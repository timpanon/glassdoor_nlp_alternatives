1,,A Case Study in Poor Leadership,2022-03-10,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"There is no shortage of work at Acadian, you will gain experience quickly in whichever role you take. This should be seen as a positive. Separately, the benefits are generous.","Acadian’s culture was very disappointing. For a world class asset manager, I would expect the culture to be inclusive, supportive, and respectful. Unfortunately, the environment was toxic, which stemmed from the top. I saw countless examples where management allowed poor behavior of their subordinates to continue. This was unfortunate, as it fostered a toxic environment for many employees. It was one thing to demand excellence, it is another to berate your employees. 

Additionally, as a company who prides itself on being diverse, inclusive leadership is nonexistent. There is no healthy debate of opinions – in fact, if you do not share the same sentiment as leadership, you are essentially blacklisted in your career. This is not the type of environment that will retain employees."
2,,Overall very good,2022-03-10,4.0,Anonymous Employee,Great benefits and a lot of good people,Nothing much to speak of

4,,Good work life balance. Opportunities to contribute to tech stack and learn about factor investing.,2022-02-17,5.0,Investment Data Analyst,Environment is relaxed. Will have time to complete extra side projects and develop skills beyond BAU,Satellite office so coordination with HQ in Boston will be somewhat of a challenge.

6,,Good stepping stone,2021-12-09,3.0,Anonymous Employee,Acadian offers a good training ground.,There has been a lot of turnover.
7,,Chill Quant Shop,2021-08-08,5.0,Analyst,"Good pay
Good people
Good work life balance",A small firm very focused business. If you seek for a more diverse workplace. This is not a very good place.

9,,Company Review,2021-05-20,3.0,Support Staff,"Flexible schedule, good medical/dental benefits","Employees are undervalued and overworked, Executive Management needs to step up"
10,,Took A Downward Turn,2021-04-08,3.0,Anonymous Employee,"Benefits are amazing here
Pay is competitive with a bonus each year
Transparency for the most part","No opportunity for growth of your career or opportunities to climb the corporate ladder unless you have an in.
Before I left it was easy to see the transition of power was resulting in loss of employee moral and how leadership cared about their employees"
11,,Good company,2021-03-18,5.0,Performance Analyst,"Great culture, friendly people, good products","Like most asset management companies, revenue is correlated to market performance"
12,,Acadian is performative.,2021-03-08,2.0,Anonymous Employee,Hard to find any pros.,"Acadian has an EVP who now writes columns on their website about how she champions women and supports women in the workplace, however she was responsible for a re-org at the firm that laid off 5 senior women, and several other junior women at the end of 2019. 

Her recent post states: ""In last year’s post, I noted the importance of building the pipeline to lay the groundwork for greater female representation at the senior levels, by supporting women at a much earlier stage in their careers than the industry historically has.""

At the layoff, Acadian had less than 20 senior women. The EVP does not care about women empowerment and neither does the company."
13,,Great company and culture,2021-02-12,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Great company. Offers flexibility, good comp and genuinely cares about employees.",I like my job and don’t see any major negatives with the company
14,,tough times means finding ways to lead and making the most of opportunity,2021-01-18,4.0,Principal Software Engineer,Working from home has made working at Acadian far more enjoyable - please keep this in your back pocket.,Not looking forward to going in to office - dealing with the commute and the rush when there
15,,Good experience,2020-12-21,5.0,Analyst,Great smart people. Great opportunity.,Not really any cons to share
16,,the company offers a good training ground,2020-12-09,4.0,Analyst,the company offers a good training ground,leadership is not a strength
17,,bad experience ( learn from others :) ),2020-06-08,2.0,Quantitative Research Analyst,"1. get to work with some smart people
2. might be okay for people at entry level but not worth it imho","1. groupism (russian)
2. dinosaurs not working nor retiring but impeding any new ideas.
3. not collaborative environment, very toxic culture."
18,,"Strong quant firm, poor leadership",2020-05-29,2.0,Assistant Vice President,"Good comp and benefits, an industry-leader in client service, and a sophisticated investment process","There are a lot of good things to say about Acadian, but I would think twice about joining right now. The investment team has stumbled from one succession issue to the next, resulting in senior leaders who talk a good game but have a track record of questionable judgment about culture, people, and business issues. At the moment it feels like what matters is who hired you and having the right sort of background rather than what you can do for the firm."
19,,Culture In Crisis,2020-03-01,2.0,Anonymous Employee,"Generous benefits, monthly bonuses for new clients, WFH opportunities (depending on role and manager), kitchens stocked nicely.",Culture has eroded since new leadership took over - the focus is no longer on employees but the bottom line (read: layoffs). Technology is not centralized and is woefully lagging peers. Work/life balance is non-existent.  Siloed departments make movement within the company difficult.
20,,Good Benefits,2020-01-17,3.0,Marketing Support,"Great benefits, flexible work arrangements are an option","I’ve been at Acadian more than a dozen years.  It was a very small firm when I started with an outstanding company culture. Employees were valued. The firm has more than tripled, new leadership is in place, and the culture has taken a nose dive. They no longer care about their employees, only the bottom line."
21,,Fools Gold!  Stay away!!!!!,2020-01-03,1.0,Engineer,"Benefits and pay are excellent, industry best.  Very light workload.  Pretty easy, if you like that.  Lots of training opportunities to learn new things - best I have seen yet!","+ your skillset will deteriorate - good luck making your next move
+ no leadership - zilch nada 
+ .net and that's all they know, besides some python and perl thats from the early 2000s 
+ split technology groups creating unnecessary duplicate work and duplicate infrastructure - wasteful
+ reduced benefits this year
+ cloud focused but you won't have any chance to work on that stuff - its all done - although its cobbled together
+ unnecessary 6-7 layers of hierarchy in technology management, yet very small company.  everyone is a VP type environment.  
+ all apps are internal use only - so sense of urgency, resiliency and scale is different than that of SaaS based companies"
22,,Great place to work,2019-10-24,5.0,Software Engineer,"Good culture

24,,World-class quant manager with stellar culture,2019-08-12,5.0,Performance Analyst,"Culture is phenomenal! Everyone is engaged, smart, motivated, and willing to help. Acadian does well in encouraging staff to continue learning and developing either through certifications and/or higher education. Decision-making is pragmatic, promotions meritocratic (relatively little in the way of petty politics).",Junior positions on the Investment Team are relatively few so it can be challenging to grow
25,,A great firm with bright people,2019-08-01,4.0,Portfolio Manager,Good compensation relative to similar firms. Deep data resources for research.,Power struggles up top often trickle down to all employees.
26,,"Here's thirty pieces of silver, to pay the Devil",2019-07-20,5.0,Technical Help,Get paid. Lots of people who think they know what's going on but don't. No accountability. Can be subpar and make it big time. Love to play with new technology have no idea how it works get scared and run back to old principles everyone is the smartest person in the room !,"Will find someone to pin it on so be careful
Only people who stay can't find work other places so lots of old relics."
27,,Great place to work,2019-05-29,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Good work/life balance, generous PTO, great health insurance",Not many cons except for the business hours 8:30-5:30 which is hard for employees with families

Great perks like a $100 new customer bonus   for everyone. Everyone is an expert in their role, very smart pool of coworkers.","Work life balance is out of whack. If you show management that you can work faster, or put in extra hours to finish a project. They start to expect that for everything, even the little things."
33,,Corporate Group,2017-10-13,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"They treat employees really well, great benefits,  great people to work with.",It would be great if Acadian was a privately held company.

37,,Best place that I have ever worked!,2017-02-21,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"- Management really cares about developing employees, both personally and professionally
- Open and welcoming learning environment where people are encouraged to learn for the sake of it, not pressured to stay in lane
- Kind and compassionate coworkers, most with a solid sense of humor
- Colleagues have a genuine interest in quantitative investments and coding
- Lots of company, department, and team social events with great food and drink. Did I mention the time they took everyone and their families one of the swankiest ski resorts in northern Vermont? They don't mess around. They want you to be colleagues and friends across the company, and they make it fun and tasty!","-As with any finance company, there are those who engage in ego wrestling matches and make their advances at others' expense
-Some people forget that it is small shop, team effort that makes Acadian special and try to steer the company in the direction of becoming just another Boston Brahmin investment company"

High quality firm with good long-term investment results and positive market reputation.  Firm culture is achievement oriented but collegial and supportive.,"Hard to move from some functions to others (say operations to investment research).  Firm is still dependent on equity strategies so firm growth, and employee growth opportunities, can be cyclical."
40,,Good People - No Growth,2016-05-31,3.0,Anonymous Employee,Smart people to work with,Not a lot of growth
41,,Analyst,2016-04-20,4.0,Analyst,"Team environment, Acadian takes care of its employees with little perks, they pay for graduate school I believe if you stay there for a certain amount of time",Quantitative firm gives it a much different feel than a traditional asset manager. Different learning curve and lots of coding. If you like finance and coding its a perfect place to be but
42,,It was a good learning experience.,2016-03-29,4.0,Systems Engineer Intern,"Good place to work, Friendly people.",None that i can remember
43,,Nice place,2016-02-15,5.0,Analyst,"Culture of meritocracy, transparency, innovation.  Even as a very junior employee, I felt valued.  They take their responsibilities to clients very seriously.","Sometimes too many decisions are made by committee, and every meeting has 20 people which makes it tough to get stuff done."

48,,"Smart People, cool work",2014-10-07,4.0,,The atmosphere is very relaxed and people are very smart.  Projects are hard but rewarding.,Slow moving.  Most research does not see the light of day.
49,,"""Pass the buck"" culture",2014-03-31,2.0,Anonymous Employee,Money flies around this place. From the free lunches to the Acadian logo-ed swag.,The management system and performance review system encourages a 'me-first' attitude where people are unwilling to help or share experience. Money is king and almost all incentive is personal and monetary which leads to employees working extra hard to avoid blame while not so hard on teamwork or leading (in terms of management).
