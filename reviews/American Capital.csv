33,,"Interesting business model, great benefits, decent work-life balance",2015-08-18,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Have been with the company for 13 years.  I'm always learning something new here, and while some things get old, there are always enough challenges to keep me intellectually engaged.  It's a roll-up-your-sleeves environment where even mid-high level managers are comfortable taking on the ""doing"" tasks when necessary.  The benefits are great, the flexibility is a huge positive.  While there are some departmental culture differences, the firm loosely embraces a work anywhere as long as you're productive policy which is fantastic.  Pay is pretty good, and I love the people I work with.  I was pleasantly surprised when hired and continue to be impressed with the laid back but tenacious and dedicated staff.  Coming from another company that was a much stiffer financial services environment, the ACAS culture has been a breath of fresh air.","Senior management does not focus on operations as much as investments  While this is good in some ways, it can be bad from the context of optimizing the efficiency of how information is gathered and disseminated throughout the organization.  Strategy is set, but many process initiatives lack the follow-through required by senior management to enforce or encourage adoption.   This can create many operational challenges in inter-departmental processes."
34,,IT,2015-08-12,4.0,,"Great work environment, very flexible. The work-life balance is the best you'll find in the area, and the technology is very cutting-edge.","It's a finance company, not a tech company"

36,,Great blue-chip company,2015-06-04,5.0,Anonymous Employee,I love working at American Capital.  It's publicly-traded.  I get to work in private equity in the DC area.  There are so many smart people.  Great coworkers.  There is a high level of sophistication.,None that I can think of.
37,,Administrative Assistant,2015-04-13,1.0,Administrative Assistant,Great Health benefits including family members.,Very much run with the Mean girl mentality.
38,,Wow too many rifs!  Too many long term employees let go w/o warning. Seems like the family that was ACAS is 2 faced!,2015-03-19,1.0,Senior Analyst,Great salary and perks. Unrealistic expectations that can make you expand your skills.,Bad management. Crazy politics based on appearance.  Horrendous HR they were a mess!
39,,Excellent company.,2014-12-15,5.0,Office Manager,"Excellent private equity experience, with excellent employee benefits.",Reorganization of the firm - the closing of the Dallas office.
40,,Great company! Good team player environment and work-life balance.,2014-11-20,5.0,,"Great compensation, excellent benefits, work-life balance, flexibility, work effort is valued, team player environment, in-house career mobility, location is PERFECT and easy to access, paid parking....and this names only what came to mind right away.",I have very little to say in the way of cons. The cons are no different than any other company. Any place where you have three or more people you expect some sort of disharmony at times. I cannot say I have experienced that here.
41,,They talk a good game but don't believe the hype!,2014-11-19,2.0,Administrative Assistant,Great benefits and the office is located in the Downtown area.,"Let me start off by saying this...I should've trusted the company reviews and ratings before I accepted the offer letter. The Annapolis Office is small (6 ppl), SUPER clichy so if you're not going to happy hour or out to lunch with them daily, trust me...they will find any and everything to nitpick about to make you feel like you're not doing your job and let you go. The men in the office are the type of people who will throw rocks and then hide their hands. I was at this company for a month and a half and I refused to go to their ""happy hours"" for religous reasons. They wound up firing me. Their excuse was, ""You forgot to order bananas for the office"" - Petty! My work was always completed before or on time, I was respectful and attentive. My advice, don't even think about working here. If you don't fit in with them, they WILL get rid of you."
42,,Run from American Capital,2014-10-30,1.0,Senior Financial Analyst,"Loose atmosphere and a great place to learn, to the extent you teach yourself.","Incompetent management

43,,"Good pay and benefits, limited opportunities for advancement",2014-10-29,3.0,Anonymous Employee,"Good experience in the private equity/asset manager space. Amazing benefits and excellent pay, exciting opportunities as the business expands and changes.","A real lack of communication from senior management. The firm has a cut-throat culture at times and a lack of opportunities for advancement in many departments.  Given how the workforce grew quickly and then contracted after the downturn, many departments are left with silo-ed teams and poor communication within and across departments, leading to a lack teamwork and waste of talent."
44,,Dynamic workplace with high expectations,2014-09-19,5.0,Senior Analyst,"* Provides a flexible work environment. The emphasis is on delivering, not on what time you are sitting at your desk.

There are a variety of positions, from investment and valuation professionals to internal accounting and IT, that will provide challenging work
The people you work with on a day-to-day basis are very nice - few, if any jerks

The technology infrastructure is second to none
The Company has rebounded strongly since the Great Recession which is a testament to the tenacity of Senior Management",Communication across from the top could be greatly improved
47,,"""Great Company with Rooms to Improve""",2014-07-31,4.0,Anonymous Employee,"If you are interested in PE or alternative assets, this is the company to work for in the Washington D.C. area.  Great co-workers, good pay, 100% covered medical/dental benefits, decent vacation time, free iPhone, and gain experience from smart people.  Good hours - expect to work 50 to 60 + hours/week.","No formal training.  No company-wide interactions.  No flex hours. No equity options for most employees.  Company offers many unnecessary benefits instead pay more bonuses, increase 401 k match, offer employees to buy stocks at a discount or give options."
48,,Wonderful Company,2014-07-18,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"American Capital is a wonderful company.  The C-level managers are fair and approachable; they are strategic and have the best interest of the company, employees and shareholders in mind when making decisions.

49,,Great Company,2014-07-17,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"American Capital is a great company to work for.  Compensation packages are above average, and the general work environment is very pleasant.  I am fortunate to work for a great manager who is very invested in employee satisfaction and development.   In my observation, the different teams and departments within the company work together quite harmoniously.  Plus, opportunities certainly exist to cross train and advance.",I have no cons to present.
50,,Great place to gain experience and learn,2014-07-15,4.0,Senior Financial Analyst,"ACAS is involved in a wide variety of investment strategies, that leads to a lot of experience.

52,,P/E firm and asset manager,2014-03-21,4.0,Anonymous Employee,pay and sincerity of CEO,lack of formal reviews and aggressive co-workers
53,,Too bad everyone is not like Malon,2013-12-23,3.0,Anonymous Employee,"Malon Wilkus, nice colleagues, young company with a future",HR is rediculous.  I'm surprised there have not been more suits relating to HR.  Upper management does not care how departments are run.

Limited room for growth"
55,,Some smart people mixed in with a bunch of legacy employees,2013-10-30,3.0,Financial Analyst,Excellent private equity experience as there is great transparency in the firm.  Lots of knowledge to be learned from the IC if you pay attention and are self-motivated.,Poor communication between teams.  Ambiguous roles and responsibilities within certain departments largely because of layoffs over the years.  The company seems somewhat lost after the financial crisis.

Global reach in all part of the world and many industries.,"Leadership at all levels is very poor. During the downturn, lots of internal power grabbing.

58,,You can learn a lot working there,2011-04-28,4.0,,"During it's growth phase, you learned a lot and were given a lot of responsibility",The hours could be long.  Morale was not great after the layoffs started in 2008. I'm not sure if morale is back to it's 2006 levels yet.
59,,Don't Sell Your Soul,2010-10-07,1.0,,The compensation is incredibly generous. The benefits are amazing.,Beware that you are selling your soul for the compensation and benefits. Much of the dirt is swept under the rug. IT is a mess and largely unqualified. Any good auditor would have a field day if the right questions were asked.
