104,Apollo Global Management,My experience since the beginning,2020-11-03,4.0,Associate,"Overview: It has been almost 2 months for me at Apollo. For starters, it is a very professional corporate workplace. I recommend working at Apollo. Onboarding and infrastructure for WFH: The onboarding was very smooth (especially given the pandemic) and the team members gave me a very warm welcome. In terms of resources, amazing quality of hardware setup is provided to work from home and the entire infrastructure is quite user friendly and state of the art. Nature of work: I am part of the valuations team at Apollo and my roles include liaising with investment team, managing internal processes and giving a final sign-off on the value of numerous investments made by Apollo. With respect to the work, it has been quite challenging in the first 2 months. But there is thrill only in such situations. Additionally, because of cross-border nature of the work/ teams, I tried picking up a lot of new things for which I did not have exposure in the past. The overall environment is friendly and competitive at the same time. Compensation: The compensation is quite dynamic and in my experience is decided based on what you bring on the table. The senior management values Talent. I am more than satisfied with the start that I have got here. Conclusion: Holistically, I would suggest people to explore opportunities at Apollo. And given the fact that Apollo is relatively new in India, one can get a chance to grow with the firm.",As mentioned in the overview

There were MANY communication challenges in trying to explain to our US colleagues how things need to be done in Europe, because the regulatory and legal rules in Europe are different. Often, response we received was that if we want something done right, we should fix it ourselves.

There is lack of appreciation for non-investment staff. There is a feeling of clear segregation between investment vs non-investment staff. The firm treats the investment professionals very well, while they disregard the ""back office"" functions.
