27,Balyasny Asset Management,Accountant heading a technology group?,2021-01-29,2.0,Software Engineer,Great benefits. Management that cares about their people.,"The technology management including the CIO measure low on professional integrity. The CIO and his first level managers take no responsibility for design and architectural issues that their decisions caused. The default reaction for a project failure or problem is to blame and fire all the developers who ever worked on that project. Performers are not rewarded whereas politically savvy but technical dunces are promoted to head the groups. CIO lacks any exposure to trading technologies and lacks basic understanding of the products that BAM trades. CIO makes personnel decisions considering who goes drinking with him. One instance of his low integrity; the CIO arranged a weekly ""open door"" for his employees on Zoom. If an employee shows up to ask a question, the CIO later yelled at the employee's manager that the employee is not busy enough."

- Great support to WFH during COVID. 
- Very competitive pay and excellent benefits.
- Great diversity and inclusion.","I wouldn't call them cons. Perhaps ""things to be aware of"".
- You are expected to perform. I think that's a good thing, as it helps you grow and learn new things. If you want a job where you can coast, however, this is not the place (which I like and one of the reasons I came here).
- You are protecting BAM and its clients, so don't make a huge mistake that could bring down the network during trading hours. This is not a con, it's the nature of the job. Just like when you are a surgeon, making a mistake on your patient has dire repercussions."
33,Balyasny Asset Management,"Great business leadership, technology organization in decline",2020-11-12,3.0,Software Engineer,The business leadership has learnt well from the mistakes of 2018-2019. The fund rose from the turmoil with tremendous returns of over 30%. The firm has seasoned business leadership and a talented and loyal investment team.,"The technology team is in decline. The CIO of 2015-2019 built excellent infrastructure and a team of talented developers. The technology leadership that succeeded him are GE style managers. They created 6 layers between the decision maker and the developer. The software engineering team no-longer interacts with the business, but have to go through multiple layers of management team. The technology managers are expected to be status aggregators only and not contribute to neither development nor architecture. The most technical person is a team-lead who is at a level above the engineer. All layers above the team-lead are non-technical status aggregators."
34,Balyasny Asset Management,Incredibly toxic environment,2020-10-29,1.0,Analyst,"Pays a fair market rate

As a software engineer you have access to cutting-edge techs and tools while dealing with large amount of data
Surprisingly good on-site fitness programs and gym","People are being laid off at will - not even related to performance

47,Balyasny Asset Management,Great place to work!,2019-09-10,5.0,Analyst,"Collaborative culture, Clear communication, Generous benefits",Volatility related to market swings
48,Balyasny Asset Management,"Difficult business model, poorly managed organization, lesser-than-advertised culture",2019-05-26,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"Generally great perks: beautiful offices, good and healthy catered lunch, in-office gym.","As you can read in the news, Balyasny's investment results and business have been having some meaningful issues over the past couple of years.  For what it's worth, there are a few important factors that I think are worth really considering if you are thinking about working here.   Balyasny has a tricky business model, where it manages an amount of assets that is very small compared to the size of its organization.  They make that work by charging extremely high fees to their investors, which makes the business less stable because investors will promptly pull their money if the fund has a couple bad quarters of performance.  This makes Balyasny constantly under siege, which you can imagine doesn't have a great impact on either culture or the organization's ability to plan for the long-term.   I actually a lot of smart and high-quality people working there, but they definitely did not tend to be in upper or middle management.   Balyasny markets itself as having a nicer culture than other hedge funds, but it doesn't take much time to realize that that is superficial.  In my opinion, the extremely high personnel turnover (both on the investment and operating teams)  is basically the ""proof in the pudding"" that this is not a great place for most people to develop their career.   If one of my friends were considering working here, I wouldn't recommend it unless they truly needed the money."
49,Balyasny Asset Management,No sense of urgency,2019-04-22,3.0,Director,"The plus side is it, for a job in the financial world, it is relatively stress free.","When returns aren’t there, the business model begins to break down."
50,Balyasny Asset Management,Lack of direction,2019-03-29,2.0,Analyst,"Beautiful office space, smart and driven co-workers, free lunches delivered daily, fully covered health care, unlimited vacation (although you can never truly take it).",Lack of career progression: as an analyst you are completely at the whim  of your PM regardless how well you do individually. Virtually no women in PM positions.
51,Balyasny Asset Management,Very ambitious hedge fund,2019-03-16,4.0,Software Engineer,Technology at a very high level,Too many directors per one engineer
52,Balyasny Asset Management,Investment Analyst,2019-02-26,5.0,Anonymous Employee,Leader in industry. Attracts best and brightest talent.,Rapid growth. Experience varies based on PM. They are working on streamlining things and adding consistency and process.
53,Balyasny Asset Management,Senior Quantitative Analyst,2018-12-19,3.0,Anonymous Employee,Better culture than other similar Hedge Funds.  When your job is eliminated they try to find you another position in the firm.   Overall a friendly atmosphere.,Recent loss of capital has caused major cutbacks. The future is unclear for the firm.   Some of the new senior management have corrupted the unique culture.
54,Balyasny Asset Management,Rotten apples in tech leadership makes for a poor career experience,2018-12-12,2.0,Anonymous Employee,"Some wicked smart people, unfortunately balanced out by some conniving, political people. The Chicago office is new and pretty. They are focused on physical fitness and being healthy.","Well-meaning company plagued by a few rotten apples in leadership. The technology team especially is not enriching to work for - there's excessive political drama, and poor planning resulting in unnecessary franticness and wasted effort.  Being busy is valued as a cultural value over being impactful, providing perceived value is valued over providing actual value. If you are interested in pursuing an enriching career in technology, I invite you to explore other options.

Benefits are on the decline."
55,Balyasny Asset Management,It's a cult,2018-12-04,2.0,Anonymous Employee,"High pay, high bonus, high fees.",80 PMs for one fund. Viciously competitive atmosphere. Horrible work life balance. Middle management will cut your throat to get a chance to flirt with Dmitry.

67,Balyasny Asset Management,Office Administrator,2016-12-01,1.0,Office Administrator/Facilities Coordinator,"Free food, some fun and interesting personalities around the office.","Saw 3 people get fired without warnings and reasons, but the ""favorite"" employees get warnings only.  The Office Administrators are so scared of getting fired that if the CEO doesn't get soy sauce with his sushi, they start panicking about getting fired - OH BROTHER, the stupidity.  Managers can't confront people in person and send passive aggressive e-mails.  Facilities and Office Administrator department hire based on personality and favoritism, not on hard work.  Lots of gossip and cliquish behind each other's backs.  They want someone on their team that is obsessed with the company basically and you will work on weekends by sending e-mails through your work phone - quite pathetic.  Was verbally harassed three times by the same Facilities Coordinator at work and outside of work during a company dinner and management did not make him apologize at all.   Office Administrators abuse the corporate card and pay for Ubers from Long Island on the weekends and other no-work related things.  If management was more on top of them, they would get fired honestly.  Management is lazy and won't bother to give anyone a slap on the wrist, just fire them without a reason.  Least professional place I've ever worked, honestly.  Found a better job and a better pay a week later in a nicer looking office."
