It’s an exciting time to see the rebuilding of a company.  Some of the corporate functions have revisited their service models and are making strides to get the company updated with basic infrastructure that was lacking before to help support business strategy.",Many of the legacy employees have old fashion thinking and struggle with the new corporate strategy and new internal service models to get the company to the next level.   Hope they will get on board or decide to move along on their own.  Previous culture was unhealthy and  old  fashion.
28,Boston Private,DO NOT GET A JOB HERE!!,2020-02-14,1.0,Back Office,Unfortunately there are no pros,"I have worked in many different types of banking/investing institutions and this is by far one of the worst places I have worked. There is bullying, favoritism, and when you complain to HR that it’s a toxic work environment they allow the bullies to then be promoted. 

HR and IT here are absolutely awful!! When you reach out for help they delay in getting back to you for days. I have fixed issues in my own department because IT took weeks to get back to us. HR is scared of their own shadow and when you go to them for guidance or to bring up workplace issues they ignore everything and don’t seem happy to help.

Half the “managers” I have seen are never in the office and “work from home” half the week. One manager in particular was never in the office, barely did anything when in the office and this place laid off a handful of great managers and this guy is still here. What a joke!! The gossip and favoritism is really bad in some departments and if you aren’t part of it you are the target. 

The pay is horrible and most departments are not even getting promotions or bonuses this year. 401k match is .50 to the $1.00 so your really not getting the full percentage they advertise. 

Bank is under a new CEO and most of the changes are being in the wealth offices. They are bringing in high paying department heads but can barely pay the rest of the workers, or give raises to the hard working people that have been here for years.
 
Jobs are also being outsourced to save money and I wouldn’t be surprised if this place gets sold in the future. Don’t waste your time at this place. Go to First Republic or another Boston bank that will pay you way more and actually care about you."

35,Boston Private,Execution is Key,2019-04-16,3.0,Anonymous Employee,"Most people are very nice

Good office locations

Opportunities to learn a lot (a lot!)

A lot of potential to be an exceptional place","If you’re good at your job, you’ll have to do other people’s jobs too. 


It’s so overwhelming. I am hourly and need to check my email after work and on weekends just to keep up. People email me and text me looking for responses, and emails can become a full time job if you’re not on top of them.


Most new responsibilities I have taken on were because of a change in our group or some other temporary factor. I’m happy to help pick up the slack, but I need some relief! The period of “we just need to get through this restructuring period” or “we’re trying to fill these reqs” or “letting the dust settle with the new leader”, “figuring things out,” “the layoffs”, etc. has been my entire time at Boston Private. There is a difference between rolling with the punches and being expected to tolerate chaos.


It’s like playing hot potato with responsibilities, between other groups and most disappointingly, your own group. Sometimes we’re passing the potato around, sometimes people are throwing up their hands saying not my potato.  We can’t seem to even discuss transitioning the handoff of the potato in a fair and orderly fashion, even if it was the person/group’s potato to begin with. If you feel a need not to let things drop, soon enough you’re juggling a hell of a lot of potatoes. 


The worst part is realizing that a lot of the potatoes you have aren’t part of your actual job and you’re so busy (or people think you’re too busy with “your work” aka inherited junk) that you can’t accept the projects that are actually stimulating and will help you move forward in your career.


Benefits are average compared to other high end banks and wealth management companies


Bunching vacation and sick time is unhealthy and makes for cranky coworkers, just the minimum 5 days of paid sick time being a separate pot would be a great gesture to employees and would increase productivity overall. Feeling that you can stay at home when you’re sick and not be judged for it is good for morale, and happier people will work harder and stay longer. Yes some may abuse sick time but there is already a lot of timesheet abuse, and those that do abuse time probably have other issues they should be corrected...


An oddly top heavy structure, and a lot of the many managers don’t know how to manage (people or work). Managers need to be instructed on what is expected of them as a manager, and then given the tools, time and coaching to do their jobs right! Managers spend a lot of time navigating the inner workings of a group while requesting simple things, like getting access to something for their employee, or asking HR a question or for help on routine things. Managers need to be taught how to be managers and how to be managers in our company, they can’t just be thrown into the deep end!


The technology experience is terribly outdated, it takes a long time to navigate between web pages and to open or save documents. You can’t do too much at a time without your computer freezing. Email, an Excel document, a Word document and several IE tabs at one time? Forget about it"

The recent layoff is completely misinterpreted - this cut a lot of dead weight and underperforming staff that was long overdue.  Technology roadmap is sound (though needs to deliver), and remaining people are top notch.  Lot of opportunity for junior staff to rise to the occasion.","While vision is sound, it’s not well articulated.   The plan to get there is just as foggy.  Individual teams are better aligned, but still aren’t marching in lock step.  So close... just get it on paper for crying out loud."

46,Boston Private,What a disaster,2018-08-01,1.0,Manager,The company is well thought of in the marketplace.,"Inside is an absolute disaster. The entire company's IT infrastructure is powered by the IT equivalent of a hamster running on a wheel. Then, to boot, the company tried to overcompensate for this by spending $50-100MM to build a custom IT infrastructure. Which would be great except for 1) That is an insane amount of money for a company that size to spend and 2) THEY'RE BUILDING IT INFRASTRUCTURE THAT ALREADY EXISTS FROM THIRD PARTY PROVIDERS FOR PENNIES. They're trying to do things like custom-build an online banking platform, custom-build a data warehouse, custom-build a wire system. It's insanity. 

The politics here are also absolutely out of control. I could never have imagined the politics of a 100,000 person company (paired with the lack of resources of a small company). No one cares about work quality or results. It operates more like a country club where you are promoted for good social standing. Some people have worked their way to impressive levels within the company for lots of brown-nosing and can't answer basic questions about their job or banking generally. The company constantly brags about its ""culture"" but from what I have seen you get rewarded for BS'ing around all day and people who try to tackle real issues, propose real solutions, and solve real problems get reprimanded for ""stirring the pot"" and making people think the bad thougths.  

Zero expense control. Zero. A management team who have zero experience in banking (entire management team is made of up consultants, investment managers, and marketers). 

This is the type of place that has more SVPs than entry/mid-level associates. It's like an upside-down pyramid. The amount of people getting paid over $200k at that company to do little or nothing is staggering. If you are VP-level or above your job is to run around and go to pointless meetings all day. 

It is beyond bewildering to me that an activist investor hasn't gotten involved and asked the company to sell itself yet. It's such a shame because the company has a lot of very talented salespeople and an impressive client list and just completely fails to stop shooting itself in the face. I have seen people lose half a million dollars from blatant stupidity or just failure to read a contract and seen the finance department shrug. Not a business decision, not a judgement call, just failure to understand a document they were signing. The person in mind even got promoted at the end of the year because he/she  was ""in"" socially within the bank. 

And the best part is: anyone who is in control at this company does not give a flying fart. There is a cabal of people who have been there for 15, 20, 25 years who ""run the country club"". If you try to complain, it dies with them. If someone has been at the bank for that long, it's not because it's such a wonderful place to work, it's because they're people who are fearful of change and have found a place where they can get paid above market to do no work and have built a fiefdom for themselves and won't leave now.

The company's culture is so messed up I honestly don't even think it can be saved."
47,Boston Private,Smoke and Mirrors,2018-07-09,1.0,Vice President,"Solid CEO. Some of senior management focused on getting ahead, protecting fiefdoms (expected) 

Congenial atmosphere, a great many employees genuinely care about their coworkers.","Continual trickle of assets leaving wealth group, Bank and Wealth do not integrate, despite what is said. 

Backstabbing in several of the groups (Marketing) is commonplace. Lack of trust. Lying. 

Insecure as a corporate entity; i.e. The company does not walk the talk, and runs scared in the face of adversity. 

Pay is average, bonuses are below average. 

There is still multiple headcount to hack, essentially deadwood from the old regime. 

IT is antiquated, although this is being addressed. CTO just departed.  Salesforce implementation is a disaster."
