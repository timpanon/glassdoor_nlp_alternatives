If you are someone who thrives in team settings, have always been well liked by your peers and leadership regardless of the work environment - then you will find it easy here too.

Individual credit for good investment performance is democratized, but if you are senior and well liked, it will likely help you get promoted. If you’re average, you will still have a decent career.","Being scared of a negative public opinion is in the corporate DNA. This means every imaginable decision is justified and documented. If you’re a junior resource this grunt work is your job. If you’re not helping you will be quickly written off and a slow and painful decline will make you leave.

If you are someone who relies on their investments and ideas speak for themselves and don’t spend time being liked - you will eventually make a mistake and every little misstep you’ve had will be documented and used to derail you. 

 
Don’t join if you are someone who likes autonomy in decision making. your peers will be making investments while you spend your time creating educational materials for senior management about those investments."

If you work in middle office, get ready to spend almost a decade at the same level because career stagnation is super real.

If you work in front office, be prepared to potentially grind just as hard as you would at a bank, but at a lower pay.

This, plus absolutely nonsensical re-orgs every year, and lots of social posturing - employees asked for detailed reports regarding pay scales, gender equality, inclusivity, pay scales relative to each other/the street, and the difference between hiring externally vs internally.... two years ago. Somehow the company is ""too busy"" or ""unable"" to procure these. It's also another one of those companies, post covid, who are pretending that employees want to come back to the office full time.

They are always busy not due to the complexities created by them and not having staff to deal with them. Stay away guys if you are looking for a job in this place. Its like an ocean of stranger fishes, noone cares about others, people just want to finish their work without thinking about the impact on others. When you look at your senior, you feel like that you dont want their role. The higher you go, the more stressed you are. They pay little incremental money for all the stress that comes with the job."

The group receives the results in aggregate, but the group heads receive version which can be grouped ""where there are 5+ responses."" This makes is extraordinarily easy to figure out who wrote what, as you can break down the results by several categories such as rank, gender, location. For example, in a group where there are 5 analysts and 1 associate, you can get a result for all six, but you can also get a result for the 5 analysts.
