8,,"A wage, not a career",2021-10-06,2.0,Contact Centre Agent,"- Fairly easy work
- Teams are nice
- Regular contact with colleagues even through remote working.
- Equipment and furniture all provided","- Qualifications are in-house and useless outside of Domestic & General. I was told I ca do NVQs and BTECs as part of my in-house training. Instead, they offer you full access to the internal L&D catalog, but that is only useful for internal promotions.

- The work is boring.
You'll be screamed at down the phone, you'll have the same conversation 50 times a day and then you'll log off. Its boring.

- Operational Management and QA are focused on business needs, not employees.
You'll have your commission taken from you at the slightest mistake and for very subjective reasons, and your targets are ever tightened. The business benefits by putting its profits before both customer and employee welfare.

- You'll hurt people.
From my time dealing with complaints, I was always told to continue to sell, which was my job. But the standard line from Resolutions if there was a complaint was typically to blame the supplier rather than take any initiative and actually help someone.

- Laughable mental health support.
This kind of job lends itself really easily to burnout. The support just isn't there. The external EAP programme requires you jump through loads of hoops.

- They claim that they promote internally, but internal opportunities were also posted to LinkedIn at the same time, and there was a minimum time served requirement for internal recruitment, putting internal recruits at a disadvantage to those external to the company."
9,,Absolutely horrendous culture,2021-09-22,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"Great name on your CV, good compensation but nothing else","I joined CVC Credit (credit arm of CVC Capital) a few year now

Since joining, the phrase social life has disappeared from my life. There is no work life balance. You're lucky if you don't have a 60+ hour week nor work weekends. I don't even have time to call my family. Constantly working beyond 12am everyday and I stopped making weekend plans when I just end up working every Saturday and Sunday

People are very rude, especially the Investment Professionals from the Private Credit team. The way they talk down to people, especially core infrastructure teams whom I believe do an excellent job, is unbelievable. 

You don't hear ""Thank You"" or ""Please"" in any of the emails, just ""Do this urgently"". Company culture is very last minute when you only got given 24 hours or less to complete a task and investment teams will have the audacity to chase every couple hours, as if no one's doing their job. This is borderline harassment.

We have not been shown any respects since joining. In all honesty, I've been treated better by a Starbucks Barista at JFK. 

We deserve to be treated better whilst doing our job."

25,,Good company but needs clearer messaging,2017-03-06,4.0,Anonymous Employee,"When my colleagues in my last job found out I was moving to CVC Capital Partners they were like ""Oh my God, no! They'll eat you alive!"" I understand that CVC has a bit of a reputation in the market but I feel the rep is unjustified: sure, there is a culture of long hours and 24/7 availability but the people here are friendly, pleasant and (assuming they're not busy) approachable.

The benefits package is excellent.

The IT equipment here is really high quality and IT service desk give you a ""white glove"" service. Any problem - however minor - and there's usually someone at your desk within an hour to fix it if they can't do it remotely.

The restaurant in the London office makes amazing food freely available though I wish they'd take the cheese board away because I'm getting fat.","There isn't really much in the way of internal communications, either from the business leaders or from the support teams such as compliance or IT. As a result, it's difficult to know what's happening within the company as a whole, particular as we're spread over such a wide geography. I don't feel like I know where the business is headed and it makes it harder to understand how my work contributes to the overall mission."

29,,Mis-managed small office - NYC,2013-06-20,2.0,Anonymous Employee,"- company has a global presence.
-","- for a small office (25 ppl approx) there are many ""deadwood"" employees who should no longer be there.  
- many employees are mismatched to their role (they don't want to be the ""X title"", or are unqualified  and it shows. 
- there is a lot of inequality of distribution of responsibilities.   Good staffers are working hard, poor staffers are hardly working - creating a sense of dissatisfaction/bitterness that good staffer has the workload of 2 ppl, when poor staff is just floating along w/out penalty.   This is how you loose good employees."
