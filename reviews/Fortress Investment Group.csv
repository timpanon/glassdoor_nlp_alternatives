17,Fortress Investment Group,Interviews and Nascent Experience -- Dallas Office,2021-06-13,5.0,Analyst,"So, I'm going to share my experience with the interview process and my initial experience in the Dallas office. First, I want you to keep in mind this is an investment firm and all the connotations that come with that; second, I'd like you to note my personality -- I'm high-strung and type A; if I'm not tired, busy, or stressed, then I'm not happy; and last, I chose this field because I wanted something intellectually stimulating, something to keep me busy, and something that will compensate me for my obsessive work habits. So, when reading what I've put down as pros, remember this context. In other words, my pros may not be ones for you. 

Interview experience: quick, more informal (but not completely), and well-guided. The person I worked with in HR/Recruiting was Christen Zellinger. And honestly, she was pretty fantastic. She set up interviews, made sure I was posted throughout the entire experience, and kept any personal-life quirks in mind while interviewing (I was going to be without service for a weekend). She was very pleasant and conversational. I think we were able to connect as much as a candidate and an HR recruiter can, and her personality made this possible. 

Relocating: I ended up relocating to the Dallas office. This experience was fast-paced. However, I felt supported (as much as a company can support you) while doing this: I was given a reasonable amount of money to move; I was given resources, information, and contacts; I was also given emails from my team on which neighborhoods to explore, etc. That’s not to say moving wasn’t stressful because, quite frankly, I think stress innate to the process, but I knew I had resources if I needed them. 

The Office: We are currently in Las Colinas for the office, but a new one is being built in the middle of Uptown/Knox-Henderson (really ""cool,"" trendy areas. I'm actually really excited about the new location.) Now, Las Colinas is fine. It's a typical office/workplace community -- there's offices, a few restaurants, and then most people leave to go back to their living communities. Is it the best place? No. But is this completely manageable for ~6 months while they finish the new building? Absolutely. (The plus here is the new office/future workspace.)

The Office (cont.): Now, concerning the workplace culture, this is where I think people are a little shocked, but I'm not sure why. During my interview process, my team repeatedly asked me if I was okay with the following: a busy schedule, quickly learning a lot of information, being available for work calls/deals/etc., and occasionally having to work weekends. I've done a lot of research; I've worked at (literally) the top investment bank; I knew what to expect. And so, when I got to the office and saw people working/staying late, I wasn't shocked. This is literally what I was told to expect and have already experienced, and then I got it -- but this is the kind of career I wanted and what fits my personality. So, in my book, the company was completely transparent and then delivered, most companies are not like this. Their candor is an incredible plus to me.","Read until the end or else this will just feel like a lot of what I've already said (see pros): This is a very niche environment in terms of the entire career spectrum. Meaning, you should not come here expecting a Silicon Valley and/or startup culture. If you want a typical 9-5 with predictable hours and moderate pay, this isn’t the place. This is going to be a demanding position (most likely, I can't speak for all teams/career paths) but you'll be well compensated. 

Now, because of this specialized culture, I do think they're lacking in diversity. That is, my office is pretty white, cis, heterosexual male (seeming, at least). Now, my team, which consists of ~7 people, is pretty good for the finance industry: i.e. a person of color is the head management, other team members of color, we have females, and a member of the queer community (and yes, they're all separate people). But the (Dallas) office, overall, is very white, very male, etc. and females/people of color tend to be in administrative roles. However, I think there is a push to remedy this; and I think it's worth mentioning that there are other socio-economic barriers impacting this sample that, quite frankly, I don't think a single firm can solve for an industry. 

So, if you're looking for an environment that is already wildly diverse, you're not going to find it here. However, if you're an individual that is comfortable with being part of a push for more diversity (without being tokenized), then I think this a safe bet. Because, honestly speaking, I don’t think anyone really cares as long as you’re good at your job -- at least, that’s my impression."

You may influence everybody including CTO decisions over time.,"Business mistakes as usually can be paid with individual layoffs so your performance and energy may not matter much. Some friction and unclear strategy due to partitioning in the company. Some divisions feel like on competitive track rather than specializing in their finacial sectors. Optimizing technology is not aligned and sometimes feels like local optimizations put corporate efforts in conflicting directions slowing down progress. Hopefully CTO will sort that out, but it will take some time and technolgy stacks move way faster than Fortress. Also technology is a bit behind and refreshing every two years cycle is needed."

He was verbally abusive to all his employees and peers and often expressed racist and misogynistic views loudly.

But in the end, it's not really worth the day to day in my opinion.",Where to begin? Work life balance is horrible. You are just a body that does work. You have no life. No training for anything and if you make a mistake (depending on your manager) it is like World War 3. No real values or culture. Just work hard and shutup.
108,Fortress Investment Group,I.T. Developers Beware,2014-09-05,1.0,,Can potentially pick up a lot of new skills and technologies. Have been known to offer generous bonus incentives upwards of 20% of base.,"Extremely long work hours not suitable to family work/life balance. Poor, spur of the moment I.T.

People are really nice","While the people are really nice there is a really weird culture that isn't social at all. It seems the system has gotten so bureaucratic that a lot of people are leaving for more entrepreneurial environments.
There is no buddy system or training program. They throw you right in and if you make mistakes it is on you."

Regardless of how well they're treated by other groups, they have an inherent hatred of each other and have constant miserable attitudes, and often don't train new hires, and brush them off. When initiative is taken to take self-training courses for products that are used, you are reprimanded, then alienated."

119,Fortress Investment Group,You can do better.,2013-10-07,1.0,Associate,"Looks great on the resume.

Close to the subway.","The back office in general is a capitally mismanaged meat-grinder.  There is very little in terms of year-end reviews, raises or employee appreciation. Bonuses are reasonable but considering how much you'll work for them, they will be underwhelming.  In general the message is - just be happy you have a job.  

There are some managers who genuinely care about their underlings but that does not seem to be the overall tone at the top. 

The culture lacks in collegial environment and professionalism which is surprising for a firm of this caliber.  Don't take me wrong - you'll work with some great people - they have brilliant, amazing individuals at Fortress, but unfortunately there is no fundamental culture that discourages the bad apples from treating the rest like crap and rewards those who make a real positive impact."

129,Fortress Investment Group,Great experience,2010-08-03,4.0,,"Very involved and active work environment. A lot of deals pass by your table so you get to acquire an insight into different market cap, sector  etc . companies and different valuation and financing methods.","Not very organized and 'one firm' culture is not implemented that well.
