If you enjoy working in a bullpen where you are screamed at in public but congratulated quietly in private - this is your kind of job

A few long-time employees run the show as yes men to the CEO. Most of them have no clue what it takes to do what they promise to get done.

Senior Management run around like headless chickens making everything a priority and not knowing how to prioritize anything. Everything is a fire drill. Staff is expected to deliver on responsibilities but are constantly drawn away from tasks to put out another self-created fire.

You may be promised a promotion but beware - you WILL have to fight for it or it will be given to the next shiny applicant that says they can do the job better.

I left a great job to join Geller and was beaten down so bad I needed actual therapy when I left to regain my self confidence and find another rewarding position. HR was AWFUL and caused more emotional distress rather than helping me succeed."

If you ever reach out to them, which I absolutely encourage you do, they will respond and communicate with you quickly and thoroughly, and solve your problems, no matter how long it takes, or how much explaining it takes.","1. Accountability of supervisors/senior accountants - upper management trusts them BLINDLY. 

They never question them, never investigate/audit them, never monitor their computer activity, etc. It is truly their way or the highway, supervisors/senior accountants always get what they want, no matter what. Upper management cannot force supervisors/senior accountants to do anything they do not want to do. 



2. Meetings 

Supervisors/senior accountants are always in meetings.



Below is a section of a recent article written by Chuck Swoboda, of the esteemed, Forbes magazine, that explains what meetings all are truly about here at Geller.



Consider one of the most basic workplace best practices: meetings. Most people’s days are full of them, with research suggesting that many managers spend almost half of their work time in meetings.

IT MAKES YOU WONDER HOW MUCH MORE WE COULD ACCOMPLISH IF WE SPENT MORE TIME WORKING AND LESS TIME MEETING.

Jason Fried, the founder and CEO of Basecamp, offered this perspective: “MEETINGS ARE JUST TOXIC, TERRIBLE, POISONOUS THINGS DURING THE DAY AT WORK. WE ALL KNOW THIS TO BE TRUE…MEETINGS AREN’T WORK. MEETINGS ARE PLACES TO GO TO TALK ABOUT THINGS YOU’RE SUPPOSED TO BE DOING LATER.”



3. Blame - no matter what, it is ALWAYS your fault as a staff accountant, even things outside of your control.

Every supervisor is a narcissist, and I am convinced the company policies allow them to be, as this has been happening for decades, which explains why there is zero supervisor turnover, and infinite staff turnover.

Seniors act like they are tenured college professors with PhD degrees, have cured all types of cancer and viruses, and centuries worth of experience, they will never blame themselves, NOT ONCE.



4. No promotions from within/Dead end jobs

Staff accountant positions are designed so most of them, if not all, end up quitting after extraordinarily little time.

Also, I have not seen one staff accountant get promoted to senior in 2019 nor 2020.

Out of all the seniors who were recently hired, which is many, they all came from other companies. 



5. Bullying by Supervisors and ACTUAL CLUELESS PEOPLE

Supervisors bully you every day, so you end up quitting.

This is a well thought out scheme as they will blame every problem on you once you officially leave the company.

Again, the top leaders of Geller are dumb enough to believe these “supervisors”.

These “supervisors” are EVIL people.

No matter how nice they are to you in the beginning, or when upper management/the very top leaders are around your desks, they could rather care less about anyone other than themselves.



Here is where it gets better.



This company has super important positions filled by people without an accounting or finance degree. Most of them are NOT Certified Public Accountants (CPA), so you can see why there is nonstop chaos here, SINCE THOSE AT THE TOP CANNOT EVEN UNDERSTAND THEIR OWN JOB.

Nonetheless, they continue to get paid six figures, if not well past $100,000 a year, and continue to receive the world’s best health care, every single year, no matter what – this is why there is zero supervisor/upper management turnover.

Again, they are not in control of that, so I cannot even blame them for taking advantage for as long as they can, ALWAYS BLAME THE VERY TOP!

If I may, I would like to reference Simon Sinek, known for his book, Leaders Eat Last, when he stated, “When someone used to being in control is in a situation THEY DON’T FULLY UNDERSTAND, they can often be blind to their own ignorance. OR WORSE, THEY MAY CHOOSE TO HIDE WHAT THEY DON’T KNOW FOR FEAR OF HAVING OTHERS QUESTION THEIR AUTHORITY.”

My take from Mr. Sinek: FEAR = Feak Evidence Appearing Real



6. Review system

Your reviews, which determine your annual raise, are solely based upon what other people on your team think of you. If you cannot realize this is corrupt, I do not know what to say.

Simon Sinek said it best when he declared, “When we opt to stay above the clouds, RELYING ONLY ON INFORMATION FED TO US instead of going down to see for ourselves, not only is it harder to make the right moral decisions, it makes it even harder to take responsibility when we fail to do so.”



7. Temps

They take full advantage of all temps and have no intention to hire them as full-time employees, they also blame them for everything. Temps are like college interns; they can only do what they are told. It is literally impossible for a temp to go “above and beyond”.

Remember, when temps and interns get blamed for things, this is the equivalence of blaming a 5-year-old child for any of your problems, it could not be more immature and ignorant."
36,Geller & Company,Don’t do it!,2020-09-18,1.0,Anonymous Employee,Good benefits and opportunity to work a lot of overtime,"The expectations at all levels, even entry level are ridiculous. You can work above and beyond what you are getting paid to do and it's never enough. If you are a good performer, you are rewarded with more work, fixing other people's mistakes or making up for their laziness. You can anticipate getting yelled and cursed at regularly by the line of business executive due to lack of understanding of the processes and the need to constantly jump to conclusions rather than actually listen to the members of the team thoroughly. You can also anticipate having ""confidential"" concerns that were voiced during team meetings blasted out during company-wide meetings as poor performance markers. Working overtime is not only expected, but necessary to keep your head above water, but instead of being appreciated, your additional effort will be deemed as a sign of inefficiency. 
 
 If you are lucky enough to work for someone who cares (there are a small handful of them), it won't last long because the good people get beat down and treated like garbage while the company rewards bad behavior. I had great relationships with a few managers who genuinely looked out for me and cared about my concerns, but they, too, were grossly overworked and I didn’t want to place additional burden on them.
 
 If you care about your emotional well-being at all, do not work here. If you enjoy being treated like a doormat, seek an application. If anything, you can get some good therapy with the medical benefits."
37,Geller & Company,"Overall a good place, but depends on which team you go to",2020-09-09,4.0,Senior Analyst,Management is understanding and supportive during the pandemic. Competitive Pay. PTO is decent.,"Teams are not cooperative sometimes, and just kick balls to each other or not responsive. Quarter end can get pretty busy."
38,Geller & Company,The Worst Employment Experience I've ever had,2020-09-08,1.0,Anonymous Employee,Competitive Compensation and Insurance was covered by the company,"I left a job I liked for the prospect of more money and better room for growth. Had I known what I was getting myself into I never would have left regardless of how much the pay was. 

There's very little training on anything relevant to the actual job they have you doing in most cases. To make matters worse management will often times have you doing tasks with little to no guidance and if the project winds up being a success they'll claim all the credit and if it fails they'll pass the buck on the blame. The turnover is so high that knowledge is commonly lost in the shuffle and the managers that are involved are too far removed to really know what's going on in the day to day process.

The clients are demanding but the culture of just work more hours to get everything done is what makes it unbearable. If you ever stay a minute late or volunteer to do something outside your normal scope of responsibilities you'll quickly become expected to do it until the end of time. Any response from management to adjust or rebalance the workload is lackadaisical at best because they care significantly more just keeping the client happy for another day than they do about creating a work environment that fosters happy work life balances that employees would enjoy doing. This leads to a vicious cycle of people quitting because the work load is to high which is than dumped onto whoever is remaining until they can't take it anymore and its tossed on to the next person who was just hired to replace the first person who left. 

This job will quickly take over your life and begin to infect every aspect of what you do in and out of the office. It's common place for people to be working on their vacations or handling emails on their days off. You'll find yourself dreading taking time away from work just to keep your head above water when you are on the clock."
39,Geller & Company,Stay away!!! Please. Do not leave your current employer for Geller!,2020-08-18,1.0,Anonymous Employee,The benefits and competitive salary.,"Everything else. Not worth the great benefits and pay, I really wish I had taken the negative reviews seriously before I started. This is the most disorganized and unfriendly company I have ever worked for. On my first day, I had “orientation” - basically brainwashing you about how great the firm is, while not giving you any helpful information. They did not give me any next steps or follow up, and no one reached out to welcome me my first week. That should have been my first red flag that no one cared. The onboarding is a disaster and no one knows what is going on at all times, nor care to help you. People scoff at the fact that they have to train you because it’s an inconvenience to them.
The clients are so demanding to the point where it drives the supervisors insane, so they become bullies to their staff and harass them until their work is complete. They will work you into the ground because they do not care about you, only about the revenue they can generate from the client. Supervisors will publicly shame you while CCing the team email if you did something wrong or forgot to do something. Overall, if you want to leave your current job for a toxic environment, then Welcome to Geller."

42,Geller & Company,Excellent Leadership and Professional Resources,2020-07-13,5.0,Senior Financial Analyst,"At Geller, CFO Support Teams are comprised of Financial Analysts, Team Leads, CFO's and Super CFO's. there is one key area of focus for each CFO Team, and each Analyst/ TL has the autonomy to figure out their own solutions to common reporting / ad hoc processed. 

For a newly hired Geller Professional such as myself, after 90 days I have really grown to appreciate this model. for while allowing each Financial Analyst to build upon their own skillsets and truly produce their won work, each Analyst actually has a large team to draw on for support.

In addition, Geller places a HUGE focus on Data Security and Professional Training. With our product being the reports we build and analysis we provide, ensuring that the data we store and transmit is highly protected, and that our systems are always up to date is essential, and it feels good to be part of an organization with these proper controls in place. Further, with all the in-house training, SAP sessions, LinkedIn Learning, the Young Professional Network, ToastMasters, and others, our 500 person firm offers a highly robust support package aimed at supporting each analyst with the tools to be the absolute best they can be.

Finally - Leadership. A Key theme during my short tenure so far has been COVID-19 and the general concerns of returning to work in NYC. The recurring Town Hall sessions led by our CEO has been amazing. All an employee could ask for is to be part of the conversation and to understand where their employer is at with the state of the world and what we should be prepared for. Leadership genuinely wants to know our questions and concerns and quickly responded in tangible ways.","It has been hard for me to work remotely with my new team, as I joined the company during the lockdown and have only met a handful of people in person- so it still feels like I have yet to really settle in.

Management loves to take credit for the great work of the associates, but the associates are beat down and reprimanded when they do not perform. Very little guidance - even the best trained and credentialed new employees will be learning everything on the job. There are promises made at hiring and at review time that never come to fruition unless you press the issue over and over to get updates on your advancement opportunities. But beware, someone who is a friend of a management team member will probably be more qualified than you!

44,Geller & Company,Good progress but Executive Leadership needs to change,2020-06-16,2.0,Manager,"Pockets of new and old managers and leaders really do care about the Geller Family.

In the last two years the expansion of training opportunities with new leadership in training, Geller is starting to look like it’s maturing.",Executive level leadership expect rapid growth and rapid change without fully appreciating what it takes to execute. When the company tries to change executives don’t play the right supporting role.  Decision making is crippled by the amount of stakeholder input required.
45,Geller & Company,"Please stay away, very difficult company and people to work for",2020-06-09,1.0,Accountant,"As mentioned in other reviews, insurance is covered by the employer.","Upper management here is brutal to say the least. During the interview, they may seem welcoming, but the environment you will work in is just degrading. 

You are constantly belittled, lectured, and disrespected from the get-go. Leaders are supposed to teach and help you develop, and neither is provided here at Geller.

Training is non-existent, you will learn only through trial and error, so expect negative repercussions. Everything is your fault and you are to blame even during the learning process, it was awful.

Going into office was stressful, day in day out. If the manger was in a bad mood (which was often), you better believe your day was ruined. You would get blamed for things that you had no idea was your duty! Nothing ever stayed consistent and just dealing with the stress of dealing with bad managers is debilitating. 

As for career growth, that's reserved for anyone who can stay here past 5 years. The turnover rate at Geller is astronomical. New faces and new names were the norm here. People do not stay at Geller and once they realize the mistake they've made, they try to get out as soon as possible.

Just the gut wrenching feeling I had entering the building and knowing the potential havoc that would be laid upon us still makes me feel sick today. There was no happiness when I began to work here. I worked late (which was a badge of honor for some managers in a sickening way), and came in early just so I can prepare myself for whatever nonsense came my way.

And please forget about work life balance. Countless family events and vacations were ruined by the demand of this job. I cannot stress this part enough.

Diversity is not on the radar. Maternity leave, while offered, is looked down upon. The business is based off one main client, and not particularly sustainable given the volatile nature of the founder/CEO and his contacts with the client. The founder uses the office to employ his personal staff. He is an extraordinarily volatile, fickle person, surrounded by a swarm of yes men/women.

57,Geller & Company,Look Elsewhere,2019-06-09,1.0,Anonymous Employee,Decent location next to subway.,"DULL, complacent, about a decade behind in technology, business model relies on the hands of a few large relationships, there's no sense of urgency whatsoever (Until they need employees to put out a fire).  Zero forward thinking, creative thought processes are disposed of, management will turn a blind eye to any criticism or even simple requests.   HR seems hesitant to act, it's a constant game of cat and mouse and no one knows where to hide.   Those with career ambitions quickly realize that  the firm will not grow and the negative impact on employees will continue to leak until the flood gates burst, because of barriers management has constructed for their own personal benefit.  A truly toxic culture.

Turnover is astronomical, they never stop hiring because employees don't last one year ( that's generous).  Promotions?  Almost non-existent, they're hiring outside the office only for senior level jobs and that should tell you enough.  They don't care to give their employees a path towards success."

The people of this firm are its greatest asset and everyone I have worked with in my department and across has been great. The work life balance is decent and the benefits are top notch. The firm is working on initiatives and events to bring the entire firm's employees together but I would say there is still lack of visibility between departments. This is something management could improve on.,There aren't enough internal mobility/growth opportunities but that is also something in the works which would be great.

Geller is a wildly political place - and definitely not a meritocracy. The people who get ahead are the ones who play the game well. There are managers who have little to no experience. They are jokers “faking it until they make it” and torturing their team with asinine requests. Associates get forgotten or lost in the shuffle as their managers fight to keep their jobs or advance. There is no career path at Geller. My time was wasted there with a series of fire drills and pointless exercises. There is no respect. I previously worked at a prestigious company that crushes associates - but I walked away with recognition.

The firm has various businesses including supporting a large multinational company which makes the work very exciting and rewarding. Pay is very good and health benefits are exceptional.  Also employee training/continuing education is encouraged and technology used is high end.","Smaller firm size, which I noted as a positive, is also a negative in that there are fewer positions available making career growth a challenge.  But this is true at every smaller firm.  I had worked at a company with over 100,000 employees, so it does take some adjustment!

Like many other companies, some departments are very well managed and others are, well, not so great.  But it varies by team/department, so I suggest focusing on this during the interview process and asking questions about the culture in the department in which you will be working.  For me personally, while it has not always been perfect, it has been a good experience and I have learned many new things and been exposed to many new areas during my tenure.

If you are considering an offer or even interviewing here, I hope you will not make the same mistake. The ratings on here are perfectly justified. 
Geller does a terrific job on selling you on this great ""culture"", of career opportunity and work life balance.  Unfortunately neither is the case.  There is virtually zero career growth and when positions do open they will always look to hire from outside despite having perfectly qualified candidates in house.  The same goes for compensation: raises and bonuses are very poor, no matter an ever increasing workload.  Although there are summer days and floating holidays, standard work hours are 9-6, so the extra days really just offset that.  
This is all without even mentioning the terrible managers, politics and rather hostile work environment.  Most managers are incompetent, with either no experience in the teams they manage or little skill in managing people, but likely a combination of both.  The only people who seem to ""get ahead here"", including your manager, will not hesitate to throw others under the bus or stab them in the back if it makes themselves look better. I have never seen a more political workplace than here, so unless you have the ability to be completely fake person to suck up to the right people, you will not succeed here. 
As other reviews have mentioned, this is a poorly managed, insanely political and hostile work environment.  Please do yourself a favor and look at opportunities elsewhere as you will quickly regret your decision to work here."

121,Geller & Company,Unhealthy work environment,2015-08-29,1.0,Anonymous Employee,Well stocked kitchen and some nice people just not enough in senior management roles.  Good medical benefits and nice offices.,Dysfunctional and unprofessional organization.  CEO / Owner is disengaged and disconnected.  Some executives spent their time publicly humiliating me and others. This type of behavior seems to be encouraged and rewarded. HR is non existent and the CEO has no clue.  My manager supported me and I enjoyed working for her but was powerless to help as no one cares to listen and I was only mid level management.
122,Geller & Company,Tax Associate,2015-08-09,1.0,Anonymous Employee,They have great benefits and great perks.  The office is nice and the technology is first rate. The pay is good.,"The management at he upper levels seems to be good, but the directors and managers are unclear about expectations and will not give feedback on job performance."
123,Geller & Company,Former IT employee,2015-05-05,2.0,Anonymous Employee,Interesting IT environment. Lots of new technology investments and ability to stay current. There was always a chance to learn from other employees.,"Low pay, mediocre benefits. Management never hesitated to let you know how close we all lived to being fired, a lot of fear uncertainty and panic."
124,Geller & Company,Administrative assistant,2015-04-21,3.0,Anonymous Employee,"Mostly Great people, great benefits, could have great working environment depending on what department you are working in and for.",Mostly great people. Executive admin team very clique oriented. Which applies to some executives as well. In my department complete lack of organization. Too much socializing and not enough prospecting for clients.
125,Geller & Company,Hard work and no play,2015-02-22,3.0,,"Good pay, great benefits,nice offices.  Some of the people are really helpful and you can make good friends.","Hours are very long all year round because they are inadequately staffed for the work that needs to get done.
A lot of improvements could be made but the people working there are not really interested in learning
Leadership keeps changing from year to year"
126,Geller & Company,"Great people, great culture, great place to work",2015-02-12,5.0,Intern,"I was hired as an intern and so far, the experience has surpassed expectations. If you're looking for a company with a great culture, Geller has a fantastic one.  Not only are the people are incredibly kind and warm, they are so open and willing to help you learn and contribute. It's truly a superb learning experience and provides great exposure for me as an intern.","Sometimes the projects become tedious, but once you get the hang of it then most likely the process will turnover faster."
127,Geller & Company,Solid place to work for experienced hires,2015-01-10,4.0,Anonymous Employee,"For experienced hires, Geller provides a lot of interesting projects tailored to each client. Client managers appeared to remain excited and engaged by every new project.",Inexperienced hires (right out of college) don't have a lot of opportunity to move up the ranks in tax and cash management services.
128,Geller & Company,Geller & Company,2014-11-10,3.0,Anonymous Employee,Excellent benefits. Challenging work environment. Opportunities for advancement. The flat organization can lead to excellent exposure with top senior management.,"Flat organization, no promotion/track or structure. You will have a difficult time ascertaining what you goals to achieve to get ahead, and if you do, you will have no idea what the job title/salary increase entails. Difficult to get promoted without job hopping. Project management is often very helter skelter...you may be sidetracked from your day to day ""job"" for days/weeks and then dinged for it in your review."

If you do a good job and know how to speak up they will throw you money! Be ready with a backup plan ( Job ) just in case. I received 3 big bumps in pay telling them i was leaving, but i had something to fall back on, just in case! The benefits were good when I was there, I know they were working on changing them as I left.","if you are a person that likes to just come to work and be a robot then this place is good. If you are creative, can speak up, and can shine then be very careful. There is always someone you will get upset by shining yourself. ALWAYS ALWAYS ALWAYS, have all of your conversations in email and NEVER act comfortable with people here. I suggest using sub folders for any manager you speak with. Unfortunately upper management does not know what goes on. Although the owner is in fact a genuine person and does care about his people, he is way too busy being the head of the company as it should be. His trusted HR dept is another thing. They will do their best to keep you hidden and make sure you do not reach his ear. Again have everything in email as proof. Or just keep your head low and be a robot."
131,Geller & Company,"If you get an offer for this company, run to the nearest exit",2014-05-11,1.0,Anonymous Employee,complimentary snacks and location is near public transportation,"Although the company brags about there team and supportive atmosphere to get you in the door, once you start working there, it changes significantly. Everyone only cares about their own well being and will throw one another under the bus, if they can result in them keeping their job. The training is lackluster at best and there is no such thing as interim period to get up to speed.

Also be prepared to work extremely long hours. Although they emphasize that the workout peeks during certain time frames, the average employee works 10 to 12 hour days."
132,Geller & Company,Geller is a challenging but rewarding work environment.,2014-04-10,4.0,Finance Manager,There is no limit to what you can learn if you apply yourself.,It's a flat organization little room for upward advancement.

It's a very hands-on environment. Be willing to roll up your sleeves.

Entrepreneurial environment

Advice to those considering a career there would be to have or want to develop a level of self-awareness, be open to change, and always be accountable for what you do. If not, you won't succeed.",Hours can be challenging at times but the results are worth it.

140,Geller & Company,A huge waste of time,2013-06-20,1.0,Financial Analyst,"Benefits are just about the only thing that's good here. Medical, dental, and vision paid for and decent amount of vacation days.","Lots of office politics. People are older than dinosaurs here.

141,Geller & Company,Truly empowered,2013-04-19,5.0,,"I enjoy the non-uniformity and diversity of the work environment at Geller and Company. Having this, helps to keep me interested and motivated. I get to see and thoroughly understand different business processes, business development, and business relations.

142,Geller & Company,Great learning & growing experience!,2013-04-01,4.0,Accountant & Financial Analyst,"I was hired by Geller early on in my career.

Agree with other reviews, great pay & benefits.","small company, tough to move up to make Manager.. seemed senior management always hired someone from the outside for upper level positions"
143,Geller & Company,Big Mistake,2013-03-05,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"Fully paid benefits, 4 weeks time off, all from day one","Long hours  caused by reaction rather than proaction by management.  Nepotism - senior management that fratenizes with staff and then rewarding them while others are ignored. Employees are not treated fairly - if you are liked you may have a chance to succeed.  - They get you in with the benefits and the BIG name of their Key Client - which if it ever left, that would be the end of Geller & Co.  There is no communication between departments, units and management.  Management has a habit of berating employees in the middle of the floor and during meetings to make themselves look good.  The opporunities that they speak about are not existant you just work in a silo and become a robot there.  HR is clueless as the atmosphere and environment and has no clue how to interact and assist the employees."
144,Geller & Company,Great company,2013-03-04,5.0,Anonymous Employee,The benefit package and snack bar is a big plus. But overall I have to say a large number the people there are nice folks.

They throw around the name of the Key Account and tell you you'll have exposure and it's like you work there.  Not true.  Dry, stuffy atmosphere.  Management is incompetent.  Long hours.  No communication between departments; everything is done in a silo.  Terrible reputation (wish I had know this when I interviewed).  I don't know anyone at my level, in my department, who is not looking for a new job.  I would not wish this upon my worst enemies."
