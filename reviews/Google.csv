Inclusive workplace. GREAT perks (the meals, beautiful campuses, flexible hybrid work model).","Very self-service oriented, meaning you have to learn things and navigate the org pretty much on your own. Very hard to get promoted, which can be demoralizing for some."
1,Google,"Great overall company culture, but it comes down to your team",2022-06-21,4.0,Program Manager,"Excellent employee benefits and competitive salary (usually the top of the market)
Lots of opportunity for professional growth and internal mobility
Perks are fantastic (free food, onsite gym, shuttle service, etc.)","I'm sure you've read all the great things about working at Google, such as the obvious like perks and salary. But do your due diligence when going through the interview process to get a feel for your team and manager. Ultimately, that is what is going to shape your day to day experience at the company. I ultimately left after a bad re-org that left me doing the work of 4-5 people by myself that was outside the scope of my level, yet I wasn't promoted when I brought it up to my manager."

Rewarding work if you find a team that is a good fit.,"It's getting harder to take pride in the work as products decline and get shut down. Promo rewards new products and features rather than quality.

It's also harder than it used to be to move teams. Popular teams get a lot of people applying, and a lot of teams interview almost as if you are changing companies.

Unless you do ML, there is not much room for growth in a purely technical role. You have to shift into more of a leadership role."

- High pressure. Google is growing at a pace faster than they can handle themselves. Growing rapidly entails right sizing teams to cater to an increased workload, this was not the case. Google will make you over work and then send you a bunch of goodies, but beyond a point, goodies don't do justice to the work that they get out of you.
- Hitting your high pressure hiring target is one piece, apart from that, you ought to be exceptional at your SLA's, TTH and Pass Through Rates. With high volume hiring, meeting all the requirements can be very daunting.
- As part of the interview process, was made to meet with a Senior leader on the recruitment team, and the individual did nothing but humiliate me. Wasn't sure if that was the intent, to break someone down and corner them, but it was the worst feeling, especially when it is a leader"

By working anywhere else in the country - Pittsburgh Pa, Rural Virginia -- even 40 miles West to Burlington, NC you would make more money. This does a disservice to the area. The company further claims it is trying to hire more HBCU graduates in this location... So cheapest location in the country, and trying to hire HBCU graduates. Not a good look. The News & Observer and Washington post have both issued articles ""Google lowered its salaries in North Carolina. Now workers are protesting"" and ""Google employees protest company’s Durham wage policy. Here’s why they’re upset""

On a less key note, compared to other google offices, the office here seems surprisingly normal - more akin to your typical office location than you think of when you hear google office. Maybe this isn't a bad thing, but it shouldn't feel so targeted as making this a ""discount"" location."

The expectations are almost nil - it's impossible to get fired, unless you completely stop showing up.

The benefits and pay are good (not the best in the industry, but better than most).

Some of the older technology was (and sometimes still is) genuinely groundbreaking. You can learn a lot by studying it. If you're an engineer, find someone senior who has been there for 10+ years to learn from: most of those people are extremely impressive, if they haven't left yet.","Most of the senior leadership changed from 2015 to about 2018, and the new people are the most ""meh"" uninspiring bunch of caretakers I've ever seen. Above director level, leadership seems to only care about PR and cutting costs - nobody has any kind of product vision or the guts to try anything new. Any innovative product someone manages to produce gets killed immediately. Any new acquisitions get bogged down in senseless bureaucracy.

The old leadership leaving triggered a chain reaction that's still ongoing, and has now reached tech lead and line manager levels. Most of the best people left or mostly checked out.

There's nothing wrong with wanting a simple 9-5 job, but Google today is something else: it's soul-crushing how much nobody cares anymore, and how disincentivized you are from actually trying to ship a product for end-users. If you actually try to get anything done, you will be the only one, and it'll suck life out of you.

On paper, this might sound like a nice, chill gig, but human beings are not meant to do nothing. The complete lack of goals or vision in the company will start getting to you sooner or later, and it is depressing.

Consider: this is a well-funded business with lots of infrastructure and resources, and the leadership chooses to do absolutely nothing with them."

- Free food - not great - but ""free"".
- Come here to rest [strikeout]and vest[/strikeout].","- The average developer in Google is a far shot from being a great engineer despite all the ""prestige"". This reflects in an aging tech stack, poor code quality, overcomplicated designs that are glorified in a self-fulfulling game of showing off how much complexity engineers can come up with. Surprisingly sketchy practices on some core products. A lot of the 10+ yoe engineers here have been at no other company and know little of the outside world or technology progress.
- This company is super frugal - to the point of being just plain cheap. This is a far shot from the reputation it has of having extraordinary perks and a fun environment to work at. Offices are very average for today's standards even compared to much smaller companies. Management dumps corpspeak on Googlers every other week and feels old school corporatey. Open memegen (the company's internal 9gag) any day of the week to see popular posts endlessly complaining about compensation, corpspeak from leadership, lack of transparency and overall self-mocking messages. It's pretty depressing and nothing ever changes.
- Systematic racism + extreme in-your-face diversity consciousness advertising makes this a painfully hypocritical company to work for.
- As an engineer who myself enjoys the guilty pleasure of an occasional praise, being surrounded by Googlers' continuous self praising and elitism is repulsive. Stick around employees a bit after a few drinks and you'll open up a secret world made up of an openly dirty racist bunch of humans lusting for more money and status (or might just be the London office).

594,Google,Old fashioned tech company where office politics work,2022-05-20,3.0,Senior Software Engineer,"The pay and benefits are great. On most teams, work you do influences many, many people. The company is huge. If you aren't happy on your team, it's easy to find another one and transfer, much easier than if you were unhappy at a startup and had to move to a whole new company. Changing teams is as easy as clicking a few buttons, a short chat with the new manager, and filling out a form. Relative to anywhere else I've worked, people are more positive and helpful, nearly always willing to make time to help each other out.

Google has many products that have millions or billions of customers. It's easy to find teams that give you the opportunity to develop skills to work at huge scales. Relative to other companies, it's simple to write servers or single-use or cron applications that process huge amounts of data and do it securely, with respect for user data. You can learn how to store massive quantities of data for customers in geographically disparate areas and respect data-location and privacy laws or learn how to apply AI queries at scale while respecting user privacy or write UIs that run on many different types of devices and screens. The scale of the company provides many, many opportunities.","Engineering processes and tools are ancient and bad, but people in charge believe that those practices are the key to Google's past and future success. Compilation, testing, deployment are painful slow and error-prone. Engineers aren't permitted to code on laptops. Everything from the version control system to the build tool to the server frameworks to the server environment is internal-only and custom. It feels like the dark ages. The company in the 2020s introduced the first team-based work planner with a backlog and iterations.

Working hard and improving the product and company doesn't get you promoted. You have to spend time selling yourself and your work. The amount of time you'll spend doing that varies by team. Some engineers do practically no work and are great at getting bonuses and promoted. They attach themselves to multiple other teams, organize big meetings, give presentations and that's about all. Most other companies ferret those people out quickly. Google promotes them.

To clarify my ""Diversity & Inclusion"" score, the company could not possibly do more. I was on a team that held multiple college recruiting events only for women, black, and latinx students. There were empty seats and we threw food away. One of the professors, a woman, emailed almost begging to let a few other students in. Internally, there are promotion opportunities only available to people based on their gender or race. When we start discriminating unnecessarily, that's not ""inclusion"". It's explicitly ""exclusion""."

Many Google offices are animal friendly.

Another initiative also provides pushbikes to ride around the Google Campus in an eco-friendly way.","Con: Work-life balance – not always balanced.

Many modern American companies have developed a contrived culture of lingering at work. Ambitious, new or young talent may end up hanging out at the office outside of work hours, often working or learning. This can develop into peer pressure to spend a lot of time at the office. Apart from coffee shops and libraries, some places have “sleep pods” for that swift power nap to help you keep going for longer. The Toronto Office even has a crazy golf putting green on the roof!"

905,Google,"Still an amazing place to work, beware of entitlement",2022-05-05,5.0,Software Engineer,"1. Great work/life balance. There's not many companies I know that have a consistent a 40hr work week, and pay top salary.
2. Cool projects to work on. Good balance between research & development. (See caveats below though.)
3. Supportive, healthy, psychologically safe work environment. Google cares a ton about how we work, and how we work together. The bottom-up culture also means that we have a lot of self-determination and don't feel like we're at the mercy of our management.
4. Super easy internal mobility. Lots of us change teams every couple of years. Google has so many different types of work that you won't feel you're ""stuck"" -- as long as you like working at Google overall, then you'll be able to find something interesting.
5. It's Google! Having Google on your resume opens doors to other opportunities, and it's great for networking too since generally your colleagues will be top of their field.","1. Entitlement. I make literally 5x as much as I ever dreamt. The comp is insane at FAANG companies like Google. But people here constantly complain about salary, the quality of the free food, why they have to work 5 days a week.... these are sometimes the same people who work 20 hrs a week. The amount of entitlement is insane here -- yes, we're the best of the best and we deserve a lot. But the culture and perks tend to pamper us.

2. Not all teams and projects have fulfilling work. There's lots of options, but choose carefully. Maybe you're happy getting paid to do nothing, on a team that has no visibility, so that you can ""rest and vest"" and coast. But, this will leave you woefully unprepared for your next job.... any company will hire you after Google, but that doesn't mean you'll do well at any company, particularly if you go to a more fast paced environment."

- Fun coworkers and positive working environment

- Learn lots about Cloud and time/budget to attain professional certifications
- Explore both technical and non-technical work","- Your experience is very dependant on the team you end up rotating with, so mileage may vary. If you end up with a team without much work, you have to actively search around for things to do. On the other hand, if your team is slammed, you will have to learn to say no.

- Information is provided with little warning. The program can be changed on the fly, and you will not know where or in what role you will be placed until a week before it happens

- You begin as an L2, rather than the usual L3

- If you are set on being 100% technical, software engineering may be a better fit. You could try to transfer after this program but I think having software engineering experience at another company will be a better way into Google SWE."

Most of the best/preferred technologies are not shared outside the company which limits how much your skill set can transfer to elsewhere.

Now, those who’ve worked with him say he’s a gentle, creative soul who seeks to help colleagues.

Spent a couple of years looking for a home. To put it mildly, the development culture I found wanting. So much emphasis on coding standards and reviews, for example, but a real lack of planning for the code development in every one of the groups I worked in.

- outside of cloud, Google is a really cool company to work for
- you get to work with some super smart people, especially those who have come from other parts of Google
- Google’s charitable matching program and annual charitable give away to charities of your choice is very cool","- culture is being destroyed in Cloud through bringing in a stream of people from big consulting companies other less respected tech companies known for terrible culture and practices 
- evidently the talent team sold a lot of pandemic joining nooglers on the future of Google being remote and hired people from all over the UK, yet Cloud have not granted remote working status to hardly anyone, instead everyone has to be in the office three days a week regardless - exodus expected when speaking to colleagues
- despite a core Google value being respect each other, this is not the case in the UK. Bullying and retaliation are a common theme across Cloud. HR seem to bury the cases, as those in management with strings of cases against them seem to regularly get promos. 
- politics and back stabbing are a daily occurrence 
- lots of inexperienced people in management positions making poor decisions 
- performance reviews are every 6 months and are solely based on whether you are part of your managers “in crowd”
- many sales people aren’t hitting target as quotas are extreme/in achievable (don’t believe what you are told in the hiring process)
- Cloud are mainly based in the least desirable Google London office in Victoria 
- pay is not competitive despite what you get told
- the internal sales tools are terrible (there are so many) and not fit for purpose, especially tools for tracking attainment. For a company so focused on data, the Cloud org have no clue how to manage it/make it useable/beneficial internally. you will spend a majority of your day doing admin to make sure you get paid correctly or working out your forecast, which is done in spreadsheets despite all the systems
- there is an annual company survey each year in which Cloud does terribly and every year we are promised change in all the most negative areas, but real change never comes and the issues just get swept under the carpet"

The community of individuals is top-notch- amazingly smart, driven, and courteous colleagues.","Given the scale of the operation, it's very hard to create change. The best opportunities and problems are often ""gifted"" down from managers to select individuals who are on fast promotion trajectories. Challenges are often framed so positively, it can feel impossible to ask the ""real question,"" criticize efforts, or swim upstream. I saw individuals sent a strong message with their ratings for challenging the status quo. At times, this can feel toxic and insurmountable. The key here is aligning to strong managers who are transparent and supportive so you can get tapped for meaningful work, find a safe space for challenging assumptions, and get buy-in for your ideas."

3026,Google,Best place to work at,2022-01-27,5.0,Client Partner Lead,"Google is one of the best employers in the world by far. Here I do not want to talk about the perks, the salary or even the offices. Those have been written and talked about over and over again. But I would like to stress the culture and the people in this amazing company. 

Google strives to be a place for everyone, where everybody could bring their best selves. No matter who you are, what your gender is, what your background, color, ethnicity is, Google welcomes every single employee with open arms. The most important factor in Google teams is the issue of psychological safety. This means that as an individual, I should not be afraid to raise my voice about my opinions and fear for retaliation, humiliation or discrimination. Google believes that great organisations/companies can only strive with open mind and collaboration and in order to have everyone bring their best ideas there should be psychological safety. Which unfortunately, is not the issue for most of the companies in the world.

The other thing I would like to talk about is the quality of the employees. I kid you not, every single employee feels like they are smarter than you. When you first come to the company you get this huge imposter syndrome because you think you're a hiring mistake, but then you talk to other people and realise that everyone feels the same because of the smarts level around you. Thinking about it retrospectively I believe that this is an amazing feeling, a feeling that pushes you to be better and bring your best.","Honestly, the first and the major con I can think of is that once you start working for a company like Google it is very difficult to spread your wings and fly away to an other company because Google is incomparably better than others.

An other con might be the slow progression of career steps. Google is a huge employer with more than 150k employees around the world. This sometimes makes internal mobility and career progression slower or harder."

- Lots of incentives to rush things in time for perf/promotion cycles since management mostly cares about new shiny launches (just see how little users trust Google at this point to keep their products alive or do good customer service)
- Massive company = lots of managers and arbitrary bureaucratic power. It's up to luck whether you can escape internal politics and have a good experience or get stuck in a toxic team
- Very very political environment which can be really draining
- Even in Europe, American views on identity and race trump all (if you're white, it's irrelevant if you came from a poor family in a post-soviet country, you need to check your privilege)"

The benefits package is to die for, especially as a transgender woman attempting to start a family.","Google has no aesthetic sensibility whatsoever. Google's rigorous focus on metrics means that anything that can be easily measured is optimized for, and anything that is difficult to measure is systematically neglected. Many important aspects of product design and software engineering exist in this subjective realm, and are impossible to turn our focus upon without being punished by the performance review process.

Many of Google's important internal tools, including such essentials as source control and front-end frameworks, are hilariously antiquated. Google is systemically allergic to third-party dependencies and essentially out of conversation with the open source community. Internally, many open source best practices are regarded with open hostility.

Turnover is very high, and org charts are very deep. Conversations with decision-makers are filtered through many layers of management, resulting in game-of-telephone miscommunication and planning processes which move slower than market conditions. Short-term thinking is systemically encouraged by itinerant managers and ICs eager to achieve promotion quickly and move on to their next team.

Nevertheless, meaningful work is possible for ICs who are steel-nerved and internally motivated."

- 75%+ (90%?) of projects are worthless/pointless & destined to go nowhere. On these projects, you can lead a team & the culture is typically good - but your work will never have a real impact.
- At most 25% of projects (probably less) have any chance of having much impact. On those projects, its very difficult to get a role as more than a cog. Also, those teams can afford to (and tend to) have a crappier culture & push people much harder because people want to work on them.
Most people end up working on things they aren't really interested in, or in roles they wouldn't take or stay-in at other companies.
Management quality varies *a lot*. I've seen some managers who were good at their job and also decent human beings. I've seen some that absolutely didn't deserve their roles, and/or that were vey sleazy.

5419,Google,Bad Promo Process and Mediocre Salary,2021-09-15,3.0,Financial Analyst,"Google has an awesome company culture and perks. Culture: management is accessible, your voice can be heard at team meetings and even all-hands meetings, people respect you, and I always felt cared about as a person. Perks: I thoroughly enjoyed the free breakfast/lunch/dinner, baristas, gym, commuter bus, and subsidized massages.","Google has to make some serious changes to improve its performance management and promotion processes. Called ""Perf"", it's a twice a year process that managers and staff alike despise because it takes up enormous amounts of time and results in questionable promotion decisions. 

In Finance, approximately 10% of the team can get promoted in any given Perf cycle and there are only two per year. I recommend learning about Google's internal level system during the hiring process and asking what level your role is before you accept the job offer. Talk to a friend or contact and see if the leveling of your role is reasonable to start with. I was hired at too low of a level and then slow (3 years) to reach my first promotion. 

Finance Levels at Google (rough work experience required):

L3 Financial Analyst (1-2 years)
L4 Financial Analyst (2-4 years)
L5 Senior Financial Analyst (4-6 years)
L6 Finance Manager (6-8 years)
L7 & L7.5 Senior Finance Manager (8+)
L8 Finance Director (12+)

L5 is the terminal level for many Finance employees. It's extremely difficult to get into management. L6 and above are very political promotions. For promotions at levels 3-5, they are largely time-based (2 years on average for L3/L4, 3 years for L5). Super strong performers do not get promoted more quickly, contrary to what Google claims. 

While total compensation (salary + 15% bonus + equity) is often competitive, the salary component is quite low and makes it hard to afford the SF Bay Area cost of living, especially in your first year before you get a bonus and before any of your equity vests."

Google is all about bringing your whole self to work, so long as your whole self is progressive. There are a number of activists within the company who will protest at the drop of a hat.

5756,Google,A Big Company that pretends it's a Startup,2021-08-27,3.0,Senior SRE,"Amazing tech, excellent benefits, a very generous employer. Salaries are not top of the line, but certainly high; office amenities are well documented; there are various budgets and stipends for training and learning; out of hours on-call times get (some) time off in lieu.","Many policies are enforced unevenly, the dismissal of various ""troublemakers"" have made the news and should be reviewed carefully. There is a significant amount of gaslighting and straight up dishonesty about policies, especially around topics where it is easy to be vague such as communications and confidentiality.

The positives above only apply to Engineering teams. Life is very different in Sales, I am told. 

While there are many claims about ""we're a family"" and ""community"" and so on, there is the usual strong disconnect between senior and exec management and the individual contributors at the coalface. This is expected in a huge company, but as it fails to admit that it is a huge company, it takes no steps to correct this."

Lots of amazing people, got to meet and see all kinds of cool people. 
Got to travel
Occasional perks made some things nicer, but they were often ephemeral. 
FTE status for extra perks sometimes.","Too much to complain about. I deleted a lot that would have probably identified me. 

My first manager threatened my job in a private meeting. Told me other managers were gossiping about me. He told me my job was in danger if I kept submitting negative feedback about his (eventually proven to be bad) idea. I communicated that the expectations set when I started were being abandoned. I told him how my last job they hired me away from stuck to their expectations at least, and he told me to go back to my old job. 

Another manager, in a small meeting of himself and some ITRs did it to a group of people once too. ""Remember, we're the ones who sign your conversion papers"". I didn't feel secure and was often anxious around management, because I never knew who was gossiping about me and who wasn't. 

How would you react to this kind of hostility? I was too afraid to report him, so I watched him get promoted away from his mistakes and failed responsibilities. I was mentorless, directionless, and the guy who I thought was looking out for me was just looking out for himself. 

This kind of trash happened more than once, and the managers should be ashamed of themselves for starting cliques and discouraging honest, candid feedback. 

This program was not googly, and this is not the only reason."

Not necessarily something good, or something completely functional (even for the minimal features in the MVP), just something. Frequently software is rushed, testing is skimped on, and higher up engineers are unwilling to learn modern software development practices to improve software performance, reliability, developer experience, and user experience.

If you do not like to cut corners, do not work at Google. After spending 4 years here, being told by 3 managers that I care too much about my work and spend too much time making it right (while simultaneously being dinged on perf for it being 'not right enough'), and witnessing Google's willingness to protect sexual abusers and the bottom line over its purported values, the veneer of friendliness seems very disingenuous."

Very hard to make data-driven decisions for the customer with constant bullying and micro-aggressions from the Category Management team to push their specific agenda (i.e. revenue goals and merchant favoritism).

8611,Google,Do not join Google in this role,2021-03-31,1.0,Associate Account Strategist,-everything related to Google and not related to this role or the GCS org,"Summary: it's not what it used to be anymore

-calling client's that don't want to talk to you and convincing them to do things that are often not needed for them but for Google to generate more money
-learning curve flattens extremley after 3-6 months. After that, just a very well paid call-center job
-no clear career/growth path. Google keeps enforcing level (promo) requirements that force you to do a job that could be done by a computer for 2 years. 2 years ago, you would only have to do that for one quarter. Back in the old days, you would do 20% projects with other teams to get out of GCS. But this becomes harder and harder as most people know how terrible the GCS Org/Job is and simply leave after a short time. It's also very hard to learn any transferable skills as all you do is call people and convince them to stuff (no brain power needed) 
-higher management in central Europe does not have a clear strategy. Feels more like they try to push their own promo as hard as possible. Also, they block any rotation that would help you to get out of GCS to more interesting roles
-Higher management in central Europe always says stuff like ""we put you and your career first"" - which only applies to the sales roles that almost no one wants to do for a long period of time 
-The level you will be joining on (l2) in GCS is so low that you can't even change to (almost) any other department before a promotion. Even after a promotion, your level is often too low. You are stuck in this role for 2 years + 1-2 years on the next level before you can do anything interesting 
-A location that almost no one likes. That's why they hire local irish people for higher management to enforce the location"

9642,Google,"interesting preschool environment, typical lack of appreciation for educators",2021-02-16,3.0,Children's Center Teacher II,"- work at a tech company and enjoy most of the benefits (if you can work It into your schedule)
- freedom in day to day work (*very team dependent)
- health insurance","- very low pay for the area - my recruiter literally told me my offer was considered ""below a livable wage in the bay area"", however I also had no room to negotiate based on experience ..lesson learned!
- unfair / biased hiring practices - theres at least one lawsuit in recent years alleging unequal pay between male and female teachers. I can confirm I knew of at least 1 male teacher who was hired as a level II when every female teacher I knew had been told by their recruiter they *must* start as a level I regardless of education or experience. I knew of at least one peer with a Masters who had to start as a level I - $16/hr. I am confident the male teacher did not have the same level of experience.
- unfair promotions - all about who you are friends with. if your team is a sinking ship you will likely go down with them at performance time regardless of your own individual performance
- HIGH attrition due to all of the above. constantly understaffed and making huge crazy sacrifices to stay in ratio 
- used to give stock options at hire - took them away without telling the population. huge uproar when everyone found out, followed by walk out protest and calls for raising base pay based on market standards. told by google leadership ""we know educators being underpaid is a problem, but Google is not going to focus on that right now""
- few growth opportunities - only 3 levels of teacher when I was there in 2017, otherwise like a handful of operations and leadership positions. 
- base pay is bad but promotion compensation was worse, a slap in the face. when I was promoted from a level I to level II teacher (the 2nd of 3 levels I could aspire to, remember) my raise was literally less than a dollar + a few stock thank god, and my manager actually acted like It was a big deal. I cant really blame her, knowing now how some companies manage promotions and $$ when It comes down to It, but that was just insulting..for the both of us. not unusual for educators, especially in preschool, but Google sets their own standard high and when a company is always preaching how ""employee first"" they are you kind of get to hold them accountable to it in practice."

* Outside of the major offices you're not going to advance very much. This is more of a job for when you want to kick back and relax rather than be ambitious."

9951,Google,"Google is an amazing place to work for the people, the growth, scale, variety and perks!",2021-02-03,5.0,Software Engineering Director,"-) The people (coworkers are smart & nice). 
-) The growth (you willl get invaluable development feedback from 360 degree reviews, that, if you are able to internalize and incorporate the feedback, will propel your career forward)
-) Variety. So many groups in one place, that when you're ready for your next career exploration, it will be easy and smooth. Google wants to be the last place you'll ever work.
-) Scale. If you want to have lots of users, in some cases billions, Google is a lot of fun and you are helping many people who use your product directly or indirectly. 
-) Free food and stocked ""micro-kitchens"" with snacks. And, the shuttles (okay, in 2020-21 this isn't a factor, but it will be when we all go back.)
Help the environment and make friends with neighbors, while riding a climate controlled bus with leather seats and friendly bus drivers, to work & back. If you can read in cars, you also will probably be able to get all your email done on the way to and from work, and the day is just about getting real work done.","It is a large company, with over 100,000 employees, so there are often many people involved in any given project. You will need to be patient to work with stakeholders. Most teams have minimal politics so this goes smoothly. Things take longer than in a startup, but on the other hand, the scale of users, products, infrastructure is much greater."

9982,Google,Foot In Door To Google,2021-02-02,5.0,Associate Account Strategist,You get to work with intelligent (socially and book smart) people constantly whether they are your customers or your coworkers. You don’t have to know Google Ads to start the role and they train you in the product very well. By a year in the role you’ll be in the 95% percentile of Google ads experts and you’ll have the opportunity to explore other roles at Google if you please. If you do well your pay goes through yearly refreshes and It can make a huge difference. You get to bring your whole self to work and that’s really cool.,"If you are joining the role from another company It is very vague if you will come into the role as an L2 (hourly) or L3 and that can make a big difference in compensation. People with 2-3 years of experience can make the same as a college grad and that can be frustrating. While pay has the potential to go up if you perform well, promotions can feel slow due to only 2 cycles a year which can limit you from going to roles that require certain levels. You will be challenged and need to have discipline, but it’s not a cutthroat environment in the slightest everyone helps everyone."

The people at Google is really the best, there's a lot of great talent, and while Google needs to continue to improve the diversity, specially on management roles, I think the Google Cloud team is fairly diverse.","There's a lot of change, and for some people this could be stressful, because there's a lot of adjustment needed. There are changes at all levels including compensation/salary changes.

10553,Google,The job is really not that interesting |The company really cares,2021-01-13,4.0,Account Manager,"- Perks are great and you will use them (gym, food, pantry, education, insurance, dental, ...)
- Working for a big company logo helps to open doors and makes you ''an interesting'' person in the room
- In the right team and with the right portfolio, you can make a real difference to businesses and communities
- Very empathetic, inclusive, and open environment
- Job safety. If you do your job, are on time, do what you're asked, it's a road to retirement

Generally, I'd recommend this job to someone in their mid-20s looking for a career in one company with a lot of resources, or an older individual with less drive looking for a safe place.","- Some roles are really not as glamorous as the job description reads. In customer-facing roles, you will often find yourself being an extended arm of Customer Support filing tickets and following up
- Getting a promotion is a steep challenge and fairly political (You have to be visible to the directors and sign up for all kinds of projects to show your value. This isn't much of an issue to me personally, but many people view it as an unwanted obstacle).
- You have to master your calendar to have time to actually do a job you want to do (After filing tickets, attending a dozen training sessions, taking multiple internal meetings a day, and replying to your emails, there are days when you find yourself having only 2-3 hours to do the job you hoped to be doing when they hired you)
- Inter-office transfers are very difficult to accomplish
- Irish tax system isn't really income-friendly (for those coming from low-income tax countries, you'd be shocked with how much money is lost every month).

Generally, I'd recommend dynamic, hungry, and entrepreneurial people to consider a smaller scale company where feel like you're making a difference, you mean something and your work is tangible, and not just a digit in Google's multi-billion dollar revenue."

The compensation is really good. Collaboration across teams can be great, although it does depend on product area. The culture in the company and much of the scandal that comes out is born out of transparency and freedom. Freedom to express yourself many employers stomp down on and sometimes.... it's too much but usually it's quite freeing.","The promotion process at google is well intentioned but poor, IMO. It is honestly probably the single biggest reason google is known for abandoning products. We develop things for promotions because that's what gets them. Maintaining and improving or spending the energy to rebuild and transfer data doesnt get you a promotion.

You need to land something, but you also need to excel for over a year this dissuades people pushing to do something to try and get a promotion which is good but also disincentivizing. The whole thing is political, you need to land grab at times to get work other teams might be doing so they can't do it.... again so you can get promoted. If you land in the right place at the right time it is easy to move up, rising tides raise all ships. A bad manager, a bad product idea, can sink you even if you are doing good work."

11143,Google,Great technological company marred by bureaucracy and politics,2020-12-09,3.0,Software Engineer,"Salary might be high and various perks are nice. Depends a lot on the country / office you are in, though. A lot of smart people, computational resources and great (even if proprietary) tools for everything. The company carries the whole burden of your relocation. You have the ability to somewhat easily find a different project when you want and to move to that different team if you have spent 1-1.5 years on your current one. A lot of various projects to choose from.

If you are not a white heterosexual male, you get special attention from recruiters, also numerous internal support and career mentoring resources are at your disposal, so the company might be a good choice in that case.","Depending on the project and the team you might feel inefficient of even irrelevant due to projects being huge, old and slow. Despite all the talks about fighting biases etc, your future to a high degree depends on your manager, who is often a great engineer, but with the upsetting probability might be useless or even detrimental as a manager. Your future also depends more on your ability to demonstrate your work than to actually do something useful, which makes sense, but the company does not do a nearly good enough job teaching you how to perform such demonstration the way it is expected of you. Sometimes you have to choose between doing something useful for your team or something good for your ""career"". Having to stick to all those internal proprietary tools (that are otherwise great to have) makes it hard for you to do much if you leave the company and those tools behind.

You might end up in a team that won't be nearly a good match or might get a wrong role due to the recruiters making mistakes and then neither recruiters nor managers caring about fixing them.

HRs pretend to be your friends, but make no mistake - they are not. They only seem to care whether you are a potential issue to the company. If an issue might go away as a result of them bullying you - they might do that, as actually figuring out how to fix internal culture is harder than putting pressure on people.

The company keeps changing internal performance evaluation requirements, disrupting rythm of work on regular basis probably so someone up high might add ""revamped evaluation process"" etc to own resume at the cost of all the damage to the rest of the company. The CEO, Sundar Pichai, is great at photo ops, but otherwise uninspiring. The company's top management pushes American politics onto the rest of the company even if you are outside of the US. If you do not share radical left-wing American perceptions - either learn to stay silent or start searching for another job.

In 2019 there was a big situation where a bunch of black employees and their ""allies"" were harassing a white employee for that employee being unfortunate outside of work to call the police after noticing a black man who acted as a trespasser and who refused to leave. The top management of the company in a company-wide meeting ""addressed"" the situation by pledging their support to the black employees and said nothing at all that would prevent similar harassments in the future."

VP-level leadership doesn’t appear to understand the simple fact that processes have a cost, and it boggles the mind. Every new VP introduces more random process without ever worrying about the cost to time and morale, and then erects a wall of program managers and forms to insulate from any criticism or pressure to simplify.

Worse, most VP-mandated process is introduced because the VPs don’t trust middle management to do its job. Criticism and comments are discarded without response, and managers and directors I have spoken to are completely resigned.

The beatings continue until morale improves."

Google cares so much about innovation, that one of its principles encourages Google employees to spend 20% of their time pursuing innovative ideas about which they are passionate. Products and applications, such as Google News, Google Alerts, and Google Maps Street View, have been born from this principle.
Google offers shuttle services to employees who work out of its Googleplex so they can avoid long wait times in traffic and even the stress of driving to work. Every morning, big black buses equipped with WiFi pick up employees to get to the office.
Google also offers some of the best paid parental leave for new parents. Its employees have paid leave up to 18 weeks if the father is the primary caregiver, or seven weeks otherwise. Mothers are still entitled to 22 weeks of maternity leave. Google cares so much about new parents that it offers parents one-on-one consultations to figure out their scheduling for daycare options, money to spend on baby bonding time, as well as four child care centers on one of its campuses.
Google also offers a Global Education Leave program, which enables employees to take a leave of absence to pursue further education. All of this education is covered by Google.
Since Google is one of the most well-known technology companies in the world, it offers employees better job prospects should they decide to leave the Googleplex. It also offers growth within the company, whether it be for middle management or higher-level management opportunities.
Working at Google provides employees with a sense of contributing to the worldwide population. Google employees positively impact society with the applications and technology on which they are working. These technologies would surely benefit the human race; for example, self-driving cars could enable its passengers to catch up on sleep during their commutes. Its accident rate is uncanny, with just a handful of accidents in the more than 20 million miles driven since January 2020, many of which were determined to be caused by human error.
Google only looks for the best and brightest minds, and employees are always exposed to other amazing employees and intelligent thinkers. Being around other intelligent thinkers allows for a creative work environment, collaboration, and disruptive innovation.
To help with morale, employees are free to bring their pets to work. Some Googlers describe that being able to bring their pets to work keeps their energy levels up, as well as bringing joy to other employees.
Although there are highly intelligent employees at Google, there is no rocket science that goes into Google offering one of the best work environments. Google simply treats people with respect and supports its employees' creative and innovative endeavors.","The competition is brutal.
Let’s face it: When you work for one of the biggest organisations in the world, your employer can easily afford to select the best – which makes for a highly competitive environment. When you work alongside some great talent, competition will be pretty much inevitable.

Learning is self-driven.
There is an expectation that you will actively continue to educate yourself and expand your knowledge as a Google employee. You are encouraged to commit to self-improvement as well as expanding your skills. Some might see this as an imposition on their time, but it is simply part of life in today’s ever-changing work environment – especially in technology – and many businesses have adopted a similar culture.

Launches drive advancement.
Google is known to promote staff as a result of product launches rather than as a reward for incremental improvements. Of course, in reality, most software developers will be involved in code improvement and bug fixing, yet the incentive scheme is not generally geared towards taking that into account.

Work-life balance – not always balanced.
Many modern American companies have developed a contrived culture of lingering at work. Ambitious, new or young talent may end up hanging out at the office outside of work hours, often working or learning. This can develop into peer pressure to spend a lot of time at the office. Apart from coffee shops and libraries, some places have “sleep pods” for that swift power nap to help you keep going for longer. The Toronto Office even has a crazy golf putting green on the roof!"

- Decent benefits. Far better than rivals Amazon or Microsoft. But no match to other Bay Area counterparts such as Facebook or Netflix. 
- Bureaucracy is there. But the company tends to be data driven and makes tough decisions based on where the data points. Which means that the typical corporate fiefdom politics will have diminishing returns in the medium to long term.","- Big company. Which means the company culture is rather diluted in day to day experience. What really matters is the team, organization, manager and role that you sign up for
- Tough to make an impact as there are plenty of smart people around. This means the ones who are well entrenched in the system tend to perform better. As a new comer, don't expect immediate success
- Imposter syndrome is a real thing. But you need to remember that this is a well oiled machine and will function very well without any single individual. This includes even the CEO - Pichai. Yes, Google will run very well without him.
- Expect to be low balled in terms of salary/designation. Google has plenty of applicants. And they can always find a better person for the role at a cheaper price given enough time. So be ready to eat humble pie and join on the company's terms."

12087,Google,"Good benefits, bad everything else",2020-10-03,3.0,Technical Solutions Manager,"Google pays reasonably well, and makes an effort to keep employees happy enough to stay.
The benefits are great, and the pay is competitive.","It is nearly impossible to transfer into engineering if you aren’t already there, and the company culture is very strange. You are expected to be friends with your coworkers, and you are expected to treat Google as though it is the best company in the world. 
The diversity and inclusion strategies are very tokenizing. As a queer person, I was immediately asked to get involved with diversity efforts. 
The culture also seems to be such that people like to pretend that Google is not a corporation that makes money.
Worth mentioning also that I was hired for a job description that had nothing to do with my actual role. 
They told me it was consulting but turns out it was product support. Big fat lie.
Also, the team I was on did things that were antithetical to the company’s “mission” and cloaked it under the guise of a necessary evil. 

Basically, unless they offer you a job as an engineer, avoid."

12130,Google,N/A,2020-09-30,5.0,Software Engineer,Good benefit and teammates to work,The promotion becomes slower and slower.
12131,Google,A shell of it's former self,2020-09-30,3.0,Technical Program Manager,"Benefits are solid. Health, dental, yearly bonus, vacation, and pay raises are amazing.","The culture and environment has become a joke. Google was once the most sought after company for employment, but it has lost it's unique charm from over a decade ago. Now it's a corporate monster that has grown far too big. We were once the #1 company on Forbes' 100 best companies to work for and it hurt us deeply when we dropped to #2 after many years at the top. Fast forward to 2020 and we don't even make the top 100.

There is a serious lack of coherence and communication anymore. Motivation to succeed is not based on making great products, but instead on what you can do for promotion. This is clearly evident in the products we develop - or develop then abandon. It's also why we once had nine discrete messaging apps while many other products included messaging functions.

The world would be a better place if great ideas like Google Fiber, Stadia, and Voice were better executed. However, we're left with products that are not only made fun of by the public, but given countdown clocks to when they'll be discontinued. What remains are disjointed products like Gmail - including a UI so butchered and bloated, they needed to add a loading screen so you didn't think long loads times means the service is down. 

We once did great work and were on the top of the tech world. This is no longer the case and I doubt we could ever get there again. We're too large, too slow, too disparate, and have so many competing visions, that there is no return to our former glory days."
12132,Google,Google,2020-09-30,3.0,Account Executive,Good first company name and experience will open doors,Too hierarchical sometimes felt detached from objectives
12133,Google,[For Google X] Your experience is highly dependent on your team,2020-09-30,3.0,Mechanical Engineering Contractor,Great food and snacks. Easy commute access being right next to the caltrain.,X Labs is not very diverse unless you count asian and indian and it felt like most females were not on the engineering side. I was a contractor so can't speak to benefits. Your experience is HIGHLY dependent on your team and projects can come and go very quickly. It is very difficult to move from a contract to full-time position. Also the parking problem is terrible.
12134,Google,Great company to settle down,2020-09-30,4.0,Account Manager (Sales),"- best perks in the tech industry
- great salary and equity compensation
- great work/life balance (depending on the team you work on)
- great job to have when you're ready to settle down, get a mortgage, have children, 9-5pm, work from home once/week, take lots of vacations. You will see people who have been working at Google like this for +10 years with very junior titles who are very happy. Success isn't always about the never-ending race to the top at work, spending time with families is also ok and Google provides the opportunities for that.","- Google sucks the best talent in the market, people who should be using their skills to be doing amazing, ground-breaking work to improve our society, are instead optimizing for how to get more clicks. You'll be surrounded by people who are way overqualified for the job they do but are only there because of the ""golden cuffs"" (the free food, the endless perks, and work/life balance). 
- eng vs. non-eng divide. Engineers get the best perks, salaries, off-sites, offices, etc. If you are not engineer, you're disposable, master degrees in anything else but computer science don't really have any weight here. MBAs won't automatically give you a different title or responsibilities at Google than a college grad.
- Really hard to move laterally once you have reached the plateau of your learning curve. If you're no longer challenged or happy with your job, why invest in you when they have hundreds of people lined up to take your job?
- no diversity among senior management (few women or people of color who are, in turn, not interested in raising people up the career ladder)."

Google is now just a big company - there's lots of people and a competitive talent pool. This makes getting stretch opportunities a rarity.
Lots of distraction from day-to-day work with protests against Google in China, DoD deals, sexual harassment, etc. While the sexual harassment protests were definitely merited and Andy Rubin was absolutely in the wrong, I thought there was frequently more negativity than was warranted against the company that fed you 3x/day, paid you handsomely, and gave you the chance to interact with other amazing people."

12501,Google,"Solid Experience, would work again",2020-08-31,4.0,Software Engineer,"- Highly competitive pay, best benefits I've seen, best perks I've seen (yes, this doesn't matter, but when everything else is good, this helps).
- Very strong individuals. The average engineer here is very skilled and some of the best in the industry are here. This does not mean everyone is a genius, but there are certainly some here. To do the work, you definitely don't need to be the best, but the quality here is definitely among the best I've seen (I've worked at other ""top"" companies).
- Stellar work life balance. I've seen reviews for this that are negative, but I feel like they're on the wrong team or something. My team was busier than most and promoted people quickly and I still rarely pushed over 40 hours a week. I've seen some people work significantly fewer hours as well and still progressed. You can coast at L4 if you just do basic work and rest and vest.
- Good projects if you're on the right team. If you get lucky and get on the right team then the work is definitely interesting. This can be a con if you are on the wrong team.
- Interesting tools and learning opportunities. You can definitely learn a lot about system architecture if you are new to it. You can learn about any product area and go into the little details of that domain. Some tools at Google are used elsewhere and the knowledge can be transferred (Guice, Bazel, gRPC, protos, etc).","- Work does not translate to other jobs. You never get to work on stuff like Apache Spark, AWS S3, RabbitMQ, and other technologies that are very common in industry. Instead you learn things like BigTable, which is similar to Apache HBase but not exactly. Your knowledge of internal frameworks is mostly useless in other jobs. The concepts learned are not, however.
- Half the projects are objectively boring and stale. Most of the projects are maintaining some aspect of the system (cloud, ads, etc) and a lot of it is tedious infrastructure work.
- Office politics as usual. The general population is friendly, but this does not mean everyone. Office politics definitely do play a role."
