3,Jump Trading,Good Pay But Won't Stay,2022-04-11,2.0,Software Engineer,high pay; low living cost,- not diverse environment (9:1 male:female ratio)
4,Jump Trading,World class trading organization,2022-03-19,5.0,Quantitative Trader,"Jump is a world class trading organization. They hire the best of the best and invest heavily in all aspects of their technology stack. 

If you believe in yourself - your intelligence, skills, and work ethic - then this is where you want to be.

Joining Jump was the best decision I ever made. I will be forever grateful that I got to be a part of this organization.","Jump is composed of many trading teams which operate largely independently of each other. This is undoubtedly an organizational strength, as it leads to small, highly motivated teams, and to an incredible diversity of ideas and strategies across the firm.

But there are some downsides to this structure. There can be some reinventing of the wheel across teams. And it can be hard to find meaningful opportunities to interact with and learn from people across team boundaries."
5,Jump Trading,Best Place For Researchers,2022-03-15,5.0,Quant Researcher,Freedom and resources to pursue ideas. Qualified co-workers with expertise in various fields from hardware to pure math.,Not much structure so sometimes hard to get a quorum on the same page.

Fresh innovative technology and business strategies 

Continued flat/informal work environment even in the midst of explosive growth and success",The environment can be tough if you are uncomfortable operating with evolving and fluid accountabilities
8,Jump Trading,getting stale and crowded,2022-02-08,3.0,Software Engineer,My perspective is as an engineer who has been at the firm for a few years (pre-covid).  There are plenty of smart people here though there are just a lot of people here.  It's more or less typical Chicago HFT firm inside with standard benefits and perks.  Good on WFH policy.,"It has definitely changed for the worse during my time here.  The rate of hiring is unbelievable and little thought seems to go into how new people will be managed and integrated.  Everyone just wants more headcount. Doubling a big firm into a very big firm in 3 years without any structural changes has just created pandemonium and confusion.  My manager told me the other day we are going to outsource some software development work to Romania. That is something I never thought I would hear.  
Everyone is busy and many things get started.  Few get finished or show good results though.  There is profits in certain areas but overall feels stale despite the frantic pace.  And with all of the people comes the exponential growth of politics.  The management says we are flat and without politics but it is funny (and sad) how wrong that is.  Nobody on my team believes that and judging by informal conversations it is not believed elsewhere."
9,Jump Trading,Amazing Place,2022-01-28,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Anyone that gets the opportunity to work at Jump should jump at the opportunity. Smartest people in the world, amazing culture, founders/owners, and management team are some of the best people you will ever meet. Company is always two steps ahead of the industry. If you like learning, collaborating and winning, Jump is the place to be.","Nothing negative to say about Jump. Maybe a little unstructured for some people, but I think for most, the autonomy is a big positive."
10,Jump Trading,decent hft company but work is blah and growth has no structure or direction,2022-01-17,3.0,Senior Software Engineer,Jump is a good HFT firm if you want to be in that business. WFH has been good and perks are all standard everywhere.,The work is dull and meaningless. The firm has grown so big so fast that nobody seems to have an idea how they will be trained or what they will work on. It's a bee hive of activity but no direction. All the teams are competing with each other which also lends to strange dynamics.

16,Jump Trading,"Great company, high pressure but good rewards",2021-09-29,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Good company, fast moving, you learn so much here",Lots of pressure during down times
17,Jump Trading,Tech startup vibes + Research lab culture + Finance upside,2021-09-28,5.0,Quantitative Researcher,"Prior to Jump, I spent time at various finance/tech companies in roles ranging from backend software engineer to portfolio management to trading quant research. The culture at Jump is by far the best, and if the circumstances are right (more on this below), I will return without hesitation. The company is extremely aggressive and demanding when it comes to business and growth, while staying patient and accommodating when it comes to nurturing people and talent. There are almost no places I can think of where you will learn as much in as short of a period time, with as much of a ramp-up time as you need to learn the ropes, while having almost unlimited financial and career upside to boot.

I have personally seen one of the founders bend over backwards to accommodate an employee who had trouble fitting in with existing trading teams by naming that employee head of a new trading team; I have seen a team fail and reinvent itself multiple times while maintaining unwavering support from management to keep investing in people and technology; and I have seen people's careers absolutely skyrocket in just a few years after graduation from the amount of impact they are able to have from day one. This is a place where senior leadership wants you to succeed and grow the pie, and very importantly, where you will be recognized and rewarded for doing so.","I ultimately decided to leave because I wanted to take a chance and start my own company. While Jump can give you a point very far on the risk/reward curve, definitely far enough for most people, it can't quite provide the two-hackers-in-a-garage ride-or-die sort of deal that I (probably foolishly) wanted as a next step. Who knows--maybe I'll look back as a multi-billionaire and think that leaving was the best choice I could have made for myself. More likely, I'll come back as an older and wiser (and greyer) scholar of the markets, and with that entrepreneurial itch scratched, I'll ask for another chance."
18,Jump Trading,10/10,2021-09-20,5.0,Software Engineer,"Everything is great: compensation, work-life balance, extremely knowledgable & friendly co-workers",I can't think of any cons.
19,Jump Trading,Very Messy Place - Lots of Gossip,2021-09-20,1.0,AP Analyst,Unlimited sick days for all workers,"A very messy place to work and lots of backstabbing. Even from the COO - Matthew Schrecengost, there was a lot of unprofessional workplace behavior. An untrustworthy environment, so be careful before choosing to accept an offer from them. Maybe the worst decision that you could make. Stay with your current employer if you don't need a job immediately"
20,Jump Trading,My experience,2021-08-24,4.0,Analyst,"Competitive salary, flat and lean organization",Communication within teams can be improved
21,Jump Trading,"Very nice people, top tier comp, good WLB",2021-08-16,5.0,Software Engineer,"- People are very nice, the company genuinely cares about it's employees. I have had two managers during my time at Jump, and felt like both cared about my career ambitions, professional interests, and personal circumstances. This is a direct result of how well the owners, CEO, etc. treat people around them.
- Very good compensation. Don't need to focus on ""selling"" your impact like in big tech companies, as managers tend to me much more technical and this reflects in compensation if you do well.
- Good WLB in the sense that you get to pick your balance. Some firms in this industry are known for horrible WLB. As long as you do good work, you can work a very reasonable 40 hour week at Jump, or more if you want to rake in more money. Point being, it's your call.
- Some very, very talented people to learn from, Jump has some good teams with high performance C++ work, if that's your thing.
- Good COVID response.","- Very little to complain about, cutting edge work exists, but tech debt can be frustrating depending on your background."
22,Jump Trading,"Amazing company,",2021-07-16,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"The people that you will work with are both friendly and incredibly talented.

24,Jump Trading,"not a tech company, just a high frequency trading company",2021-06-16,2.0,Software Engineer,The money is fine and the hours are not bad but the work is dull and pointless. Yes there is a kitchen and office perks are not bad.,"The first thing to be clear about Jump is that it is not a tech company. It is a high frequency prop trading company. They can say it is a tech company and think that having office perks is what makes a tech company but it is not one. I worked in a tech company and things aren’t perfect but at least the work was more interesting and possibly of use. This high frequency trading is pointless.

It is 1000 people and has been around for 20 years so it is not a start up and has the bureaucracy and politics of any big company. Jump will claim it is without politics and everything is flat and open and it is not the case either. Saying that the company is a tech company and has no politics does not make it true."
25,Jump Trading,Good place. Lots to learn,2021-05-08,4.0,Recruiter,Great learning / collaboration / working culture,Not much to complain about

33,Jump Trading,growing pains,2021-02-13,3.0,Software Engineer,Jump does a good job of training people and exposing them to many things. Many very good talents around. Covid response is good.,It is not any longer a nimble or well managed company. Over time there has been much growth and hiring but no plan or reason for many things. All company have growth pain but this one doesn't know how to manage. Very political and a struggle if not on favorites team.

The quality of life is incredible; Jump is everything an employee could want in a company. If you have the talent to compete on the world stage, this is where you want to apply. These are not your everyday finance bros; these people are some of the smartest in the business and still treat one another with respect because--get this--it's built directly into the culture.

40,Jump Trading,A highly respected organization and brand,2020-07-23,4.0,Anonymous Employee,"- The firm's brand commands tremendous respect amongst competitors, brokers,exchanges and regulators. High standards in business conduct globally and always looks to set a higher bar. 
- When mistakes happen, culture is less of blaming and more of a ""lets understand what happened and make sure it doesn't happen again"". 
- Big spenders on technology investments
- Quantitative powerhouse in Futures
- Excellent pay
- Good regular communication from leadership to the entire global organization about what's happening
- Incredible investment in college recruiting and training programs.
- Hyper competitive drive to be #1 in the HFT industry.","- Has grown so much that making an impact is difficult. With the pie not growing as much, everyone's fighting for a larger piece of the pie, driving a political culture. 
- Weak in Equity Options and Equities (compared to Futures)
- Questionable performance review methodologies.
- So much back office ""fat"". Too many random roles and too little accountability. 
- Zero diversity in management."

Not too many lunch options around the Chicago office."
44,Jump Trading,Well run and consistently successful,2020-03-04,5.0,Software Engineer,"- Compensation and benefits are great.
- Feels more like a tech company than finance. Always interesting things going on, trying crazy new ideas and seeing what works out. Makes diverse bets in many different directions.
- Chicago office is improved dramatically after 6th floor expansion and Cafe/Barista addition.
- It's casual, it's not too formal or stifling. #thedailydog. Friday song. Shrec (CEO) is charismatic and knows everybody by name.
- Things always seem to be getting better, not worse.","- Jump isn't as agile as they think they are. TONNES OF TECH DEBT. A general fear of changes taking out production trading means that getting stuff fixed or improved is often slower than it should be.  Coredev somewhat dysfunctional.
- Not exactly a Meritocracy. Front office trading teams take the lions share of profits, though back office are working their butts off to make sure everything can run smoothly.
- Not much of a bigger picture. There appears to be no greater purpose to the work than profiting off the markets. Jump entices hundreds of incredibly smart people, who might otherwise be solving important issues in the real world, to just polish the P&L - for scientists and engineers, it's kind of an empty goal."

60,Jump Trading,Heavily invests into employees like there *is* tomorrow,2017-12-22,5.0,Working for One of the Trading Teams,"Jump invests in it's employees as if we all are going to stay with the company for decades. Which is what many of us plan to do, as long as one's trading team stays profitable.

Examples speak better than words:
 1. Almost any data set is available internally, and catered lunches and a lot of company-arranged  events make it so that different trading teams know each other and talk and cross-pollinate data, ideas and even technical tricks (the latter is very different from most Jump's competitors where different trading teams are secretive and don't share),
 2. Jump pays for all sorts of internal trainings (I took Advanced Python and one of big data classes, planning to take FPGA class next)
 3. I saw two teams dissolved for bad performance this year, however almost all of the former employees of those teams... ended up joining other more successful trading groups within the firm, internally","Structure is very flat, which could be viewed as a disadvantage. For example, if your idea of career growth is to have important-sounding job titles and promotions every other year... that's not going to happen! Instead, as you grow within the company you'll get to mentor junior colleagues and/or play with increasingly more sophisticated technical ""toys""."

It is an excellent place to be if you are motivated and want to work with really smart, dedicated people who are (mostly) not dicks. Without question this was the best place that I have worked, and I fear that it will remain so going forward. 

London office space is really nice. Lighting a bit of a problem, but workable.  

You need to know your stuff (which, if you get through the interview process, is quite likely) and be able to defend your position when you are right; I found admitting and owning it when wrong to be valued. 

You can expect people to do their jobs, do them well, and go the extra mile. 

The company seems generally quite willing to work with employees and (given you lay the groundwork with your target group) willing to move people into new roles after they have proven themselves. This is particularly true for people who have been with the firm a few years and shown skill and dedication to the job. It seems to be more true now than it was in the past. 

The London office is probably one of the best places to work on the planet. (And I'm leaving!)","Friday lunches will fatten you up. 

Chicago office space is a bit of a bunker (but I think a well designed one if you are interested in getting things done). 

Some people are a bit egotistical; most are not. Given the overall high skill/ego ratio, and the low number of dicks, this is probably a pro.

An individual's experience will be highly dependent on what group they join, particularly in the front office. 

Tough interview process."

91,Jump Trading,"Driven, Kind, and Extremely Successful",2014-11-13,5.0,Algorithmic Trader,"Jump operates on a flat management structure and team oriented basis.
