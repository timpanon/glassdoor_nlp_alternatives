You are going to be assigned to some impossible to achieve project, so badly managed from the beginning that is obviously due to fail, but even if you do all your best and manage to complete it, one day you will find yourself suddenly in a room with your line manager and someone from HR that you never spoke with before that will fire you, without even some warning before. The IT is very badly managed with a lot of issue and legacy procedure that stay there even they don't makes any sense.

- Good location near a number of travel and shop facilities.
- Great CEO. In fact amazing! 
- Good building as an office environment.","Summary:
""This is a thankless industry shut it and move on"". That's what has been aggressively put across to me constantly!! I've been taken into meetings for silly opinionated situations made into an issue when really and laughably NOT. IT management are getting their nickers in a twist unfairly and mischievously. If they mess up all is okay if we mess up = HR. Apparently WE have to fail in or order to succeed. WRONG! Lesson #1 ""If you fail to prepare then prepare to fail"". 

IT Management:
Ever since 2018 from July EUS Technology are horrifically impactful because of the degrading new IT Management and styles. FALSE advertisement,  Poor behaviour, Massive lack in technology knowledge, difficultly shocking with selective attitudes, no retaining mercy, no leader nor role model inspiration, undoubtedly rude and unhelpful unless someone is monitoring them, Petty accusations, blaming and siding cultures, Cover-ups, Singling and picking on people. Above all if you passionately and constructively disagree with them in order to do very good instead they'll disown you and make HR cleanup and deal with the dirty work as if you're in a movie of ""Gossip Girls"". Yes, that's us... to them... You could say ""Let them mess up"" but you'd be messing up with them, let that settle... The firm's defined and so called committed principles are exaggerated upon. 

How I feel:
Unfortunately I have never ever felt so Patronised, Mentally abused, Bullied, Forced, Upset in all my career and life itself. The word disappointed itself doesn't begin to describe. They discriminated and harassed me until I was out the door. I now see this as a favour rather than their actual intentions which I'll leave YOU to imagine... They're not short in money I can tell you that @Earth but most importantly if you're thinking of joining MAN Group then choose a boss don't choose a job. 

Your time is more valuable than theirs as honestly I don't recommend joining. IF you are really great at what you do then this is NOT a place for you most importantly. Whereas if you're not so great then depending on your thoughts of the above you've got a bit of learning curves ahead of you. Decide wisely and good luck dear professionals! Welcome if I've helped you dodge a bullet."
