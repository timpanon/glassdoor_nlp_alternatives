In team meetings, she would always come down on the male team members for their metrics even though our female counterparts had the same exact output.

196,Meta,Career-Changing Opportunity,2022-01-25,5.0,Project Manager,"• Meta is an incredible place to gain experience, work (and network!) with people who are at the top of their fields, and grow your own skill set—IF you invest the effort and time to make it happen. 
• Many employees have the chance to work with people from all over the world, in an environment that encourages different perspectives. 
• I never thought someone like me would belong at a company like this—but I feel welcomed and encouraged, and I'm grateful to have learned so much (personally and professionally) from my coworkers. Never would've believed I'd feel this way while starting remotely during COVID, either!
• Most managers at Meta really want to be managers; folks aren't promoted just because it's the next most logical step in their career. In my experience, this means most managers are supportive, want to see you succeed, and are invested in helping you grow your career, not just in furthering their own agenda.
• Comp & benefits are amazing. WHY DID MY GUIDANCE COUNSELORS IN HIGH SCHOOL AND COLLEGE NOT TELL ME ABOUT RSUs??? That is all. 
• Having Meta on your resumé will open doors in a way that name dropping few other companies would.
• The support Meta provided throughout COVID has been exceptional, with flexibility and leave options that have helped me deal with remote learning, childcare gaps, and more. I've repeatedly told friends how lucky I have been to have joined Meta just before the pandemic.","• There are high expectations. ""Move fast"" isn't just a value — it's a description of how we work. If you like rigid work structures and aligning to predefined goals without questioning or re-assessing them as you progress, you probably won't thrive in the Meta environment. 
• Because of this constant flux, it can be hard to take PTO or maintain a consistently good work/life balance. This honestly depends on your team and manager, as well as how good you are at prioritizing. (Hint: Get comfortable saying no.)
• Constant press leaks continue to threaten the previously ""open by default"" culture, complicating some teams' jobs (as they react to announcements vs. prepare for announcements)."

In the two years that I have been here I have learned more than what I have learned in my entire career. I have learned from how others process information and look things, their approach to solving problems, how they structure information and the flags they raise. I have been able to see 'in action' different perspective that have brought awareness and growth, personally and professionally. The people I work with, is the number one reason I am still, and will continue to work here. A second important factor is the flexibility and multiple options that employees are given for returning to work post-pandemic. We have the ability to request remote work and relocate. Every employee has the option to tailor their work schedules and adopt to suite their life styles. Fair and competitive compensation and benefits are secondary.","Every workplace has opportunities for growth and while not everything is perfect at Meta, no one has said that we have stopped growing. The constant changes indicate the pains of growth and bring hope that things are being looked at and that feedback from employees is being applied.

The company culture is so supportive and empowering, and it's so refreshing to be treated like an adult. From Day 1 you're assumed  to be good at your job (as opposed to most at companies where you spend years trying to prove yourself) and your opinions are genuinely valued. It's a great place to grow and learn, and determine  your own career trajectory.","There is a lot to learn and get acclimated to when you first start. But there are so many resources and trainings that you're not left to your own devices.

Disappointed in the name change. In theory the general public know FB became Meta but they don't seem to make the connection when you say you work at Meta and it's not as impressive. I know this sounds entitled,  but I'm in recruitment and the FB name had much more sway with passive candidates."

Diversity & Inclusion: They are struggling in this arena like the rest of the tech industry. Many teams & leaders are trying to push this forward across recruiting & different functions in the business. As much as we improve the numbers, there isn't much movement higher than the VP level, and we're losing as many folks as we're bringing in.

People tend to guard their tiny piece of the pie zealously. Be prepared for a zillion stakeholders on everything. Executives regularly drop 11th hour feedback bombs. 

Particularly on the marketing team, strategic shifts happened every 6 months like clockwork. By the time we implemented one strategy, higher ups had already moved onto the next one. Hard to actually apply any learnings.

It is apparent that there is no management support for this role in any form. The role was created in an attempt to fool regulators and stockholders into thinking that things are changing at facebook. The mission of facebook is to misuse private data and the role is an attempt to distract the public from that fact. I am an h1b, much like most facebook employees, and i am threatened with being booted from the program whenever i attempt to protect customer data from being exposed. If anyone from management is reading this i sincerely believe facebook is the proverbial boulder rolling down a hill with too much momentum to stop the downward slide.

Coverage for leaves falls on existing team with little to no empathy or support.  You're expected to just make it work and figure it out. There are no tradeoffs or prioritization with goals. Because nothing drops off the laundry list of priorities, few things actually get accomplished and the cycle repeats year after year. Meta is turning into a corporate behemoth that's too insular to accept and act on feedback from users, employees, etc...

338,Meta,Perks are great but atmosphere and management is toxic,2021-11-18,1.0,Digital Marketing Manager,"I worked for Facebook for 3 1/2 years. The perks are amazing, free food, free healthcare and the resources you have are the best.","Being a white male with a African American wife.....during my time at Facebook I was called racist, insensitive and bias. It was frustrating to go home and tell my wife instances at Facebook and then get her opinion saying I said or did nothing wrong. Over and over again I was looked at as the enemy when I had no intention of hurting anyone. 

Being a white male at Facebook you are looked at as the problem and reason that is bringing a certain race or ethnicity down. During my bi annual review I was told by my Asian manager to work on toning down ""Your White privilege"" during meetings. Excuse me? If my wife had a manager that asked or accused her of taking advantage of the fact she's black there would be lawsuit. 

I am not a racist, I or my parents, grandparents or great grandparents have never enslaved anyone. In my eyes everyone is the same and deserves a fair shot, but at the end of the day all white people are not bad and allowing people to blatantly accuse you of being racist without repercussion is what Facebook 100% supports and at times promotes though the classes you have to take as a employee.

Facebook has a policy that someone of color should be interviewed for every position, which is fine but I witnessed several times Asian and African American managers completely ignore someone who was white and more qualified and gave the job to someone of their own ethnicity. Out of the 10 times I saw that happen, 7 of those people were eventually fired cause they just couldn't do the job.

In summary, this attitude that white people are the root reason why every other ethnicity experiences problems is just flat out sad. Then it is taught and supported by companies like Facebook, which only separates us further. Out of any group there are bad apples, but that is no reason to come up with a blanket opinion and then teach that from generation to generation, that is the exact opposite of progression and being united.

A direct quote from my father in law (Who is black) ""Above being just black, more importantly I am an American, where you can make anything of yourself if you stop coming up with excuses and just get to work, white people are not the problem and we need to stop teaching our kids that they are""."

- From the git-go, there wasn't even honesty about the job description, or even title, during the job interview. On my second day I learned that the position had a different name and dept than what I had been told. 
- There was absolutely no training for a highly complex role. We were just told to read the wikis. Except that a lot of things didn't exist in the wikis and you just had to go at it and hope it worked, and that any mistakes wouldn't set your projects back too much. 
- Despite the above, there was absolutely no leniency for taking a bit longer on your first projects. You were held to the same timelines as other team members that had been there months or years. 
- You were also held to the same timelines despite rapid changes being implemented to the system that caused weeks-long delays (e.g. longer review processes.) Somehow you were just supposed to compensate for them. 
- Expectations were not made clear at all - you didn't know you were failing at something until you were being told you could loose your job. 
- Rabid management that provided no support to you. The only purpose of my weekly meeting with my team lead was to be reminded that I could loose my job if I didn't produce enough. The manager would routinely flip out during team meetings and put a team members' position in question - in front of the entire team - for the smallest of mistakes. 
It was one of the most hostile work environments I've ever experienced. I literally ended up coaching multiple team members on how they too could leave their roles during my last week."

Facebook’s cafeteria provides employees gourmet meals to indulge. Are you ready to fill your stomach with incredible delicacies such as roasted chicken with garlic lemon butter, beef surgo with pappardelle pasta, and spicy mushroom broth?

The Disneyland-like Main Street
When you’re not in the mood for gourmet, your destination is Main Street. Here, you’ll find outlets and food trucks that serve burgers, ice cream, Tex-Mex, and barbecue. You could experience the cozy ambiance and nice features when you hang out with colleagues.

Almost Everything is FREE
The company provides incredible employment benefits such as healthcare services (medical and dental), laundry service, salon, bike repair hub, company shuttle, and twenty-one paid days off. It includes generous parental leave, by-popular-demand-to-expand gym, and a bank.

Creative Distraction
If an employee needs time for a creative and fun distraction, the company has a woodworking workshop, and a print shop for them to extract their creative juices.

Facebook encourages you to be yourself. Ironically, the company designed the office as a no-wall workspace policy, which you may find uncomfortable and lacking privacy.

Buffet-at-Work
The open workspace provides picnic-style tables, where you can sit shoulder-to-shoulder, with limited space, and gives no privacy. You will be rubbing elbows with colleagues… literally!

The Facebook Employee Stereotype
Most people expect Facebook employees to know everything on the site. You may still receive questions and hear complaints from people even outside the workplace.

Executives Who Discriminate
An anonymous former Facebook employee claimed he had his worst working experience in the company. He said higher-ups treats him like trash, gives him minimal guidance, and hands him inappropriate tasks such as sorting the director’s laundry.

The “Holier-Than-Thou” Attitude
One source complains that CEO and Facebook founder, Mark Zuckerberg and COO, Sheryl Sandberg are both self-righteous. He claims they spend too much time on “extracurricular activities.” The said source also accused the two of copying-off competition; for instance, the poke that resembles the one on Snapchat"

First off, everyone is nice here! Yes, folks are ambitious, but there is a shockingly small percentage of jerks here… not sure exactly how they are weeded out, but I’m grateful for it!

Lots of small benefits and well-run systems give the overwhelming feeling that this company just generally has its sh*t together. Shuttles, good food, good internal chat and groups system, not too many meetings or emails (much better than other companies!), great tech stack and automation, etc etc. 

Pretty good transparency and communication with leadership (e.g., weekly CEO/CTO Q&As). They are open to feedback and change when needed, without too much unnecessary reorg-ing and pivoting. Good examples recently are moving to annual performance reviews after years of complaints with 6-month cycle, decoupling Oculus and FB accounts, and killing facial recognition. 

Comp is fantastic, and relatively standardized within levels. Engineers don’t have different titles between levels, we’re all just software engineers. This was weird at first, but is a really cool feature that discourages dumb hierarchies. 

Work life balance is totally reasonable in my experience, but might be different on other teams. 

Mark is great, I don’t really understand why folks dislike him externally.","Some risk with new company direction. The metaverse shift is gutsy. It seems like a reasonable move, but if it doesn’t pan out, Meta might not be the same tech giant in 10-15 years. 

Like any big company, it has its share of internal koolaid/propaganda (but criticism/feedback is still welcomed and discussed openly)

Should I start with the horrible recruitmentli/team placement mistake that caused major setback after setback. Yes, they put me on the type of team that they swore they never would. The really bad manager accountability, who prefers to be more of a boss vs. a leader. Or could I address some of the most ruthless and two-faced narcisstic coworkers with the most severe case of unconscious bias and fat egos you will ever encounter? Or is it really their fault or the company culture that made them that way? 

Its kind of like Squid games, but then you remember that the people you work with don't actually come from the most desperate lives who need to be fighting for their lives, just people with severe personality disorders/power trip and ego issues.

- Virtually infinite learning opportunities. There is always some new technology to learn. You will never be bored.
- Compensation is excellent. There are few places that would pay an engineer more.
- Perks are amazing. And I haven't even tried the free food yet. (We're still working from home.)
- Fast paced.
- Engineers have extremely high autonomy. Engineers usually decide for themselves what projects to work on.
- Employees are very optimistic and regard most problems to be solve-able. We are always trying to innovate and improve.
- The middle-managers are some of the best I've ever seen at any company. They respect people and seem to really care about their well-being and career goals.","- Expectations are very high. You have to be strategic about how you spend your time because there are so many expectations that it's hard to satisfy them all if you just do random work without thinking about how it matches the expectations list. This is kind of an annoying cognitive burden to constantly deal with because no one will directly tell you what to do. (See the point about autonomy, above.)
- If you like to be methodical or process-oriented, it can be frustrating at times because Facebook is the opposite of that. Most activities are ad-hoc and documentation is usually terrible or non-existent. Tools and infrastructure randomly break and you frequently have to troubleshoot them yourself.
- Software reliability is not the best, which means you frequently will be pulled into putting out some fire or preventing a crisis, rather than working on the thing you would prefer to work on."

• Autonomy. Fb gives employees the freedom to make impact with very few (if any) bureaucratic guardrails. They trust their employees to make impact, so if I feel passionate about something I do it -- instead of first having to ask permission like I've been used to. 

• Diversity & Inclusion. FB doesn't just talk about the importance of DEI, they put the resources in place to actually make it happen. They have clear goals for the company to achieve diversity across the board (including within Leadership) and the provide proactive updates for how we're tracking. 

• Perks. The legends are true, but after more than a year still finding out about new benefits. Wellness award is my favorite and can be used to reimburse expenses for whatever helps you recover -- whether it's Spa Days, Ski Trips, or even an Apple Watch for tracking fitness.

• Career Growth. With the hyper growth opportunities for professional growth are abundant. 

• Too many others to include, but wanted to highlight some of the things beyond the normal 'glitz' you hear about (#Freefood #FacebookForty)","• Fast-paced, constant changes. While I personally love this about FB, I recognize there's a 'comfort' in knowing how your systems will operate day-to-day / week-to-week.

- Compensation is hard to beat
- Really good free food in office
- Cool offices with fun amenities
- Vast majority of people are very empathetic and smart
- Ability to change teams fairly easily","- Super toxic high achiever culture (there tends to be an attitude of ""Facebook isn't for everyone"" if you don't meet the absurdly high and intentionally ambiguous standards, even if it was for reasons outside your control)
- So much saying one thing but literally everything pointing the opposite direction (e.g. ""we're a strengths based company! just focus on your strengths!"" but performance evaluations are designed to evaluate uniformly and will hyper-focus onto the smallest weakness while ignoring strengths that balance it out)
- Facebook's idea of diversity is only skin deep (i.e. race and gender). They completely turn a blind eye to other forms of diversity like disabilities, neurodiversity, age, culture, etc when it means that any action needs to be done to address unfairness and implicit bias.
- Expectation to promote within specific timelines until E5 but the timelines are fairly short and don't take into account different learning speeds
- The higher level software engineer you are, the less you get to code and the more you're expected to project manage. Honestly I'm not sure why Facebook bothers to hire PMs if they just force engineers to project manage anyway.
- Performance evaluation system was designed to be as ""fair"" as possible by evaluating against uniform standards, which ironically makes it extremely unfair if you don't conform to the average, even if your coworkers and manager chain think you're delivering impact and providing unique value that would be hard to replace
- Talks a big game about work/life balance but there really isn't much because of how much it invades into your personal life
- Your success is almost entirely based on your manager because that's how it was designed. If you have a bad manager, you're SOL and your only options are switching teams or dealing with it. It's also common to have many manager changes and it's not that unusual if they only stick around for a half, leave, and then you're ""managed"" by an overwhelmed skip who probably won't be able to represent you accurately at performance reviews or make much time for you.
- So many damn re-orgs and it scrambles everyone except directors so much but they don't care because that's their impact for the half"

I was never asked if the re-org that would change my job function was something I wanted, and there was no support for this constant change. The first re-org came 3 weeks after I was hired. I once voiced my concerns about the new job function not aligning with my strengths and was told I was lucky to work at Facebook.

This feels constraining especially if you're a higher level IC who's trying to get promoted and grow your career. 
 - Micromangement has grown within the past year. Management is constantly watching for techs not supporting users and they will reach out to see what you're doing with your time. 
 - The org has adopted a call center mentality and techs now have to hit a monthly quota to avoid management review.

1054,Meta,Publicity skills are more important than Engineering,2021-03-12,2.0,Data Engineer,"Great pay, perks, benefits and cool offices. Friendly people (at least on the surface)","What I find most annoying and frustrating (found other IC4 or 3 DEs also share the same frustration) are: 
1 - The role: Like someone else mentioned I can’t see why we have ‘engineer’ in our title. It’s like 80% of your day goes about project management, expectation management, navigating team and product priorities, finding work for yourself and just what you need to do next. Then keeping others and yourself updated about what’s going on. When you can get a break from constant meetings and notifications and pings in chat then you can get some work done (Hello overtime). Also put aside time for advertising yourself, writing posts about what great things you are going to do, doing now, and have already done. Add a ton of stress on top of that for delivering IMPACT and constantly wondering if what you are doing is going to create enough noise to get you somewhere.
2 - Lack of well defined projects: you have to put in so much time and energy just to find something to work on. It’s like a manager decides they need some more headcount on their the team and hire the person and then tell them I don’t know what you need to do but there’s something out there for sure, go find out! Good for you if you can find or define a new impactful project, otherwise take on someone else’s work which they abandoned for something with more IMPACT or start working on some product that’s not going anywhere but some vp cares about.

Other things to consider: 
- The role : Data Engineers at FB are in a tough position. Usually noone in other roles really know what you are supposed to do, even DEs themselves will have a bootcamp course to tell them what they are supposed to do. As such you are always in the position of pushing back on requests, trying to define what you should do, or seeking to do the job someone else is already doing but in a better way. If you fail to push back you’ll be flooded with meaningless work (adhoc requests).

Other cons:
- Lack of Knowledge sharing and documentation: A piece of info you seek could be in a post on workplace, stored on some random quip, a file on dropbox, a sheet on google drive, or some random wiki page. And when you find it you can never trust what you see because it is possibly wrong or already outdated. Better to directly ask someone and hope they have the correct answer to your question. Enjoy waiting for responses or not finding any available time on their calendar to book a meeting.

-Moving Fast= Tons of junk: Moving fast to deliver short term impact has plagued the analytics org with tons of garbage. Noone cares about optimizing their solutions or documenting their work, and when they get credit for the IMPACT they move on to the next thing. Good luck if you inherit someone’s work which you need to make sense of on your own."

Lies are horrible. Facebook taught all wrong lessons in life: for example, everything the upper management says should be interpreted as the opposite. 

There is a stack ranking, where 10-18 percent of employees are slated to not meet expectations at the review cycle. Facebook officially denies doing this, however it is in every management training and most managers are admitting it. It is in management tooling! 18% - it's like triple the Amazon's.

* Many things to fix at FB, so you will be easily distracted and can put risks on achieving impacts on your primary goals for the half
* While in-house tools are great from a ""please fix it"" approach, it's also usually come at the cost of usability and stability. We really could use more help in making tooling accessible and useful
* Impacts is go big or go home. Everyone is obsessed and measured by impacts. This could be cpu win or engagement metric move or power reduction or productivity.

With all the ""effort"" going into mass hiring of BIPOC, there is little to no consideration for how to retain. There is constant censorship on the intra-Workplace conversations, discrimination during PSC, and worst the silent exiting of employees that frame BIPOCs to be resigning. All the hush money they offer exiting employees help keep up the facade
- With such rapid growth, inept individual contributors were forced into management positions and now they spend all their time trying to keep their friends at the top and everyone else in desperation to advance. This also means there are far too many bad managers 
- HR is a hot mess of incompetence whether it was related to PSC, career growth, everyday issues

Lots of interesting product development happening consistently.","Productivity suite is chaotic / not standardized across teams (takes a lot of time managing personal comms), sometimes it can feel TOO people oriented (very surprising what can be said to managers and Zuck himself that is honestly flat out disrespectful but tolerated...also, lots of entitlement - particularly at lower levels that can make managing teams/talent tiresome). For mid-career professionals (L5-L6 in particular), advancement is tougher as the company gets bigger/evolves; seems like there are more growth opportunities for junior levels (in terms of promo: L2/L3) and senior levels (in terms of new areas of learning/expansion: L8/D1+). For SOME people, the high ambiguity, fast pace, and 99% self-determination of one's career will not fit their personal preferences. For me personally, it works well. But I have friends at the company who are quite frustrated/unhappy due to the lack of tops-down order and seemingly chaotic shifting of priorities and strategies.

- Metrics driven culture
- Global impact
- Lots of teams to choose from","- Terrible WLB: This depends on the team but generally FB hires less people per product compared to peers, so the amount of work is always high for PMs. Privacy, compliance, integrity, policy and similar regulatory stuff, albeit much needed, has added a ton of work, but the expectation of shipping fast is still there. Which means no WLB. Many 15+ hour days in a month are common.
- Low growth: Hard to become a people manager in this company unless you’re really lucky.
- Leveling is a total mystery. People who advance are usually those whose managers are willing to give them a great review at any cost.
- Middle management is filled with old timers who've never worked anywhere else, or some people who probably got in because they knew someone. Decision making is horrible leading to a lot of teams with tons of churn and low morale.
- No patience to build lasting products. Projects that need nurturing are shelved and the only ones that continue are those that Zuck personally cares about. You have 6 months to show massive progress, or else your product is done. 
- Reorgs are as common as oxygen at FB. This causes a ton of headache to have to re-start every so often.

FB fosters quite a friendly culture. At least, on the level of engineers. Semiannual reviews partially evaluate how good your relationships with the colleagues.

FB is very good at employee retention. Management will try hard to find interesting projects for you. Lots of projects that may bring a great impact. Quite unique projects at scale. 

Lots of pocket communities with interesting activities.

Good compensation.","Lots of big politics around the company. There is always pressure from the government, society, the media, and even from own employees represented by a vocal left-leaning group. You will also get the part of this pressure as an employee. 

Noisy environment. Sometimes it's good to have people around, but often you'll find yourself distracted. The company likes open spaces, MPK 20 is a living nightmare, though MPK 21 was designed better.

No digital nomad options, except big work-from-home mode right now.

Code quality is diverse. Some open-source libraries/frameworks are brilliant. Check folly or react. The non-public part totally depends on the team.

Creative teams across the company are very white, and mostly male. While I'm excited to see more roles open up in Facebook for creatives, I worry that it affords teams and management opportunities to hire more white people. Instead of bringing in someone with a different experience that is talented and deserving of an opportunity. Sadly, I've seen BIPOC candidates get shortlisted, only to not make the cut for arbitrary reasons. 'Not a good fit' is a poor reason for someone who spent the time interviewing with us with a stella portfolio. I worry that teams are only bringing in certain candidates to meet some sort of quota or to appear ""exhaustive"" in their search, just so that they can hire another white person. I'm tried of observing these performative acts of diversity from creative leaders across teams and hope that this changes. We can do better, we should do better."

The company is very unprofessional in its working style where there is little teamwork and many people who try to dump the hard work on you while they chase revenue gains for the review cycle. There is no real career progression and management will do musical chairs and swap your role. I only got to do what I thought I was hired for 18 months. 
The senior management are very disingenuous when it comes to being neutral in politics and supporting BLM. They keep leaning to support Trump but then acting shocked when the company gets caled out for it."

The ""don't talk to me unless you've got a prototype in hand"" culture can feel like it's stifling ideas (even though it's a very reasonable reaction against pie-in-the-sky proposals). Proper architecture and code quality can be big problems.

There's a strong emphasis on social networking as a means of getting things done. For introverts this can be unduly difficult, and even for extroverts it can come across as a triumph of personality and schmoozing over sound engineering principles. There is a strong emphasis on trying to fabricate relationships in order to have impact, which can feel extremely deceitful."

- Developer and process tooling is all custom and buggy resulting in a lot of externa workarounds
- Internal training is low quality and external training is the same budget as swag. There is no tuition reimbursement
- The company says to be your authentic self, but if you don't drink the Kool-aid you're going to have a bad time
- The company is driven by semi-annual performance reviews that create perverse incentives which emphasize impact over quality and short term over long term goals.
- There are too many meetings and most are run inefficiently
- The company uses Workplace (Facebook for work) for internal communications which, like Facebook, has a low signal to noise ratio unless you ignore most things

1597,Meta,Extensive Support and Brilliant Coworkers,2020-09-28,5.0,Research Scientist,"One of the biggest perks is working with some of the most intelligent, thoughtful and honest coworkers anywhere in the world. No matter how big of a fish you have been in previous ponds, you will be a small fish here and have incredible space to grow. There is incredible freedom to pursue the projects you want in the way that you want as long as you can defend why they are important to the company. While less than it was in the past, there is incredible transparency and accountability from leadership internally. Your manager will support and promote you in a way that is unprecedented at most other companies. Most importantly, the work you do affects millions or billions of people - even seemingly tiny tasks like making the app update 1 second faster or tweaking a model to deliver 1% more interesting content can have a large positive impact on the world. While it doesn't always succeed, the company takes diversity and social justice seriously and it shows in project initiatives and hiring.","It's a big company with entrenched (if sometimes informal) power structures. As much as people try to be transparent, there are backdoor politics that affect your role and career that you might not learn about until much later, if ever. There will be constant pressure to specialize - many of the new skills I've developed here would transfer well to other big tech companies, but be wasted at a startup. Work life balance can go sideways quickly unless you protect yourself zealously. Even in the ""move fast (and we no longer say 'break things')"" culture there is a lot of pressure to not mess up in ways that affect the public negatively - even small mistakes in privacy or integrity have terrible negative effects on potentially millions of people."

People you are helping are all very nice and friendly. 
Salary, benefits, and perks are incredibly generous. Facebook employees will complain about things that most employees elsewhere couldn't dream of getting.","Work can sometimes be monotonous, a lot of people have the same issues.

In addition to your work helping others, you are given projects each half to work on- which sometimes feels like you have two jobs (Support Techs are hourly and while overtime is allowed, you sometimes feel you don't have enough time)

Watch the episode of the Simpsons where Homer goes to work for Hank Scorpio. Sometimes it feels a bit like that- would you be comfortable working there?

(Working remotely, you also miss out on the social elements of working in an office... this is not Facebook's fault but due to COVID-19)"

Our experience shows us that new uses of interactive technologies have the capacity to expand and strengthen relationships. We continue to make progress engaging the expanding population that lives online, through social media and the increased use of mobile audio and video conferencing technologies. Today’s collaborative tools deliver tailored content and messaging that is available and accessible to Department employees, and shareable to members of the public and foreign audiences.","he Department produces and stores vast amounts of knowledge and data every day. Managing these elements requires centralized knowledge repositories and standard data elements to reduce duplication, facilitate sharing, improve accessibility, and automate workflows among bureaus and offices. Not only will these repositories serve as a portal to shared knowledge, they will expedite our ability to reduce the number of paper-based processes and records. Improving knowledge management will increase our capacity to enable faster retrieval and more accurate results."

At other tech companies, you're a cog in the wheel. At Facebook, you really do have the opportunity to build out the next wave of ideas, strategy, and product.

Facebook has plenty of growth opportunities as the company is still growing, despite the pandemic. New products are being launches every day and each day is a new adventure.","Sometimes leadership makes controversial decisions that the company may not agree with, however they host weekly Q&As with full transparency around their thought process behind the decision, and are open to criticism and feedback.

There is also a drastic lack of diversity in leadership, everyone above me was a white guy, and they all thought very highly of themselves. 

Facebook is not a good place to work if you're a parent, there was no empathy for having to take time to deal with kid things during COVID when my partner and I were both working full time. My manager stated that Facebook might not be a great place for me as a parent. I was also penalized for taking time to pump.

1651,Meta,Big Tech company that's still learning what that means,2020-09-07,4.0,Software Engineer,"- The engineering culture is still very bottom-up: teams generally have a lot of power and responsibility to determine what they work on.
- Internal developer tools are a huge focus. Anything which slows developers down is fixed if possible.
- Very good internal mobility: bootcamp means you have a good deal of leeway in finding a team, and, after a year internal mobility is encouraged.
- Tons of opportunities to make millions of peoples' lives just a little bit better. Like it or not, Facebook's products are used by over a billion people worldwide. There are few places where improvements and fixes can have such a broad reach.
- Lots of intellectual challenges: There are many types of challenges in building products for billions of people: technical (scaling and perf), product (how do you make it useful for everyone), regulatory (how to not fall afoul of privacy regulations), security (how to minimize badness that happens due to the products), and more.","The biggest challenge facing Facebook right now is that it is simultaneously too big to run the way it runs now (with teams trying to fight for impact and all hacking on the same products), and too small to fit with the well-intentioned goals that Mark has for all of the ways that Facebook can help people.

A company without any strong sense of unifying purpose tends toward bloat and stagnation. It feels like this is the direction Facebook is heading. The amount of infighting between teams around responsibility and ownership of new features is growing and will only keep accelerating."

1656,Meta,Amazing,2020-09-03,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"- Leadership is phenomenal. They truly care about people and have an incredibly strong ethos and value system. 
- The candor and openness of culture (which can be con in trying times - see note below)
- Caliber of talent. I have truly never worked at a company where there is such a high minimum bar for both competence and kindness.","Given Facebook's historical ""move fast"" and autonomous culture, there are a lot of byproducts that make it more difficult to work here than you would expect at this size of company:
- Disparate tooling ecosystem and preference for homegrown tools over enterprise tools (which has lots of positives, but in many regards it means reinventing the wheel and bugs)
- Siloed teams working on similar things, but not knowing of or talking to each other

The other main con is information overwhelm. As a social media company, Facebook is in a unique position to influence and have a stake in social issues that have global impact. For better or worse, that means divisive opinions in the world coexist and are surfaced within the walls of the company and all over our internal workplace. It's hard not to get caught up in this and ""focus on work"" when a lot of what's been surfaced is so deeply engrained in what our product does and/or how our culture should be."

Excellent health insurance 
Solid name recognition for future jobs
Top notch perks","Leadership moves from crisis to crisis to crisis. The attention focus is relatively short on the hot issue of the moment and that trickles down to every org. You can be working on the number 1 goal or project from Jan - June and knock it out of the park. Then by July everyone's attention has shifted and your work is no longer relevant. A lot of institutional knowledge is lost this way. 

The company skews young as well, so there are a lot of inexperienced people who want to make their mark/get their promotions and they work hard but don't get the guidance that would help them work smarter. The result is that some teams take ""done is better than perfect"" and ""ask for forgiveness rather than permission"" to another level, which can make work tedious. Almost everyone comes from elite schools and has great stats so some really lean in extra hard into making themselves stand out, sometimes in ways that aren't the most useful or healthy. 

There's also a hierarchy Technical people on top, then Business people (cause they make the money) then lawyers then everyone else. People in ops often are at the bottom of the totem pole.

Free food is just the beginning. Probably the most underrated perk is a free cell phone with international data roaming.

Promotions come quick to top performers, who are lavished with ""refresher"" or ""additional"" equity awards.","Exhausting performance review process. It feels neverending. Performance ratings are a bit too formulaic, and thus can be gamed to an extent; the system undervalues certain types of work (for example long-term, risky projects) that other companies would find valuable.

Corporate shuttles are reliable and the route network covers a huge amount of the Bay Area and then some (there's even several daily shuttles to Santa Cruz) -- but the seats are often too narrow and uncomfortable.

1899,Meta,Horrible terrible company with worst culture,2020-03-23,1.0,Software Engineer,"Free food, good salary, hype","At Facebook I got to know what ""gaslighting"" really means. Gaslighting is exactly what is the culture that is imposed top-down by management. It starts at the bootcamp. There, you'll be properly brainwashed how cute and cuddly Facebook is, how unfairly it is being treated by everybody, how great and kind the Czar and his ruling gang is, and how grateful and privileged you (a despicable useless worm) should feel to be here! Right there, in the bootcamp, they will start the abusive treatment by telling you ""why on Earth did we hire you? You do not submit any code during last 24 hours!"" This abuse and fostering of your impostor syndrome will keep going on. Typical Facebook-style management is when you are being repeatedly told ""I have no idea how did you got here, and if how come you were not fired yesterday - but OK, we'll give you one more chance"".  This is part of this culture! 
There is a STACK RANKING! It's in tooling, in manager training materials! The fact that Facebook officially denies doing it is a yet-another confirmation that this company doesn't shy away from crime. Stack ranking means that all colleagues see each other as a competition. When I started my job at Facebook, my closest colleague didn't want to talk to me, because he knew that the better I succeed, the worse is for him. This is very profound and affects everybody: it's a hostile work environment. 
Performance reviews is a complete sham. There is one ""axis"" which is related to your actual performance. The other 3 (three!) axes (direction, etc.) is a complete baloney, and can be used to justify ANY rating for anyone. All managers are deeply ignorant schmoozers. 

Cult means there are plenty of taboo topics for which you'll be fired. There are, for example, internal ""non-managers"" groups, which are patrolled for any signs of dissent. If a person posts anything out of line there, this gets straight to his manager and HR. 
HR is the worst people I've met. They enforce the authoritarian rule ruthlessly and with cynicism. 

Working at Facebook has permanently damaged my faith in humanity. I realized that people can still do horrible crimes, given enough brainwashing. That people can treat each other like animals, given stack ranking.  I wish I never joined this scam of a company, a lousy swamp filled with ghosts who pretend to be humans!"

We get the opportunity to work on very impactful projects.  In our area we support the efficient and accurate payment of many billions of dollars per year.  It's a great responsibility.

One of the great things I love is being able to work on software engineering projects in Austin for Facebook.  While they don't officially allow software engineers in Austin at Facebook, Enterprise Engineering work is super close to the work I did previously as a software engineer at Facebook in Seattle.

The growth in Austin for Enterprise Engineering is also a great opportunity for me and my team - we get to be the ones determining the work culture here for engineering.","Ramping up within the domain takes some time.  I wasn't immediately knowledgeable about things like the general ledger, period close, accruals, balance sheets and the like.  While these may not be the most interesting topics, I do enjoying how my work reduces the tedium involved and makes sure the Facebook business runs smoothly.

- More flexibility with office locations than traditional SWE roles (e.g. there's EE teams in Austin but no SWE teams)
- Hard to imagine a better place to learn and grow as an engineer
- A lot of EE teams are continuously finishing projects and beginning new ones, so you can have a lot more variety in what you're working on (which makes it much easier in my opinion to choose projects which you find interesting or you want to learn more about)","- Hard to switch from EE teams to SWE teams (requires re-interviewing) if you're in one of the big Engineering offices
- Since traditional EE roles dealt more with things like Oracle development, you can get the feeling that EE is looked down on by SWE orgs.  I think this is changing quickly as the role evolves and people realize the complex problems EE's are solving, but we're not there yet in terms of having the same 'prestige' as SWEs
- Deadlines can be tight depending on business needs

Employees are technically assessed on many aspects of performance, but the only one my manager focused on was lines of code.
- Competitive culture: Constantly talking about PSCs meant everyone on the team was afraid of any appearance that they did something wrong, which created a culture of blaming others and never admitting mistakes. Managers either stayed out of it or made it worse.
- Workload: My tech lead set deadlines that were too aggressive and didn’t listen when my teammates and I pushed back, so we were constantly behind schedule. Working late at night and on the weekends consistently was required just to remain a few months behind schedule.
- Asking for Help: Several members of my team had to ask for help writing code many times per day. Most of their questions could be quickly solved by typing a few words into a search bar and looking at the first result, but they still asked another engineer any time they encountered something they didn’t already know how to do. They would intentionally not ask managers and avoid asking for help while managers were within earshot."

1956,Meta,Good and the Bad. It really depends on your team,2020-01-30,3.0,Product Marketing,"Facebook has a lot of Pro's but it really depends on the team you land on and the internal politics that surround that particular unit. That is no different than any other company but it can be night and day here.

Generally here are the Pros
- People: Majority of the other Facebookers are of high quality and surrounding yourself with other smart people can only up your own game.

- Benefits: Positive package here overall. They take care of your health, make some life task much easier and try to make life more comfortable.

- Technology: Innovative mindset is a big plus but recent years have been more mirror moves with competition to gain an advantage. Good move but for those that want to break the glass into new frontiers, you got to pick the right team.

Impact: The opportunity is there for you to embrace.","Generally here are the Cons:
- People / Culture: There is a small minority of leftist that can be loud and push activist agenda's that are in your face. While my own goals can align (leftist) I don't like their approach. This is just society creeping into the corporate world and is seen across Tech in general. It can be toxic and extremely disrespectful. You might find more of this at Facebook due to the nature of the product. Imagine the rest... Pick your team wisely.

- Weak Leadership: Lot of new leaders... Experienced leaders may not have much experience with trouble shooting negative situations and come in with a bias. Another point here is the number of Re-Orgs. You might experience multiple changes within a quarter / half and this can drag on for years.  

- Negative news cycle ... it can be draining but it should be a wake up call to further innovate for a product for today. However... this news cycle is long... I mean looooooong and can be intense at times."

You have all you can imagine, access to shuttles, on-site dentist, paid laundry services, sweet shop. The tools, infrastructure and stack let's you be very productive. For instance, setting up a website where someone can input data on a form and storing the data in a DB takes minutes. 

An experience at this company will open many many doors for you, it will be much easier to get phone interviews. You will also learn a lot.","The culture is pretty bad and the performance review system is a joke. 

Unless you abide 100% by their culture, you can't be happy. This means you are not allowed to even question their principles. If you think something needs to be fixed at the root cause, you are in trouble, because you need to Move Fast! The company over-focuses on the short term speed rather than long term. 

I was lied to multiple time by management. I was told my rating depended on the reviews from my peers, but then when the perf came, I realized it is 100% up to the manager regardless of what your peers say. My manager told me constantly I was doing great, then perf came and because I questioned the principles, I had a bad rating. The 360 was useless, management can use if they want to promote you, but if you are not in great terms with your manager, the 360 will be ignored. 

I was also told multiple times, the company is impact-based and that what matters is impact. After working on a project with another manager, I was told I could not get any credit, since it was not 100% my idea."

However, this creates ample opportunity to improve by leveraging the expertise of talented hires."
1967,Meta,Excellent Place to Work,2020-01-10,5.0,Production Engineer,"The opportunity that Facebook offers for autonomy and career growth is incredible; coming in as a new grad PE I have the opportunity to grow based on merit and performance, not time in the role. 

Flexibility in when I work, how I prioritize my projects, and the scope of my work is invigorating and makes me excited to come to work each day. The company is mission-driven to a great extent, and I have been impressed with the way we have owned up to prior mistakes and fixed them head on. 

The Production Engineering role is well respected within the company, and the importance of reliability and scaling increases as our services reach more of the world. As a PE you will gain the knowledge necessary to build and operate real hyperscale systems capable of providing services to billions of people.

My team is comprised of some of the smartest, experienced engineers I have ever met - some of which have been building Linux services since 0.01. Even though sometimes working at Facebook feels like drinking from the proverbial fire hose, I am grateful I have the opportunity to learn from some of the top people in their field. For example, in bootcamp I took a command-line efficiency class from Jim Meyering, one of the maintainers of coreutils and also a Facebook employee.

Many other people have commented on this, but the perks and compensation are still top-notch. The company helps take care of your life so you can focus on work while you're working.","Facebook hires the kind of people that expect a lot from themselves. Despite some reports, you do not need to work long hours in order to succeed at Facebook. Bootcamp gives you the chance to find a team that matches you well, and new hires should come in intending to join a team where they can both find balance and grow in their career.

The company is growing and there is some sentiment around slowing down, but most engineering teams are still bottom-up driven and innovating in their space. The things we are doing around privacy and AR/VR are on the bleeding edge and we are strong leaders in these areas.

On the other hand, ironically, there is also sentiment around moving too fast as a company. Since we are people- and product-focused (as opposed to engineering-focused, like at Google), our primary goal is to impact the lives of people for good. Sometimes this means we opt for rapid prototyping over beautifully designed code. However, we are doing much better at recognizing better engineering work such as cleaning up code and improving monitoring, especially in the PE role."

Rampant hostile political atmosphere
Team leadership and IC's will undermine and berate service team members to push their agendas forward.  This is often overlooked by leaderhip and results in burnout and lack of empathy from everyone.  This in turn produces subpar results and half-baked solutions.  No one wins.

Sloppy processes
It's a benefit of a doubt to even say there are processes.  Most of the internal processes are poorly documented and no one has or wants to give time to onboard new hires (see comment below on the culture driving self-absorbed motives).  Getting anything done is 60% figuring out the best way forward, 20% fighting off the political backlash from making said decision and not the one the loudest stakeholder in the room wanted, and 20% is actually spent doing the work.  So much waste.  No concept of agile or the fundamentals of development practices in parts of Community Operations.

No humanity in the human facing part of the org
Working in Community Operations often felt like working in a call center.  People often don't care about their work and they don't care to look beyond the ""what's in it for me"" philosophy running the show to see the people that the organization is supposed to help.  We're talking about posts around some of the worst stuff out there- and the lack of empathy around it is nauseating and explains alot of the trouble Facebook has been getting into.

Custom everything means sloppy everything
So many of the internal tools are custom- even the ones that don't need to be!  Often the tools are under supported (or supported by a staff that isn't willing to take feedback) so you end up with subpar tools supporting a massive company that is in desperate need of some tools that are built with intent and full functionality behind them.

Culture breeds self-absorbed motives within people
Facebook's culture is oriented around ""impact""- what impact did YOU have this performance evaluation period.  It's not enough to say that you helped remove content that was harmful to minors (as an example unrelated to my direct experience).  The impact needs to tie back to numbers- how many lines of code, how much money was saved, how many productive hours were saved-- not one of the questions asked is about how it helps the PEOPLE that use Facebook.  It is all inward focused on the individual contributor- and as such the individual contributors act accordingly.  There is not team oriented thought or conduct in my experience across Community Ops.  There is only ""What's in it for me?"" 

HRBP are often ill informed on processes and policies and rotate like the second hand on a clock
You never know what you're going to get with the HRBP group- some are warm and empathetic others are very clearly only there to protect the company (meaning they'll pigeon hole you into a defensive position).  I didn't have a great experience with them and even in my exit process they got details wrong- like really important details.  Kind of disappointing. 

Middle management is hijacking the company for personal gain and Upper Management hasn't caught on yet
When I hear Mark talk- I see someone who really does believe in the mission behind the company- to make the world a more connected place.  But I'm not sure that he or his team see the snakes in the grass that are not aligned to that mission and only looking for ways to achieve their personal gain.  It's frightening given how much power and authority Facebook has and I really hope that this issue is sorted before things go to far."

- Fast pace!  Some view this as a con, but if you are high-energy and easily bored like me, this is ideal.  Plus, this includes fast career growth.  If you can perform, you will be rewarded quickly.
- Great people!  ""Brilliant jerk"" behavior, as seen in these kinds of companies, is generally less tolerated/prevalent here than elsewhere
- Generally best engineering pay among big-tech employers


Less unique pros you've probably heard of (still awesome):
- Top-class benefits (including INSANE parental benefits)
- Amazing tech infrastructure, a great place to go very tech-deep
- Campus is basically Disneyland","- Recent newsmedia.  It's easy to either feel discouraged or develop a bit of an ""us versus them"" mentality when the media/public seem both technically ill-informed and antagonistic towards your company.
- It's an increasingly mature company, which means the pace is (slowly) slowing down.  This affects the culture; fewer people are mission-driven or down for a passionate ""hacker"" culture."

Fast promotion if you can work long hours. 

Fast paced environment, you'll get to learn new stuff all the time. Lot of smart engineers around.","With fast promotion comes fast firing. It's up or out policy up to a certain level. 

Not a good place for senior engineers joining. Too much stress in the team driven by performance reviews, which is the most aggressive that I've ever known. Emphasis is on individual impact, due to which there's lot of distrust within the team. No stack ranking, but a curve is implemented a org level. This is not a big deal in other companies but here it means 'out'. Managers main job is to write performance reviews, and this often leads to micro management that can be extremely frustrating to senior engineers. 

There's lot of work duplication, most managers (even directors) ignore it as performance reviews is all about impact. Most engineers know that everyone wants to write code and make impact, so ignore the code duplication.

Some teams are hiring just for the head count, not much impactful work. This becomes a problem for senior engineers as they have to invent work or get out. Before joining a team check out their roadmap for at least a year.

This is a good place if you want make money at the cost of WLB. Not a  place to be innovative, which inherently carries risk and takes time. It's a risk because if there's no impact you'll be fired. Most of the engineers work to satisfy performance reviews. My work is determined keeping performance review as the guideline.

But company will be fine, lot of good engineers capable of quickly delivering a fix or hack a feature."
2026,Meta,With great power comes great responsibility,2019-10-04,5.0,Content Strategist,"Truly a best-in-class place to work. I was given amazing tools and resources to do my best job, and allowed a LOT of freedom right off the bat to work the best way I knew how. If you come from work environments where you're used to people directing you at every turn, I have found that Facebook is not like this at all. You are expected to take the initiative and dive on in. It's sink-or-swim at times, but if that's what motivates you, you're in the right place. The good thing is that you are surrounded by so many intelligent people, the vast majority of whom are willing to help, especially when you're new.

Benefits are out of this world, from healthy meals to gym and wellness reimbursement, resources for mental health/therapy and much, much more.

It's a huge company but I never felt like a cog in a wheel. You're recognized as a human being with human needs that exist outside of work and can attend to them accordingly.","The ""personality"" of each team can vary so much depending who is on it and how those relationships work."

-People you work with are EXTREMELY intelligent
-Facebook says they care about employees and they truly mean it.
-The company is testing a social experiment, in which they harness the benefit of you being your ""true"" self at work (no dress code, relaxed and fun atmosphere, freedom of thought/expression, etc.) Instead of reducing your personality to fit a workplace standard, you are encouraged to be yourself. By allowing you to be ""100% you"", Facebook believes that the energy harnessed from this as opposed to ""80% You"" will lead to better overall company success long term. I completely agree with them!","-Freedom of Thought/Expression and the platform in which to share it, leads to scattered ideas spread EVERYWHERE.  

-If you aren't a people person and like to stay to yourself, you will struggle at first like I did. Facebook is connecting the world and the workplace is designed to be interactive. Get ready for some human interaction even if you don't want it."

2041,Meta,Great company to work at - do not believe to different news,2019-09-12,5.0,Senior Software Engineer,"I work in company for 6 months, but I like how company works and operates. One of policies is an openness  - this includes famous weekly Q&As. Senior management tries to explain the background behind decisions, so you know why one or another thing had to be done. 

In general everything focuses on making product which would be better for customers. There were a number of mistakes makes with privacy perspective, but there is a trend to improve this. This is very good approach - instead of hiding mistakes, company focuses on fixing them. After getting an offer I was not sure to join the company because of its reputation, but being inside I figured out most of this is an exaggerations to make a hype in news.

Work style is very flexible - you want to deliver new things, to make an impact, but from another perspective, it is not demanding and it is far from sweat factory in some other companies. It left time to learn something, you can attend many meeting remotely. Work life balance is very good - it is difficult to improve it without affecting the work (someone should do the work, right?). 

There are a lot of young people around (ex-students, but usually with great knowledge), but also there are still a number of experienced people - so aging doesn't seems to be a problem at FB.","Work style is open space. Many new buildings are awesome, while a number of old buildings are depressing - dimmed lighting, gray ceilings. Some buildings have a quiet policy, but for others it is not so good.  I'd recommend remodel old buildings (hack, paint ceiling to a white, so it will reflect the light, install better lighting, work with designers!),  split large rooms into smaller, team-sized rooms, add more VC rooms so people could easier get on conference call without disturbing others.

Another minus is hyper-concentrated campus in Menlo Park. It is difficult to find a good, reasonable-priced rent in that area. It works well for young people, but for families with kids there are a lot of other factors to be taken into account, so Menlo Park area just doesn't work."

Facebook rewards ambition.","The appeal quickly wears off. Your experience at Facebook highly depends on the team you join.

Facebook does not have the best people managers. If you join a team with a good manager who knows the system, you will be more likely to have a productive, prosperous time at Facebook. If you join a team with a bad manager, your work-life balance will be horrible. You will feel extreme pressure with the Performance cycle review every six months. Worse yet, you may even blame yourself for what's happening, not realizing the role your manager plays until it is too late.

Facebook is a good company for new college graduates. Even with a bad experience, you can learn so much about practical, applied technology here. For those with several years of experience, or with family commitments, be careful. Come into Facebook with a clear sense of what you need from Facebook that you cannot get anywhere else. Be prepared to leave when that is delayed, or not a possibility, or comes at a cost to your family or external commitments.

For most people, Facebook is not a company that you join and happily work at for the rest of your life. Facebook is a temporary stop that will squeeze as much productivity out of you as it can. When that stops, it forces you out or makes you want to leave."

* Management is often promoted based on seniority rather than competence.
* ""Most fast"" mentality leads to duplicated work, lack of documentation, and general confusion. Senior ICs are expected to spend much of their time project managing to make up for the failure in organization. I often found during requirements gathering for a project that part or all of it had already been done elsewhere and everyone had simply forgotten about it.
* The culture of open communication makes it seem like employee feedback is valued and encouraged, but actions are rarely taken on that feedback.

- Impact. Unlike SWE, who can prove their impacts by finishing pre-planned coding projects and rolling out pre-planned features, data scientist does not automatically get credit if you only finish beautiful analyses. You have to suggest eng team to apply your suggestion from analysis, and prove how much of the product growth are from your analysis. So sometimes your impact can be subjective.

- Skillset. You may be asked to do a lot of ad-hoc analyses from eng team, which I am sure are very important and can guide engineers whether to implement certain features, but that will prevent you from doing some deep dive analyses and learning some new techniques in data analysis. Maybe after a year or two, you will find that you did not build any statistical models or haven't touched any machine learning. But that's the skillset what other companies will ask for when you apply new job. Who cares you did how many ad-hoc analyses or AB test or wrote how many data pipelines.

2178,Meta,"A great place to learn and grow, if you're lucky and find the right team",2019-02-12,3.0,Product Designer,"- If you find the right team, and you have the autonomy to self-improve and grow, Facebook is a great place for you to flex your wings, experiment, and improve.
- By default, almost everything you ship is used by a lot of people
- Benefits are really good","- You work all the time. It's impossible to truly step away from work. I had dreams about FB projects until about 3 months after I left.
- If you don't end up on a good team, or with a good manager, you're out of luck in terms of ""upwards"" movement and ""impact"". It's really a dice roll unless you're privileged enough to select a specific team.
- Facebook itself is a well greased machine. It self-enforces a lot of its own problems we're seeing the outcomes of today due to how it works. It's unlikely to change that anytime soon, so if you don't like how FB is unable to predict externalities in its work at its scale, you'll be upset working there
- Working at FB is a bit like having blinders on. You're so dang busy and shipping things all the time, it is not conducive for you to think about the big picture and (related to above) the potential butterfly effects/externalities of your work. Many well-intentioned projects end up having disasterous consequences, but I'm confident that 99% of people out there, if they worked on the project, would've also been unable to predict the fallout. The prime example here is Instant Articles, which was a design-lead initiative to give select news partners the ability to make their articles load fast and render ""natively"" in the mobile apps (spun out of Paper after that got shut down). I can assure you that all the team wanted to make was a beautiful interface — it was lead by a product designer — and none of them would've wished to kill ad revenue/contribute to ruining journalism. You can argue that Instant Articles was one in many many steps FB took that ultimately shifted the ability to make money off of news ads from newspapers to FB itself, and lead to today's massive journalism layoffs and click-bait culture (if ya can't get clicks, ya can't get ad views, and ya can't make money). If you ever met the Instant Articles design lead, you'd know all they care about is a good design and polished interactions. But it turns out, just caring about that means you aren't thinking about the potential damage your product can do 4 years down the line."

- Feel like everyone is on the same team, going the same place
- the PS role is an incredible stepping stone to learn data, execution, project management, XFN skills, product management skills -- or really anything. It sets you up for success in a variety of places.","- While compensation is rewarded, leveling up and moving into new roles is very very challenging
- Can feel like Facebook values outside hires more than inside talent already there
- Many people do not get hired for roles in different departments or functions simply because they didn't do well on an interview, when they are more than qualified based on previous work experience at the company -- which isn't taken into account for hiring decisions. They weight internal/external folks the same. 
- work life balance is not great, but you don't come to facebook to ""Cruise"" if you do, you will be fired quickly 
- Newer PMs from other companies seem to be infiltrating a ""CEO"" role in their job -- which is not how Facebook operates. Collaboration > dictatorship of features and product. 
- The product specialist role specifically is challenging to stay in for longer than a few years -- the bar for performance gets higher, but you have the same ""quiver"" of tactics and tools and can only reinvent the wheel so much. 
- Many teams don't understand your role or respect it much, which is problematic because a lot of your impact comes from your ability to push changes and improvements through EMs, PMs and other product focused teams."

These are usually employees with less than a 2 year tenure.  The rest of the 40% are classified as the FB veterans, who believe they deserve certain privileges (like mistreating and bullying new employees).  The culture is to blame as FB values tenure over experience.  An IC with 2 years of FB experience and 0 years of life experience is perceived to be more valuable than a FB noob with 15 years of industry experience.  It's akin to that one possessive and insecure person in a group of friends who gets down right hostile when a new friend enters the circle.  I'm the only noob on my team so you can imagine my plight.  The team is very hostile towards me and I absolutely dread coming to work every day.

- I found it difficult to express the company's values such as Be Bold and Be Open in a couple of organizations, because leaders who were external hires brought in a hierarchy, a ""CYA"" culture, and a combination of empire building and swim lanes.
- The culture in some organization is toxic – people feel unsafe voicing their opinions and being their authentic selves.
- Many teams find themselves blinded by metrics, still doing good work but missing the greater opportunities by ignoring clear paradoxes between metrics and customer experience.

Our open culture is pretty amazing to understand the vision of our company and where we're heading.

2224,Meta,Some adventures are not worth taking,2018-11-19,1.0,Data Engineer,"free food, free t-shirts, free laundry, good pay.
If you're right out of college, this might be the place for you, but that's mostly because you wont have much work experience to compare it against.","1) the job I got is not the job I thought I was getting:
  As an engineer, with engineer in the title, and over 10 years of experience, I really thought I would get to do more engineering.  Unfortunately, the job is really about 50% business analyst and 20% project management, and 30% engineering.  You are expected to own every aspect of your project, regardless if anyone else actually does.  Also, you're told you have the opportunity to choose the team you want to be on, but for me, that choice was removed at the last minute.

2) bad management, bad leadership - all managers are expected to be individual contributors which is basically another way of saying that they aren't particularly good at either, and do not have time to devote to both roles.  Also, be prepared for mansplaining.

3) more money than sense:  gobs and gobs of money are being thrown around.  there's basically an offsite every other week.  Nevermind about work, deadlines, or being competent, it's more important to go glassblowing.  The pay is nice, in fact, its the best feature about the place.

4) the company that wants to connect the world would rather loose talent than have remote workers.  no, seriously.  say you're on a team, and your team decides to move to another office thats like 1 hour away.  you are kicked off the team and put on another team.  what sense does that make?  new mom wants to wfh?  not allowed. 
 Seriously, it's called skype, people.  

5) and speaking of teams, the team structure is completely whack.  instead of having a core group of people I work with on many projects, I have a different group of people I work with on each project.  a completely different set of swe, pm, ds, and de for each project.  This completely limits our ability to grow more efficient with each project, let alone build any sort of a professional relationship.

6) you're not allowed to fix things that are legit broken.  I've only been here a short time and have already had to suffer fools who prefer poorly designed metrics with political bs to actually measuring things properly.  bug 1 told not to fix it - too big to fail, bug 2, never got fixed by other team, bug 3, too high profile to fix.  seriously?  why not just admit all your metrics are wrong?

7) people care more about performance reviews than actual performance.  no really, if I hear the phrase make ""an impact"" I will vom.  What this really means is not ""do good and useful work"" which is how it might be interpreted, instead it means that you should very little on the very high profile projects, and then post it everywhere, to make sure people NOTICE.  Also, keep a log of your work so that you can share it with your absentee manager come review time - otherwise, he (yeah I said he) likely will have no idea what you worked on or why.  But, instead of this being a meaningful signal, it just becomes more noise."

2234,Meta,Not a good place for seasoned professionals,2018-11-02,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"- benefits and perks
- endless food options
- global reach and impact

At Facebook, you have the opportunity to work on products that everyone uses. This helps you use and sharpen your skills in an entirely new way, and really think through your logic and decisions—unpacking every detail because you have to make sure it works and is understood across all demographics, countries, cultures, and languages.

They also take care of employees. Everything is free: shuttle rides, laundry service, professional development courses, tons of swag, and all the food, snacks, and drinks you can eat (the “Facebook 15” is real). The company’s health benefits are unmatched and they even have medical, dental, and gym facilities on campus.","- politics and back channeling 
- competitiveness and lack of collaboration 
- relationships hold more value than quality work

Facebook the company is like the platform: everyone acts like everything is great, but no one acknowledges or exposes what’s really going on under the surface. People act like it’s all sunshine and roses, but because there’s such a “focus on impact” and performance, it’s actually a competitive environment where people are out for themselves and scrambling for whatever projects will give them the most visibility—at Facebook, visibility > impact > high performance ratings > bonus multipliers + equity refreshers. 

As a result, people you know and being an influencer matter more than the quality of your work. Likes are the real currency and even though you’re told to “be your authentic self”, one type of person benefits most: those who are extroverted, don’t rock the boat, and are oftentimes male.

While the actual benefits and perks are great, don’t be fooled by the glamour of it all: they’re also designed to keep you there and keep you working. You’ll be taken care of, but the focus on impact and performance makes it’s easy to forget to take care of yourself. There’s an undercurrent of anxiety in the culture that is very real and not often acknowledged.

Facebook is a great company for those just starting out their career. If you’re a seasoned professional, I suggest staying away. It doesn’t matter how much experience or expertise you have—I spent most of my time proving to people half my age that I knew what I was doing. 

Time and again, my suggestions would be ignored or edited to the point that they were no longer my ideas. Time and again, leadership would be shown those watered down ideas and say, “Nope!” Time and again, when I’d go back to my original recommendation, leadership would say, “That’s the one!” After awhile, it was finally time for me to say, “I’m tired of (and better than) this.”"

Even after getting ""Exceeds Expectations"" cycle after cycle, I found it difficult to influence the top-down decisions.

Community is at the core of FB. I’ve never worked at a company that cares so much about its people. Taking care of yourself and working sustainably is part of the culture. All the amenities are there to keep you focused (or distracted). Food, snacks, multiple gyms (with classes), car service, life@ (I took my passport photos there for heavens sake). 

We have, workplace, FB’s own internal app. It’s like Facebook within Facebook for employees. I can message anybody and be in contact with anybody in the company. I’m an entry level engineer and talk to VPs Directors and even Mark, who holds open forum EVERY Friday in person. That level of access is phenomenal. 

If you have an idea you can do it. You have the support and finances to achieve whatever you can think of. If you’ve worked anywhere else then you can see why everything I’ve written is so important. It just isn’t like that anywhere else.","It’s so good that it would be hard to work anywhere else. I’m destroyed for life. If it’s your first job I would feel bad because this is NOT a true view of the working world. If you’re humble enough to appreciate that then you should be ok.

As an individual contributor myself, I really appreciate having a caring and at the same time professional manager, who gives me a lot of flexibility, but steps in when I need them.
- You are being recognized for impact, not for how many years of experience you bring to the table. This helps getting good reviews for hard work, even when you're young and unexperienced.
- You get many opportunities to work cross-functionally, which is great for diversity of thought. Personally, I like the fact I am exposed to working with technical and non-technical people.
- Some of the benefits are amazing. Fertility treatment coverage and in general medical coverage are the best out there.","- Facebook purposefully hires very smart and ambitious individuals. Even when there's no pressure from the manager to work long hours, you often see people working long hours, which in return puts more pressure on you.
- There are no incentives to stay in the company for longer than 4 years. Once you vest all your RSUs, refreshers you get for good performance look very unattractive. It's more and more common for people to leave FB after 4 years, and come back a year later to re-negotiate their RSUs.
- You are being ""punished"" with certain benefits if both spouses work for Facebook. A good example is baby cash which you get per family, not per employee.

-Mgmt has no empathy or positive reinforcement; trying to cover their tracks and make sure their team is hitting their numbers. They are mostly overseers than coaches. If you're not hitting your number, they'll exploit that, push you to do so, or push you out."

If you seek help, you'll get it. I think its somewhat imbued within the facebook culture to work as hard as possible to make as much impact as possible. It's really up to you to communicate WLB issues, if it exists, to your team and manager to make it work for you. I don't think people here are generally working hard to outcompete one another.

But, if you don' t have a strong social support network, it's a great set up. My co-workers were by far the best part of the company!","The hiring process is very strange as they hire people without knowing what team they'll be on, allowing for an opportunity to be placed on a team that's not a great fit, and then being stuck in it and not being able to move around until at least a year in. HR seems most concerned about protecting the company rather than really listening to employees and their concerns. There is a lot of turnover lately...I had 4 managers in about a 9 month span, which leads to really confusing situations.

Like someone else mentioned, the quality of hires for the recruiting team is worsening. The R4R team is so desperate to hit their goal that the bar is low and it shows. There are many new inexperienced recruiters that we just wish would or COULD do their basic, functional job. 

The role of a sourcer and recruiter is becoming smaller and smaller. And although leadership insists they care, every action they take suggests they do not. It is hard to constantly be reminded that you are merely just another number to be replaced asap. 

Be prepared to work long, long hours. There isn't such a thing as ""work/life"" balance as most in recruiting will work into the night and weekends. The goals and expectations are extremely high so you're constantly competing with a whole org of overachievers. Realistically, this means it'll be tough to even achieve a ""Meets All"" rating during the review cycle as everyone is overachieving, thereby changing that already high goal."

* Really awesome internal tools
* Unbelievable compensation & perks
* The company trusts & believes in its employees
* You become associated with the Facebook brand
* Also a con, but you have a ton of freedom in what you work on","The tl;dr is Facebook is a big company and its cons reflect that.  The company mission and values are incredibly admirable, but have become increasingly difficult to implement as the company has grown.

* You might find yourself working on a project with over a million lines of code, but nobody on your team has written more than 10,000.  The need to sit down and figure it out yourself can be pretty stressful in an environment that is pushing you to ""make an impact"" and be constantly shipping new features.  
* The few senior engineers (in my org at least) show little interest in mentoring more junior engineers.
* Sink or swim mentality among engineers, the mega-teams supporting products in the core app can be brutal and unwelcoming.
* Launch decisions are very political - criteria for launching a change is opaque, and feedback from department leads happens far too late in the development process (often in the meeting where a launch decision is being made!).  Little has been done to fix these issues despite it being constant feedback for the past year.
* Performance reviews put too much emphasis on immediate personal output rather than collaboration and assisting other teams.  This causes teams and individuals to focus inwardly.  While it's never been malicious, I've seen this behavior directly harm other team's productivity or metrics.
* Work/life balance is below average on the day-to-day, but oncalls are truly awful.
* Decision-making has become a bit too distributed between orgs and reflects in the overall product."

2. Awesome idea of bootcamp. All new people, regardless of the amount of experience, start in a 8 weeks-ish bootcamp. This is ideal for ramping up on the company wide infrastructure ( since almost all the sw in facebook is homegrown ).  Also, you get to choose your team at job fairs. How cool !

I've never been one for loyalty to my job or my company, but at least in Social VR, my team are some of the most genuinely supportive and caring people I've ever met in my life and I really feel like they accept me and will be there for me both when I need things at work and when I'm having personal difficulties. I'm given full autonomy to pursue the things that I think are most important. My team is incredibly diverse (including transgender, black, Asian, Pacific Islander, Latino, and an unusually high percentage of women) which shows both an extraordinary commitment to diversity and gives me faith that the product will be built to serve diverse customers. And the backgrounds of the people on my team are shockingly elite, with many projects on their resumes that are immediately familiar to and admired by me. I'm also proud that Facebook has so many people at the very top who are strongly committed to VR - like Zuckerberg's ambitious announcement at OC4 that his goal is to have a billion people in VR.","Facebook is hugely committed to transparency and authentic identity. So if you value separating your personal life and work life, don't want to share your personal feelings with coworkers or hear about theirs (or offer emotional support), or don't like to share with other people in the broader company what you're working on, it may be a bad fit for you. Likewise, if you prefer to be directed by leadership rather than establishing your own direction autonomously, Facebook might be a bad fit for you. Finally, Facebook's primary Menlo Park campus is located in the middle of nowhere with very little else around - you eat and get all your services on campus, with the nearest downtown a 15 min drive away. If you prefer to be in an urban center, you should either consider a different location, or a different company."

2444,Meta,"You'll laugh, you'll cry, you'll drown, you'll wish you bought in 2012",2017-12-07,3.0,Senior Product Manager,"I had 5+ years of pre-FB experience in tech and other industries, including others consistently in  Glassdoor Top 10. I don't regret joining FB:

- I've learned an incredible amount about a new tech stack and product management for ads in only a few months. Not all my peers are brilliant about all things (which is good, as I'm certainly not) but every one of them is smarter than I am about at least one thing, and it takes very little time to find out what. 

- Data and logic rule here -- not always, not entirely, but enough. There is enough of a culture of rigor to metrics that we still have a North Star when in the weeds.

- The perks are great. I have gotten broken glasses fixed by the dry cleaner for only a low tax rate. The food is shockingly good for the scale of the cafes, and I'm impressed every day by the whole MPK service operation.

- Workplace is much better than emails as a site for debate/discussion about what to do. Also a con, because it generates a game  of how-should-i-react-on-Workplace all its own, and in a more public record.","Facebook is like Bitcoin: people in it ask when you bought in because it's the easiest way to find out how powerful you are without being rude. 

I joined within the last year, along with about half of the company. The contrast in the level of success of people who joined N years ago vs N-2 years ago is logarithmic for all values of N. At its current rate, I don't think I can advise anyone to join now, and after I vest, I'm not sure I will stay.

Part of this is that the starting comp isn't  very good. The vesting stock is, but the cash is fairly mediocre (less than previous jobs I've had at far less profitable companies), and vesting accelerates over time. This nets to you being paid much more than before, year over year.

The much greater share of it is that opportunities scaling in  the same pyramid-growth path means that anyone thinking of joining today can't expect  any of the same trajectory that available 2 years ago, and maybe even 1 year ago."

Retains its ""move fast"" culture - you can get a lot of meaningful work done.

Smart and proficient colleagues - you can learn a lot regardless of your level! 

Compensation is fair and sweet.","Forget about work/life balance. In fact, forget about work/sleep balance. Management does nothing to deal with the problem.

Horrible working conditions. Wide and extremally noisy open spaces (impossible to concentrate), tiny desks, lines in restrooms, unavailable meeting rooms. I do most of my meaningful work from home. Management refuses to acknowledge the problem and praises facilities, so no chance of this being fixed.

A strong political bias coming all the way from the top that pollutes working climate."
2449,Meta,Best Large Tech Company Culture,2017-12-05,5.0,Software Engineer,"From the start, Facebook has been amazing.

Bootcamp was a great experience; not too many companies let a new grad spend 6-8 weeks searching for a good team fit. They let you pick a team, which essentially means you get to pick your tech stack (Backend; Front-end; Mobile; Infrastructure), the org you work for (Messenger, Facebook, Oculus, Instagram, etc.). More importantly, you get to pick your manager + team mates, where as in other large companies, it's the other way around; you are assigned to a product & org  & manager whether you like it or not. This is way different compared to Google's opaque 'host matching' process and Microsoft where they just randomly place you in a division like Azure or Office.

The company values really shine through every day. Before Facebook I thought the concept of company values was kind of corny and B.S. Now that I'm at FB I can at least say that here the company values are actually values held by top management + majority of the workforce and not just marketing / HR speak.

Everyday I really feel like we are moving fast and shipping a lot of product very quickly. We A/B test lots of features, analyze the data, and swiftly decide what to ship to the public. I never feel stuck; I always feel like I'm either implementing an A/B test or analyzing data so we can ship more features. There are not long product cycles with lots of prognostication from product leadership; we build, measure, then learn. Thats it.

I feel everyday that we have an open culture. At Facebook, we use Workplace, a tool thats kind of like Facebook but for corporations, made by you guessed it... Facebook. Within Workplace, just like normal FB, there are a ton of groups. I'm in a bunch of groups and basically get visibility on decision making + product updates + news from every part of our org. I feel like I'm in the loop and just learn so much about FB / product by reading my Workplace newsfeed. For example, today I read a research report about internet users in India, learned some stuff about dynamic ads, and saw one of the senior leaders announce a new partnership deal. All of that info isn't directly relevant to my day-to-day job, but because its all there and open to anyone, I learn so much and have so much clarity into FB's product vision & company objectives. Mark or Shreyl do Q & A's every Friday. Between hearing top leadership speak, and reading updates from every part of the company on Workplace, I feel that FB is a very open and transparent place to work.

There are many other pros and cultural values that I like but let me get to a major pro to end this review. Food!
Here's just a sample from today!  I ate these 3 meals today at the company cafe 2 mins walk away from my desk. 

Breakfast: 
Soft Boiled Egg + Been + Cheese + Salsa Tostada. Organic Blueberries & Blackberries. Hemp & Pumpkin seeds.

Lunch:
Vegetarian Pho with Sous Vide Eggs, Tofu, Steamed Cabbage, Green Onions, Cilantro, & Bean Sprouts in it. Added Sriracha and Chili Oil to spicen it up.
Thai Iced Tea Bobba (Bubble) Tea. 

Dinner (today was Jamaican themed):
Sweet Potato & Corn Casserole, Collared Greens, Fried Plantains, & Quinoa. 
I also got a slice of cheese pizza :)

Dessert: Mango Cheesecake made with Graham Cracker Crust. 

By the way, the menu rotates, and at the HQ, there are a ton of cafes to choose from so way more options for food are there.","Work life balance is tough. Can have some busy weeks due to the ""move fast"" culture. Plus you have a lot of ownership which brings with it some stress.
 
The offices are crowded due to how fast we are growing. They are building a few new huge buildings but until those finish things are quite cramped, and the work place can get loud. 

Also not enough space in the gyms because of the general overcrowding on campus."
2450,Meta,Facebook,2017-12-05,5.0,IOS Recruiter,"I've been at Facebook for about a year and a half and it is the first company i've worked for that's truly walked the walk in terms of standing by it's mission and values. The people that I work with care deeply about their users and about the company as a whole and Facebook cares deeply and invests in those employees as well. The problems are large scale and complex, but the people working to solve them are the best of the best. I come to work everyday and enjoy my job, I feel appreciated, secure in my role, and that I personally make an impact every day. It's a rare feeling.

Also, propaganda posters decorate all the buildings. They're there for inspiration but it felt more like cultish brainwashing. My opinions could be because I was older than about 92% or the population at Menlo Park which skews toward college grads and under 30s.

1) The company embodies ""move fast"". If you can prove you can create a vision and build momentum for a product and a team, you will be given the reins to move as fast as you can at FB. I've taken a project from 0 to 1 to launch in 4 countries in 4 months.

2) The company embodies ""be bold"". There are no ""small swings"" around here. There might be a lot of incremental work, optimization and tweaking on all fronts but when the company realizes progress needs to be done in an area, it's no holds barred. The big bet I'm currently leading has lead to 2 teams merging and org structures adapting to enable that shift.

3) The company embodies ""be open"" - There is a transparency to the decision making, be it at team level or at management and leadership level I've never encountered before. It's refreshing to be able to ask any question I want to Mark every Friday during the Q&A for instance.","One thing has underwhelmed me and that is that management isn't as available as I wish it would be. For instance, I would have loved the opportunity to meet and learn from higher-ups and more experienced people more often but am unable to find time on their calendars (Still trying though)."

You are empowered and encouraged to wield influence and ship products that can literally affect billions of people, no matter what level you are at. There is also a lot of food.","It's really expensive to live around here, and the traffic sucks, so if you want to work in the heart of things in Menlo Park you have to contend with that.

2482,Meta,"Believe the hype, this is by far the best place I've ever worked",2017-10-15,5.0,Product Specialist,"Not even sure where to start.  It goes without saying that this company takes GREAT care of its employees, and then some.  The work is challenging and super intense, but the positive and collaborative cultre, along with all of the perks/benefits offered, make the intensity much easier to deal with as opposed to any other company I've worked for.

I've been at FB for a bit over four months, but I knew during my interviews (btw these were the hardest interviews I've ever had) that this was the place to be.  From application to job offer, it took 6 weeks. When I got the offer, it was so strong that there as no need to negotiate.  When I got the job and relocated from NY to CA, the relocation package was was so good I didn't have to raise a finger or spend a dime.  Already knew at that point that this company knows how to retain talent.

This place truly rewards merit, courage, and being outspoken.  Management is aware enough (at least in my space) to place me in a role that plays to my strengths, and I've enjoyed th freedom to make my role what I want to be.   They are very outspoken when you're performing well and are honest about things that need improvement.  If you have a good idea that is supported by data and aligns well with the goals of your team or whatever your target population may be, you will find resources or people to join you in your efforts.  From hackathons to day-to-day work, this culture permeates every area of the company. 

One thing that strikes me the most is how strong the diverse community (however small) is within this company.  There are a lot of resources put towards ERG/FBRG efforts, and as a diverse employee, this means A LOT to me.  

I know the norm is to move around the industry every five years or so, but I don't see myself leaving this company for a long time.  In just four months, I feel deeply rooted here, and I intend be here for a while.  If you're reading this, there should be no question about applying, interviewing, or accepting an offer.  You'll be happy that you made the decision.","This may be limited to my team or my area of the company, but I believe there is an underlying ""me, me, me"" culture at FB.  There is a constant need to make your work visible so that others know what you're doing and so that whoever has a similar idea doesn't take the shine before you do.  

Separately, everyone wants to do knock-out work, and at times are secretive about the things that they're working on so that they can have that ""holy crap"" moment when they finally finish and reveal the results of their work.  This can result in wasted resources and time since multiple people/small groups coule be working on the same thing without knowing it.  Not sure what the solution is, but this at times takes away from collaborative work.  I identify it as a con, but I've quickly found myself doing the same thing, and that's just because it's an underlying, unspoken culture at the company."
2483,Meta,"Wonderful people, fun work, great culture",2017-10-15,5.0,Production Engineer,"Comp, benefits, and perks are incredible.

Company culture is so, so good. I've had two great managers who both have done an excellent job supporting my growth and guiding my career.

It also feels like senior and C-level management really cares about employees. It feels like Facebook the company really tries to support me as a whole person (but be sure to ask for what you need! nobody's a mind reader).

For eng, bootcamp and team selection are such a good idea. I freaking love my team, and I get to own my decision to join that team (rather than some hiring/allocation manager deciding where I get to go).

Very few operational rules/bureaucracy. I can ssh into any machine I need to. If someone's fighting a fire anywhere in the company and I am able to help, I feel like I can always jump in to help. I really like Infra, so being at a big company like FB is super fun.","Oncalls can kill your sleep during your oncall shift if things are noisy overnight

- The company is innovating and revenue growth is phenomenal. Which means the equity value grows significantly YoY. 

- Comp is good here. Facebook generally overpays a lot of recruiters compared to Google, Amazon, and Microsoft. This could be attributed to desperation because of  how difficult it's been to hire recruiters.","- The bar has significantly dropped in recruiting. Because of the hyper growth Facebook is going through they've been forced to hire inexperienced recruiters and also rejects who weren't able to hack it in other top tech companies & start-ups. It used to mean a lot to be a full time recruiter at Facebook. Now it feels like they're giving an offer to anyone with a pulse. Inexperienced recruiters or bad ones can attribute to poor candidate experience and headaches for other recruiters. 

- Performance Reviews many times aren't a true reflection of individual performance. It's a problem that many companies have and Facebook is one of them. 

- The company has become so corporate. It's like you're just another number and the impact you're making is insignificant. 

- Work Life Balance is terrible. In order to be successful here you'll need to work well over 50 hours per week."

What sticks out most to me is that the company is accutley aware that it won't be able to reach it's long term goals without tenured (more than 2-3 years) employees. It goes to great lengths to remove everyday hassles from your life so you can spend more time doing the things you love outside of work and when life happens (babies, relocation, bereavement) it's most amazing perk shines through. The people around you come together to support you and give you the time you deserve to move through life changes. 

They really look at it through the lens of ""if the employee is happy and taken care of then they'll do the best work of their career"". This doesn't mean that everyone will work 80 hours a week. If you question this, ask to see the office at 6pm. It's pretty empty. Most people leave closer to 4.",Is hard to imagine another company to work at.

I've been given opportunities to work with many great colleagues who care deeply about the work that you're doing and will challenge and encourage you to do better. 
- Support staff at Facebook is amazing whether it be the people who greet you in the morning, facilities, IT, the security guards, chefs, or the the people who work at the gym. Everyone is super friendly and has your best interest at heart. It's like going to work at a 5 Star Hotel every single day :)
- Feedback is taken very seriously and typically acted upon. For example a couple of years ago Facebook didn't offer 4 months paternity leave for employees outside of the US and after receiving feedback from international employees this was policy was expanded globally
- Perks are amazing, free food, gym (or membership for offices without gyms), laundry, great healthcare.","- Mid-level managers are a hit or miss. I've had 4 different managers in 3 years at Facebook and my experience at work has greatly been dependent on how competent they are. My best manager pushed me and opened doors and was a true advocate for me within the company, whereas my worst manager who was also a first time manager made me feel as if I was working on an island. If you're joining Facebook in a non-tech role you should definitely try your best to get a feel for your future manager.
- As the company has hired over 10K+ people over the past 3 years roles and responsibilities are definitely becoming more specialized and opportunities to drive tangible impact are becoming increasingly difficult for people in junior roles
- Pay and benefits for people working in international offices are not comparable to working at HQ. For example IVF is offered in the US but not non-US offices."

In fact, if you don't - that is bad.  But be prepared to back up what you say.  And know you will get direct feedback on how you can get better, because we all can.  Feedback is real and designed to help you get better, not judge you.  Overall, an amazing place that moves fast towards a clear mission that everyone in the company is behind.

2569,Meta,Amazing for female engineers,2017-05-03,5.0,Software Engineer,"I'm a software engineer who has been at Facebook for almost a year. It is hands down the best place I have ever worked.

To be frank, I didn't have high expectations going in that it would be very different from the misogynistic cultures I've had to navigate at previous companies. 

Before working at Facebook, I'd kind of come to accept that being a female engineer would always be a somewhat isolating existence and the best I could do would be to find a team with 90% great colleagues and just try and avoid the creepy and rude ones as much as possible. I'd seen that as long as they performed well (or held some other utilitarian value for the company) they would always have a place in a company and their treatment of women would be an open secret and accepted.

Honestly, my first couple months at Facebook made me aware of how much effort I'd been spending navigating those types of situations.

It's incredible working with people who assume your competence rather than constantly having to battle to prove yourself.

It's amazing seeing constant efforts towards dissecting internalized biases and senior male employees openly discussing their efforts to catch themselves unconsciously interrupting people. It's laughable to try to imagine this happening at my previous companies.

It's so precious being able to find a place where you can just focus on your work.",It's a long commute for San Franciscans who come down to Menlo Park because we don't have an SF office yet.

Upon arriving to the office every morning, everyone from the reception staff to your team says hello to you, and genuinely is interested in your life. People love coming to work every morning and are excited about what they do here every day, and it shows. 

Many companies as competitive as this expect a lot from their employees, and so does Facebook. However, they also encourage a healthy work/ life balance, ensuring their employees are taking enough time off (either by working reasonable hours every day, and/or actually using all of their PTO) to be able to stay fresh and ready to work when at work.","Not many cons to the company.

2583,Meta,I found my people,2017-04-16,5.0,Production Engineer,"I really feel as though I've found my people.

I've had this dissonance in past roles: ever since academia years ago, I've been out of the ""research"" phase and into the ""engineer at a X company"" stage, where ""X"" is occasionally a software product but more often a service or commercial product.  The culture was not one of making the right things, but making the profitable thing now.  Driven by sales people, there was a lot of grandstanding, peacocking, both in the culture and in the message.

Facebook has my people, my culture.  We do things in the way that scales and makes engineering sense.  Sure, perfect is the enemy of good enough, but if a temporary shortcut remediates a problem or a need, it's quickly iterated to improve, all the while immersed in a tech culture: Pusheen, Archer, Dr Who, Starwars, memes, the micro-actions that continually reinforce a culture-fit or a culture-miss.

I'm in the culture fit.  Sure, I get a very competitive salary, plus my tech chops improve (when C++ gurus review your work, your C++ quality improves), and the food, and the perks, but above all, this is the place I feel I most fit.

I'm in my mid-40s.  I ""get schooled"" my mid-20s.  ...and it's awesome.","Pace is a killer.  The work is complex, as are the discussions about it, I have little fuel in my head to code after work.  Big personal desire to keep up to the more efficient engineers.  I don't want to pass-a-fault, but want to move-fast, get all the things done.  It's exhausting!"
2584,Meta,Software Engineer,2017-04-14,4.0,Software Engineer,"Competitive compensation package if you join the company at the right time (when stock price is low.)  Otherwise it won't be too attractive unless you are E5.

Lots of things to learn in the company, good benefit.

If you can get a management role, you will be in haven.  Most of the managers their life is very very easy, they only need to care about their team don't get downsize in the political wrestling.","Manager's turn over rate is too high. I got 8 different manager in three year. Some area got lots of politics, watch who is the head of that department. 

Instagram, Messenger has pretty bad culture at this moment. 

Literally no life when you want to get good perf review ratings."

If I were to pick one pro out of all of them - it's the people. Whatever you heard or read about Facebook really doesn't give the place enough credit. I'm not in HR/recruiting or even management, but I do see a common trend in everyone they bring on board. Everyone is smart, motivated, non-judgemental, and freakishly CARING. There are so many people with heart at FB.

To be honest, you can be one heck of a coder, but if you're selfish - I don't think you will get hired here. I've previously worked at Google and MSFT; FB blows both of them out of the water (maybe I'm a little biased). Other pro's of course are...  

+ Free world class food options all day long on the main campus cafeteria (MPK 20/21).This includes great snacks/drink options everywhere else as well.

+ Resources. They will give you everything you need so you can do an amazing job - period. Hardware, software, etc...

High level of independence and reliance on individuals doing what they see as the best use of their talents for the company (with guidance from managers and others if needed). Each team is a little different in how they operate, but because you can pick your team after you join (and have gone through bootcamp and met many of them), you can find the fit that matches you. And if you find you need a change at some point, then you just find the next team/project (or come up with your own) that again satisfies you and helps the company as much as possible.

The perks are awesome. Free food, snacks. Lots of variety, high quality. Great benefits - I'm a big fan of the onsite medical/dental options. It's a company that cares about its employees and you can feel it imo.

Open culture. Smart people. And a growing business make it the best in tech right now.","Problems that basically persist for most tech companies in the Bay Area like commute sux. Hard to get a good commute, and if you do, then you're probably paying a steep price for it. Shuttles help a lot if you're coming from SF or surrounding cities, but still suck overall.

Generally, prices for housing suck anywhere you live in the Bay Area. If you're already here, then you already know that. If not, then be prepared - it sux.

Diversity is still a problem. Facebook is trying to fix this, and it comes up all the time about what more can be done which is good, but at the end of the day, it's still a problem."

2644,Meta,Software Engineer,2017-02-05,5.0,Software Engineer,"1) The only metric we're measured on is ""impact"". This feels completely fair to me. It also means you get to pick your own hours as long as you get some impactful things done and you're still in sync with all of the other people on your project.
2) It's easy for engineers to switch teams. That means you don't need to know what you enjoy working on before you join and you can't get stuck with a bad manager.
3) New York-specific: the company is in East Village, which means you can live in the most exciting part of the city AND have the luxury of walking to work.
4) I think Facebook's company history is interesting.

Everyone uses the same check in process (per repository).  Everyone uses the same employee feedback process.  etc...  There are also lots of internal services that are really helpful.  Services for deployment, managing configuration, a/b testing, etc.  Because everyone uses the same tools, everyone invests in them and they're well-documented, easy to learn, etc.
- People: everyone I've worked with is really smart and happy to lend a helping hand.  Haven't had any issues so far.
- Work: I've enjoyed the kind of problems that I get to solve at Facebook much more than the kind of problems I got to solve at Microsoft.  I worked on four different teams at Microsoft.  The problems here are more challenging and require scalable, efficient solutions.
- Culture: The culture here is fantastic.  Internally, there is a lot of transparency.  There isn't too much politics.  You can make improvements on part of the codebase.  There isn't much process to slow you down.  There is a lot of individual freedom in what your prioritize and work on.
- Work life balance: I've had great work life balance here.  I typically work 35-40 hours a week, and I've not once stayed late for dinner.  On-call is pretty light--much easier than on-call at Microsoft.  This might vary by team.
- Food: Really good food.  Lots of healthy options (and unhealthy options if you want a cheat day).

Beautiful campus","Not every team is created equal at Facebook. I'm a Product Support Specialist at Facebook working under the Global Shared Services department. Unfortunately, the role that was stated in the JD is not the role that I am in. 

I was told the Product Support role would be a precursor to Product Management and that you will be spending a lot of time strategizing and helping product teams with their product roadmaps. A couple weeks in, and I soon realized that this role is purely operational and SLA based. We manned bug reports on a daily basis. Everything was numbers driven, but not in the right way. We were encouraged to analyze the tickets to find ways to improve SLA. 

Leadership is quite weak. They only listen to our goals and aspirations but neither help us or nor point us to the right direction. Most of the team don't plan to stay for long. Everyone seems to have a plan B or to be using this role as a springboard to another one within Facebook.

Although I hear great things from other teams, this one is not it."

2685,Meta,"Facebook is the worst job, except for all the others",2016-11-30,3.0,Infrastructure Engineer,"Facebook is probably the best big company to work for.  The company cares a lot about having its employees being productive and satisfied with their jobs and it works hard at maintaining an environment to support that.  As a survivor from the real world, this is really rare -- pretty much every company-wide system is designed to make life easier for employees.  The benefits and conveniences offered are amazing.

Many decisions about the company and its goals are made fairly transparently and open discussion about most things is encouraged.  This can get really annoying at times.

Unlike most companies, Zuck is actually a pretty inspiring leader.  He makes mistakes, but does learn from them.  He has really lofty goals, though, and doing the right thing is highly subjective when trying to change the world.

If you are politically savvy and willing to work hard and make sure others notice that hard work, you will go far.  You will learn a lot if you seek out opportunities to learn, and work with a lot of very talented people.  You have to own this yourself, though; don't count on a lot of support.","Facebook still believes that it is a magical meritocracy reasonably free from corporate nonsense. While there aren't any Office Space-style TPS reports to fill out and you don't have to bring in your own coffee and toilet paper, it is now just a big company job like any other.  If you want something, whether it be a promotion or a good dessert from the cafeteria, you have to plan how to get it, execute on the plan, and then make sure everyone else knows what you did and how great it was.  You also have to share just enough detail to be convincing but not so much that people can poke holes in your story or usurp your dessert acquisition techniques.

The typical first level line manager at Facebook doesn't have prior management experience, only knows the Facebook way of doing things, and is overwhelmed with all the pressure being placed on them.  It's a really hard job, too; your manager will be responsible both for setting the direction of your team and for making sure you and your colleagues grow at the company. Most people are not good at either of those things, let alone both.  Be aware of what your manager is looking for and how to best communicate it.

Everything FB does is subject to a lot of public scrutiny, and you will know how the sausage is made and see that the goals of the company aren't focused on invading privacy or global domination like everyone else thinks.  It's hard to see this thing that takes up so much of your life lionized and loathed by the press and your friends.

For engineers, a lot of the tools you will use day-to-day are incomplete, broken, poorly documented, and might not be supported anymore.  You will get used to this.  ""Move fast and break things"" is more complicated than it sounds, and that's really hard to adapt to when coming from a more traditional company.  Have big goals but chop them up into small tasks with well-defined success indicators and communicate them early and often."
2686,Meta,Software Engineer,2016-11-28,4.0,Software Engineer,"Facebook's products are used by more people than anything else. The company's mission -- to connect the world -- is good. There are many, many choices of projects for software engineers and you get to pick your team.","Facebook is a big company with rules. If you are a software engineer, you are compared to all other software engineers. If you do part of the job of a software engineer and part of the job of a something-else (PM, manager, analyst, etc), it will be hard to evaluate you. Also, it is common to have a lot of manager changes."

Because they have issued you these items, there are no excuses."
2706,Meta,What a great place to work,2016-10-18,5.0,Engineering Manager,"There are many, but here are a few of my favorites:

- Play to your strengths. Too many companies and too many people work on improving weaknesses, in hopes of becoming well-rounded. This is fine, but often the better strategy is to play to your strengths, where employees do more of what they're good at, and less of what they're not good at, in a diverse team. I've never seen this done as well as at Facebook.

- Moving fast at scale. There are so many tools and frameworks to help you still move fast, as fast as any startup, that's it awesome. So impressive at Facebook's scale.

- World-class team. I know this is said often and loses meaning, but it's true here. Every single person is both smart and nice, a rare combination.

- They care about the right things, and don't care about the wrong things. Both parts of this are important. Too many companies sweat the small stuff that doesn't matter, e.g. who's invited to a meeting or whatever. At Facebook, everyone is just trying to make a positive impact, without care for politics etc.","- Things change fast. If you're not at ease with change, or if you're seeking a place that never changes, this is not the right company for you. This includes projects, tools, technologies, teams...

- There are multiple technical ways of doing most things. It's not always clear which is the best way, so you have to ask people. I think that's actually OK as you get to know your colleagues. But if you're the kind of person who wants perfect documentation for everything, this is not the place for you."
2707,Meta,Fantastic Experience,2016-10-14,5.0,Anonymous Employee,The benefits from working at FB are amazing. They are not just throwing money at employees on useless items. They are thoughtful and trying to make people more productive and healthier with the items they provide.,It is a very young company. The benefit is that it creates an aggressive and flexible style of working. On the flip side if you like consistency and predictability - this is not the place for you.
2708,Meta,Mission Driven. Impact from Day One.,2016-10-12,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"People here care deeply about the mission to connect the world. Everything we do connects to the mission and Mark talks about the mission in practically every talk. We encourage people to be their authentic selves. There's no ""work you"" and ""personal you."" There's just ""you."" People care deeply about each other here. And you have the ability to make an impact beginning on your first day. Some places it takes 6 months or a year to make meaningful progress, but here you jump in and make a difference right after orientation.","It's really fast paced and things change quickly. You have to be able to ride the waves and adapt quickly. So many people are grateful to be part of such an amazing company, but there are a few bad eggs who ruin the culture because they takers, not givers. We need to serve more humble pie in the cafes."

- Tons of resources
- Strong company values

2710,Meta,Great place to work; Hard to navigate career growth and internal politics,2016-10-05,3.0,Analyst,"- Amazing benefits. They really take care of employees. 
- Great workplace environment. Coworkers feel like family and are very supportive of each other. 
- Mission of the company truly runs deep. 
- Flexible work hours and environment. There is generally a high degree of trust between employees.","- The open floor plan can be completely draining (especially for introverts, like myself). 
- Very unclear career growth. I started as an early career employee and one of the main reasons I left was because I felt like there was really little investment in my professional and personal growth. I found that Facebook really likes employees that will work hard and make them look good, but they don't care about helping you move up to the next level. There was no clear progression. A part of this is the flat organizational structure, which appeals to some but not to all. 
- Very millennial feeling (I'm a millennial too) and can feel extremely unprofessional at times. No line between personal and professional relationships. Again, this is up to personal choice but it didn't feel great to me all the time. 
- Cult-like worship of upper management (Mark and Sheryl). They are awesome people to look up to but people are not critical enough of the company all the time. It felt like people were always blind-sided by the flashiness of M-team's messaging. 
- Facebook hires a lot of contractors to full-time positions (especially in Austin), which can feel irksome. 
- Since the company has grown so much, they need to stop acting like a startup. 
- It's easy to do work that isn't actually fulfilling but is necessary to run the company. 
- Loved the mission and messaging of the company but didn't feel like my work was impactful in any way, which was an unfortunate feeling. 
- Pay is not that good for entry level/early career business side roles. Engineers make a lot more, unsurprisingly. 
- This is an engineer-run company, after all. So if you are on the business side, expect to be heavily reliant on engineering resources, which can be extremely draining and frustrating. 
- Facebook says it's easy to transition between roles and teams but I found that to not be true. That's another reason why I left. It may be easier on the engineering side. Additionally, being a remote office truly limits your networking and career opportunities (even if they tell you otherwise). 
- I had more managers than I could count in one year. The turnover was way too high and I didn't feel like anyone was invested in me. I wasn't growing and as an early career professional, growth is my top priority.
- Facebook is a global company and most of its users are outside of the US. However, the mindset is still extremely American and I frankly found the way in which people talked about users outside of the US to be downright offensive at times. There was no desire to get to deeply understand user behavior and market trends outside of the US. Given how the world economy is trending, Facebook will be in a bad position if employee mindsets don't change. There are companies all over the world (especially in Asia) that are taking over (and have already taken over) the spaces Facebook is trying to break into as of late.
- A combination of unclear expectations and high manager turnover led to not-stellar performance reviews for me. 
- People always said I could work on what interested me and what I was good at but whenever I tried to do so, I was shut down."

- The projects you're able to work on are high impact projects more often than not.
- Everyone is passionate about their work and incredibly good at what they do. I learned a crazy amount this past summer.","- The work culture is largely self-driven. There's no particular structure or strict schedule for getting work done, so if you're not self-motivated, you could fall behind without much consistent feedback for your performance.

Culture and work/life balance opportunities). The management team looks down on everyone. No one can advance beyond an entry level position. You get an idea that gets bought or get stuck in an entry level type job for your ""career"" with barely above avg pay rates. I know that this is a competitive industry but sometimes the stupid people win just because they have the right connection. Bad employees stay while realistic workers realize the mistreatment and all leave within a year. I'm not making this up. Go look up Facebook's overall turnover ratio and tell me how that could lead to happy employees. Every SINGLE person on my initial project was lied to about their working hours (expect 9-5 and told 9-5 then made work overnight/graveyard shifts), benefits (only get to go on campus when with a supervisor), and team management. Too often we are told that our ideas will be considered then a manager gets promoted to a new project for spearheading such an idea."

However, because Facebook hires strong talent at EVERY position, in some cases where strong talent is hired in positions that aren't core to the success of the business (read: if you're not an engineer, product manager, or maayyyybeeee a key sales person), it can be frustrating as your job is just not that important to the company's success. Hungry, ambitious people in these sorts of situations (as Facebook tends to recruit) can get disengaged and frustrated by these facts."

2808,Meta,Pleasantly Surprised,2016-02-16,5.0,Site Selection Program Manager,"I'm a 55 year old working in a company where the average age is 28, and I've never been happier. I have always wanted to work in a company where I wasn't the proverbial square peg, and after nearly 30 years in the work force, I believe that I have found the company that complements my ideology for how a company should operate. Here are the ""Pros"" as I see them...

- Leadership:  Mark Zuckerberg, Sheryl Sandberg, Chris Cox and the rest of the leadership team. Inspiring, smart and totally real.
- The Culture:  The openness is a real thing, we're trusted to do the right thing, mistakes are expected, being yourself is important and encouraged, humility is encouraged and expected, building trust is paramount, the mission of making the world a more open and connected place isn't just a cool phrase because it guides everything. It's not about us, it's about everyone else.
- The People:  Smart and nice is what I find. The diversity is better than any other company I've worked at and it's getting better. Those that are figuring out how to make what we do better for everyone are really good at implementing their ideas. Two years ago I didn't know what this company really was or if it had a secure future. I can clearly see now that they have what it takes to last, and it's sincere.
- Management:  Managers are hired because they're good managers and not because they're good at something else. The management track is different than the contributor track and they're equal in importance.
- Benefits:  Working in the Valley it's hard to differentiate all the benefits employees receive and Facebook is at least equal to all the major tech companies, but coming from Seattle the benefits are nothing short of incredible.

Granted, I haven't been with the company for very long and I'm still in the honeymoon period, but I can tell what's real and what's not; this place is for real.","Like any tech company, the work is big and complicated so work/life balance can suffer from time to time. The difference is that it's the passion within the individuals that drives them to work long hours and forego time off. Of course there can be times when schedule demands force the imbalance, but it's not such that 10-12 hours days become commonplace and expected regardless. We do what we do to get the job done; no one is killing themselves because there's an order to do so.

Being able to eat to your hearts/stomachs content can be dangerous to the waistline, but that's a self-control thing and not the company's issue."
2809,Meta,Fortunate to work for this company.,2016-02-15,5.0,Technical Recruiter,"A company that truly takes care if its people! The benefits, the compensation, the perks but above all its the people that make this place great.",Experiencing huge growth. You need to be able to adapt to change easily and be patient as the groom new leaders.
2810,Meta,Continuous Improvement,2016-02-15,5.0,Software Engineer,"I've been at Facebook for more than six years.  The culture is very introspective and dedicated to self-improvement; if it were the same company it had been in 2009, I wouldn't still be there.  Everytime I think I might leave, a new awesome project comes up that keeps me around.  Seeing Mark Zuckerberg mature into the great leader he is has been magical, and I have a lot of trust in Sheryl and Mark and Mike Schroepfer to make good decisions.  
In many ways, engineers are more productive now than they were in 2009, despite the fact that we work at a big company now.  We have more tools, resources, and knowledgeable people at our disposal, which compensates to some degree for the increased bureaucracy you see in some parts of the company.  We also launch to hundreds-of-millions-to-billions of users, depending on the product, making our contributions very high-value.  Product launches continue to be driven by bottom-up ideas as much as top-down directives.  That doesn't mean that you personally are going to have an idea which shakes the world, but it does mean that you have a better shot than other companies.
Especially if you're an infrastructure engineer, the culture is very bottom-up.  You still have great latitude to come up with execute your own ideas.  The flipside of this coin is that if you're not good at deciding what to work on, you'll need to learn that skill within a year or so; management isn't going to spoonfeed you tasks to the extent they do at other large companies.
When joining Facebook as an engineer, you will still have many many choices of which team to join, and you'll make that decision after a few weeks of ""bootcamp"" which means you'll have an informed choice.  It also means that the quality of engineers is high throughout the company because every person comes through the same interviewing process.
One of my favorite aspects of Facebook culture is focusing on impact rather than hard work. Another is a recognition that you can advance your career without going into management, and that there are many different kinds of talent.  There are several different ""archetypes"" of senior individual contributors that are recognized and encouraged to flourish.","Facebook has become more careful in certain core areas like Newsfeed, Timeline, Ads, and Platform.  There are many stakeholders on these products and thus you've got to get a lot more things buttoned up before you can launch a product change in these core areas.  We still do experiments but not quite as freely as before.  Just understand that the more impact your product has, the tougher it will be to make changes, and place yourself in the company according to your preferences."
2811,Meta,Nice,2016-02-10,5.0,,"Great perks, friendly work environment, free food and gym.

2815,Meta,Product Manager,2016-02-08,5.0,Product Manager,"Freedom to explore, speaking to my counterparts at other companies like Google, Twitter, and Uber it seems that Facebook has some of the most open cultures that encourages product exploration outside of one's primary duties and helping people finding impact across the company in places of their personal interest.","Commute to San Francisco. The commute to San Francisco is unhealthy and inhibits social life. I want to live the city lifestyle, and this is a serious consideration for me.

Forth manager I had in my first four months later kept from me that the work I was hired to do was being removed from Facebook's objectives. 

Some seniors managers keep secrets and are horrible to work for. There's lots of truth to the saying, ""I joined for the company and left because of my manager."" Facebook a really, really good at selling its kool-aid story to employees. (It's why they have great ratings on Glassdoor IMO.) If you are in a position or team that is dissolved, you only have 4 weeks to find a new job, which isn't much time at all."

Terrible place if you are a mature, serious professional. The environment rewards people who like to brag, boast, and broadcast their awesomeness. If you work hard but humble and quiet, you will not succeed here. Also, management in general, refuses to fix problems with the process. Performance reviews are geared towards those brown nose the best.","It feels like a cult for young, single people. Mature professionals with families need not apply. If you do manage to join, be prepared to be surrounded by rah rah rah, lots of brown nosing, politics, eating, drinking, and going to the gym with your co-workers is almost required if you want to get ahead here. If you don't join the herd with a smile on your face, you'll certainly feel like an outcast and will be on the black list. Manager smile to your face, tell you what you want to hear, then will stab you in the back. Extremely immature organization.

2838,Meta,Facebook is Awesome,2016-01-06,5.0,Director of Engineering,Facebook has an incredibly impactful mission in the world. Possible the most important tech company of its decade. You get to learn from absolute top talent is many fields. Excellent culture lacking almost entirely in bad office politics. Great pay and benefits.,Facebook is becoming a larger company and lots of time get sunk into coordinating and selling rather than building. Life/work balance can suffer despite considerable efforts from the company to balance things.
2839,Meta,"Visionary leadership, industry experts will be your peers, the ability to impact billions, and incredible benefits",2016-01-04,5.0,Network Engineer,"I am not hyperbolizing when I say that working at Facebook is the best job I could possibly imagine.

You get to work with a visionary leadership team that is incredibly accessible and wants to hear from you. Mark's Townhall meetings grew out of the weekly Q&A that he runs internally. If you want to ask Mark Zuckerburg or Sheryl Sandberg a question you can do it. If you want to give feedback or see changes in nearly any aspect of Facebook you will be empowered to do it.

Your team will likely be comprised of industry experts in your particular area of work. From kernel hackers, PhD's in computer learning, hardware engineers building drones and our own servers, to network engineers that are helping write drafts and RFC's that define the underlying protocol architecture of the Internet - you will find everything under the sun and these people will make you so much better at what you do.

If you aren't enjoying what you're doing in your current role you can go on a Hack-a-month with another team. This lets you expand your skills working on a different set of challenges and stay on your new team when you finish, if you like the work, or head back to your old team to work on something else. The best part is that management encourages these types of moves!

The management teams empower you to work on the things you want to, and gives you the ability to impact billions of people. You work on one of the biggest platforms on the planet and you will see the results of the work you put in everyday in making it better.

Also, the benefits are pretty amazing.","Any complaints seem like extreme first world gripes given all that the company does to keep the employees happy and progressing in their positions and careers, but I do have a few.

The company will absolutely (and gladly) take as much time as you put in. They don't overly pressure you to work insane hours, but you will be surrounded by overachievers who put that pressure on themselves and create the perception that large swaths of the company are, ""always working."" This can be a blessing or curse and it is up to each individual employee to figure out the dreaded work / life balance equation for themselves.

The other issue, is that Facebook prides itself on not competing on salary, RSU's, etc. against offers from other companies. While that may seem ok in practice, it results in a revolving door (which is a bit of a Silicon Valley issue in and of itself) between other big tech companies and Facebook. We won't make counteroffers to keep people, but we'll pay them what they wanted before they left to come back which sets a bad precedent for the people who stay."

- Although coworkers are competitive here, they are much nicer to work with than other companies holding same 'elite principals'. For example, I rarely see (though there're few) arrogant people here. The whole culture was built in the sense to favor people who are both smart and humble.
- Culture encourages transparency, so you have to learn hear and accept sometimes very tough feedbacks, but you could end up growing much faster as you can tell.
- If you are good, there's no barrier on 'what you can do'. Facebook does NOT reveal your level to anyone else except your report. So you could see E3 engineers work like E4 or even E5 in the end. But in another way around, it could be tough for seniors.
- Facebook sees deliveries (executions) as 1st priority, so people here just focus on work more than the rest, I believe this is one of the biggest reasons why this company moves faster than other companies with equivalent size.
- Most of work in Facebook reaches great amount of people (1.5B in web, 1.3B in mobile), and great amount of revenue (20B of this year). So you can tell how much impact you can have, and this would to the minimum becomes a highlighting bullet point on your resume.
- People says Facebook has bad work/life balance, I don't agree: 1) you have freedom to pick a laid-back team and free to go almost anytime (they have hackamonth program and it is true), 2) most of time I see hardworking people working hard due to their own choice.","- People says Facebook has less politics, but I do feel some. Usually come from a group of people joining to same team from same company around same time.
- Culture encourages transparency, so if you're a smooth talker and avoid giving harsh feedbacks, this could become your problem in review."

2851,Meta,A dream company come true!,2015-12-09,5.0,Product Designer,"On my first day at Facebook, I remember asking myself, ""Is this company for real? How am I here? How does this company exist?"" Facebook is the epitome of the perfect company. A wise man once told me about the four Ps of the perfect employment: Product, Problem, People, Profit. 

Is the Product interesting? This product serves over 1.5 billion people - it is the most exciting product to be part of.

Is the Problem interesting? Beyond interesting. We're trying to solve making the entire world more open and connected through communication, through sharing, through education, etc... In any area of the company, the problems are all great problems to solve.

What about the People? The people are literally the best people I've ever worked with in any position I've been through. They are brilliant, kind, friendly and completely supportive. I left my last company as a senior member and at Facebook, I still feel like I'm learning something new from my colleagues every single day. Beyond my colleagues, the leadership here are more than supportive about an individual's career growth to help us grow deep within our roles, support groups to help you become a better manager, classes to help individuals transition from one career to another. I've seen many of my colleagues get the opportunity to completely change paths (e.g. Designer to Engineer, Researcher to Designer, Designer to PM, etc). You pave your own path and leadership here is supportive to help you get to where you want to be.

So what about Profit? Facebook, luckily, is doing very well in this area. At a personal level, Facebook pays also very well. I was lucky enough to have my total acquisition package matched and exceeded which made saying yes to Facebook a no brainer.

Take a great product, great people, amazing culture and a beautiful place to work and tie that all up in a bow. That is what Facebook is and I hope it never changes. I love this place!","The only con I've found is that Facebook's campus is a bit in the middle of no where but honestly with the flexible shuttle system and an all-day shuttle that goes back and forth between downtown Palo Alto, it's not so bad."

It's also nice that the company is so successful; it's motivating to know that they are moving in the right direction and have had wild success in the past","There's so much autonomy that direction from above isn't quite there. There's no product development process. The success of your product is very much up to how good your PM is or whatever process the team has lifted from other companies.

They indicated that no contractors could ever offer value; contractors were viewed as an extra pair of hands. However, my role was specifically to provide expertise and coaching in my domain area. The junior/mid-level staff never solicited feedback and assumed only their ideas were useful. Just because people say they are open to feedback does not make it so. I got unsolicited feedback constantly at FB: everyone has an opinion and thinks it's valuable. But, not once did anyone ever ask for my feedback. In that sense, and many others, it's a hypocritical environment. 

If you're junior or less than 15 years in your job, FB is probably a good place to grow. If you're more experienced, be sure you carefully evaluate the job. My experience is that I wasn't working with the best or brightest, more often they were the narrow-minded, arrogant and entitled.

Finally, in the area I worked, it was all about blame and pointing fingers when things went wrong. And because they hate processes, of course things would go wrong."

Focus on impact means that you have flexibility to get work done when and how you choose. Quality of people we hire is outstanding, coupled with low egos. Love the 'focus on strengths' mentality which means your role often shifts to make sure you are spending the most time doing what you love. Lots of support and training for managers at FB, although the individual contributor role is equally valued - becoming a manager is a lateral move (and a deliberate choice) at FB rather than a reward for being awesome in an IC role.","Personally I love the concept of bringing my authentic self to work and being personal friends with coworkers, but I understand that it's not for everyone.

-Autonomy to work 100% independently, authority to make huge decisions that shape the business, and pretty near perfect manager and leadership support. 
-Quite literally the smartest, hardest working and most competent people I've worked with in every facet of the company (including start-ups, mature companies, and post-start up tech companies). 
- Low tolerance of BS, low tolerance of ""everything is amazing, everyone is perfect"" when things can be improved. 
- The org moves fast with people issues, low performance (when appropriate), and childish behavior (very very low tolerance for this). 
- Incredibly lean orgs, especially in HR, so you really have the ability to own a business from end to end. 
- Low tolerance for politics or front stage/back stage behavior. 
- Best HR team I've ever worked with including the best manager I've ever worked with. Full of high performing, no jerk, high wit peers at the top of their game.","- Incredibly lean - At least on the non-tech side of the house we could easily add 5 more HRBP's/HRG's and still be understaffed. The pro is way more opportunity for impact, the con is that you just cant get to every org, manager or employee that could be optimized with some extra attention. 
- Comfort in the gray - Being successful at Facebook means being comfortable without always having a process, policy, or system to fall back on. The bonus is it leaves more freedom for judgement, the down side is first ever decisions can feel like they're policy setting (even if no policy is created)"
2891,Meta,Perks Beyond Comprehension and an Opportunity to Change the World,2015-10-05,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"If the reviews here sound like employees are really drinking the Kool-Aid...it's because many of them are.  The people at this company genuinely believe they're changing the world by connecting it, and that mission and set of values permeate everything they do.  

-Unbelievable benefits and compensation.  Seriously, some of their benefits are mind-blowing.  Gym benefits, free (really good) food everywhere, amazing healthcare and family planning and daycare benefits (including a ""baby bonus""), access to incredible company events and speakers, generous vacation time that they're constantly encouraging you to actually use, the latest phones and computers for work use, on-site doctor and dentist that are actually good...the list goes on and on.  
- Strong company culture and values.  I've never been at a company that lives and breathes a mission so completely.  Am constantly in meetings where coworkers are asking, ""Is this the right decision for the people who use Facebook?"".  Even the way they treat their contingent workers (who receive better benefits than most of the tech sector's contingent employees do) makes this evident; there are internal communication groups where full-time employees are constantly asking what more we could be doing for contingent workers to show our appreciation for their work. Both internally and externally, the ""#shiplove"" mantra is strong here.
-Work/life balance.  You'll see some mixed reviews on this point, but I've been here a year (non-engineering role) and I've never had the level of work/life balance I've had here.  I work a very consistent 9-5, and it's rare when I have to fire up my laptop at home at night or over the weekends.
-Facilities.  It's Facebook!  The campus is gorgeous, and they allow visitors.  Hosting out-of-town friends and family for lunch or dinner is a great perk.
-Efficient and fast.  Fewer politics than many other companies of this size.  A lot of the day-to-day communication and work gets done on the Facebook platform, which is hugely efficient and easy to use system.
-The future!  These guys have their hands in a lot of cookie jars, and are working on some really amazing stuff.  Whether you're working on things like bringing internet access to the third world, virtual reality products, artificial intelligence that will serve peoples' needs, or all of the innovative things that go on inside the regular ol' Facebook app that serves over a billion people a day, chances are you're working on something really cool.
-Women's leadership.  I've also never been at a company that really understands women's needs as much as Facebook does (I think we owe this to the leadership of Sheryl Sandberg, Lori Goler and Maxine Williams).  They encourage an ongoing dialogue about women's issues in the workplace, have mothers' rooms all around campus, encourage us all to take a ""Managing Bias"" course (which is really eye-opening, on many levels) and even host a yearly Women's Leadership Day, which is truly empowering.  They bring in amazing speakers for this event and out of everything I've experienced in my first year here, this was probably the event that stayed with me the most.","-Entitlement.  After you've worked here for a while, it's easy to get entitled.  I'd say 95% of employees keep their feet on the ground and appreciative and gracious about the benefits they receive, but the entitlement plus the company's culture of open feedback (""feedback is a gift"") occasionally breeds inane complaints in internal communication groups.
-That commute.  If you live in SF, you'll have to hike down to Menlo Park, and depending upon where you're coming from and how bad traffic is that day, it could be as bad as 2 hours each day.  The good news:  that's rare, and company-provided transportation options (shuttles with WiFi) make this as easy as possible.  You do get used to it, and your time on the shuttle is your own.  Sure, you can do work, but you can also nap, watch Netflix, or read."

- commute. UGH
-Need to do better with giving back (as a company and as employees). I know our CEO has donated gazillions- but we need programs that allow employees to donate and have funds matched, and allow employees to volunteer their time.

I've been here for almost 3 years now and never once have I felt that my work has gotten stale. I think this is very important for facilitating personal and professional growth.
-The people I work with every day are not only some of the smartest people I know, but they are my friends and people I chose to hang out with outside of work. Facebook encourages all employees to be their authentic selves which translates to a much more relaxed and social work environment. It's work hard play hard and it's awesome being able to work people you actually want to spend time with.
-The perks are unreal. Everything from free food and laundry to awesome healthcare plans. It's actually kind of ridiculous. Their focus is on convenience benefits to help with work life balance.","-Always attached to Facebook. Let's face it, I did this before I started working here anyway.
-Lots of information. Sometimes it can be tough to keep track of all of the things that are changing. We have internal groups for everything and it can get a little intense trying to follow it all."

2. Brilliant people to work with.
3. Awesome work culture.
4. Even though it's a large company, you still feel important.
5. You are encouraged to move fast, without taking pressure which is an awesome combination, especially for a Software Engineer.
6. Awesome management, HR and all the supporting teams. They really make the life easy.","1. Work can sometimes be overwhelming for some people. However, to me, it seems like it is a product of their own working style. No doubt, there is a lot of work going on at a rapid pace, but you are always free to complete it at your own pace and your team is always there, ready to help you.

2909,Meta,Amazing company to work at,2015-09-21,5.0,Program Lead,"Great company with an amazing culture. You work hard, the pace is fast, expectations are high, and change is constant, but Facebook really looks after its employees and provides a diverse array of opportunities for self development, cross-functional training and career growth. The CEO meets with all employees once a week and answers anyone's questions.

Most people here are energetic and passionate about their work and seriously focused on making an impact. The work environment is physically (and culturally) very open: open spaces, no offices, casual dress, etc. Work/life balance is respected and encouraged and you have the flexibility to work in the way that best matches your individual style and needs. Face-to-face communication is highly valued but meetings are generally focused on not time-wasting activities. Anyone can suggest a new feature or improvement and be part of the team that makes it happen. There is a lot of opportunity for high performers to grow their careers. The compensation, benefits and perks are truly above par. 

One of the most important things for me is the open culture and the way Facebook encourages employees to find and be our authentic selves, and to listen to the voices of others who may be different from ourselves. The company works very hard to create a diverse and welcoming environment for all.","It may be hard to adjust in the first few months if you're used to working in a traditional company. You can't sit in a corner and work alone - cross functional teamwork and building relationships are the norm. Facebook is always in the public spotlight, and this is one of the things you'll have to learn to deal with if you want to work here. And you'll have to get used to spending more time on Facebook. :-)"

It's great that one person can find support and quickly get resources allocated to their cause if it's justified.","One of the consequences of the flat, disparate teams and ""move fast"" philosophy is that multiple teams may be duplicating work and competing internally, or just faltering in a disorganized fashion."

With growth comes empire building and people will fight for ownership of your team's work.  You see team's shifting scope and grabbing land.  You have to be fierce and aggressive to win.  That has always been the case at Facebook - just look at what types of people get into leadership roles.

I've had better and worse managers, but one unifying theme is that they all have good intentions, which I can't say for every manager I've had in my short career.","- Salary growth can be somewhat linear...and the y-axis (what you start off at), has more weight than it should for a young company.

You have great IT services and productivity tools that make the day-to-day of getting work done easy.","- Management at the manager level is full of many inexperienced managers who are looking to try their hand at management. I don't think it's working that well. They don't back up their direct reports and are afraid to make any sort of decision. 

- Decision making by groups...while in theory is nice and probably worked a few thousand employees ago makes things slow down now. Empower your people and embrace accountability and responsibility. 

- Politics are king, if you can navigate them well, you'll do well on certain teams as it is rampant. Favorites are played and it's more about what you say you're doing then what you actually are doing. 

- Plan but don't execute - executing is for low level people, senior folks plan strategically with a holistic view and full context....yeah all that garbage talk is for real though. Seriously, depends on the team and role, but getting ""stuff"" done could be seen in a bad light."

Very talented individual contributors (and/or good at politics) are being promoted. As a result, instead of having well rounded managers, you end up having either extremely career driven or super awkward managers. Some of those middle managers are very green, making it even more painful.

Most companies have a mission; some say they follow it, and extremely few are actually mission led. Facebook truly believes in making the world more open and connected; including those people who aren't even online yet. Every role and department ladders back to that. 

In advertising sales, we have the goal of building our client's businesses by connecting them to the consumers who matter to them. More importantly, we ensure that people on Facebook are seeing ads that are relevant and high quality, this delivers shared value both for the advertiser and the end person using our products. We also have proven and measurable results across verticals, which drives continued client interest and adoption. 

Having come from another founder led company, Mark is incredibly brilliant, open, honest and hard working. He surrounds himself with fantastic people, listens carefully, cares about the people who work for him, and makes long view decisions for the health of the company. 

Management and the people who work at Facebook follow leadership's example, everyone rolls up their sleeves to get the work done, and is incredibly grateful to be here. 

As a woman it's also inspiring and impactful to have female leadership at all levels, and colleagues who are incredibly encouraging. I personally experienced this when a male peer encouraged me to apply for a management position on our team. He referenced the known bias that women are less likely to apply if they don't have 100% of qualifications vs. men who take it as a suggestion. Beyond gender, the entire company strives for diversity and acceptance.","You have to be very self driven to succeed. Seeking out and maintaining internal relationships is critical for success. If you enjoy titles, offices and structure, this is not the place for you! 

We have a saying at Facebook, ""nothing is someone else's problem"". That means you might be having a CMO level meeting with a client, and then helping clean up the meeting trash afterwards."

2983,Meta,Landslide win over Google for career growth,2015-05-01,5.0,Software Engineer,"I just left Google and joined Facebook, and felt so much happier. The reasons are:

1. The real impact
At Google I joined a team whose product is only used by less than 1000 people, and even for that product I was assigned to do a peripheral part, whose functionality actually doesn't matter at all. Just for that module, I had to write unit test for every silly part of the code, and took long iteration cycles. I admit those are good engineering coding trainings, however taking precious time in my life to work on something that doesn't matter is just a waste of my life.

In Facebook things just move so much faster. There are standard software engineering review process but not as rigid. Just during training (boot camp) weeks, I had tasks to change very important part of Facebook's core code, and the second day after I check-in my code, it got shipped to almost 1 billion people. As a software engineer I cannot recall a moment I felt better for my job.

Then I joined a team that's extremely important to Facebook's revenue. A mistake in the code I changed could cause Facebook million dollar a day. However Facebook just trusted us, allowed us making mistake and having quick iteration cycles to test ideas fast. If I make a coding mistake in my team in Google it might cost Google nothing in terms of revenue as my product was small, however the development process was so strict I could not have chance to try my innovations or test my ideas. But in Facebook that's all possible.

2. The organizational structure
Google's organization is now very structured and hierarchical. Facebook is having more layers, but the working style is still flat, and social-network style. Speaking to people in different teams, form an idea, lead a virtual team and complete it, this style is still valued. My boss is more like a mentor helping me navigating through the ideas, rather than an authority telling me what to do.","1. I don't quite like the office decoration style. A little bit stressful and factory like.
2. The compensation is better than Google but not as good as other smaller companies.
3. Despite good acquisitions for solidify the position in social media, social networks, there is still uncertainty about the future of this company."

2988,Meta,Not for Everyone,2015-04-12,2.0,Software Engineer,Perks & pay are top notch. Some of the engineers are truly talented.,"As the title says, FB is not for everybody IMO. The recent set of 1-star ratings list pretty much all the things that made me leave: questionable work-life-balance, no planning/structure, arrogant/ignorant coworkers, every man for himself/every woman for herself, cliques, political, inept managers, poor communication/rumor mill/back-stabbing, no teamwork, management by attention-deficit disorder.

The work-life-balance issue goes beyond the mere hours: it is expected that you become FB friends with all your coworkers, managers, etc. FB makes it impossible for the realm of your private life to remain separate from your workplace and coworkers. This wasn't working for me, but I recognize that for others this isn't an issue.

It seemed to me that much that is broken at FB is perpetuated by the in-clique and in fact gets sold as the great achievements of FB's unique culture."
2989,Meta,Team Lead,2015-04-10,4.0,Team Lead,Smart people. Cutting edge technologies. Amazing food.,"Some huge, out-of-control egos in management, especially at the middle layers. Couple that with the general immaturity of the company and you'll see some very poor judgement and ""Game of Thrones"" style politics in a few departments. 

Average tenure of a staff engineer is about 4 years - mostly because after the initial stock grants vest there is near zero incentive for anyone under a Director level to stay any longer.

Culture creates and fosters entitled whiners - so much so that it is a running joke inside the company, with groups such as ""Patently Absurd Requests for Facebook Offices"" making fun of it all. But then again, this company is largely made up of the ""participation trophy"" generation, who have been told they were super-special since they were born. Being hired by Facebook amplifies that self-esteem level well beyond eleven. 

It is never spoken about, but staff turnover is huge. The washout rate of n00bs is likely around 40%. Truly talented staff move around, so team continuity is rare. 

Zero work-life balance - unless you happen to have a kid while working there."

Projects: Every team is understaffed, so there is a ton of incredibly important work to do everywhere. Because of this, you can work on high-impact (and potentially high-visibilty) projects from Day 1.

Autonomy: I've always felt extremely trusted in both my technical competency and prioritization skills. Management is (generally) helpful when I want help, but mostly I've been able to do my own thing and work on whatever project feels most important to the company and/or interesting to me.

People: Everyone is really smart, and most people are really friendly, funny, and generally awesome to hang out with.

Food: Amazing. Healthy options are phenomenal, as are the unhealthy ones.

Gym: The staff is incredible.

So much more!","- Stress: The company likes to run slim. As mentioned in the pros above, this means you're always working on impactful projects, but it also means your team is understaffed and you may have to work some nights and weekends to get stuff done (though definitely not as bad as the previous strartup I worked for). The more teams you work with, the worse this can get, since some people love to load up on meetings during the day.

Egos: There are some people who are really full of themselves and difficult to work with. This happens anywhere I've been, but there's a special brand of self-importance among some folks here. Fortunately, I've never had to work too closely with these people, but they make their presence known."

Open culture encourages everyone to know exactly what's going on internally. For engineers, you have a wide range of team choices, and you are given the opportunity to learn something completely new.

Opportunities for growth happen very quickly from what I have seen and people genuinely care about each other. The open environment encourages you to step out of your comfort zone.","Work life balance, or lack thereof. This will depend on your team. There are teams that work long hours and weekends just because they love what they do, or they want to meet a deadline, etc. It can be difficult to have work life balance with smaller teams, but it can be easier to control with a larger team. 
There are a handful of negative people at the company that look down on interns or new hires even though they themselves just started a few months ago. Some people get very sensitive about the products they own, even if they are just internal tools, and are surprisingly very unopened to criticism. 
In the end, it's about the money. If a product is doing very well, there will be a huge hiring push, which can be overwhelming at times."

I must say I have been pleasantly surprised to see how everyone employed here has been living the company values. There is a lot of focus on moving fast, making mistakes and correcting upon your mistakes. People and processes are very open that makes decision making super fast. There is little to no room for people who want to do things in the dark. You can feel the proximity to Zuck's decisions.","If you are looking for cubical or office type privacy this place is not for you. If you like to keep your personal and professional life, that doesn't happen much here.

3042,Meta,A Management Nightmare,2014-11-09,1.0,Manager,Looks great on your resume. Lots of perks (if that's what moves you). Interesting story to tell your friends.,"If you're a manager, this place will drive you nuts. Employees are snarky, entitled, and disrespectful brats. They have no concept of critical thinking or any desire to do real work. 

Unlimited sick days in the hands of overpaid children is impossible to manage, my team would somehow always manage to catch a ""cold"" on Fridays and Mondays. (Interesting that they would Tweet and post about their weekend party binges though.)

While Facebook does a great job recruiting Ivy League talent, I was underwhelmed by the level of intelligence of ""Facebookers."" They are so busy congratulating themselves on being ""awesome"" that they never stop to consider they didn't have any real world work experience to back that assertion up. It's really hard to manage and lead people who ""know it all.""

Kitchy inspirational posters everywhere you look. ""Be Bold!"" ""Dare Greatly!"" Yet, I didn't see any substantive work or product coming out of anyone, which makes sense since Facebook really is just a glorified website - users are the product.

Communication is an absolute nightmare. You are forced to ""friend"" everyone you work with and join an incessant amount of internal group pages where you had to filter through all the BS people would post (memes, YouTube videos, snarky hipster comments…clearly these people didn't have enough work to do) to get to any relevant work related information you needed to know for your job. I actually thought I was going to get dumber working there.

Meetings - the sheer volume was mind bending. None of them critical to doing actual work, more self congratulating on unearned awesomeness. Being social at Facebook was far more important than doing anything meaningful while you were there. 

Anyone serious about doing meaningful work need not apply. You'll make it a few months and then quit out of frustration."
3043,Meta,Great Place to Work,2014-11-07,5.0,Platform Manager,"Driven Culture, very few politics, lots of perks, Facebook tries to maintain the start up culter and allow massive amounts of freedom to shape your own job and your own work.  The review system can be the best getting honest peer review feedback that makes your work better.","sometimes too demanding, no life half of work life balance.  Its a driven and competitive culture the person sitting next to you doing 12 hours days and weekends will get ahead faster.  The bar is high the demands are high and there are no rewards for failure.  Doing the same thing this year that you did last year is considered failure.  Its not a good place for folks with lives and kids out side of work.  The review system can be the worst with nepotistic back scratching in an echo chamber."

Perks are amazing, but they're made so you don't stress with the little details of life -> I work less hours in average than my previous top-company-job but achieve a lot more in that time.
No micro management overall (obviously there are black sheep everywhere) -> you do need to know how to prioritize and work by yourself without being pushed though
Mission and vision that matter to the world -> ""Don't be evil"", eh? Right. Here we're truly connecting the world. Very few teams focus on revenue, which is awesome.
Excellent compensation -> do I need to say more?

3056,Meta,Facebook set me up for success,2014-09-26,5.0,Engineering Manager,"Facebook is a top tech company like Google, LinkedIn, Apple and many others. All of these companies offer basically the same thing: great engineers, good money, free food, impacting zillions of people and interesting tech problems. Facebook has a few things that set it apart:

1. Open-ness. Root on every box, access to every source repo. I very rarely had to wait to receive credentials to do anything. At other jobs you're often blocked sitting at your desk for a few days waiting for access to some repository.

2. Control over your career. You don't get hired into a specific team -- you choose it (in recent years they've added a list of teams you can choose from, but there's still a lot of variety). And if you get bored or feel stalled, you're encouraged to switch teams.

I don't think other companies offer those things. The real list of pros is huge, but since they could be applied to other companies I don't include them here.

The only reason I left is because I always wanted to start my own startup. Otherwise I would have stayed forever.","With everyone switching teams all the time there is often a lot of lost tribal knowledge. So there's parts of the codebase that no one understands anymore.

Since the Great Shift to Mobile there's been a focus on quality at the expense of moving fast. I really liked the Move Fast and Break Things mentality of Facebook when I joined, and though people disagree with me, I prefer it to the ""don't ship it until it's perfect"" mentality (I think many of the independent Facebook apps waited too long to launch).

Another thing that no one will agree with me on is the work-life balance. I have noticed a trend of people working less, hackathons running during the day, etc. I think your average employee is less driven and moves slower than a few years ago. This used to be a place where people were obsessed with shipping above all else. It isn't that anymore. This is a pro for some people but not for me. I'm giving it a 5 because I think it's good for your life, not because I agree with that balance."
3057,Meta,"Very fast-paced, lots of impact.",2014-09-22,5.0,Communications,"The fact that Facebook's product touches 1.3 BILLION people on a monthly basis is incredible. To support a community this large, everyone who works at Facebook must be willing to act fast, and often take risk. You are given a lot of autonomy in your role; however, FB is also surprisingly collaborative. I have never worked at a company where literally everyone I work with is equally as smart and hard-working across the board.","There are tons of resources for training and leadership here, but often not enough time to take advantage of everything that is offered."

You're surrounded by an astounding number of really smart, accomplished people who are really dedicated to the company and its mission of connecting the world. Watching the company grow as the product grew from fewer than 50 million users to well over a billion in a few years was an astounding feat. 

It's a work hard, play hard place. During my time there, the layers of management did grow, but the organization really strove to stay as nimble and fast-moving as possible. Most of the time, people are recognized and rewarded for their impact. 

The perks are up there with the rest of the top Silicon Valley companies. And I really do miss taking a shuttle to work now.","Depending upon your role, you can find your growth options limiting. 

The ""work hard"" half of the ethos can really burn some people out. (then again, I guess the ""play hard"" side could do the same...)

Mid management gets packed with responsibilities, the individual contribution is no longer relevant, the general philosophy seems to be ""it's normal for people to leave the company"" and that happens regularly after every performance cycle or stock vesting time. 
To counterbalance this, company seems to brainwash employees with slogans, posters are everywhere around the office to make ""the culture"", many company employees believe and talk with slogans.

I suspect I will rate FB  #1 by next year. The work is intellectually challenging, the environment is fast-paced, and the people I work with are excellent.  FB has its eye on the ball at all times for its core platform yet is always looking at other opportunities for growth, though they may take several years to bear fruit.  Management is open and accessible, particularly the weekly Q&A's with MZ and the leadership team - I've never experienced senior executives sharing that much information with an entire company before.  Colleagues are easy to work with - not a lot of ego or politics that I've seen.  In fact, we are reminded to check our ego as we enter the building - there is a lot of cooperation here.
The benefits & perks are really amazing - I don't think college hires or interns truly appreciate what is offered here unless they have worked for other employers.  (You can never take these things for granted, so I really appreciate these perks.)  And the total compensation structure seems very competitive - they have many dials and buttons to play with, and I feel I am well-compensated for my contributions. 
The commute benefits are excellent, and make it really easy to use transit, shuttles or vanpools.  Driving to work is just so stressful, both ways.  I'd really rather not.","Long hours away from home, due to my own commute situation and long working hours.  But since I've only been here less than a year, it's important to show results early.

3076,Meta,Amazing culture built by great people,2014-08-22,5.0,Software Engineer,"In my opinion, Facebook operates under a policy of extreme trust and respect for its employees.

This makes getting the job done a much less painful experience.  Truly an ""ask for forgiveness"" environment (no need to ask for permission).  If there was no downside (which there is), I would give this company a rating of 5 stars hands down.","Facebook is still in its teenage years of development.  While many HR processes & policies are mature (the hiring process is best I've seen), fraternization is overlooked (aka sex between coworkers, sometimes even in the office itself) and relationships within chain of command are accepted/overlooked - yet don't dare say ""pimp my ride"" in an open space as you will get your hands slapped."

Going to work is a ton of fun. I look forward to tackling new problems each day.,The work schedule is pretty intense. Nice thing is that everyone works really hard here.

3110,Meta,Drink the koolaid,2014-04-06,5.0,Software Engineer,"Facebook is definitely a great place to work.  If you're young (or not) and energetic, you can still do big things here.  As an engineer, you still have a lot of control over the direction of your product, at least on the teams I've experienced.  I think management is pretty good here as well, and you definitely work with really great engineers.  The pay is great, the benefits are awesome, you are largely treated well, but this is a company you can definitely bite into too hard and overwork yourself.  The place is still a lot more open internally than other corporate machines, less so since going public.  Also, you get the sense that Mark has a vision, and really wants to execute on that.  Time will tell if the spur of acquisitions lately are worth it, but he definitely has the balls to act on where he thinks the product is moving.","I think it says a lot that I can't think of a lot of cons.  AND I'm planning to leave the company this year.

-There are a lot of egos here.  Definitely not representative of everyone, but some people slip through the cracks and it can be a drain working with them.
-The company is starting to feel really big.  It's getting harder and harder to do anything very different as you have to convince more and more people that this is a good idea.
-If you're living in SF, then the location is pretty inconvenient.  That and you'll just shove all your free FB swag in a drawer and never look at it again with all the tech protests lately.  You can stand out on your team and do a great job at FB, or have a life outside of work.  Choose one.  I chose the former for too long, and now need to reprioritize."
3111,Meta,"Still trying to be a start up even though we're a big company. Still fun, smart and a great place to be",2014-03-26,5.0,Technical Project Manager,"Fun culture, super smart people, great benefits (for non married folks), still retains the ""let's do everything at a breakneck speed"" mentality. The hierarchy is still pretty flat. You are always in charge of your destiny so it's pretty much up to you to step up or sit down. If you sit down too long, you won't last. This is a company of doers, not debaters. There is opportunity everywhere as long as you have the attitude to do something with it. Most everyone is incredibly helpful.","Moving fast doesn't always mean doing it right - While you're pretty much allowed to try anything, as a large company, we should slow down and mature some of the processes in order to maintain a high quality of shipped products as opposed to letting the culture of ""fail fast"" cause duplicate work."
3112,Meta,"Open, fast, no bs",2014-03-17,5.0,Software Development Engineer,"It might be easy to roll your eyes when people from Facebook say how open their culture is, but it's true; it's more open than any other place I've worked at. At a company wide-level, secret projects, public incidents, important non-public business metrics and the like are all openly discussed. You can ask questions about them directly to Zuckerburg at the weekly Q&A. I think the idea is that if everyone is on the same page or at least, differing views are heard, the company will be stronger, and solutions may be offered from a place you didn't expect. This is much different from previous companies I worked at, where discussions on internal email lists would be shut down by some lawyer saying that there's certain things that can't be discussed, and important data is divided up to groups and individuals on a ""need to know"" basis, etc. 

This culture applies at a lower level too. You feel comfortable giving feedback to each other about each other, about product decisions, about management, etc. The flipside of this openness is that you of course, have to be willing to receive the feedback, you have to recognize that while openness and feedback is highly encouraged, decisions have to get made, and actions and data are more valuable than words. At the higher level, since the company trusts employees with access to so much information, keeping such info confidential from the outside world is taken seriously.

It's a great place to work as an engineer. You're given a lot of freedom, but it's also a responsibility to make sure you're doing things that are valuable. You don't get much credit for working hard or being smart if you don't produce valuable output.

One cool thing about Facebook, in contrast to other comparable companies (Google, Amazon, and Microsoft, though in truth, FB is much smaller), is how they have a pretty singular focus. Even with the differing areas (including advertising and such), they do a good job of keeping their eye on their mission of connecting as many people as possible. I also think they are way more empathetic to their users than most people give them credit for. It seems like popular opinion has it that FB is arrogant and only cares about its users insomuch as they represent $-signs. From within the company, it didn't feel this way at all. I saw a lot of empathy towards users, and a lot effort spent to improve or things or fix broken things with no direct financial benefit. The strategy is not complex. The thinking is that if they can make FB easier and more fun to use, then more people will use it for more time each day (which will also have a network effect of attracting even more people to use it), then the advertising dollars will follow. Of course, it is true that FB wants to make the audience more accessible to advertisers as well, but there are a lot of people at FB who care about privacy and security.

They have really good infrastructure and really great ways to share the infrastructure and code. They have a lot of cool internal tools, and what they've built is really impressive, and more importantly, it helps your team build products faster without having to solve problems that someone else already solved. Every software company tries to do this, but FB seems to have been more successful with it. Perhaps it's because they're still relatively small, but if anything, I can at least say it is very cool while it lasts.

The perks and work environment are great, unless you're one of those types that can't stand open office spaces. I've worked in both a private office and open offices in multiple companies. While I do think a private office has some benefits, I mostly think it's a personal luxury for the employee and a huge waste of money for the company. I'd much rather have the money go into other areas like salary, benefits, and other workplace improvements rather than the added real estate necessary to have offices.

Of course, you've heard about the food and snacks. They have an amazing selection of great stuff, and what I like about it is that it sort of goes above and beyond expectations. Sure, some days, lunch is better than others, but I really can't complain, and the selection of drinks and snacks is amazing. It's not like you should work at FB just because of that, but it demonstrates FB's desire to make work as fun and convenient as possible.

You'll be surrounded by people who like being there. I can't think of a better environment to work in. If you have a giant ego, you may not like it as much. Respect is definitely given to those that have deep experience in the industry, and they are expected to lead others and mentor more junior employees. However, if for whatever reason, you can't perform at the level expected, no one is going to care if you did this and that at Google or shipped ten things at MS, etc.

FB also has a lot of fun events, and I made a lot of friends working there, so going to the events was fun. Also, if you're older and worried that FB is just a bunch of 22-year-olds, and that you won't fit in, I wouldn't worry about that. FB does have a lot of young employees (who are really smart btw), and it does hire a lot of people straight out of college, but it also attracts a lot of experienced engineers from other top companies like Google, MS, Amazon, etc.

Work-life-balance seemed totally normal to me. It may be different depending on your team, but I felt you could do 40-50 hours of work a week for the most part and you would be totally fine. It's about what you produce, not how hard you're working. Other team members who had children would work normal hours and go home at normal times. I didn't see any of these folks have a problem when they left early to take care of their child or things like that. Of course, there could be times that people are expected to work extra if something critical happens, but for the most part everyone wants to avoid this and this happens sparingly, from what I observed. Now, there were many times where I chose to work late myself, but I never felt any pressure to do so. The caveat is that there are on-call rotations, and in addition, even if you are not on-call, you are expected to be reasonably available if the on-call person needs your help. However, again, no one wants this, and your team will work on ways to avoid these situations.

The best thing I can say is that working at FB is about productivity. I didn't experience and political bs and it was a pleasure working with a group of people who were all concerned with producing a good product and making the best of the time spent while doing it.","FB expects a lot out of engineers, and you can't slack off. Of course, you shouldn't slack off at any job, but since FB is pretty fast-paced, there is a risk that you'll have trouble adjusting at first.

FB has a lot of custom infrastructure and tools, and prehaps more impressively, it works great. It makes doing your job really great, but on the other hand, you'll end up learning a lot of stuff that won't be applicable elsewhere.

FB's code-base is very good in some ways, but in other ways, it's not as great as some of the existing engineers think it is. I don't think this is that big of a deal, but the important part is that as an engineer, you need to quickly learn FB's values and practices and ""get with the program"" so to speak. If you don't like some things, then you just have to deal with it, as it's not likely you're going to change people's minds at this point. The nice thing is that things are at least very consistent."

Facebook's onboarding process is the best I've ever seen, and I've worked at a lot of other major companies. You're hired as an engineer, not as someone to fill a specific job. Then you spend your first six weeks getting to know how all of the company works, filling in small holes on code bases that you aren't familiar with (web, Android, iOS, data analysis stuff), and learning what problems in the company you most want to work on, before you pick your team.

3125,Meta,"Smart, boring people and no balance.",2014-02-12,2.0,Software Engineer,"The people are smart, and the scaling challenges are great. Where else does your code impact a billion people? The compensation is amazing.

Senior management are generally amazing people, smart, visionary and compassionate.","The focus on measuring means anything that can't be measured is ignored. It's easy to measure someone's ability to code on a whiteboard. As a result, the coders are much better than nearly everywhere I've worked, but that's it. Social skills and personality can't be measured. As a result there is no one here you would ever be friends. The internal surveys bear this point that people don't have friends at work. Similarly for managers, they are selected strictly for their technical ability. Again, they have zero compassion. In my time being here, I've never once felt like anyone cared if I was here or not. Not once has anything positive ever been said. It's really astounding.

Recruiting does an amazing job at making candidates feel wanted. That feeling disappears the moment you sign. After that, you have no manager or anyone who will care. You'll go into bootcamp where you'll have a ""mentor"". His role is to continue to do his job while counting the number of lines in your diffs to make sure you can make progress with no assistance.

After bootcamp, you'll have a manager who operates in the same mode. They are interested in the technology and not the people. To them, you are a resource to be maximized. They will tell you everything you need to do to improve, but never once say ""good job"". In boot camp, I kept meeting these amazing, visionary dynamic managers. I know realize they were the exception. Those people made me love Facebook during bootcamp, but that feeling wore off quickly once I interacted with the average line level manager.

Plus, beware of the reviews here. Recruiting will tell you point blank that they curate these reviews. The reason FB has the highest rating is because someone internally has a goal to achieve certain star ratings on this site."

Seriously, this place was built for speed. They empower the engineer and allow you to do what you need to get done without fear. At first I just assumed this was like every other corporation who claims to empower their employees and move fast. Nobody wants to move slow but Facebook is serious.

3158,Meta,Great people moving fast.,2013-10-03,5.0,Software Engineer,"Probably the most important thing about Facebook is the culture. Engineers are always free to solve problems when they see them. Generally there are no hard deadlines to meet, so you can almost always put something to the side when you think there's something more valuable to do. If you find a bug in somebody else's project, fix it. If you have an idea for a useful feature, make it. We're willing to try anything once. The agility of Facebook is amazing, because all engineers are expected to be able to help out with anything. The org is very loose.

And the benefits are fantastic. Free food, laundry, shuttle service from all over the Bay Area, and much more.","I frequently take a moment to consider what I would want to improve at Facebook, and I never come up with anything. I could see how if you were somebody who really needed structure and direction, you could get frustrated. Facebook strongly encourages engineers to try working on new things every so often so that you're always learning, and also expects autonomy."

3166,Meta,In-crowd or out the door,2013-08-02,3.0,Online Operations Associate,"Great benefits like free gym access, meals, snacks, bonus money for having kids, etc. Great technology to work with. Talented engineers create inventive tools that enable non-technical staff to do their jobs with ease.  Genuinely nice and honest people can be found in every team.","From what I've seen in my time on multiple teams here, managers come in from different companies, take over teams, hire their own friends primarily from their previous companies, and then give the promotions to those people in a very short time.  You may spend years hearing praise for the work you do, but it's never backed up with promotions.  Also, this is not a good place to work if you are at all introverted, value family life more than work life, or prefer to work a normal person's schedule. If you are in a non-technical role, you also have little chance of seeing any kind of career advancement.  Large divide in pay between people on the same teams and little transparency into the payment and growth processes.  

Additionally, most employees share a highly liberal political stance, which drives the culture in a mostly positive way, but it also requires that everyone agrees with the mindset.  Those that have differing values can expect to feel ostracized.  

Finally, the treatment of vendors and contractors (including facilities staff, janitors, kitchen staff, security guards, and receptionists, among others) by employees can be staggeringly disappointing, embarrassing, and offensive. There is so much of a sense of entitlement upon employees that many seem to view others as second-class citizens."

3168,Meta,"Make an impact, we have a long way to go",2013-07-28,5.0,Internet Marketing Analyst,"Talent - I came from working in tech in Boston and this is a standard deviation increase in talent. Projects are run by PMs who really know what they are doing with a strong skill set in strategy, engineering, data driven decision making and user experience. 
Strategic direction - Money truly is a means by which we can achieve the mission to connect the world. There are tons of bold bets and we seem to have a good balance of reacting to the marketplace and maintaining focus on executing with blinders when necessary.
Opportunity - There is so much work for really anyone to come in and make. With such rapid growth, there are bound to be mega bugs or missed opportunities ripe for fresh eyes to come in and recognize immediately.
Culture - The company values are genuine and you really do get the feel that you are working on something bigger than yourself. Getting to hear from and ask questions of Mark each week really helps makes sure everyone is in the loop and feels heard if they disagree. You are never ""out of line"" for thinking big picture or questioning strategic direction and it is in fact encouraged. There's also a ton of young people so it is great to meet friends, especially if you live in SF.","Time - There are amazing perks like really quality free food all the time, a gym on campus with a basketball court and large playing field, shuttles to SF and surrounding areas but I often find my coworkers and I spend less time on that fun stuff that you might expect. There's just so much work opportunity because you are expected to be driving on projects rather than just doing what you are told so you could theoretically work all the time and its up to you to stop that.
Company maturity - Like all fast growing companies, there is a natural curiosity around ""how much better would things be for me if I had joined earlier?"" because there would have been ever more responsibility and financial potential. Both of those things are still really high but it does raise the natural question of it would make sense to gain the skill sets to understand what makes Facebook work and then consider working somewhere smaller with more financial upside."

The job is boring. Things gets done extremely slow and the quality is very far from being perfect.

If you have a great idea and can convince others to join you, there is very little process stopping you from building awesome new stuff and shipping it to the world.  Practically everyone I know, and everyone I meet, has used the software that I've written.

The company culture and values are amazing and everyone is totally on board with them.  There is no politics or infighting and everyone is really on the same team trying to make facebook better.

Facebookers are extremely smart people and super passionate about their work.  We aren't afraid to take on new risks or big challenges.

The technology stack is mind boggling.  When I started at facebook a few years ago, every day I learned something that made my jaw drop.  The same thing still happens to me on a regular basis years later.

The company culture is richer and uplifted more-so than any other company I've worked at (including Microsoft, IBM, and NYT). We're encouraged to take control of and have ownership over our work, micro-management is micro-managed out and big-impact work is rewarded (even—no especially—if it's not sexy). 

There are few places in the world which provide the hat-trick of being an exciting place to work, provide freedom to work on what you want, and provide social and cultural impact to a significant portion of global humanity.","The biggest downside is the double-edged sword of Facebook's culture. It's easy to get lost in the whirlwind of cool stuff, great perks and exciting smart people and forget to get something done. For those cranking away, the intentional self-exploration (hackathons, etc) can result in the occasional duplicated work or dead-ends. You can't say we won't take risks and try new things, instead you could say this might happen a little too much. Also, Facebook is a pretty constant target of the media for both good and bad news. This can be a bit trying when you just want to get your job done and your friends and family are bugging you about the latest features added (or not added)."
3224,Meta,A mature culture of smart people working on the hardest and most rewarding problems,2012-11-19,5.0,Software Engineer,"The Culture:
This tops the list of reasons to work at Facebook.  Many companies say they take their culture seriously but Facebook lives it. The mantras and propaganda around the office really do help you ""stay focused and keep shipping"", by clearing away your own barriers and resolving debates.

The Impact:
My first day on the job I submitted a diff that now hundreds of millions of people see every day.  Imagining a more connected world keeps me coming in every day, because I know that I'm building that future.

The Career Opportunities:
There is no arbitrary ladder, no game mechanics, at Facebook.  Your career grows as you hack larger things.  Because you are encouraged to work across Facebook, jumping teams and technologies, you gain a variety of skills that keeps you agile and flexible.  And because Facebook is built on a lot of open source technologies, the skills you gain here are easily transferable everywhere.","Work / Life balance:
If you want to spend most of your time with your family, and work is just a job to you look elsewhere. No one keeps track of your time, but if you want to do well here you'll spend a lot of your free time thinking about the problems you're tackling."

3253,Meta,The experience of a lifetime,2012-11-14,5.0,Systems Engineer,"I left Google due to all the red tape, process, communication difficulties across teams and depts, etc.  Facebook will undoubtedly face these challenges as well as they grow, but at this current stage, they've taken more of an open, ""move fast and break things"" approach.  I love the freedom given to explore, share, collaborate, and HACK.  I didn't feel I had much of this freedom at Google - and there is much less (pretty much none) of the ""Engineer vs. Everyone else"" caste system that Google is famous for.

I am incredibly relieved, and satisfied, that I made the jump.  I've been at many of silicon valley's top tier companies in my 15 years here in SV.  After 15 years here, I have a pretty strong idea of what I want and what I don't want - so I can say with confidence that Facebook is my lifer job - I plan on staying here a WHILE.","The speed at which things move here can be daunting for the uninitiated, but if you've been at top tier companies before, it's nothing unique.  Just do your research and know what you are getting into.  There is a lot of work, and a lot of reward to be had, but only if you reach for it."

- Plenty of opportunity to make an impact, as we ship to millions of users on a short cycle with very little red tape. Not afraid to make mistakes, though of course we strongly prefer to avoid them.
- Strong overall compensation.
- Excellent on-site food options. I eat here at every opportunity.
- Fun ""work hard play hard"" internal culture. Coworkers tend to be ""from the Internet"". Many lolz are had.","- Now eating too many sweets because they're readily available.
- Sometimes feel like I joined too late (e.g., hear Proposition 30 complaints from coworkers, doesn't apply to me).
- Continued growth has decreased the small company feel somewhat. Beginning to develop internal politics.
- There is some tendency among some folks to prefer a quick hack instead of the Right Thing in the name of moving fast."

There are also a ton of smart people there and I feel like I'm constantly learning new things from my coworkers.,People generally work very hard.  This is by choice (people are generally excited about what they are working on and trying to ship stuff quickly) but it does mean that there's a fair amount of peer pressure to work hard and it's easy to feel like there's always a little bit more that you could be doing.

I go to parties and friends  complain to me about Facebook and I love it... because I'm empowered to help make it better. I often turn around and literally try and solve those exact problems because I *can* help.
- I get to solve really interesting business problems.
- I have access to the most senior executives -- even though it's big, it isn't *that* layered.

My co-workers range from good to stupendously great engineers, and I've seen no sign yet of a decrease in quality in the new hires.

The product:  It's an incredibly rare opportunity to build products that are used by 1/6th of the world's population.  I can visit the most far flung corners of the world, walk into a cafe and see people using the thing I've built to connect to their friends and loved ones.","It can be stressful at times, and maintaining work life balance is tricky.

The culture is motivational.
You have a lot of freedoms that come with being your own boss but none of the crap that comes with it. Your manager gets that crap out of the way for you.
People genuinely try to do the right thing and make connecting with friends, family, and your interests a better experience.
You get to play the explorer. We solve problems that haven't been solved before.

Everyone I've worked with has all the magic engineer powers: really smart, good at getting stuff done, and fun to be around. The company knows it, and so there's not much red tape on the engineering side. It's up to each person not to break the push or launch a feature too fast. It's refreshing.",Not a small company anymore.
3269,Meta,"Talent, commitment, autonomy, impact.",2012-11-13,5.0,Software Engineer,"The most important reason to work at Facebook is the other people working at Facebook. Almost all of them are very, very good. Down to about the 20th percentile of engineer, you can pretty much take their word as gold: if they say they'll do X in time Y, they will, and often a better X in a little less time than Y. This is a kind of super-power: it reduces the overhead of coordinating complex projects significantly.

Facebook is also a mission-focused organization, in the same sense that the military, or a relief agency is. Most employees understand the goal of the company to be larger than just making its employees and shareholders materially successful.

You will enjoy a vertiginous amount of authority as a front-line employee at Facebook. For better and for worse, on your first day at Facebook, you're given the keys to the proverbial Ferrari; you can push code, fix bugs, implement features, and yes, crash the site as much as any other engineer. Many user-facing decisions end up getting made by individual engineers.

This also implies that your work will have impact. Almost everyone you meet in your daily life is a user of your software. If they are unhappy users, it is your fault and responsibility to make it better. If they are happy users, you can enjoy your share of the credit.

All the basics (salary, equity, career advancement, food, miscellaneous perks like shuttles from SF) are world-class as well.","A mission-oriented job is not for everybody. If you are looking for a paycheck, and a ton of time to pursue your model railroading hobby, Facebook is going to be a weird fit for you. This is not to say that people don't have hobbies, or that everybody works 70 hrs/wk; but if you are completely ""checked out"" from your job, this will not be a happy place for you, not matter how good you are at it.

The physical work environment (open plan office, graffiti on the walls, lots of free-form discussion and collaboration) can be jarring if you're coming from a more typical corporate engineering environment."

Every day I learn something new from one of them. We move fast and think about having impact on the world. Our site is used by a billion people.  The company cares about its employees' quality of life; we have excellent food, shuttles to/from San Francisco, a culture that eschews meetings, great ergonomics, onsite medical care, and a gym.  New engineers go through ""bootcamp,"" which exposes you to all aspects of the codebase in a friendly environment where you're allowed to ask n00bish questions and bond with other new engineers.","It's difficult to come up with meaningful downsides to working here.  We move very fast, so I don't always have time to be a perfectionist (but in general that's a good thing).  Our codebase is huge and it can be difficult to find documentation."

The company is still growing, which makes for a lot of room for career improvement inside it too, not to talk about all the experience you get there. Finally, the work environment is just great, with very good free food, open space, and the feeling that everyone loves working there.","I guess a downside to it is that it's a big responsibility to change and build things there, since if you make something wrong you'll be affecting millions of users with it, which can be scary."

* Flexible hours
* Lots of food options, free drinks, etc.  All usually very good
* Smart people
* Open culture
* Great coworkers","It's still a big company.  With that comes some of the big company downsides.  Being smart politically can advance your career.  If you keep your head down and just do a good job it's less likely to be noticed.  For example, I see good engineers not going anywhere with their career even though they do good work, while I see average ones advance up the ranks if they make it a point to post in FYI for every feature they create.

You also have less of a chance to make an impact as a new hire since you're more likely to work on existing features rather than new ones.

If you joined about a year ago, your stock grant was over valued (by about 2x), so you're making a lot less than if you go to another company.

None of the cons are unexpected at a large company. If you're looking to work for a larger, post IPO company, then you're not going to do better anywhere else."
3278,Meta,Great place to be an engineer,2012-11-13,5.0,Senior Software Engineer,"- Almost unbelievable autonomy and trust given to engineers; most projects bottom-up vs. top-down
- Big, interesting projects are everywhere; if someone is bored at work, they're not trying very hard
- Caliber of peers is extremely high
- For the most part, rapid adoption (and often creation, e.g. a VM for PHP) of new technologies","- Many (though not all) engineers tend to work lots of hours, mostly because they just enjoy what they're doing. If this isn't necessarily your lifestyle, you may feel like you're not ""keeping up"". This is really all in the eye of the beholder, though, as there are many engineers who are very effective and productive and use that to work more limited hours so that they can enjoy family/non-work activities.
- Most teams have rotating on-call rotations, wherein the engineer must be available to be paged 24h a day (typically for a period of a week) to respond to issues with their product or service. This is more of a burden for some teams than others (e.g. a core piece of infrastructure vs. a little-used feature). This isn't particularly fun.
- Rapid pace of product change means it can be a challenging place to be in infrastructure. This isn't necessarily bad, but it does require a flexibility in planning and mindset, particularly if you come from a company where software releases are measured in months-years."

The lines are very short, and it's easy to get a hold of the right person to talk to on any topic. There's no red tape, so it's really up to you to have a big impact on the product and the world. People who make a big impact are recognized and rewarded, regardless of their job title or level of experience. The company's leadership truly believes in Facebook's mission to make the world more open and connected. Teams are small and have a lot of autonomy, and it's amazing to see how much of a difference a single person can make at this place.",The downside having so much going on all at once is that it takes energy and discipline to stay focused on those things that matter most.

- Employees are trusted with working on what's important without the need for constant overview
- Everyone is smart, but rarely feel the need to prove it.
- The amenities allow us to focus on our work, and also make us feel valued. Plus not having to go grocery shopping in eight months has been nice.
- The campus really does feel like a home. This is the first job I've had where I really am glad to head into work and actually get disappointed when I see how quickly the day goes by. 
- The managers are very technical capable, and know when to manage and when to step back.","- The size of the company makes communication a little harder, and it's more difficult to get to know people who you don't normally work with.
- Conversely, there aren't enough employees to have people working on whatever pet project they want. The work they do has to have as much impact as possible (but the hackathons are a good chance to work on those pet projects for a bit)

2) Very little process and bureaucracy for a company of this size.
3) Hackathons.","1) You own your own career, which also means you have to be the one focusing on impact (and ensure it's visible) to progress.

2) The intense focus on impact can sometimes mean that longer-term, exploratory projects are harder to initiate, justify, and eventually get recognized for. Facebook is growing to the scale where a small team focused on ""failing more often"" (that is, crazier projects) would be beneficial."

The company clearly tries to take care of its employees when it comes to making them feel right at home.","The hours were very tough, but it may depend on the department.

It could be exciting but could also be a bit tiring sometimes...
3318,Meta,"Amazing scale, pace and culture",2012-09-02,5.0,Software Engineer,"I'm coming up to the end of my first quarter and continue to be blown away by how fast we can move, even compared to tiny startups.  The engineering culture is aligned to enabling you to try things out, get things done and get them shipped out at an amazing rate.  The perks are amazing and the management structure feels flat and low friction.  Lots of smart folks and plenty of opportunities to get stuck into different areas if you feel like a change.

Work/life balance is good; lots of encouragement to take a break when you need it with a pretty high frequency of offsite events, and flexible working hours.

The onboarding process is very well put together: culture infusion from the moment you walk in the door, and you're mentored through a six week bootcamp and can be pushing code out to the website in your first week.","The flip side of the low friction management structure is that you need to take on more ownership of finding high impact work--don't expect to handed out work, you need to identify the work and then get it done.  I see this as a plus, but it can make it a little difficult when you start out.

Having a high density of smart folks can make it feel more competitive than it really is, and that combined with the pretty low average age of employees can result in the occasional abrasive conversation.

Being privy to the roadmap and our plans overall but not being able to tell people about it when they interpret our steps towards our grand vision in a negative light can be frustrating."

3321,Meta,"As a Facebook engineer, you can have as much impact as you are driven to have; your opinion matters a lot!",2012-09-01,5.0,Software Engineer,"As a software engineer, a lot of work is self driven and based on self-motivation. You are not told exactly what to do week over week. It is your job to figure out what is best to work on, what has the most impact for the company, and how to improve things. Most engineering is driven by the engineers themselves and not some sort of management. To me, this is perfect. However, if you don't like thinking about what you are doing and being critical about what is good for the company and your team, this might not be the place for you.","Facebook is all about iterating fast. This is great for our products because we can quickly get something out there and see what works and what does not. However, it means we have a lot of sketchy software and products sometimes. It also means we have to constantly be doing ""cleanup"" which often takes a long time. You will be under ""attack"" by the outside world because things ""suck"" even though you know they are being worked on and improved, but that takes time."

3323,Meta,Best place to have a big impact,2012-08-29,5.0,Director,"- compared with its competitors (many of which have 30,000+ employees), Facebook gives people a chance to make a massive impact. I've been at the company for 4+ years and we consistently grow our number of employees far slower that the growth of our users, developers and advertisers. This gives each employee a chance to do something huge for our nearly 1billion users. 
- if you are a ""doer"" and take accountability for things, there really is no limit to what you can accomplish","- if you love process for the sake of process (i.e. going to meetings), Facebook is not your place. It thrives on results and moving fast, and process that helps the company move fast is reward; process that results in more meetings and redundancies is not
- people at Facebook have a lot of fun, but it is a relatively serious and extremely driven place; we expect a lot out of our employees so come ready to contribue"

3325,Meta,Really the best engineering experience I have hoped for,2012-08-29,5.0,Software Engineer,"During the 5+ years I've worked here as an engineer, I've had really incredible and satisfying experiences.  I've learned so much more than I did at my past company in a similar amount of time, have almost never been disappointed with the caliber of a co-worker (and I've worked somewhat closely with around 50 other engineers) and have gotten to contribute the product as a clip I wouldn't have believed possible.  As an engineer I felt like I had a lot of control and influence over my work and the products I worked on and got to create some of the most impactful and satisfying products and features of my career, past and probably future.  If you're really great at what you do or have really great product ideas, very little will interfere with you showing that quickly.  New engineers are highly valued in the culture.

Salary/bonus compensation has been really strong in addition to the stock compensation.","I've felt like I've been able to maintain a pretty good work life/balance (especially after the first year), but I feel like I had to work hard to make that happen.  Being around many people who feel compelled to put most of their waking weekday hours into coding can be intimidating, even when you feel confident in the job you're doing and even when pressure to put in a ton of hours is rarely explicit.  Engineers can definitely work reasonable hours, especially older ones with families, but you have to bring your own self-confidence to trust that you're kicking butt even if you're not putting in a ton of hours (especially during the summers when interns ratchet up the intensity around the office)

Things are done very fast, which also means things can be hectic and sometimes chaotic (though this feels less and less true as the years go by), but I'd expect some culture shock for anyone coming from software companies where stability and consensus are top-priorities.  Code quality has felt really good for the past 2 or so years, though this definitely didn't feel true when I started."
3326,Meta,The best job I've ever had,2012-08-29,5.0,Production Engineer,"They grill you hard in the interview but once you're in, you get a lot of autonomy and freedom to make decisions about how you think things should be done. Zero bureaucracy/red tape, very few meetings, and people are encouraged to build what they think will work. Two of the common sayings there are ""code wins arguments"" and ""what does the data say?"" meaning that if people disagree about something, the debate gets resolved by looking at numerical data and/or by building something and seeing whether or not it works. This is a very fast, turn-on-a-dime, high productivity, zero BS environment. It's also a lot of fun to work there. People work hard and play hard.","The cons at Facebook mostly fall under the heading of ""growing pains"". 

Technologically, things move so fast that the layers of the technology stack are often in flux. If you are building a system that depends on other systems at FB, be ready for them to change underneath you. Nothing stays the same for long at Facebook. Every layer of the stack changes, and changes quickly. 

At the human level, the company has also grown very quickly which means many of the lower level managers are new or inexperienced or got promoted to management for being good with computers (but not necessarily with people). It can be frustrating to report to junior managers and/or people who are clueless about social skills. With that said, the higher level, more senior managers tend to be really good and their skill often ""trickles down"" in various ways."

It is staffed by some of the smartest people in the world who are industry leaders in whatever it is they do whether it is software engineering, design, public policy, even more traditional functions like HR and Finance!  Facebook redefines what it means to be a corporation with its unique move fast and break things culture, its culture of discipline, and its innovative and iterative approach.

It is extremely difficult to get hired at the company given the companies intense focus on culture and values (which is not always accurate).  It is also an intense environment, and not for people who are looking to coast.  This can be difficult for people with a lot of obligations outside of work.

-Consistently testing your comfort zone, receiving the opportunity to try new things and implement new ideas.","I've worked full-time for 3 companies and as an intern for 5 companies. Facebook is the best company for which I have ever worked.  Like any company it isn't perfect, but we carefully choose the ways in which we are not perfect."
3361,Meta,The most intense and rewarding experience of my career.,2012-03-26,5.0,,"Access to people who are smart in ways that you can't even comprehend.  
Incredibly challenging work, and opportunities to finally do things you've wanted to do elsewhere but couldn't because of the size or political currents of other companies.
You really care passionately about making the world more open and connected and want to be surrounded by people who are dedicated fully to making that happen.
You want to work with people who not only help you experience all of the above but who are also the most respectful and inclusive people you've ever met.  When we say we want you to be yourself completely at work - we really mean it.","The pace and scale of what we're doing is insane.  You're regularly exhausted but in a good way.  Facebook isn't just a company, it's a kind of movement that people dedicate themselves to in ways that transcend the traditional bounds of employment.  You will make life-long friends who will become a part of your life beyond 9-5."
3362,Meta,Amazing place for the truly entrepreneurial.,2012-03-26,5.0,Staffing,Very open and colaborative. Lots of opportunity to try new things and make impact. Even very senior people seem to be more than happy to help nearly anyone understand a situation and give their opinions. I am surprised everyday by the feedback that flows here.,"The lack of process an structure can be problematic for some. Really grasping how much autonomy exists is a hard thing to do until you are there. This is only a problem for some, but it's critical."

My peers are founders and inventors and role models. Given every opportunity to succeed including resources and people.

The team I'm working on is a group of all-stars, making each other always look good.","In order to change the world like we want to do, it requires dedication and hard work. So at times we have to work long days. But in the end, it's worth it."

3367,Meta,The best place to work for an engineer in the bay area,2012-03-02,4.0,Release Engineer,You work along some of the brightest talent in the Silicon Valley. There are hardly any politics around you and get to make an impact in your first few days. Great perks + benefits.,1. Company is growing up fast and it'll be tricky to maintain the culture.
3368,Meta,Change is the norm,2012-02-29,4.0,,"Fast paced, smart people, innovative, great perks and benefits! The challenges presented ahead are still very compelling things to work on.","As the company grows, it's losing the 'startup' feel. You can definitely still get exposed to multiple areas of the business."
3369,Meta,"Although working more than 40 hours/week is a given, I wouldn't want to dedicate my time and effort to a better company.",2012-02-13,5.0,Recruiting Lead,"Facebook gives their employees the freedom to work on projects that make an impact. When you're able to work on things that affect millions and millions of people, it doesn't feel like a job, more like a purpose.","It's tough for people who aren't willing to put in the extra effort needed to succeed in a company like Facebook. Part of the culture is to work hard and ship things. If you're not good at executing on a project, it will be tough to fit in."
3370,Meta,Best place I've ever worked,2012-01-21,5.0,Software Engineer,"Amazing people - hard to overstate this.

You get to choose what you want to work on (Bing ""Facebook bootcamp"") for more info.

Everyone is really passionate about the product. People care about the folks that use Facebook, and really want to make it a better experience. There are so many cool things we want to do, it'd be hard to get bored.

Things move really fast - there usually has to be a good reason not to do some new cool thing, instead of a reason to do it.","Since so many people at Facebook are amazing, recognition/awards aren't as frequent as I'd personally like.

I've done stuff that would've earned me instant promotions at a previous company, and only got a ""cool, nice job"" at Facebook.

It's hard to hear people spread misinformation about Facebook while you're working there - I've gotten so passionate about the company that when people say misguided things like ""Facebook sells your information to advertisers"", it's hard not to get angry."
3371,Meta,Amazing.,2012-01-20,5.0,,"The openness, inclusion and excitement that we all feel every day.  This is truly a company where the people are without a doubt organized more around the mission than their own personal interests or potential gain.  We are here because we want to change the way the world works, and the fact that we get paid to do it is amazing.","It's not a ""job"" - in many ways it is a life.  Long hours are the norm.  Hard to completely consider this a con, though, as many of those long hours are spent working on stuff you love with people you admire and befriend."
3372,Meta,"Fun at the engineer to engineer level, but brutally long hours and badly disconnected front-line management.",2012-01-02,2.0,Software Engineer,"Huge corporate upside potential (but might not apply to new hires as of 2012).

Fun work environment (free quality food, game rooms, frivolity encouraged, etc.).

High impact in terms of people using your code and recognition.

Good opportunities to try new ideas and move teams.","Brutally long hours for many, frequent pressure to delay or cancel vacation plans (even outside of release deadlines).

Harsh, unjust, and badly cross-team calibrated reviews coupled with frequent firings so that the stick is very close to the carrot.

It has now grown large enough that internal corporate politics have seeped in.

Management, at all levels, fixated on lots of shiny new features, no matter how broken, and lack of respect  for  necessary work getting done."
3373,Meta,Tough place and amazing people.,2011-12-14,5.0,Software Engineer,"- Super smart people to work with
- again, super smart people
- people are young and dynamic, always willing to help. No question is too dumb to ask, people aways help you.
- everybody working toward the same goal: making the company move forward.
- lots of resource, easy to get machines allocated
- freedom to work on projects that you like
- food is awesome","- very challenging.
- lots of work
- long hours
- not always clear communication from managemenent.
- lots of koolaid and internal propaganda.
- little recognition. Not too surprising, everybody's doing awesome stuff."

3378,Meta,Learn to swim or you will sink,2011-11-03,5.0,Administrative Assistant,"My coworkers are the smartest people I have ever worked with.   They love their jobs and they work hard.  But they keep a balance in their lives.  

Also, the management team is a group of good human beings.   They really want to harness the power of what they've created to accomplish something they believe in.    They know that if people across the globe can connect - good things will happen.  And they have.","It can feel very chaotic, fly by the seat of your pants, always on the go.   It's growing so quickly it's hard to tell who owns what project etc."
3379,Meta,Best. Job. Ever.,2011-11-03,5.0,Technical Project Manager,"What I love most about working at Facebook:

- The people. I get to work with some of the most talented and passionate people in the world.
- The culture. I love the fact that we get to take big risks and 'move fast and break things'. It's very empowering.
- Impact. All my friends and family use Facebook (+800M people around the world), so it's great to know that people I care about love to use the product that I'm a part of.
- The culinary team. best. food. ever.","- growing so fast makes it so you don't know everyone at the company anymore, but that's just a product of rapid growth and hiring enough people to sustain and grow the business."
