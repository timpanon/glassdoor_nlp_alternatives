119,Neuberger Berman,DO NOT WORK HERE - TERRIBLE COMPANY,2020-06-02,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"The 15% 401K match was good. Other than that, nothing.","Where do I even start. How about with the ILLEGAL hiring practices that go on (a.k.a. discrimination based on ethnicity and medical status). You think I'm kidding? I've seen it and heard it first hand, not from my own personal interview process, but from being involved in new hire interviews at Neuberger. The comments behind the scenes regarding why a person was or was not getting hired revolved around ethnicity and medical status. I couldn't believe what I was hearing. Speaking of hiring, how about the fact that they hire you under one job title and then after you accept the job offer, they switch your title to something less desirable. When you start, there is no training. The only way you figure out what you are supposed to do is by doing your best with no information and then getting chewed out in front of the entire office on day three of your job for doing it wrong. That leads me to my next comment which is about the incessant verbal abuse you get from upper management on a daily basis. I have never seen more pathetic, inexcusable management styles than those at Neuberger. Upper management does not know how to have a civil conversation. Their only form of communication is yelling and screaming. They will also use anybody underneath them as their own personal scapegoat. You will get blamed for things that you had ZERO involvement in, and you find out that you got blamed for these things when you get a flood of emails from more upper management chewing you out for something you had nothing to do with. And if you try to politely but firmly explain that you had nothing to do with it? They will yell at you for not taking responsibility and for being defensive. Your reputation will get slandered at the hands of others. Talk about being trapped with no way out. And don't expect HR to do anything about these problems. They are well aware of them, yet they still don't take any action to correct them. Also, the NY office seems all dandy, but any other Neuberger office gets brushed under the rug. Anybody not in the NY office will tell you that. Part of the benefits package doesn't apply to people outside of NY, and only employees in the NY office have any sort of formal training / welcome to the company.

130,Neuberger Berman,an embarrassment to work for,2019-10-28,1.0,Anonymous Employee,If you're interested in experiencing the culture behind the largest bankruptcy of all time then Neuberger Berman is for you. The backstory of accomplishments and innovations prior to the 2002 acquisition by Lehman Brothers is practically a fairytale. That company culture was murdered and a Lehman Brothers escape pod has been running around  in a disguise made out of the carcass.,"Chief Administrative Officer was originally an attorney at Lehman Brothers and speaks fondly at company events of having worked on ABS products. Those were the securities that obliterated the last empire. Might explain some stuff, because NB does not seem sustainable. It’s like a bad caricature of an investment firm.

Career trajectories are detached from performance. People get unqualified buddies hired, then collect bonuses for recruiting them. Many supervisors aim to keep operations non-transparent and undocumented to avoid accountability while being intentionally ineffective to justify increasing the number of people they manage. This isn't speculation. Senior staff keep sharing this information with me as unsolicited career advice. Middle managers sabotaging the operations of entire teams is totally normalized and excused. I’m aware of this happening at least 6 times in the last 5 years. Women usually need to be attractive, overqualified, and not respond when overtly humiliated, treated like idiots, and kept out of the loop. There have been situations amplified by HR and management that are far more severe than industry norms. Exceptional employees also risk attempts at being intentionally harassed out of their jobs for threatening the status quo. 

NB looks like a ticking controversy timebomb. Audits seem intentionally compromised. HR enables dysfunction like it’s their primary purpose. As I’ve become more familiar with different parts of the company, the situation has only seemed worse and worse. 

Once new trends have become widespread in the industry, NB usually will acquire smaller firms with already established capabilities or make equivalent high-profile hires. You will never be able to transfer to a better/more appropriate role. The only exception is if you dedicate yourself to backwards office politics, and it’s thought that you’d be a more valuable sycophant doing something else. You will not grow here. If you sincerely take pride in your work, NB will destroy you."

135,Neuberger Berman,A forward-looking & high-performing company - 10/10,2019-08-17,5.0,Analyst,"Compared to the vast majority of companies within the financial services industry that I've had the chance to work for, Neuberger practices what it preaches. The quality of work that employees deliver on a daily basis is high, but this doesn't come at the expense of a thriving company culture.  Both regional offices and HQ sustain robust and yet collaborative business practices, where everyone (down to the most junior levels) has a say in, e.g., improving existing processes and innovating to serve clients in the best possible way. Managers actively encourage participation in regional and global Town Halls, and the results of a recent employee survey point to above-average employee satisfaction scores. It is a pleasure to work with co-workers who also hold the firm in such a high regard.

Silos are not prevalent and internal mobility opportunities exist, in that employees are regularly rewarded for their ability to think outside of the box and add value to an adjacent department/function. 

AUM has grown steadily over the years, and the suite of investment product remains diversified whilst keeping pace with key trends in the industry.","No major flaws I could think of - granted, the company is smaller than some of its counterparts (e.g. Blackrock/Fidelity/Vanguard) in terms of the global headcount, but this creates a tight-knit work environment."

Some senior staff members were particularly disappointing to work with, especially if they had transferred from the US to the London office. They offered nothing but weak leadership, poor fund management and a negative effect on morale and I would place them as some of the weakest people I have ever worked with.

Senior staff were often rude and dismissive of other members of staff.  They also belonged to various cliques.

There appeared to be two groups of employees, one group would receive all benefits irrespective of performance, whilst it was always a difficult year for the second group.

Salary was not competitive."
158,Neuberger Berman,Not the worst but not the best,2018-08-28,3.0,Analyst,"Everyone is very approachable and willing to help.  If you have a good manager they are very understanding of personal situations and will try to accommodate you. Dress code is on the lenient side unless you are seen by clients. They offer many classes to brush up on skills or learn new ones and management is supportive of employees in taking these classes. They also offer MANY philanthropic opportunities throughout the year and management is also supportive of participation, as long as there is coverage for whatever you need to do during the time out of office. Most people are very easygoing, I really enjoyed the people I worked with.","You get certain looks if you try to go home on time, it seems frowned upon to leave while others in your team are still working. I was part of a group once who would stay until 8pm daily on average. Then we would get talks about doing too much OT, followed by a talk the following week on how we can’t leave until everything is completed. New responsibilities were constantly given and the groups kept getting smaller. Sometimes expectations  felt highly unreasonable regarding the amount of time to complete tasks. 
If you work in operations, there’s very little opportunity to move to another department. They won’t really give you a chance - I’ve seen peers who got their CFA all on their own turned away. If your manager likes you and won’t want to lose you, they have “dibs” on keeping you even if another manager would hire you for a position you are interested in. So basically if you do a great job and your manager likes you, instead of being rewarded you get held back. I was advised by a long time Portfolio Manager that if I wanted to move up I would have to leave the company first because management won’t hire someone whose current manager doesn’t want to lose. 
The pay was not great and at year end we all got the same sob story of the company not doing great so bonuses would rarely change much (some years it even decreased) while upper management would go home with a large slice of the cake."

296,Neuberger Berman,"Either become a revenue generator or disappear - Firm is for those who can generate revenue, cost centers don't matter",2014-05-30,1.0,Legal and Compliance,"Work here if you are a revenue generator and have a book of business you can bring to increase firm's AUM either as a sales person or Portfolio manager.  You eat your own cooking.  Each team is paid based on their individual team level AUM.  If you can bring in money, then you will feel like you own the place.","If you are a cost center in Operations, HR, IT, Risk, or administration, then you are considered second class citizens.  It is as if you hold non voting shares in a company.  You don't matter, you are compelled to leave the firm and you are told to keep you opinions to yourself.  As a cost center, you are just a number, you really have no identity.  Please do not take cost center jobs, you will regret taking the job because you are just a menial worker.  You will lose your self confidence and will lose motivation to engage with your work due to the environment in the firm."

Anyone in a non revenue generating part of the business is treated that way (including compensation and advancement opportunities). Advancement opportunities are difficult to win and it's not clear what your managers are looking for."

Technology is very outdated.
Everyday is perpetually worse than the day before. 

I just want to add that I was at my last job in the same industry for 5 years and really enjoyed it, but we decided to relocate to NYC for personal reasons and I took the first job that was offered. However I did think that this could have been a great oppurtunity and that I could advance in the company.  I was mistaken, I look around at people who have been here 10+ years and are still at my level. I personally don't like interviewing and didn't want to job hop, but I have no choice.
