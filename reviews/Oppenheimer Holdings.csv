The location is great, exposure to all resources. If you just want to be a paper pusher you can, but if you want to be more involved and work for a good financial advisor you have to take control and do it. If you work with a great/flexible advisor your life is good. If you do not then you’re SOL—management doesn’t really support associates just the producers. 

Compliance and operation managers are friendly and approachable. 

If you’re looking for just a job you go to from 8-4:30 and push papers around for mediocre pay this is the role for you.","The technology and the office are embarrassingly outdated. 

You cannot work from home (unless your advisor pays for your remote access) or from satellite branches. 

There is NO training. Processes (and being a finance firm there at A LOT of processes) are passed down from associate to associate. 

So much time is wasted trying to find the person who knows the right answer. And then another person has another opinion. It is messy. 

No room for growth. 

Your raise/bonus comes from your financial advisor (good if you work for a fair/generous human, and sad if you do not). No firm raises and your bonus is based on how many years you’ve been there (if there is a bonus) There is no annual review you get an email that is a grid “less than one year employment you get 400” “1-2 years $450” — not exact numbers but VERY close to the past year.

Spacious office/cubical surroundings. Great location close to restaurants, attractions and shopping centers.","Extremely poor wages with extensive wage-freeze, unrealistic expectations with workloads tripled year-by-year, benefits reduced, unfair distribution of work and disgruntled employees with poor management.  Very disappointed in the way we were treated.  Management whom I had worked with for decades only recognized their employees as ""numbers"" and not people.  There were no recognition programs, review processes or morale functions to speak of.  Every year workloads increased, and staffing dramatically reduced forcing responsibilities to become very unmanageable during transitions.  Over-time or bonuses were not permitted, however you were expected to complete daily tasks with little or no assistance or guidance.  Break times were reduced or interrupted for urgent processing demands.  These people were run ragged from the time they clocked in until they minute they had to leave.  The stress in the environment was so thick, your hair would stand on end!"

329,Oppenheimer Holdings,Registered Client Service Associate,2012-07-02,3.0,Registered Client Service Associate,Pay is good for amount of work you do. Don't have to take a lunch so only have to work 8 hour day,"No opportunity for growth
Technology outdated"
330,Oppenheimer Holdings,Terrible work life overall and company cares next to nothing about employee satisfaction,2012-06-02,1.0,Analyst,Very relaxed atmosphere...often too relaxed. Family-like environment where most people know each other as far as related departments go.,"Incredibly ""cheap"" company that believes that employees are just work ants and nothing more. Morale is very low, work is barely challenging, upper management cares little about subordinates, work environment is very miserable in terms of basic comfort and amenities. No sense whatsoever of challenge, drive, inspiration, and opportunity. It's just a place to come to and get a pay check. Very unprofessional atmosphere all round."
331,Oppenheimer Holdings,Depressing and disappointing,2012-05-18,2.0,Broker Trainee/Client Service Associate,"Good equity research.
Carter Worth constantly on CNBC.
Massive product offering.
A limited few fun/entertaining coworkers.
Very helpful and friendly sales assistants and operations folks.
Positive name recognition.
Very quiet office enviroment at times... can hear a pin drop... cant be good for business, but can be relaxing at times.","If you are part time, do NOT ask to become a full time intern!
You will take a pay cut from $13 or so to minimum wage!

To broker trainees: your overall responsibility is to be a cold calling machine. You are supposed to sit down, strap in, and have the phone to your ear all day and get as many qualified leads as possible... which is not necessarily a bad thing.
You are supposed to gain training and sales experience along the way... which does not happen. Whatever you learn, you will pick up on your own along the way.
You then supply the leads to the FA you work under. If he does not call your leads and thus create new business (because hes older, wealthy, set in his ways, and lazy), you are screwed, and you're working for nothing. Demotivation and depression will soon set in, because all of your efforts are for nothing, and management will do nothing to better your situation, and youll soon face the prospect of resigning (which is my personal experience).

Your fate is in the hands of the brokers u work for.

TERRIBLE PAY.

Ancient technology.

Dead end posotion for recent college grads.

Impossible hurdles. 

Over worked, underpaid and stressed support staff.

Stressful and volatile environment when the market is down, if none of the FAs are doing any business.

Abusive and harrassing office management.  Office administrators should watch themselves or they'll get slapped with a harassment law suit soon."
332,Oppenheimer Holdings,Good salary opportunities but shady managers,2012-03-19,3.0,Registered Client Sales Associate,"Working at Oppenheimer allows for great salary growth potential.

334,Oppenheimer Holdings,Great stepping-stone for a better job down the road,2012-02-29,2.0,Registered Client Service Associate,Good job stability. Good brand name (that sounds more reputable than it actually is). Co-workers are great; supportive and hardworking. I also lucked out and have a great boss. The support staff is incredible...without them the whole branch would fall apart!,Terrible technology. No room for job growth. No raises EVER for salaried employees. Incompetent branch management & HR. No 401K matching. No formal job training.
335,Oppenheimer Holdings,Good Name but thats about it,2012-02-26,2.0,Institutional Fixed Income Sales,"Good and respected name, smart colleagues and good trading environment","Horrible support functions surrounding the trading floor, very few perks, very hierarchic ( even when employed in mid hierarchy )."
