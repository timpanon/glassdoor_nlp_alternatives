The company is growing and there is a sense that with the new(ish) CEO and PineBridge have a clear strategy that is being delivering on.

Morale is at an all-time low.  The smart people are leaving left and right because they're overworked due to high turnover,  underpaid and stifled by incompetent managers. Career growth is non-existent.  Unqualified people are overpromoted to keep them at the firm because these poor managers can't do the work of their subordinates (they just take the credit for it).  Support employees are treated like second class citizens.  Those in investments reap all the benefits.  The firm bleeds money but it can somehow fly investment employees all around the world for a special conference and wine and dine leadership.  What about the rest of us? We're all sitting here waiting for the next layoff and wondering who will be canned next.

To add to an already horrid work environment, the latest regime took away all that was good about the firm - Summer Fridays, monthly happy hours, summer party, etc.  You're basically punished for sticking around.  Next, we'll be celebrating our holiday party in the conference room."

It is one of the more truly global companies - in part due to the fact it is smaller so needs to be more integrated. There is not much politics to deal with, and the corporate environment is quite positive.","The work-life balance is not great, in part due to the international nature of the firm - you may end up doing long and strange hours. Due to its small nature management can be quite hands-off - you have to be able to work well with a reduced amount of supervision!"

- Ownership shifting from AIG to an Asian family owned platform changed the risk perception in the eyes of the Limited Partners, hence, the firm is losing its attractiveness for U.S. institutional platforms because it is loosing its old established  values of doing business"
57,PineBridge Investments,Awful,2017-06-01,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"Since the formation of PineBridge in 2010 from AIG, the company has done very well, mainly due to some excellent PMs producing top quartile performances across a number of years and over numerous strategies. The working environment is relaxed and I actually have no complaints in general about the quality of staff. My colleagues were mainly very friendly and good to work with. 

Work/life balance was decent. 

The new CEO seemed to be very good.","The senior 'management' at the London office are a joke. Please note, I refer to two individuals mainly (one of whom recently announced his resignation) but within certain teams, the same can be said. Never before have a group of such under qualified, inexperienced, egotistical, autocratic, selfish and untrustworthy people been allowed to run a business. Their concerns are only for themselves and the amount of money they make (which is ludicrous) so do not join this firm thinking anybody has got your back. 

My advice would be to think carefully about joining this company. If you are prepared to get on the right side of the boss and play the very political game that is required then do it well otherwise they will have no hesitation at all in getting rid of you with the ruthless culture that is embedded within the firm. 

It took me moving to another, much more progressive and open asset management firm to realise that the culture at PineBridge is toxic."

It's a mid-sized buy side firm with stability and a huge growth potential. The investing culture isn't risky yet very thoughtful. The people culture is amazing. Everyone works hard yet knows how to have fun. There are fun events like monthly happy hours, summer parties, holiday parties to allow employees to engage and connect with one another. Because the company is lean, it allows employees to be autonomous in their role and implement change if there's a need. The company environment definitely allows work life balance but like any other firm, if there is busy season in the area that you work in, extended work hours are required.","While we had the interim CEO, I felt the company was at a standstill.

Much worse, however, is the firm's failure to implement decisions made prior to the CEO's departure. Management is increasingly ""too busy"" to speak with staff, which (among other things) has morale at an all-time low. Everyone has been in a holding pattern for two quarters, going on three.

- Certain teams do not consider project deadlines and consistently deliver content at the 11th hour (there are no enforced consequences for missing deadlines)"

104,PineBridge Investments,Decent pay but unfriendly and highly political environment.,2013-09-25,2.0,Intern,"The pay is decent, especially at the intern level. Nice office and great midtown location. Large Asset Manager handling large amounts of money.","Highly political, lack of communication between senior management and the rest of the firm.

108,PineBridge Investments,Great people working hard and having fun in a relaxed environment.,2013-01-08,4.0,,"The LA office is relaxed, friendly, and supportive, the benefits are very good, and you are valued as an individual.  Turnover is very low, which points to the fact that most people like working there.  The California culture, which makes the LA office a great place to work, does not extend to the rest of the company.  Employees visiting from other cities often comment on how different the LA office is: no office politics, no surreptitious positioning, and no cutthroat hijinks.","Because of the low turnover, training receives very little attention, and the pay could be better."

Selection into committees are very much based on favoritism, not on quality hence company is led by very poor managers with only short term targets.  Dissenting comments are not welcomed.  VPs and MDs are not treated equally and favoritism abounds.  Experienced senior people leaving.  Very little focus on career building as heads of departments are more concerned on keeping their own jobs and hence surround themselves with 'yes men'."
