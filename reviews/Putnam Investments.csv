Technical skills may be there but that doesn't matter if your subordinates don't feel like they can approach you about anything else. A lot of them are extremely robotic. 
In my personal experience there, I was ambushed with a summary of all I was doing wrong based on the perspective of others who I barely worked with. That level of unprofessionalism and disrespect was traumatizing; it was the first time I'd ever cried at a professional setting. That same moment, that department lost value in my eyes and was not worthy of my time. 
- Not enough community outreach or team building. We spend more time with our coworkers than we do with our loved ones, you'd think companies would understand how important team building activities are.

The managers and supervisors set their employees up for failure and constantly belittle them. There is a public shaming review sheet on all of the tasks you do. These review sheets contain horrific comments called points and these points prevent you from receiving a 2% raise and or a $1,000 bonus, which is still not worth it after the amount of stress the Managers and supervisors put you through. The managers and supervisors will also make up false points if you have nothing wrong on your tasks that you pass in. Also other departments work with the tax department and they can see the horrible comments that these supervisors and managers give to their staff. You will spend countless hours struggling to figure out how to prepare a fiscal provision or a tax form on your own without guidance. They will tell you that there is a lot of room for growth inside the tax department but this is only to bring you in.  The turnover rate is very high and one will find out after they have worked there for a few months."

For example you have 10 minutes a day to go to the bathroom total outside of lunch. You can't go over the 10 minutes or you get put on warning if you do it a few times. If you're more than 2 minutes late for work or back from lunch (literally) they put you on warning to get fired, that's if you do it more than 6 times total in 6 months. There is no work life balance at all. If you need to go to the drs you need to get the day off, if you can get it. People who have worked there the longest get the first pick of days off. Which means you will never get anything but a Wednesday off. They record everything you do and then critique you on it. I can tell you I was a top performer my whole time there, the entire time, and it was still really bad. They barely pay you and the benefits have become really bad. One time they took me in an office and said that my capris were 1 inch too high above my ankle. You can't speak up either about anything."

EAs get similar resources and travel as analysts and are given the latitude to be truly creative and entrepreneurial in their research process. Portfolio managers take EA recommendations seriously, and there was a demonstrated willingness to give us more responsibility; managers actively want to promote internally, so there is clear growth pathway for achievers. There is additionally a writing / presentation component to the role, so unlike some other finance roles, the program gave me significant opportunity to develop strong communication and presentation skills. Overall I think the program is a great place for someone to develop a well-rounded foundation for a long-term career in investing with room for internal promotion.","The role is very open-ended especially relative to most other roles in finance available to young people – mentorship, training, and guidance is definitely provided but this is not a position where someone will give you a syllabus/ to-do list every day.

It looks good on a resume.,The management is young and unpofessional. They under pay--you will make 1.5 times the salary anywhere else. They do not promote from within. Limited upward mobility. They treat you like a child giving you 3 minutes per hour for personal time such as going to the restroom. No more than 5% personal time per week. The politics are horrendous.

I enjoyed working with some of the best minds in the industry while I was there. The pay is relatively good for the industry.,"Following the subprime crisis, Putnam suffered round after round of layoffs. There were far too opportunities for talented individuals to rise through the ranks. There was a small clique of people in the 'in-crowd.' If you were one of them, going out for drinks or to lunch regularly, then you did well. If not, then not."

242,Putnam Investments,Putnam Investments,2013-07-29,2.0,Anonymous Employee,If you are happy making below market average then you will have a long term job.,Had to pay for tuition out of pocket when they discontinued tuition reimbursement.  Losing benefits and greater out of pocket costs that lower overall salary package each year. Senior managers differ greatly in what they expect for a work-life balance.

Profit sharing is fairly consistent each year.  Vacation accrual is good if you can stay on long enough.  Maternity & Paternity leave available.,"Work week used to be 35 hours, but changed to 37.5 randomly without augmenting salary or bonus in 2010.  Layoffs always looming.  Over the past several years it's turned into a ""Survivor Island"" environment.  No room for collaboration since everyone is worried about their own fate.  Fund performance still not very good.  Communication is poor at all levels.  Culture is still in a state of flux as it's moved from the Lasser - Halderman - Reynolds phases.  Three different Senior Leaders with 3 diferent styles in less than 10 years.  You can do better elsewhere within the fund industry.  Especially in MA."

Otherwise, stay away from it.","I worked at IT department. There are so many incompetent employees,  high school drop-outs, housewives who don't know **** about computers. Almost everything was controlled by a few ""consultant"" who like parasites sucking blood from the company. No way for new employee to learn anything.

You are not micromanaged though at the same time management can be needed.","It can be overly political, and like most corporations some animals are more equal than others.  The trend with the current economy is that you should be thankful you have a job. Running an understaffed IT department but continue to pile on the work. Expect you to work 50 hour plus weeks covering all hours of the day and night. Have begun outsourcing aggressively.  Working in IT should something go awry the priority focus is to determine whose fault it was and then to address the issue."
