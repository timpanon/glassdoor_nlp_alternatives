8,Sequoia,Great benefits in exchange for being mentally drained forever,2021-11-23,2.0,Client Services,"Good benefits, random company perks every once in a while, some absolutely wonderful team members","- continually in “growth mode” and the amount of work never stops increasing
- they literally just hired a chief of people officer last month, but there’s been no internal HR, no compensation director, no development professional for the 21 years of the company’s existence. There’s no transparency about pay and many, myself included, were severely underpaid for the many random hats we had to wear. No career pathing and promotions and raises happen only once at the beginning of the new fiscal year (even if you technically got a new role midyear)
- DEI? What DEI? Diversity, equity, and inclusion is not just an afterthought, but the most performative aspect of Sequoia. There are no active training or support initiatives, only social media posts. 
- leadership has absolutely no idea what the day to day of anyone looks like, nor do they care. When we asked for more hires for a functional group, we would be told that the numbers don’t support more hiring, even though most of the team is continually working overtime for clients and projects
- they only care about sales. All that matters is that the numbers look good and they sell more. To the point that BCs sell services we can’t provide, and then client service gets the heat and have to push our boundaries beyond what our scope of service is
- their semi annual employee surveys always churned out the same results for improvement, and yet I was there for nearly three years and never saw any. 

They question why retention is low, why top performing team members leave after 2-3 years, and it’s never just as simple as one reason. Sure there were great managers and great coworkers, but the low pay, complete disregard for the needs of anyone who isn’t in upper management or leadership, and “the customer is always right” mentality are just some of the multitude of reasons why."

20,Sequoia,Not for everyone,2021-05-18,2.0,Human Resources,"Your direct colleagues are wonderful, most are experienced, and most care! The offices were pretty cool, but very very clicky.","Development is not existent in the organization. DEI is not valued or cherished and the majority of the founding DEI program team is no longer at the organization, which shows how much they feel that the organization is accepting. There is a party culture in the organization and if you don't partake in alcohol you feel like an outsider - another strike on inclusivity. No one seems to go agains the CEO's opinions, at least publicly and when they do they seem to be put in their place right away. There are no experienced HR team members internally to actually support the people, not that the executive team would let the HR people actually do anything. You will bend over backwards for a client, even when they are in the wrong. And everyone even in non-sales roles has to sell all the useless junk the organization is creating."
21,Sequoia,"I wouldn't necessarily recommend it, but I wouldn't necessarily not",2021-05-11,2.0,Client Operations Manager,"- Fun coworkers on lower levels; a few decent hires in upper management and the C-suite (always from outside)
- Decent health benefits
- Party culture if you’re into that, particularly the sales team
- If you don’t care, it’s not that hard to skate by and do the bare minimum, particularly if you are searching for another job
- Good snacks (sometimes)
- So much swag, you could literally dress yourself in solely Sequoia gear for a week after a year on the job","-Members of management that have been there since the inception of the company are only there because of personal reasons and are often grossly incompetent/a hindrance to the growth of the company
- Service centric organization - if client service wants something they get it (including if they don’t want to do their jobs, which they usually do not)
About 10% of the company does 90% of the work - many teams and individuals have an attitude of “this is not my problem/who will fix this problem for me” and are completely unremorseful about treating their coworkers poorly
- Technology is aesthetic but under the surface is a total dumpster fire
- No growth pathways or marketable skills; very little career coaching
- Promotions and title changes are laughably random and feel arbitrary; there is little transparency on compensation so I’d guess that is even more of a joke
- DEI - a slight effort is made by the company overall but there is little interest in self-education by leadership (much of leadership remembers this is an initiative when clients ask what the internal efforts are like)"

SCG Bangalore is newly built with less number of peoples"
27,Sequoia,Inexperienced Leaders and No Career Opportunities,2020-07-30,1.0,Client Services Manager,"Very talented, smart, and caring people most of which are not in management.","Let me start by saying that most of the reviews found on this site is fake. The talent team and management monitor the negative reviews provided on Glassdoor and try to counter it with posting positive reviews. Early in the year the rating was 3.2ish but has miraculously rose to 4.1 in a matter of months. Questionable? 

If you're an experienced professional, you will find little to no opportunities for personal and professional advancement at Sequoia despite that it’s a growing company. This is largely due to it being a flat hierarchy and a lack of structure for employee development. From the second you step through the door it's about what you can (and need) do for the company, but no clear path on your own development which should have been a red flag #1 for me. The management team also lack experience to be thoughtful leaders to help in development of their team.

There is only one leader at the company and that is the CEO. Actually, CEO is an incorrect term because there is no Board of Directors, making Greg the only decision maker at the company. I have seen the company hire some very smart and talented people, only to watch them leave Sequoia within a year or so. In 2019, the company had about a 100 person turnover. Red flag #2. Steve Jobs once said “It doesn’t make sense to hire smart people and tell them what to do; we hire smart people say they can tell us what to do.” This is not the case at Sequoia. It’s a dictatorship environment and the CEO, Greg, hires smart people so he can tell them what to do. Any disagreement will result in termination. Therefore, all the Principals and managers are pretty much “Yes mans” as they will agree with the CEO mainly to keep their job. The smartest leaders hire people who are much smarter than them to help push through diverse thinking and drive the business forward. Unfortunately, Greg has a difficult time understanding that his vision has taken him so far. It is time that he should utilize the talent that’s within this company to help it reach the next steps. Sequoia has been at a 300+ employee count for the last 2 years due to high turnover. 

Compensation is a joke. It’s below market rate and the bonus structure is less than what I made at my entry level position after college. 

COVID-19 Response: It was disappointing for me to learn that during a time of economic uncertainty, with many of Sequoia clients trying to stay afloat, the CEO was still trying to push forward with aggressive sales goals, and charging clients for add-on services that was not needed. He is very focused on growth, which brought down company morale as client service teams tried their very best to work with clients through difficult decisions such as budget cuts, layoffs and furloughs. This was one of the deciding factors for my departure, as I felt his messaging and approach was tactless during a time when clients needed us as their partners and consultants.

If you're considering an opportunity at Sequoia, I would advise reaching out to former employees to get their experience."

31,Sequoia,"Best company I’ve worked for, hands down.",2020-06-24,5.0,Anonymous Employee,Employee centric culture and a value prop that really focuses on creating new solutions for clients in tumultuous environments.,Lack of IT resources. We’re a small company but tech resources are spread thin.
32,Sequoia,Making a Real Difference in the Most Difficult of Times,2020-06-24,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Sequoia is one of those rare companies that talks about being mission-inspired and actually follows through. Ever since I've been here, the focus has been on being there when people need us. That has a particular meaning inside the company, but the impact and importance of that mission has become so starkly clear over the last few months. The systems, tools and capabilities that Sequoia works so hard to build bring guidance, telehealth, resources, and access to information and care exactly at the moment that can be the most concerning to the individual.","There is a real sense of obligation and commitment to doing great work. Given the scale of the mission and the opportunity, for sure, there certainly is no shortage of it and definitely ways to become more efficient.

Getting the balance right is important and admittedly an area of focus at Sequoia. This will be important to figure out, but that balance is one of the hardest things to do for any company. 

The silver lining though is that in a world experiencing economic contraction and massive unemployment, being at a company that has as much opportunity as Sequoia has is a positive as well."

39,Sequoia,Wonderful Company to Work For!,2020-06-04,5.0,Payroll Specialist,"Sequoia employs some of the smartest and most self-motivated people that I’ve ever met. I’ve never before worked with such an amazing group of kind, empathetic, caring people across the board. 

From my personal history in payroll, scheduling time off for vacations or appointments can be really tricky because of the hard deadlines of making sure people are paid on time. At Sequoia, I love that I can trust my coworkers to not only cover me if I’m out of office, but to also do an outstanding job of making sure that my clients are well taken care of in my absence. 

I feel heard and appreciated. When something isn’t working, not only is feedback listened to, it’s also acted upon. It’s easy for an employee anywhere to get frustrated when processes aren’t working as well as intended, but what sets Sequoia apart is a drive to fix these annoyances and make things better and more efficient.

The benefits that Sequoia provides are stellar and are provided at a low OOP cost to the employee. Perks are also fantastic! Healthy snacks, celebrations for company and individual achievements, plus access to a vast number of vendors/companies such as One Medical, PerkSpot, Rocket Laywer, SoFi and more.","The workload can occasionally feel overwhelming during busy seasons, but this is common for payroll/payroll tax professions across the board. Management has been focusing on simplification of processes and making sure our team is well versed in what to expect in advance, which has really made a dent in this pain point so I expect this to continue improving."
40,Sequoia,Great Place to Work,2020-05-29,5.0,Anonymous,"Sequoia is a people-first company and they really stay true to those words. From day 1 you feel welcomed, appreciated, and can tell that everyone you meet is genuinely excited to have you on the team.

I've never worked with so many outstanding and driven people. For team members who I don’t necessarily interact with day to day, they still make the effort to reach out and stay in touch. Working from home due to COVID-19 has been a struggle for many companies, but Sequoia handled this gracefully and is now leading the way for our employees and clients to return to work safely (whenever that may be). 

Sequoia makes an effort to recognize employees and make them feel appreciated, which goes a long way. Leadership will make time to speak with every employee and get to know them, instead of just acting as far-away figureheads like I have seen at other companies. 

Truly a great place to work!","Our benefits are great, but we could have more perks based on what we offer to the clients."
41,Sequoia,"Amazing People, Amazing Place",2020-05-26,5.0,Security Compliance Specialist,"When I was looking for a new career opportunity last year, I wanted to find a company whose values mirrored my own, and one that would make me feel lucky/excited to come to work everyday. For me, that company is Sequoia. I get to work with the most passionate, genuine, talented, and optimistic group of people, and on projects that are intriguing, rewarding, and valued by the company. My manager, team, and Sequoia's leadership are supportive of me, my professional growth, and my overall well-being. The icing on the cake is that we get to work in beautiful, modern work spaces, with healthy and delicious food provided by Sequoia!

Sequoia has been leading by example since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic in how they have handled everyone working from home, and in developing a Return-to-Work center for us and for our clients. The health and safety of Sequoia's clients and employees is of the utmost importance to the company.

The bottom line for me is that, if you are looking for a place to work that values you, your ideas, and your career goals, Sequoia is that place.",The only negative part about the past 7 months at Sequoia is that I haven't been able to see my coworkers in person since March due to the pandemic.
42,Sequoia,"Supportive, Engaging, and Fun!",2020-05-26,5.0,"Director, Payroll Services","Sequoia has been an incredibly supportive place to work. My direct boss often checks in, offers support, and makes herself available despite being busy herself. I've also received check ins from our CEO and other members of leadership to ensure I and my team are supported. In the times that I have provided feedback, it's heard and taken seriously, and I've seen action. There will always be obstacles, or hard days at any job, but to be in an environment that is solution-oriented is what makes a difference. 

I also love that Sequoia is innovative and provides solutions for our client-base. It's engaging to work for a company that is looking to take service to the next step. Projects like this take team work, and it allows me to become involved in a way that not only makes an impact, but provides me a unique opportunity to have some variety in my day.

As a director, I have a solid work-life balance, even during the busy season for my team. Sure, sometimes I work extra hours in the evening or the weekend, but it's not in excess. But the pay off is I get to spend quality time with my family, I can pick my son up from daycare and log back in later if I need to. For me, work life balance isn't about a 40 hour work week that is Monday through Friday 8-5, it's about having the flexibility to show up for what's important and having the autonomy to get my job done and still have a life outside of work, without being totally consumed by the day to day. 

Our compensation, benefits, and perks are incredibly generous. 

We set goals that are team based, meaning that everyone contributes to the impact, and we celebrate together. No one person gets all of the credit.","I honestly don't have cons. Every job has it's ups and downs, it's frustrations and obstacles. To list any of those as a con seems unfair. As I mentioned earlier, it's how a company and its leaders handle those frustrations and obstacles that makes the difference."

growth track 
-majority of non-management employees are down to earth and helpful because they know what it's like
-if you aren’t used to wearing multiple hats, you will here since there is always a lot to do & lack of structure/accountability across teams","If you’re reading a review here that lists no cons, it was created internally by the Sequoia talent team. If it seems fake, it is fake. They reach out to current employees to ask them to write a review and give them a template of what to write. 

 In my opinion, the most accurate cons have been listed in prior reviews that are deemed most helpful but I want to focus on a few ones that I personally experienced:

-There are no salary bands at Sequoia. I know for a fact I was making over $20k more than some of my peers with the same responsibilities. They make it a point to tell you not to talk about salaries to fellow team members. It comes down to how liked you are by management since your manager goes to the CEO for the compensation.

-Sleazy sales tactics. Their sales team doesn’t care about being accurate with the cost of the Sequoia product/services. They only care about winning the sale and will do anything necessary to win it. I have seen sales team members mess with numbers on presentations to make Sequoia seem more attractive against their competition. Very unprofessional and misleading.


Hypocrisy in management:

 - Constant heat-checks on how I was feeling and conversations on how to make things better but no action was ever taken or considered
- I requested feedback from my managers on things to improve on, only for them to defer the question and eventually wait long enough to avoid the question entirely. I went a year with no real feedback from management.
- Constantly asked how to improve issues I encountered, when providing answers, none were acted upon. 
- They claim one of their main goals is personal/professional development when in reality they have nothing in place for advancement

Lack of communication and transparency throughout teams and organization:

-I have seen multiple co-workers vanish into thin air to only be notified a week later that ‘they are no longer at Sequoia’. Some had been there 10+ years. Very disrespectful to people who gave a lot to the company. In most cases, they don’t even let the person giving notice to have 2 weeks, they make them leave the same day so they can’t tell any coworkers so they can spin the rhetoric however they want.

- I have seen positions be reduced to entry-level, data-entry positions and workloads be unfairly distributed to teams because other teams/managers of those teams refuse to pick up more responsibilities. 
- I have seen new positions introduced to the organization that completely undermine supporting roles of teammates and managers act like its no big deal why people are frustrated. 
- I have seen the vast majority of new hires come in with a lot of great energy and can-do attitude only to be burnt out in a few months because the resources aren’t there to support them nor are there any opportunities for growth.

If you really want to know how management is here do some research and search for former employees on LinkedIn and look at the timelines they were at Sequoia. Most are under 1-2 years because they figured out what Sequoia was all about, that being the complete opposite of what they preach. Reach out to them, they have no reason to mislead you if they aren’t there anymore. If you are joining a team with a newish manager, odds are they replaced the previous manager because they “do what leadership wants” and don’t have any freedom/decision making in that role because the directions are coming from the CEO

Their bonus structure set on garbage metrics that the majority of the teams don’t have control over. Mostly focused on sales goals that only the sales team has control over. 

At the end of the day, Sequoia is just another shady broker in a shady industry that doesn’t value their “bottom-level” employees. They expect them to work 60+ hours a week during “growth” season to retain a client that only the producer/client service get compensated for retaining."

I constantly feel supported by my manager and my team.  I recently experienced a loss of a loved one and so many people reached out and offered to take on some of my workload, not to mention the surprise flowers that were waiting at my house!  The team at Sequoia really cares about the whole person both personally and professionally, I've never been part of culture this focused on their people.  I've also been able to grow within my role and take on projects that I'm passionate about which is really important to me.",We are evolving and growing which sometimes leads to change in the process.
50,Sequoia,Great until it's not,2020-02-03,3.0,Salesforce Administrator,"The secret sauce of Sequoia is the people. I admire how they continually bring in great people with high levels of personal responsibility. You're very likely to meet kind and cool people you'll enjoy working with, and probably become close friends with - across all teams at the company. It's normal to expect that your colleagues will be resourceful and help you even when it's clearly inconvenient for them. Some groups operate very collaboratively and are able to mobilize on operations quickly, regardless if there is an existing process or if multiple functions are involved.","Your experience at Sequoia will likely differ, based on your team. Some people claim work/life balance, career opportunities, and job expectations are all clear and great while other people say they're poor. They're likely both accurate and I won't claim to speak for any of those items as if they represent the entire organization or why they are that way. Some Cons, however appear undeniable - e.g. operational ownership, transparency in hiring/firing, diversity and inclusion. 
-New/existing processes will get kicked between teams while decisions around ownership and support for the processes are avoided for days/weeks/months. In the meantime, Sequoia leadership depends on its individuals to work harder/longer to not let anything fail.
-It is likely that someone will be hired to your team or to manage you without any communication or having their expertise tested prior to their hiring. It is also likely that someone you know will suddenly no longer be employed without communication or reason - regardless of their quality of work or tenure. 
-Two employees on the same team of similar tenure/experience/responsibility both left the company for non-competitors recently. One does not identify as a minority and left on their terms, another does identify as a minority and was asked to leave, without reason, shortly after giving notice. On the surface there is only one discernible difference between the two employees, but the reason why remains an unanswered question. 
-Sequoia thought it was acceptable to reference and say ""my ninja"" repeatedly at an all-employees meeting. It is an obvious lack of sensitivity when people aren't even aware why it's unacceptable (i.e. if anyone asked what ""my ninja"" means, how do you answer that?). Personally, I did not have an opportunity to express my discomfort and question this prior to my departure, but hopefully Sequoia answers these questions in the future at an institutional level.

Despite the above, I chose to leave because I did not think my manager was capable of adding value or enabling my potential now or in the future. My experience at Sequoia was invaluable and I believe it can be a great place for anyone [not just some] if they can add processes and people that are focused on enabling the potential of many rather than the opinions of few."

52,Sequoia,Corporate Pyramid Scam,2019-10-28,1.0,Client Services,There are no pros to being in this toxic environment.,"Run for your life. This place is like the Trump administration with their corruption and scandals. The top people were popping bottles of champagne when Trump won because it supported their mission to continue to keep Americans from equal opportunities to health insurance. They don’t want you to be healthy! All about capitalism at this place. Total pyramid scam. The top people all making over $300k while the hardworking people are treated like the lower class.  They call them “principals”, but they’re really just the most brainwashed people in the Sequoia pyramid who can be easily controlled by the owner. All serious issues are swept under the rug, including harassment complaints. 

All positive reviews on here are FAKE. The recruiting and talent team directly writes them and asks other minions to post positive notes!!! Believe me!! Do NOT trust the recruiters!!! They are trained to scam you and keep building the toxic pyramid.

People have been running for the doors for years, especially across client service. They can’t handle lying to their clients everyday as leadership expects. Check the history of reviews! Speaking up is not allowed. Being innovative is not allowed. Being a leader, unless you are part of the mind control, is NOT allowed!!!

RUN while you still can! And if you’re thinking about becoming a client or employee of Sequoia’s, look elsewhere!"

54,Sequoia,"Great People, Some Growing Pains",2019-10-01,4.0,Analyst,"Most of the people at Sequoia are genuine and kind individuals.  People care about their work and are invested in the success of the company.  Although the company is over 300 people, there is still somewhat of a start up feel of being able to create your own role and identity within the greater framework of the business.  The company also prizes technology and innovation, although rapid evolution can sometimes be prized over quality control.","The hardest part of working at Sequoia is that despite the company's overall desire to innovate and change the industry, there are definitely still stagnant mentalities within employees and leadership.  A lot of leaders that have been at the company since its inception have outdated perceptions of their and their team's roles, and really fail to evolve their teams and take on new tasks.  For example, a lot of managers don't think basic proficiency in Microsoft Office is an absolute must-have for every team member, and end up trying to push off or farm out work that involves any sort of competency with Powerpoint or Excel, instead of teaching their team basic, marketable skills.  There is a dearth of problem solvers and people who have a basic desire to learn, and quite frankly, this stymies overall growth.  It also wears on the employees who are constantly driving things forward."

58,Sequoia,Great Culture & Opportunities!,2019-07-18,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Being at Sequoia for a few years now, I can honestly say the culture and people here set them a part from other companies! Everyone truly cares about you personally and professional. Greg, our CEO, takes the time to really get to know the team members and strives to be a people first company! 

Management notices your potential and hard work and provides opportunities to support your growth path. I am thankful for the opportunities that has allowed me to grow and make a difference here! I have built an amazing relationship with my manager and other team members who have made me feel like Sequoia is a home away from home.  I love that we don't just get to know each other, but get to know each other's families!

Everyone works hard, but we are taken care of and celebrated throughout the year, which is appreciated. The team comes together to celebrate professional wins and personal milestones (baby showers, wedding showers, work anniversaries, birthdays, etc.). 

Other Great Perks:
Work environment (office space, snacks, music, desk setup)
Onsite Wellbeing Programs (teeth cleaning, eye exams, flu shots, massages, etc.)
Giving back to the community (CORA, wardrobe for opportunity) 
PTO (they encourage team members to take time off!)",A perfect company does not exist. There are going to be road bumps and growing pain in every company. You can’t grow and succeed without change. What I admire is that issues are addressed and management and leadership work together to find solutions. I believe Sequoia is growing and learning. What makes Sequoia strong are the values and people that are the base of this company.
59,Sequoia,"Overworked, underpaid, extremely disorganized company",2019-06-20,1.0,Client Service Manager,none that I can think of.,There was always so much confusion on processes and best practice you end up running around wearing 10 hats. The hours are brutal and they basically expect you to be on call at all times. High turnover and messy leadership and direction.
60,Sequoia,Client Service,2019-06-11,2.0,,"There are some genuinely nice people in the office and if your on the right team its not that bad. Free snacks in the kitchen and randomly there will be office events (happy hours, on site 15 min massages, etc.).","For starters this review will get pushed down by some fake positive one with a push from the talent team. Wouldn’t even put it past that team to create fake positive reviews themselves. Take a look at the positive reviews yourself and make your own judgements but the positive reviews tend to be pretty short and most say they couldn’t think of any cons. Im sorry but if your sold on a company you’re going to be raving about it and not just write generic positive statements. The no cons really bugs me and thats part of whats wrong with Sequoia. Either these people are naive or just flat out delusional and don’t want to see the problems that exist. You will also have people that will talk s*** about the company, talk s*** about a useless meeting they just came out of, talk about all the issues but tell management what an informative and great meeting that was. Having an employee base that is not willing to provide honest feedback will be detrimental to Sequoia’s growth (People could also be afraid to be honest as they don’t want to get let go).

What ultimately sucks about Sequoia is that it almost has the foundation to be an amazing company to work for. If we treated our own employees like we do our clients it would be a different story. Around 100 people have left this fiscal year and we have a few more weeks till 7/1!!!! That is just crazy!!!! (100 is a number i  recently heard but thats not something i can confirm myself but i do know for sure we were over 60 a few months ago with half of those being employees that had been with the company at least a min of a year). Sequoia has admitted the have a retention issues but acknowledging you have a problem vs actually doing something about it are two different things. Very tired of hearing we have a retention issue over and over and all we have to show for it was a survey to provide feedback. That buys the company a few more months to do nothing and pick the easiest things to address. Be nice if they share all the feedback everyone put!

WHY WE STILL DONT HAVE AN HR TEAM IN 18 YEARS IS RIDICULOUS!!! Dont tell me our new HRBP’s (formerly called the talent team, must he nice to not be qualified and get a hrbp title) is an HR team. Its just the short the company took to say we are starting an HR team. The lack of an HR department is the root cause to a lot of the issues at Sequoia. Employee’s are not held to the same standard (lazy people tend to get away with so much), you can get paid 20k less then a co-worker doing the same exact thing (you probably also work harder then the person getting paid more), and there is no place to go when you have an issue with management.  

Lets not forget about the hundreds of meetings and all hands that we have (an over exaggeration for sure but I’m trying to make a point). Most of the meetings are pointless and are not beneficial to anyone. Why have a meeting for the sake of having one!? There is no need to meet as much as we do and waste our times. Sometimes it feels like some of the upper management schedule a last min meeting to make it look like they are adding value to the company but the content of the meeting has no actual objective or will lead to making our daily lives better. Instead creates more work and forces us to work long hours to catch up from the time we lost and could have actually been working and servicing out clients. There should be no more useless meetings. 

No loyalty at Sequoia either. Watched someone who had been at the company for over 10 years and even have a company celebration for the commitment she made to Sequoia get rid of like she was a nobody. It was so wrong how she was let go and the entire office was in shock that it happened. Pretty much if she could get let go like that nobody was safe and maybe thats the message the company wanted to send. Stay in line or you will be let go. A few of us even said i guess we better keep our opinions to ourselves now. Sad thing to say when you cant express your feelings or honest opinions where you work.

You will also be asked to take on more task (you will not get compensated for it or get a new title since that would just be a stupid ask) all the time. You will be asked to take on the slack for your teammates who have been messing around and put themselves in a backlog. If you complain your not a team player and don’t want to help. The management team enables this bad behavior and it sucks. Some people really gotta go but since they like the person they wont do anything but overwork the good people. Then they wonder why we have lost so many good people to date.

There are favorites for sure and people who should be fired but still haven’t been let go. How someone can be at a company for over 5 years and not be able to add value to their own team and still have a job is just silly (nicest word i could put). Good for them I guess, getting paid to do way less then the rest of their own team must be nice. Its just sad to see the people who do work so hard and care about their work and clients get overlooked because the might not be company favorite or be all happy and carefree. Ive seen it happen way to many times where the hard workers have to fight to get promoted and sometimes dam near quit for anything to be done. If you can manage to play the game right and get the right people to like you, then you will get far at this company and you don’t even have to be good at your job! 

Im sure i can keep going and going about Sequoia but please don’t be naive in thinking this place the best place to be. Its not bad but its not great either and the last year its been trending in the wrong direction to a place where people want to continue working. This was a very long review not because I’m just an angry person or that unhappy but because i actually care. I care about my team, what I do, and my clients and it sucks when the company you decided to work for is headed down a not so great path and no real sign of change on the horizon. I would love it if we actually made changes to help the employee’s and not just to line the pockets of those higher up."

62,Sequoia,I would not work here,2019-06-02,1.0,Anonymous Employee,Some good workers and teammates. Biggest problem here is abusive leadership.,"Very weak leadership. The leadership is not strategic at all. 

I was told to work longer hours. I replied with “I’ve completed all of my work and my customers are happy. Where should i spend more time and what should I focus on to improve?” Leadership’s advice write emails with more bullet points and hustle nights and weekends. Essentially they were saying you do great work but if you don’t stay in the office until 8pm every night then you will be fired. 

They cycle through so many employees that they are eventually able to find a few that feel lucky to have a job bc of various circumstances. Once that happens sequoia leadership goes in for the kill to take advantage of them. They do this to people with work visa issues, under qualified candidates etc. They require 70-80 hour weeks and use threats and intimidation to keep it that way. 

They are very cliquey almost to the level of a cult. I believe mgmt is in on it together as they have a very profitable business by stealing 10% of all health insurance premiums. This middle man approach ended for the travel agent industry and will most likely end the same way for sequoia once technology catches up to the health insurance industry. For now though sequoia mgmt is trying to make as much as they can at the expense of their workers, the insurance industry and the rest of Silicon Valley."

Free dinners for those that stay late, colleagues telling you to go home and they will pick up whats left to be done, other departments giving thanks.

2. The managers seem like they really care about you and your career path. No, there may not be a new job for you in 18 months, but if you develop relationships with them, work with them on your goals and keep it front of mind for them, it happens. In other places, managers just managed a P&L and did reviews and only were around if a client complained.

- Innovative healthcare  insurance products - for early stage, mid-size, and household name technology companies - what Sequoia calls the glide-path of products/services
- Building a lot of proprietary technology
- Smart, nice people
- Best consulting team in the industry
- Strong client service VPs
- Visionary founders (Greg and Kelly)

I was lucky enough to work here for more than a few years, so I was able to see the maturation of the company. Between the Sequoia One, Sequoia Tech, and Sequoia SI products/services, Sequoia is probably the most well positioned benefits consulting firm in the country.

Alongside the healthcare innovations, Sequoia has the best people in the industry – many of the folks are either high performing in their set roles, taking advantage of the many advancement opportunities, or getting hired out by brand name technology and consulting firms. 

There is a lot of opportunity to make an impact here and you can see the impact on the business directly – whether it’s through special projects or client work.

Also, the wellbeing team has developed and maintained a great wellbeing program – offering various perks like One Medical, Rocket Lawyer, Grand Rounds, financial education seminars, Fitbit competitions, Headspace competitions, etc. Other perks include a stocked kitchen, flexible work locations (CA, AZ, Remote, NY), many team building offsites at fun remote locations, etc.

Most importantly, Sequoia is a family and the relationships you make here are real – both internally and with client partners. Sequoia Alum stay in touch and often have deep personal relationships outside of work.","Sequoia is in major growth mode so with that comes some disruption and a lot of change. The business and service model continue to change as Sequoia reaches new heights. Managing this change creates discomfort at times. I’ve read some of the past reviews and find the frustrations completely understandable. New roles have been created and some roles have changed – leaving some people feeling like they are working incredibly hard while adjusting to their roles. To me, all of this seems like a completely natural result of this type of growth. I get why some have taken it quite personally given employment is a highly sensitive subject. That said, knowing this company and the leaders in it – they do care deeply about the employees and have worked incredibly hard to manage the growth in a way that supports the business and the greatest number of people."

People aren't feeling valued, appreciated and cared for like they used to. Employee morale is low and work life balance can be really tough, especially during the renewal seasons. There's an odd aspect to the culture where people who work more than they should (late evenings/weekends) are more rewarded and recognized than those that don't, which continues to feed the work-life balance issue. Instead of encouraging already hard-working people to work harder, they should be encouraged to disconnect and spend time with their families."

They want to make sure there is a fit not only for Sequoia but also the potential candidate interviewing.

Trying to be more progressive in an industry lacking innovation","The company is a complete dictatorship.   Please do your homework on the CEO's reputation in the industry before you consider taking a job here.  Ask yourself if you'll be happy working in an environment  with someone who literally has to control every decision in the company (from the napkin color at events to the emails that can be sent to prospects).  Do you believe that's an effective leadership structure for a 250 person company?  Middle management exists only to carry out his orders and nothing else.  Look at the past list of C level execs who have joined Sequoia only to leave within 24 months because of this environment.  You will not be immune to it just because you aren't in the management ranks.  There is no room for dissent at Sequoia - it is absolutely true that you can't have an opinion that differs from the CEO.  If you do it's likely your time will be limited.

All employee departures are swept under the rug.  Smart, hard working colleagues are often just gone with no explanation of what happened.  Never a thank you for their contributions or well wishes for the future.  Lately there have been more voluntary departures of really good people who have just had their fill of the dictatorial style of the CEO.  This spiteful treatment of departures is part of the overall culture unfortunately.  

Useless busywork.  Outside of all the work you already have on your plate, you'll be forced into cross functional collaboration projects where you have to devise a way to make the business better and devote time to your project and team each week.  At the end of 3 months you'll have to present your deliverable and try to roll it out to an employee base that will never wind up using what you worked on.  Here's my solution to this - hire an operations team to improve the operations of the company instead of making your client facing roles take on more work.

Sequoia has no HR team but has about 8 recruiters and recruiting coordinators.  I still don't know what the recruiting coordinators do all day.  This is a huge potential liability for when actual HR related matters come up.   

As others have mentioned, the culture and values are largely fake.  Sequoia is a pure volume play on the employee benefits sector, yet one of their stated values  is quality over scope.  The support teams are overworked and burnt out even though growth goals aren't being hit.   I know for a fact that morale is very low across most of the servicing org and people are looking for the exit, but the last 4-5 reviews on here are all people saying how they ""LOVE Sequoia"".  I honestly believe that any negative reviews here are immediately countered by the army of recruiting coordinators trying to maintain the phony facade that people are happy here.  And again, everyone lives in fear of saying anything negative internally because there are numerous agents of the CEO just waiting to report back to him.   An employee survey was sent out recently but it wasn't anonymized - what kind of company does that??

You will be expected to always be ""on"" while working here.  That's the tone that's set from the top.  Think about your future and if work/life balance and family are important to you - Sequoia is trying to grow as fast as a venture backed tech company but attracting talent to the insurance industry is still a major struggle in the Bay Area.  You will inevitably pick up the slack as the rate of hiring never comes close to the rate of growth."

We're building the future, and that comes with getting your hands dirty and maybe a few splinters on the way.

There is a continuous approach to ensure teams have the tools they need to succeed and an extreme (in a good way!) focus on end-user experience: internally and externally. Do our services match what our clients want/need? If not, let's figure it out so we can remain competitive and stay updated with our client feedback to ensure their experience is positive. Same approach internally. 

Management wants to hear feedback and wants to make improvements. It's a very flat organization with many opportunities to participate in projects, improvements w/in team and cross functionally, community impact events, client and HR events, internal fun events (team olympics! wine tasting! paint night! more!). Anyone who feels they are not heard, speak up, and you will be! 

Specifically for the Client Operations Team at Sequoia - what a fun bunch of driven folks! Very intent on implementing and improving processes, spreading project management best practices, engaging with clients proactively, staying ahead of the systems landscape... not to give away all of our secrets!

In closing, the culture at Sequoia is truly inspirational:  positive, trustworthy, hardworking teams. I've never seen so many amazing outcomes in such a short time. Never bored here and definitely see the fruits of our work - everyday. Super excited to see what we develop in the near future and long term.","Cyclical - benefits team be prepared for busy Oct - Feb, however, new processes will help you understand your responsibilities and proactively plan so you can stay ahead and go home on time!

The amount of innovative ideas we have in here is incredible. I really enjoy coming into work each day. We work hard and we have a lot of fun while doing so.","Our NY office is currently much smaller than the CA offices, so there's a different dynamic between the three offices (two in CA, one in NY). The NY office definitely has more of a ""startup"" feel than headquarters in San Mateo and our PEO division in CA. Also, we need more set processes in place.

The values are front and center, and the talent team is seasoned, professional, and transparent. The on-boarding includes both formal and informal paths to get new hires to connect in their role, department, and the overall company. All of the 'best practices' are present:  new hire orientation, socialization activities, mentor/buddy partnering, 30 daily stand up meeting for 15 min of connecting with a leader to calibrate, and success tracking from day one!

The work environment is modern, open plan, and tastefully decorated. Lots of big and little collaboration spaces, glass walls everywhere for lots of natural light, and a killer cafe/kitchen with great snack food options, beer/Kombucha on tap, and both community and restaurant booth seating. Did I mention the periodic visits from comfort animals?  Service dogs, cats, and bunnies stop by for visits, and we have on-site wellness / yoga / massage resources! Great benefits package too, because that is our product!

The leadership is visible and engaged in every element of the business, with lots of all hands meetings, weekly management collaboration, and celebration time. Announcements of birthdays, anniversaries, and life events draw out the family feeling on a daily basis.

All of this great culture results in amazing customer relationships, a blue ribbon client list / reputation, and a great/profitable business! Lots of fun to be winning!","The work load is seasonal in several roles, and that can create significant stress for certain roles."

Sequoia truly focuses on overall wellness; not just for employees but families as well. Sequoia Impact program encourages employees and families to do charity/make a positive impact in the world.

The average age is fairly young - late 20's/early 30's. 

A few fine company events throughout the year.","Groups are cliquey. 

The idea that every group needs to adhere to the same rules and guidelines set forth by the Benefits team makes it a very challenging (in a bad way) place to work. To expand: the Benefits arm of Sequoia is the largest revenue-generator. 401(k) and Risk Management are a distant and galactically distant third, respectively. The folks in these two much smaller departments are asked to keep up with the Benefits machine, conform to the Benefits timelines, guidelines, client service cycles, and meet stretch goals (to hit very meager bonuses). Not once did anyone stop to ask ""is this good for our group?"" The question was always ""is this good for Sequoia?"" aka the bottom line. 

The two groups above - because they are forced to align with the Benefits way of doing things - is grossly understaffed, under-developed, and is making a case for a company who is holding back their employees' career growth. 

Very slow to promote. 

Utter lack of communication from top to bottom. 

Leadership is strongly lacking - especially in the 401(k) and Risk Management departments - this of course does not help with the aforementioned issues."

The ""shoot from the hip"" motto ultimately damages the customer experience and causes more inefficiencies across departments. There is little efficient communicate within and between departments. Often times when there were customer issues around deadline expectations set by the sales team, management would do little to step in. There was no accountability. 

The CEO only trusts a handful of his own management staff. You are always under the microscope and he is always dissecting your actions, testing to see if you are truly ""a team player"". Often times being a team player means pitting yourself against other staff. Since the company is so small, the CEO has a direct impact on your employment. If he deems you ""not a fit"", you may want to start considering other career options other than Sequoia Benefits."
127,Sequoia,One of the most innovative companies in the professional services industry,2014-08-22,4.0,Client Services,"This company continuously proves itself to be one of the most innovative companies in the professional services industry. I've read some of the reviews from ex-employees that have felt slighted in various ways, and I don't hold it against them. It is an incredibly challenging environment. I've definitely felt/experienced some of the same feelings that they have shared. The main thing about Sequoia, though, the thing that always prevails, is that we are always working towards getting better at coming through for our clients. That is what makes us the best, and as long as we have that focus, we'll continue to be the best. 

Career development is real here. We've almost doubled in size to around 90 employees in the last 15 months. This has created opportunities for many people to get promoted. The most successful people in this company have been the ones who work A LOT but also hold themselves to incredibly high standards. They take personal responsibility for their work, which is really appreciated by the rest of the team. It is definitely not easy but many many people have been given great careers here with that mindset. 

The founder is incredibly capable. We are constantly innovating, and embracing the start-up culture that we serve. I've learned so much about what it takes to build an excellent professional services and consulting firm during my time here. We've done a great job attracting top talent. One thing that strikes me about the culture that Greg has created is the high level of collaboration. We are always working to improve on this and the people here are genuinely nice and smart. I feel like my colleagues are truly invested in my success.","With innovative/fast growth comes a lot of opportunity for things to be left to the side. We do move fast and focus on the most important tasks - especially tasks revolving around coming through for our clients. It seems like this has left some people feeling left behind or untrained. Mostly, we take personal responsibility for own learning's but we could do a better job of sharing those learning's. Whether it is through continual training's or a different/better knowledge sharing platform. I think this would shore up some of those feelings. With that said, people are super gracious about sharing their knowledge whenever presented with questions.

Also, we could do a better job of facilitating side/special projects. In the past, I know people felt vulnerable when they considered taking on new projects that are outside of their core job responsibilities. There was little guidance. I think EEs in general should be cautious about this but it is something to consider here as well. Of course, the flip side of this is that if/when you are successful, you really build a great brand internally, and have a really positive impact on the firm. Also, you are given the opportunity to learn something totally outside your knowledge domain, on the job.

The founder is a great CEO -  though many times he innovates ahead of everyone else. We kind of find out after the fact that we are doing something. Which is pretty normal enough in an innovative company but it leads to uncertainty about whether our job responsibilities are going to change, if organizational structure will change, and just in general, about whether or not we are going to be able to keep up. Many times, during these transitions, the really top employees at the company are asked to take on considerable amounts of more work, and it seems like it can be really difficult to say no, because the work does need to be done. This has a ripple effect down into the rest of the organization, where everyone ends up taking on more work. The process is natural enough for a start-up type company. I can see where people have had mixed feelings here. I think we can do a better job of managing the EEs expectations and emotions around the uncertainty/changes. In the end, the change/innovations really are a part of trying to stay ahead of our industry and continuously working towards being the most admired firm in the industry, and is really the reason why people come to Sequoia."
128,Sequoia,Amazing place to build your career,2014-08-18,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Sequoia promotes from within and is a place that really fosters your personal career and development. Everyone here truly cares about one another and is always willing to help each other out. Sequoia is a very fun place to work because it is a collaborative and team oriented environment. Recently, they implemented an Unlimited PTO policy to reward everyone's focus and dedication. Changes like these are happening constantly to continue to make Sequoia one of the best places to work in the Bay Area.",With any growing company there are always new systems to put in place. This is constantly evolving and gives employees the opportunity to help innovate and really make an impact right away.
129,Sequoia,Sequoia is an amazing company that is innovating and changing the healthcare industry,2014-08-13,5.0,Consultant,"Sequoia provides best in class customer service for their clients and employees.
If you're looking to work hard and be rewarded with endless opportunities, there isn't a better place to grow your career!
Sequoia has been more than I even could of expected!","Sequoia has so much opportunity and growth potential for your career, there aren't enough hours in the day.
Currently no San Francisco Office."
130,Sequoia,"Stressful, Overworked and Underpaid",2014-08-08,1.0,Client Services,"Pros – It's really hard to think of a lot of pros for this type of environment. Some of the only highlights to look forward to would be the company events such as anniversary events or team outings. There are also some great people that work here who are reliable and truly give all they have.  In the overall picture the good will never outweigh the bad unless a drastic change is implemented. I can't say I enjoy working here since the amount of stress is worse than being thrown into a shark tank. If you ‘re lucky  you will see the bigger picture before all the grey hair sets in.
Cons – I feel burdened every single day here. I feel like I am drowning but the only thing that really keeps me going is the fact that I work with some awesome people. At times I can’t sleep and  it is recommended to get a night guard if you plan to stay.","We are  so understaffed compared to how much work is pushed on each employee that it truly is the luck of the draw on which items need to fall through the Sequoia cracks. The thing is everyone even management has these things happen but of course they will not get fired. Someone that's worked there much longer than me filled me in on the company and told me that for as long as they've been around they have seen people tossed out for as little as disagreeing on how to handle something. Be warned that if you decide to remain at Sequoia you will see a fork in the road and I recommend taking the road that leads out for your own well-being.

Pay is low in comparison to the work load. Let me make a correction Pay is low in general compared to other brokers. It is sad that this company could undervalue such hard working people and on top of that make them work like a mule.

There's no integrity. For a company that has this as one of their key values I have never seen such disgusting actions from people who should hold themselves and the business to a higher degree of standards. If you are wondering about how bad it could get just keep this idea in your mind. “If you saw on the news about ______ running ______ over because he said I don’t like the color of your car, what would you think?” The normal response would be why someone would do that. The Sequoia response: “They were not a fit for us or the lovely they were not performing as we would have liked and they are well aware of it.” It is sad that such good people could be so cruel and if you stay long enough you will be faced with if you value your integrity."
131,Sequoia,The sky is the limit...,2014-07-31,5.0,Benefitst,"The best work environment I have ever been part of. The team is focused on results and coming through for clients. This is not a clock in/out environment and that is why it is not a fit for some people. There is no flying under the radar which means everyone is a major contributor.

If you're looking to work hard and be rewarded with endless opportunities, there isn't a better place to grow your career!",Growing company challenges but leads to tons of opportunities.
132,Sequoia,Worst Experience Ever!!,2014-07-12,1.0,,"Aside from working with great people and building some lasting friendships, there are very few positives.",During the interview process many employees will try to get you to buy in to Sequoia's propaganda. Once I signed on I immediately began to regret my decision. You are worked to death and then worked some more with nothing to show for it except more work. The leadership team has no idea how to manage employees or instill positive morale. Employees are let go for no valid reason aside from them not being a good fit! Tread carefully!!!
133,Sequoia,Complete facade on being one of the best places to work for.  They work you to death then toss you out to sea!,2014-06-09,1.0,,"You receive adequate training under the illusion that you are becoming part of a team, then the rug gets pulled out from underneath you!  You do get a chance to work with some amazing people.","When you first start working here, it is easy to believe the you are becoming a part of the team.  As my length of time passed working here, I saw many get fired and the word to us from the management was that the person they let go ""knew it was coming"" and assured the rest of the staff that they had tried hard to work with the ex employee but""It just didn't work out"" or ""It wasn't a fit"".  Only after talking with a recently fired employee, will you find that they had no idea at all that they were going to be let go or that their performance was lacking in any way.  Everyone I have spoken to that has been fired says they were completely caught off guard when it happened. Sequoia tries to give off the impression that they are there for you, but in the end, you find out they are only into it for themselves. Many employees work long hours, but it never seems good enough.  The company is under the direction of a CEO who often changes his mind on how to do things from one moment to the next.  Don't drink the kool-aid because you might begin to feel safe only to find that you are the next once forced to walk the plank! There are some amazing people who work there but I am sure they are wondering when their head will be the next one on the chopping block."
134,Sequoia,"Work hard, play hard",2014-04-14,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"I have been working at Sequoia for almost 3 years and can't imagine a better place to work at. The industry's ever-changing environment keeps me on my toes - in a good way - there is always something new to learn and improve on. In my financial analyst role I've been growing professionally since the day one and have been given a lot of opportunities to work on different projects / initiatives. All you have to do it ask for it and show interest. People are excited to see you do well. It's amazing how many hard-working, driven people are in the team. Everyone works super hard but still has time to pause, answer a question, help out a coworker or chat about their personal life. We celebrate personal and work milestones, exciting life events and all the little (but important) things you wouldn't expect to celebrate at the workplace. It's nice to come to work every day and know that people know you on a personal level and appreciate the hard work you put in.",Very fast-paced but I actually enjoy that kind of environment..so not a real con. It will be interesting to see how the company deals with the rapid growth.
135,Sequoia,Your typical disaster startup,2014-04-07,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"Very nice team of peers, fun team events and celebrations.","The CEO is a nice dude but when I worked there, was also running the company and should not have been. He is one of the main reasons I left. Also, lack of training on the marketing team and the sales guys don't care if they screw you over and make you work late to finish something they were late getting to you. All the usual startup growing pains, compounded by a lack of process, and a CEO that changes his mind every 5 seconds and throws temper tantrums when people quit. Very little room for advancement. It wasn't for me."
