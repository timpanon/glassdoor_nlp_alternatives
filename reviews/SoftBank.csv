Good location with Shimbashi station and JR line.
Flexible time.","Highly political place, with traditional Japanese back-balling if you don't go to the Izakaya with your colleagues for example.
Very long hours, overwork. I have seen people working all night after a full-day work.
Engineers level is in general very bad.
Traditional Japanese service, not technology, driven system which lead to HR and sales having higher consideration than engineers.
Very low pay even for highly skilled people.
During my time at SoftBank nobody could explain me what was the company vision, nor what was our goals.
It's also possible to get hired as internal without relevant skills or university degree.
Very strange, politically oriented decisions from top management which leads to technical instability and distrust."

Oftentimes, they will hire you for a Tokyo office location and then switch your location to elsewhere within 3 months. (Happened to a many of my co-workers).

151,SoftBank,There is potential but many teething issues,2017-03-05,3.0,Anonymous Employee,"- SoftBank Robotics is a truly international company located in cool places, and it is very likely that your daily interactions would be with other employees in Paris or Japan or, if you are in the US, Boston or San Francisco, if not all four. Because of relatively flexible travel policies to aid cohesion in this growing organization, travel is often possible between these places as long as a good business reason can be justified.
- In all four locations (except the HQ in Shiodome, Tokyo) the culture is casual and the environment is collegial. This is particularly true of Paris and Boston.
- Boston has a small, young team and people generally joke around and play ping pong at work. San Francisco (and some times, Boston) has drinks on Friday. Paris employees often go out together and organize cool team building events outside of work.
- The people! In every office, people have been consistently smart if not brilliant, funny and kind when you meet them. Hence I recommend that it's important to go fly to the other offices when you commence your role, to visit the remote offices and meet people face to face. You are much more likely to figure out communication strategies that work across time zones and emails/calls, then trying to initiate things remotely.
- The startup turning into big company culture is still in it's teething phases, and while that results in a number of cons - the big takeaway is that you can influence things far more than you could in an established company. Always question things around you if they don't make sense (a lot probably won't but that's OK :) ), and the smart people aforementioned will most likely see your point, hear your proposal (propose how they could be different!), and you'll be in action!
- Of course, how can I forget that Pepper and Nao are so cool! This is a nascent industry, so you will have moments of pride when you see Pepper or Nao's face randomly pop up in media or journals about robotics and AI, and go to cool events such as the RoboCup or TechCrunch.","- Technical growth opportunities are currently very limited in the US since the development happens in Paris, so to really grow you would need to relocate. 
- Salaries in the US are based on Europe standards, so employees are paid well below market average. This may change soon.
- A loose structure means that sometimes double work (or no work) tends to happen, in fact even 2 people may be hired in different continents for the same responsibility. People end up doing work they are not supposed to and others end up routinely left out of the loop for information they are supposed to receive to start doing their work. But this is to be expected, and needs a lot of communication and meeting people face-to-face to fix - not just managerial level but also the working level.
- Miscommunication flows to miscommunication between management and HR. They have an unprofessional policy requiring technical employees to be escorted out even when they give notice, which is arbitrarily applied. 2 employees leaving the same function for the same other company were treated differently where 1 was escorted and the other kept their notice.

- Communicating across time zones is a challenge. The impact is felt more in offices that are not 'upstream' in the process. For example, information on new software releases or new potential customers would be released at the end rather than being communicated earlier on. People do try to solve that by sending Powerpoint reports - but this means reading a lot of Powerpoints and making sure you ask to be included in the email chain, risking potentially being overloaded with unnecessary information."

Depending on your department but it is fairly easy to get paid days off compared to traditional Japanese companies.,"The company claims itself to be ""global"" but in reality it is very domestic. Company culture is quite top-down and unless you are in management position your opinions won't matter. Management often makes decisions with out analyzing the situation well and sets goals very high which is just simply impossible to achieve. Because it grew so fast, the company wants you to work as if you are in a startup but there are so many constraints now that it grew to a company with 20,000+ employees."
