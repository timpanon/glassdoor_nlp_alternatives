30,TPG,Overall an excelelnt place to work,2021-04-11,4.0,Executive Assistant,"- Strong DEI focus that feels like more than lip service, but still have more to do here
- Excellent support from top-down during COVID 
- Good work/life balance, depending on group
- Smart colleagues who like their job
- CA (and possibly other US based assistants) receive overtime in addition to regular salary (per a California law - applies to anyone classified as clerical, I think)
- Culture of humility helps weed out most of the ""difficult"" folks
- Great benefits
- Post-pandemic more open to varied work schedules/ WFH options
- Excellent parental leave policy for both birth and non-birth parents
- Many resources available, including a top-notch graphics department for all of your ppt needs
- Overall, this job is what you make of it and it is a pretty great place to work.","- Leadership is still primarily older straight white cisgendered men
- Historical finance industry culture still exists, though more hidden now
- History of lowballing starting salaries and zero salary transparency
- Given that the majority of positions of power are held by straight white men, I have seen some tone policing issues, classism, and unconscious bias (we all undergo unconscious bias training. the firm is working to create a more open ""calling in"" culture - come help us!)"
31,TPG,Generous Company,2021-04-06,4.0,Administrative,"Modern offices, many amenities, great co-workers",More importance is placed on those working directly in the finance realm of the company. Support is sometimes seen as second class.
32,TPG,TPG Fort Worth is where dreams come to die,2021-03-28,2.0,Accountant,"-Everyone is interested in doing what’s right for investors
-Great business- TPG is always ahead of the curve and thinking outside of the box
-TPG hires great people. Just about everyone is intelligent and competent, and nice to work with
-Senior management is out of San Francisco and holds high standards in terms of diversity and inclusion, which is heavily supported by FW management. The company is especially supportive of LGBT employees
-The support employees give to charitable initiatives is truly heartwarming. There are some ongoing charities the firm supports, and employees go above and beyond to support these causes. For example- care packages for the troops, fundraising for the cystic fibrosis foundation, and a clothing drive for an LGBT teen homeless shelter showed everyone jumping in with their donations and their time
-All the free food you can dream of (pre-pandemic)
-Company is taking the pandemic seriously - everyone is working from home","-Massive divide between the “front office” (SF) and “back office” (FW). From the perspective of SF, back office is nothing and the only interaction between the two offices is through a few very senior individuals. There’s no understanding or appreciation of all the work that goes on in FW to support front office.
-Crazy amounts of turnover. Considering that TPG has a great business, a respected name, pays well for the market, and hires the best, this shouldn’t be.
-Crushingly hierarchical. Strong attitude by management that everyone should “stay in their place” and that only the most senior should have their voices heard. And even then, even the most senior often have no control over their careers. Job functions will change on the whims of management, even if it doesn’t make sense. Some of it has to do with the high amount of turnover, but uprooting the entire way the system works isn’t the way to plug a hole 
-While there are so many smart and competent people around, it’s more likely that an incompetent person who knows how to throw around business buzzwords and play the politics game will get promoted
-I’ve never seen so many great people so beaten down by a place – management has no regards at all for the interests, background, or skill sets of employees. It doesn’t matter what you are hired to do- the job you were hired into can change out from under you out of nowhere, or you could be plucked out of your job at any moment and thrown into a new role you have no interest or experience in. Don’t get too comfortable with the manager who hired you- that’s very likely to change multiple times
-Nothing ever improves- people are rarely left in a role long enough to become proficient and begin to improve the process and make things more efficient. Constant thrown-in learning mode. If someone doesn’t feel like doing something, they can just ignore it until everyone’s job changes again and it’s someone else’s problem. Manual processes galore thanks to expensive new systems put in that are only 90% of the way integrated
-No training. Sink or swim mentality
-Culture of fear. When something goes wrong (and it will) and it makes the “back office” look bad, management is very quick to point a finger at someone and fire them. Because of this blame culture, people are hesitant to take ownership of things. Because nobody takes ownership and jobs change so often, there’s a lot left up in that air that doesn’t end up getting done

Advice to anyone considering a job here:
-I’d only recommend if you are really, really junior (less than 2 years out of school) and completely open to anything. If you throw everything you know out the door and are willing to do anything and learn from the ground up, you can do very well here. There are a few valuable people at the firm who came up this way and are very successful.
-If you’re not really junior and are interviewing here, do your homework and ask the right questions. I am writing this because I wish I had seen it before I quit my job to come to TPG because it was an “amazing opportunity”. I saw a few negative reviews back then and dismissed them because I figured they were written by bitter ex-employees who were fired. I was NOT fired- but being at TPG was a depressing, soul-sucking experience. Being there makes you lose your confidence and forget what you’re really capable of."
33,TPG,A dichotomy of both good and horrifically bad,2021-03-17,2.0,Fund Accountant,"Perks were good when in the office. Exposure to new and changing things within PE. It's a dynamic work environment and not a place where you'll be bored to tears. There are some great people here, but also some atrocious personalities.","Where to begin... it can be extremely political. It's not who you hitch your wagon to, but who they hitch your wagon to. You will watch people continue to get promoted not necessarily for their skills/knowledge, but because they are visible and have a director who fights for them. Other directors and senior managers will deliberately hold people back from progressing in their careers. 
Some junior to early management level staff go above and beyond and the response from upper management is ""that's what is expected"" while others just do their job and are deemed to be promotable. They'll also promote you if they think you're going to quit, so people have successfully played that card (something to consider).
There is no sense of development of skills and knowledge. No true and comprehensive training. They want people to stay in the position they are in because it's too difficult to replace them. They will say that the firm promotes and encourages lateral movement between teams, but that is seldom the case, and they will likely pay recruiters heaps of money to hire externally before ever considering someone internally. 
Many of the senior managers and managers are not true ""managers"" or leaders; they are subject matter experts on their funds, and have little ability to grow, develop, and teach the people reporting to them. 

The culture is very poor under a thinly veiled attempt at fun and friendly.  Be very ready to be thrown under the bus by your Manager/Sr. Manager if something goes wrong, and for them to withhold promotion because of it. 

Happy politicking!"

They work you long hours and through lunch, so have it catered daily, but with no breaks. Its like a cattle call when its lunch time. They also pile work on you and don't ask how you are doing, and will continue until you go under with no remorse. Very cold environment. Not a great place for work/life balance."

No IT leadership.  Resistant to outside ideas or persons from Wall Street.   Very silo'd, political place to work where it is forbidden to speak to anyone outside your work area without sanction from direct supervisor.  

Decision authority at TPG is concentrated in the hands of a few persons with zero ""street"" experience, who in turn reward loyalty over ability.

Empty IPO promises since 2008.  Run by limousine liberals and trial lawyers whose political agenda take precedence over employee advancement.  While you can get paid, you are at the mercy of lawyers whose instinct in disputes is to sue first, manage later.  Not for FW outsiders or industry experienced pros.  TPG has become insular and employees from similar PE firm are seen as threats.   Avoid TPG if you are an established PE pro."

Job duties are clearly defined and pretty straightforward.","Don't expect any variety in your day-to-day tasks. I supposed some departments may have more variety than others, but generally speaking, the EA role at TPG is limited to booking travel, scheduling calls/mtgs, and preparing expense reports. It's good place to be if you don't need to be challenged and don't mind feeling like you're in a rut after just 2 weeks. Most Admins can expect to help out at the front desk answering phones and greeting guests when the receptionist needs to take breaks. This can be disruptive to your day when you're trying to get things done but keep getting called up to reception for bathroom breaks. As far as upward mobility goes, there isn't much.

High quality company benefits:
Top notch healthcare
Lunch provided every day
401K
Salary + bonus","No corporate culture.  At all.

Very hierarchical.  Administrative staff at the very bottom of the chain and indirectly, made to feel that way.  Perks abound at all levels but not if you are an admin (firm conferences, new hire dinners, team building retreats...not if you are an admin).  Huge dichotomy between investment teams and administrative professionals.

Very little (almost zero) training.  A few sessions are offered here and there for new technologies, but don't expect any new hire training as an admin.  You'll receive an administrative handbook, desk, computer and access to all the supplies you need, but there is no ramp up and no formal new hire training for administrative staff.  None.  As a result, people are left to sink or swim and sadly, some good people leave b/c they weren't afforded the resources or time to find their feet.

High turnover.  Mostly admins seem to be fed up or find something more interesting, in light of all the benefits and pay.

Senior management doesn't seem to know anything about what the administrative staff experiences and they don't inquire about it either.

Some tenured administrative assistants have moved up the chain in to interesting roles, but that is few and far between.

Overall, if you are an admin and corporate culture is important to you, then this is not the place. I cannot speak for the investment teams that seem to bond and get together frequently at sponsored events."
