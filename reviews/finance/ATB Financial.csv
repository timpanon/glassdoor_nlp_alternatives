39,ATB Financial,"Great benefits, good culture in theory but not always in practice",2022-01-10,4.0,PERSONAL BANKING SPECIALIST,"ATB is overall a wonderful company to work for. Their Flex Benefits system makes it so you can choose how to use your benefits by adding more or using less toward dental, vision, prescriptions, general health care, etc. You can choose to add funds to a Health Care Spending Account, Wellness Account, or ""buy"" up to 5 additional vacation days per year. Every employee is given 2 additional ""Flex Vacation"" days on top of their regular PTO which based on paygrade and years of service. The company puts emphasis on mental health and has been especially flexible during the pandemic. They are good about training and there are plenty of opportunities for advancement.","ATB is a Crown Corporation and has been under a salary freeze mandated by the province for 4 years and no end in sight. The only way to get a raise is to change job titles and move into another pay grade. Conveniently, almost all executives were ""restructured"" into higher paygrades and allowed raises while lower level employees expected to stay where they are at, despite inflation being higher than ever.
While I now work remotely fulltime and am under different management, I previously worked in a branch and the culture and environment there is toxic and stressful. Middle management is not aligned with ATB's values and frequently ask too much of employees, put more stress on sales targets than required, micromanage, and often set their employees up to fail. I have heard from other branch employees that they have had similar experiences. My small branch alone had 5 people take stress leave in the past year. ATB needs to ensure they are practicing what they preach in all areas of the company and not leave branch employees at the mercy of inconsistent and toxic management."

It's a mess. Toxic work environment"
52,ATB Financial,Really not what it used to be,2021-12-04,2.0,Manager,"Many team members are great. Some leaders are good, but it’s really hit and miss (more miss than hit). Benefits are good compared to most companies.","The culture that ATB once had is long gone - between the pandemic (no attempt to retain the culture during the pandemic), significant c-level changes and switch to a “performance based culture” has eliminated all traces of what once was. 

Management cares only for profit and not team members well being - the CEO’s messages supporting mental health of Albertans is completely ignored by his direct reports.

Salary freeze for the past 4+ years, combined with continuing pre-pandemic cuts to perks such as education reimbursement, travel/expenses means that year after year you’re being paid less with inflation factored in.

Complete disregard for the workload/short staffed teams. Request after request for support get rejected leading to extreme burnout across the organization."
53,ATB Financial,Culture Going Downhill,2021-12-01,2.0,Branch Manager,Coworkers and piers were great. Benefits were good.,The culture shifted immensely under the current CEO - definitely not the same place I'd known for the previous 10 years. Lots of favoritism. Who you know not what you gets you ahead.
54,ATB Financial,Amazing colleagues and work-life balance,2021-11-29,5.0,Strategy Specialist,"I worked at ATB for just over 5 years in a few different roles.

- Ability to work from home on a part-time or full-time basis (in most non-branch/agency roles)
- Wonderful people and easy to connect with folks in different AoE's and departments
- Amazing benefits
- Ability to grow within the company
- Some departments let go of a schedule and tell you to work when you want as long as the work gets done, and this suited my work style really well. I appreciated not being micromanaged with time","Unfortunately, there is no consistency across the company as a whole. Your experience at ATB can vary pretty drastically depending on which department you work in and who your direct manager or manager(s) are that are connecting you to the executive level. I feel like this could be said for nearly any large company, but it was very true at ATB.

ATB will follow compensation freezes set out by the AB gov't, leaving the only way to get a pay change is to change positions within the company. This is not ideal for people who are happy and working hard in their current roles and results in a bunch of underpaid staff."
55,ATB Financial,Project team,2021-11-26,5.0,Senior Analyst,Great company to work for,This is a Salary freeze right now
56,ATB Financial,Great place to work stifled by provincial decision making,2021-11-26,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Great work culture with emphasis on inclusion, transparency, and growth.",Can often get caught up in celebrating achievements and not working on cold hard facts.
57,ATB Financial,Forced to retire,2021-11-25,1.0,Branch Manager,Benefits and comfortable chairs along with decent free coffee made it tolerable,"No performance reviews, no feedback, no opportunity"
58,ATB Financial,Okay,2021-11-24,3.0,Agent,Company has very good benefits.,Work schedule is not so great. Depends on individual preference.
59,ATB Financial,Don't believe the hype,2021-11-24,2.0,Manager,"There is opportunity to learn outside of your given scope, if you search for it. There are wonderful team members and leaders here. You just have to find them.","The attitude from above  recently feels like this,  ""we have had great results YTD, but don't let that go to your head as that can change."" There is no time to enjoy or celebrate the positives which everyone needs this year. There is always the underlying threat that if ""we"" don't keep it up stip will be reduced or there will be more job losses. People are exhausted, they need a boost.  It is constant change, even before you have time to analyze the previous change.  Lots of layoffs where there is a team one day, then  totally gone the next. It is being lead by fear, do better or you may be next.  The executive speak about work life balance being key however,  it is next to impossible to maintain while understaffed.  You see the word nepotism mentioned in various reviews, it is true. Promotions in senior levels are more often given based on who you know, what you can do for them and not based on previous performance or education. Which is not valued at ATB.  If you are a good golfer and can give pointers to the executive you are in luck and have a good future ahead of you, no matter how you treat people or what education you bring to the table.  The executive gave themselves a hefty pay raise and bonuses for 2020 while telling team members who worked extremely hard that they would have to settle for a portion of a bonus (be grateful) and another year of no raises (that's year 6 or 7 now). Culture ratings are down and maybe the executives, board and crown need to realize that they have great team members who worked hard everyday and but are now starting to feel like they may not be able to keep food on the table as pay rates from 6 years ago on top of inflation are  impacting every single team member. Exhaustion is kicking in, talk about stress and taking leaves is increasing with the overall keyword being ""burnout."" People need something to look forward to and work towards."

67,ATB Financial,ATB is a kingdom of narcissists,2021-11-04,1.0,Personal Relationship Manager,The benefits program is decent,"Leaders, right up to VP’s, will say they care about mental health, but it’s just lip service. They will lie to your face and manipulate situations to make themselves look good, while pushing you for more and more. Poor performance is celebrated while high performers are ground to little nubs and when they burn out they are cast aside like trash. Save your mental health and don’t work here. Pay sucks too. Jobs go to friends and family, no level playing field at ATB. If your brother is a VP you can be a VP too."

Good work environment, sales staff are given a lot of autonomy.","Over the years with the new CEO in place, obviously he's trying to establish his own legacy. Some changes are somewhat questionable whether it made any improvements. Sales staff are definitely underpaid compare to other departments that seem to have made up roles (i.e change enablement, transformation etc) not sure what value they bring to the organization. Nepotism are somewhat an issue, some promotions are not based on merit which is expected at every organization."

- ability work from home, but leaders are strongly pushing for in-person/working in the office in the near future","- Leaders do not know how to lead and uplift their teams
- Leaders do not trust their employees to perform their jobs and tend to micromanage the day-to-day work by getting involved in all the work and meetings without providing useful input or being helpful at all
- Leaders love to engage in gossip and tend to keep those assumptions alive instead of dealing with it directly with the employees involved
- Senior leader rarely took a stance and often gave vague responses to questions
- There were many scenarios where processes put into place actually introduced red tape and did not streamline the work at all
- Favoritism is highly noticeable in the team
- Your feedback and recommendations to make things better will be used against you. Recommendations to improve processes were not taken seriously and were set aside i.e. you are expected to follow convoluted frameworks to get the work done
- Many two faced leaders talking great things in front of senior leadership they report into but doing the complete opposite with their own teams

If ATB just treated their employees as employees this might be acceptable, but the fake culture of caring about you, makes it harsh to just cut you off.

Replacing everyone with call Center employees, even managers have no in branch experience or knowledge but are said to have “performance coach, call centre mentality” which means nothing and are causing branches to fail because leadership does nothing. 2 years ago, staffing and environment was great but they have abandoned their old culture and are trying something new that is failing miserably. Everyone is overworked and stressed and customer complaints are higher now"

117,ATB Financial,Dysfunctional Capital Markets Division. Poor Executive Leadership. Low Employee Engagement.,2021-08-10,1.0,"ATB Capital Markets, Investment Banking, Research and Trading","- ATB Financial has deep roots in the local Alberta economy. If you believe in the local economy, this is a plus

- ATB offers an alternative to the larger banking platforms

- Compensation is ok

- Current CEO of ATB Financial (not the CEO of ATB Capital Markets) seems passionate and has spent a lot of time moving up through the ranks. Very respectable, regardless of whether you agree with his decisions.","- Poor leadership. The current CEO of ATB Capital Markets is a low performer who plays ATB politics well. He has inadequate investment banking experience, an extremely low EQ and is not heavily invested in people. He sees people as disposable assets. Most would describe him as disconnected (at a minimum) and sociopathic (at a maximum). This translates into poor morale and low employee confidence. 

- CEO of ATB Capital Markets, not focused on the present. It is EXTREMELY evident that the current CEO of ATB Capital Markets is squarely focused on using this role as a stepping-stone to the CEO of ATB Financial (parent co). His lack of attention and commitment to the capital markets strategy has caused ATB Capital Markets to quickly slide downhill. How the current CEO of ATB Financial (parent co) has not picked up on this is a mystery. The CEO of ATBCM should be released from this role immediately.

- No strategic direction. The strategic direction of the firm continues to shift erratically. Low probability mandates (with large macro plays) and flawed government pursuits are being considered, while ATB Capital Markets fails to leverage its core competitive advantage - the rest of the bank and its Alberta focus.

- Poor history in Capital Markets. ATB Capital Markets started from the acquisition of AltaCorp Capital - a small boutique platform whose founder, George Gosbee, had documented tragic personal issues. (See book, A Perfect Nightmare, by Karen Gosbee.) The organization has had trouble finding its way ever since. Its participation in equity and debt financings has been small and advisory mandates have been few and far between.

- High employee turnover. Turnover has been very high since inception, partly due to its founder's absence but in more recent years due to poor management oversight.

- Low market relevance. Overall, ATB Capital Markets is simply not a relevant player in the local marketplace. It is easily replaceable.

- Parent company coordination is poor. The relationship between ATB Capital Markets and ATB Financial is poor. They simply do not move together very well - something the larger banks figured out in the 90s."

There is a lot of discrimination at ATB, from executives to management, to people and culture. There is absolutely no growth, don't expect a promotion, you will never get it, if you ever apply for a higher level position, they will never consider you for as little as an interview. It's a family run organization for whites where mothers can recommend their kids even without an experience or education background they automatically get the job, market VPs would even create a new and bigger role for an MD's child, but if you are a person of coor you don't stand a chance.
If you dare report to P & C which is 95percent white cult, be sure to be fired a week later. In the days of Dave M and Lorne R, I guess they might even give you hope and encourage you but in the Era of Curtis, it's an organization that is blind to allowing the minority rise to the top, he doesn't care, he doesn't even believe in Glassdoor reviews.

Attempts to force work well beyond job description by claiming it “preparing” you for a potential promotion.

Had a nice leader for a while, they moved on and everything deteriorated after that.","- The ongoing pay freeze of non-management positions - not even a cost of living increase to offset increases in basic necessities.

- The mandatory pension, lost funds at one point (white paper), so they had to up the amount they took to compensate for their mismanagement of our pension funds.

- The constant stress and anxiety the company will fire you or your entire department just to line their pockets with bonuses. 

- New ""leadership"" came in and created a toxic work environment. 

- Numerous improvement projects started and then sidelined because the company ran over budget. They can't seem to budget properly. Nor do they seem to be able to focus on two to three improvements at a time and try to get those completed.

- Training of the manager entrepreneurship / relationship managers out in the branches is practically non-existent. No wonder there is such high turn over in the branches, those people do not have the support and training they should have.

- A great deal of nepotism exists throughout the company. 

- If you are not favoured by your leader then you have no opportunity for advancement. Knowledge and experience mean zero. Consistently good to great performance reviews do not count for anything. It is all about who you know or likes you. But that changes with the wind as constant corporate restructuring is taking place. 

- Some teams get a work from home option (pre-covid) while others who could justifiably work from home full time were not given the option, or they had to provide a ""good"" reason why they should be allowed to do so one a case by case basis.

- CEO talks about the importance of mental health, but it is all lip service.

-CEO had a mini cry / tantrum on a company wide live stream. It was embarrassing and unprofessional! He was so upset because team members felt unsafe and chose to ask diversity/gender based questions anonymously. 

- Not many people answer the surveys honestly because they know for a fact they are not anonymous and expect reprisal if they don't respond that ATB is doing everything perfectly.

- Have to pay for parking at the Calgary Campus in the far NE. It is not the downtown core!

- The gym is also a monthly cost to employees if they want to use it.

- Nothing done to celebrate non-management employees when they retire after many years of service. Anything put together is done by fellow employees out of their own pocket. Sad ATB will not properly acknowledge people who dedicated twenty + years to the company.

If you share something with your manager out of concerns, that will (definitely) be used against you.

Racism exists
Some managers are dictators and appreciation towards their team is zero to none. Sharing a concern will be definitely used against you. 
Pay freeze from past I do not even remember for how long. But you can get promoted if you have a good relationship with you manager not because you are good at your job and role.

- constantly are spinning the reality and truth of there inefficiencies on a lagging economy
- boast about there culture, when the culture is horrible
-run the departments off of fear and scare employees from sharing their true opinion
-if you voice up against mgmt or say something remotely truthful to the financials they ""spin"" the comments...which in my opinion is borderline fraud

- A great benefits package
- Used to have some secondary benefits for education, opportunity to travel etc (but these are largely gone now)
- Very forward thinking for a bank, community focused.
- Lots of roles easily offer work-life balance.","- Organization is fairly political and your advancement is dependant your ability to make all your bosses look good, even if they aren't doing the right thing. Most large organizations are like this, and I guess ATB is definitely no different.
- A lack of risk tolerance to experiment, try new things. There used to be some, now that is gone. 
- Wage freeze, hiring freeze, and expense freeze... 
- Many leaders are very old-school in their leadership and management styles which includes a lack of transparency, managing as opposed to leading, and not taking many risks for their team (also a symptom of larger senior management issues). Newer leaders are generally great, but lack experience. 
- Severe lack of thoughtful alignment from leadership down to individual team members.
- Some of the most talented people here are often minimized because their thoughts are contrary to maintaining status quo. Those that do best are often great at taking orders and executing without much critical thought.
- Execution of technology projects is quite poor, with many non-technical leaders and inexperienced leaders leading technical teams.
- Morale continues to drop
- Many people who work here have jobs that frankly might not need to exist, and they often don't contribute much or even detract from the productivity of others (gatekeeper culture)."

Lots of people get raises anyway though due to fake promotions now there is no room for people to grow and lots of “leaders” who don’t actually lead any people. It’s easy to dupe someone into giving you a promotion if you suck up (ex. reading some articles about AI doesn’t make you a pro in AI, or because you’ve worked in a branch doesn’t make you an expert in digital CX!)  even if you don’t know how to do the job or show results. So much waste and duplication in the transformation/technology team of people doing the same jobs and this leads to people being very territorial and competitive. This whole department is so bloated with people getting hired while certain executives were trying to build an empire. Constant restructures to make senior leadership seem smarter than they are. Systems and approvals are extremely complicated. So much micromanagement due to nosy leaders who don’t actually do work. People get promoted due to favouritism not good work or loyalty.

- I've mostly had good experiences, but in some departments, favoritism, cliques & bullying by leadership is common.  Every organization can have  toxic leaders, but these need to be weeded out quickly before they destroy engagement.

386,ATB Financial,It takes a strong and courageous leader to deliver at ATB,2019-07-05,1.0,V P,"I loved the place. Hired as a director, promoted to managing director and eventually a VP. I was involved in many of the programs to generate the cultural movement that ATB had become known for. I worked for a brilliant leader and I had a track record as someone who delivers.","I relocated the family to take on a new role. This role also came with a new ""leader."" We rarely spoke and when we did they stated ""I wish that the other VPs we're as focused as you. The problems I have are not in your market."" The results also supported that their time could be spent elsewhere.  

In March of 2018 I was fired. I was told I was being fired because I “wasn't receptive to feedback,” Remember, this is from a leader who I rarely spoke with because they had “so many other issues.” Although I was being fired for not being receptive to feedback, I had recently been told that “one of the things I like about you is your responsiveness to feedback.” I presented the evidence and it became very very quiet. Nonetheless, I was still unemployed. 

In short, I relocated the family and we were 8 months into a new community, new schools - for those that have been transferred it's a challenge for a family - and I get blindsided. What eats at me, 15 months later, is how a company that promotes itself as a great place to work and bases its culture on value statements like 'trust and expect the same from others,' 'do the right thing,' 'be personally and fiercely accountable,' among many others, can simply discard one of their own and his family, based on some made-up anecdote? 
 
15 months thinking about where I went wrong?

I naively trusted my new leader by assuming that a senior executive required courage to be in his or her role. To this day, I can only draw assumptions on why I was fired. Secondly, and consistent with themes in many reviews, I didn't makes friends with the right people. With rare exceptions performance, strategic alignment, cultural alignment, education, and talent are not what gets you ahead at ATB."

Very disappointed that this didn’t happen, not just once, but for multiple applied positions. So when you apply, and you don’t hear back in a reasonable about of time, I wouldn’t hold your breath."

1. Drink the Kool-Aid - By Kool-Aid I mean invest in the company culture and I mean REALLY invest. Eat, sleep and breathe ATB jargon. The phrases around here are super common so just reuse them in literally anything you do. Say 'transformation' and 'reinventing'. The entire MO of ATB is to be the cool new bank akin to something out of silicon valley. They want SO BADLY to be the hip new thing that if you tell an exec that you think this will help transform banking they will immediately adore you.
2. Tell your leader they are special - If your leader doesn't think you're special, you won't move AT ALL. Make sure you stroke their ego often and whenever you do something awesome ALWAYS make sure that you take zero credit and your boss gets it all. This will help you move up the chain fast
3. Appearance's are Everything - I'm not talking about clothes (though skim through a few fashion magazines and see what the 20 year old's are wearing for some ideas) - no ATB takes its image very seriously. This filters down into the various business units. Whatever you do, do not make your leader, team or ATB look like we don't know what we're talking about. Give the impression that you know everything that your business unit is the best - even if this means fudging a few stats. If you appear like you have your stuff together they will fast track you to the top."

Working there will teach you numerous new skills: the art of multitasking while meeting time deadlines, self management and sales.  Depending which branch/agency you are at it can feel like family.  Employees that give their time ,  go the extra mile all while exceeding their sales goals will be rewarded. Great benefits program. Never idle as there is always something to be done.  Can easily develop and deepen client relationships which fosters trust and future sales.  Atb actively encourages employees to be ""All IN"" both inside (consuming new tech and practices) and outside of bank hours( volunteering and teaching sessions for students & seniors etc); which ultimately helps the community you are in. Free coffee and treats on meeting days.","At Atb to advance you must put in many ""volunteer"" hours.  Atb has extremely high targets to achieve for your stip pay (bonus pay). The only way to achieve these  and get all your paperwork and call lists done is to stay late and come in on some of your days off...unpaid.   You cannot clock in and clock out if you want any chance of advancement.  Sick days are available to use however they will put your potential promotion  at risk. Working at atb you are self managed thus meaning you are responsible for keeping up with all the changes with policy and procedure and your never ending internal schooling.  You must keep up to date WHILE completing your regular job as well.  As scheduled learning time is not provided unless you are just starting as a new employee. Time management and prioritising is essential.  Systems are clumsy but are improving thus making it necessary to redo things multiple times for a result.   1 hour meeting with a client can result in multiple hours of paperwork ( mortgages etc). However it is expected that your day is gull of back to back client meeting.
 Adrenaline and coffee are what most people run off of as there is a high level of stress.  People that are natural at multitasking, self motivated , retain information, sales and are have excellent computer skills excell here.  If you don't have those skills you will fail in their culture. Despite what Atb says they are a sales oriented business.  They state that if you have a conversation  that sales will naturally occur however their actions speak differently ( connection squad coaching sessions and sales targets for additional pay).   Benefits are fantastic however you pay for them (salary-benifts = take home pay) making your cash in hand much smaller. Staff shortages are a constant battle.  Unrealistic expectations and deadlines set by management.  They will take every ounch of time and energy you will give them so make sure to set boundaries or your home life  and mental state will suffer greatly.  Depending which branch / agency you work at management can have favourites which make it hard to be recognized for promotions, take preferred time off, better shifts.  Keep looking at posting boards and be prepared to leave your branch to advance to the next level at another branch."

Generally, senior leaders say all the tight things in front of the right people but do not practice partnerships of doing the right thing for the customer - scorecards unfortunately reinforce bad behaviour. 
Additionally, ATB has increasingly high levels of overhead in non-customer facing positions. Senior leaders in those areas build empires rapidly. Expense to revenue ratios are out of whack with industry. Staff rationalization occurs in customer facing jobs and resources in this area are scrutized regularly. Head office overhead grows unchecked (seemingly) and job levels in non customer facing roles are not equitable and encourage the best employees to take non-customer facing roles taking away from revenue generating positions.

They'll spend 2 full days in a workshop teaching you about how to give feedback honestly.

Lots of inside politics, people are highlighted as stars and then suddenly gone without explanation; leaving a culture of fear. Too many priorities and no process to deal with them, leaving things disorganized and often confusing about what is going on and who is managing.

-HR at ATB, or People and Culture - while willing to answer any questions you may have/are generally nice - have zero involvement in facilitating a career roadmap for any existing team members. This results in the individual relying on the leader to support/guide their development - which some leaders don’t have the capability to do, and others are incentivized to hold you back as long as possible/to prevent a team vacancy.

443,ATB Financial,All Talk.   Don’t Believe the Hype,2019-01-11,1.0,Manager,"Every pro is tinged with a con:
1) Terrific pension programs - though they did terminate the entire pension team for no reason, losing several decades of experience and knowledge and putting the plan at risk.
2) Great health and wellness program - again for no reason, moved this team away from experienced managers to completely inexperienced manager for no clear reason other than rewarding friends of senior managers
3) work from home option - though those who do and don’t show their face enough at the office will suffer professionally as they never get promotions and are the first to be terminated.
4) Pay is average at best.  They aim to be in the middle of the market for pay, but say that their benefits make up for that.   Benefits, including banking benefits, are really good and do make up for it in most cases.  But if you are in need of the cash instead of those types of benefits for whatever reason, you will be disappointed, especially if you are participating in the PSPP pension program and have huge contributions.  Not as big a factor if in the management pension plan.","1) Senior management cares nothing for you.  Unless you become a sycophant or suck up to them to become one of their friends, you are just a number to them.  Worst in HR where a chosen few friends of the VP and CPO basically have immunity and determine who stays and goes and they get all the promotions.  The entire department fell off a cliff with the new CPO.   Totally changed the culture of ATB and HR from the previous great CPO.  HR professionals should avoid like plague.
2) As mentioned, there is no loyalty.  While they expect you to drink their kook aid (which they constantly change the flavour of based on the winds), they will terminate you for no reason.  Over the past year, they have lost hundreds of years of experience and dedication to ATB through no-fault terminations.  People who have literally given half their lives to the company terminated without cause and without reason.   It has been so bad that it even drew the attention of the Board.  You know it is bad when the Board even questions personnel changes.
3) Don’t believe engagement scores.  They manipulate them to get the awards.  They handle low departmental scores not by working to improve conditions, but by terminating or reassigning those they think give low scores.
4) Atmosphere of mistrust in the lower ranks because management isn’t clear on their expectations.   No one knows what is expected of them and with terminations all around, creates a very tense atmosphere.  Unless of course you are friends with a VP, any of the seemingly 100 of them, in which case you are fine.
5) Be wary of applying in any area as ATB is investing heavily in AI and promoting how much they can do, and will be able to do, without humans.  Watch for mass lay offs and limited hiring in the near futures as they continue that. 

Don’t believe that this is the talk of a disgruntled former employee.   I gave everything to this company for decades and it was a great place to work.  I was proud to work there.  The last two years were the polar opposite and that starts with the executive level, particularly the change at the CPO level.  ATB is probably like any other big bank in all these respects, but they promote themselves as being different.   They aren’t."
444,ATB Financial,29.5 Years and counting,2019-01-09,5.0,Project Manager,"I have had the pleasure or working within the culture of ATB Financial well before we had the 11 ATB's.  

ATB Financial has continued to evolve and become better within each iteration to be THE PLACE TO BANK and most definitely  THE PLACE TO WORK.

As we continue to evolve while always growing pains, there is amazing opportunity for personal and professional growth along with conversations to align your talents to either the day to day job or experiential growth opportunities.",I don't believe I have any cons to comment on.  Every business has items that one might not see eye to eye on.  Having the honest conversations in an appropriate way is fundamental to relationships and personal brand.
445,ATB Financial,Stay away if you are productive and passionate,2019-01-09,1.0,Leader,"There honestly is no pro left. ATB is a prime example of initiative overload. They keep branding the same old processes and names, a different way almost every week. This all in the name of change, while you will see old processes from 3 years ago resurrect, again and again, creating a vicious cycle and no progress made whatsoever. All this while the board thinks there is some real work getting done and while the top level executives pocket the money.","As a lot of people have mentioned, it's a small organization where they support only the ones that would sub-servantly suck up to management, and have personal connections. If you come from outside and are smart, they are quickly to feel extremely insecure including your leader and will do anything to make your life miserable so you leave. Here your personal connections and sucking up takes priority over productivity and skills.
There is no job security, before the new CEO even took over they started to lay off staffs in multiples, sometimes even entire departments, the leaders were briefed to throw out anyone that didn't fit into the culture, which was really vague and then became a tool to fire anyone that the management didn't like or had a personal bias towards.
It was still considered a better place to work when you had Dave and Lorne trying to instill a decent company culture. Now its turned into one of the big five banks with the same level of aggressiveness but with low-class tech. When they migrated from their old system to new, they left it half way through in between and now employees have to deal with multiple applications that are a band aid solution to a deep-rooted problem. While their basic everyday tech is horrendous, you have them constantly market themselves as a tech company. The joke is they should get into media and branding instead as that's the only thing they do well."

They are moving away from ""sales"" focus to a more ""service"" focus but how that looks in practice is still a little foggy.

This means that slowly over time the company is getting better and more people in line with their progressive aspirations are making their way into the company. ATB will be an amazing company if they can clean the nepitism and cliquey parts away from the company and hold the course (not an easy job).","Although you get an excellent number sick days, if you use more than 1 or 2 a year it'll hurt your career. It's a bit of a carrot that way.  The company claims the value of being open and welcoming of differences, but unless your difference is being gay, that's not really true. Progress takes time I know, and at least they are trying sometimes. Very cliquey, nepitite and closed circle. Training is somewhat lackadaisical. They care mostly how much you are like them, how much they like you on a personal level, then how well you support their own goals. Training is reserved for friends and then they claim you would have access to more training if you performed better. You reach the top of the performance charts and still don't receive what other ""buddies"" of management get for little effort. It is demoralizing.  You basically train yourself and hope your skin is thick enough to tolerate endless criticism while you figure it out. These facts take a toll over time and are a major contributor to employee churn.

Not understanding the differences, strengths and weaknesses of the different markets. Giving someone the same expectations whether they are downtown Calgary, or in the middle of rural Alberta doesn’t make sense.

The company strives to deliver a bold, iconic and world-class experience for each and every customer. 
The company values you as an employee and you are always made to feel that you are a part of the wheels of structure and have the immediate support of your peers and management.

Wonderful work and life balance of which is of the utmost important to your well-being as an associate and team member coupled with a wonderful work diversity. 

Great work  benefits and perks coupled with insightful and helpful peers or associates makes your time at the workplace more interesting and progressive. 

Your success is determined by your performance and there are plenty of opportunities to move around and all training and support is provided to lead on your road to success.

The best part about dealing with the customers is that you are empowered by your peers and team leaders to be as influential and as 'yourself' as possible. You will not be addressed to be a different person because who you are is why they would hire you in the first place. Your character/persona and charisma will be exploited which will make your job much easier.

The ethos, I believe can be surmised as, regarding customer service, is 'not by the book, but by the heart'. 

Create lasting relationships and serve the customer's best interests and provide a suitable and tailored resolution so that each customer feels an “personal” experience.

I was laid- off with no regrets and still would highly recommend a career with ATB Financial.

532,ATB Financial,One in a million,2017-10-23,5.0,Marketing Manager,"I love working at ATB! I've never worked for a company that is so focused on its employees and culture, and what a difference. ATB walks the walk. I was tired of working for companies that talked about how important their employees were to the business, but did nothing. We have employee engagement surveys, like a lot of organizations. However, when there is a concern expressed, ATB does something about it. They make changes. 

For the business, everything we do every day is all about the customer experience. Here's a great example: a customer in northern Alberta sent an email to an executive in the company regarding banking fees. He had become a senior years before and but wasn't advised that he could have eliminated all fees if he had switched to another account until about 7 years into that status. So, typically, ATB refunded that customers fees from all the previous years. But then we went a step further... ATB did an audit that identified every customer who was eligible for the no-fee account and REFUNDED ALL OF THEIR FEES. ATB has integrity, something that I find lacking in a lot of businesses.","I can't think of a thing, really."
533,ATB Financial,My worst employer,2017-10-23,1.0,Itsd,"Great benefits, flexibility, work from home","Totally incompetent management, with lack of leadership skills and technical expertise. Outdated technologies, a lot of politics and lies."

535,ATB Financial,Had a great time while I was working there,2017-10-21,4.0,PERSONAL BANKING SPECIALIST,"I worked for ATB Financial for over 5 and a half years. My time there was for the most part positive. I found if you have a really good direct manager that you work ""with"" and you put in complete effort then you will find your life at work easier. There are targets, natural upper management pressure and your own personal pressure you will put on yourself and this is why having a good direct manager makes things easier. If you have a chance to work for ATB I recommend it.",This organization has brought in many outside individuals from other organizations to help guide the ship in a certain direction. It will most certainly be tough times for the next 5 years with new changes being done. This will be hard for the day to day employees who work very hard to create happiness for clients.

I have comprehensive coverage and based on my current needs I don't have to offset the cost of coverage through payroll deductions. I like that there is a defined pension plan although the contribution rate takes a bite out of my salary - no doubt when I retire I won't mind having contributed to a pension all these years. The Employee and Family Assistance Program is another great perk - it's always there day or night and I ended up using it a couple of years ago and it was a tremendous help. My current position is non-geographic so despite the fact that I live in a rural community I have been able to progress in my career without having to relocate.,"The only con I can honestly think of at this present moment is that salaries have been frozen for the last few years. I have continued to expand and develop in my role and even introduced some process improvements that reduced costs by thousands of dollars per year.

Teller to Branch Manager and everything in between. We have great benifits and a pension plan that can be tailored to each individual. I love the work that I do each and every day creating happiness for Albertans. The company has put a great deal of money, energy and effort into making great not perfect leaders and that investment is paying off. I love the 10 ATBs and our story. They help every team member gauge how they interact with our customers and each other. They gave us all one purpose and the tools to get there.",Or course I have seen my far share of  bumps on my journey with ATB. Training can be challenging especially when branches are busy and have team members that are new and need many hours of one on one time. As a manager I feel that my days are filled with little fires that need my attention and then the things that I love doing or need to do can sometime be neglected. Things like coaching and one on one time with my team can suffer.  When I am working and doing the role of two of three people depending on what is going on in the branch that day my calendar goes out the window and I switch to survival mode. Doing what I must to finish the day. That leaves me wondering what did I accomplish today and that can sometimes feel like nothing. This all leads to a poor work life balance for myself and a few of my team members in the branch. With a young family at home and a wife that works full time and all of us have activities and committees/boards outside of work it can all be very overwhelming and stressful.

Some great leaders. Found upper management really good.

I still bank there even as a past employee.
Helps you grow","Although I had some great leaders - I also had terrible leaders (more than good). It can be all about who you know. I had excellent stats and great feedback from leaders and customers. I loved my job - but am not a ""suck up"". I see everyone as equal, whether it is a CEO or CRS. 

One leader made employees cry and called herself ""the terror"". After HR got involved, as the company does actually care about its employees, she was removed from her position. Because she had friends in another department, she got promoted again. She continued to harass me because I spoke up. Lots of gossip from some leaders and if you stand up and say that is not ok - you get excluded. There are leaders that are bullies and will often promote ""friends"" over the most qualified people. That being said, I did have excellent leaders. I actually miss working here and would have retired here. I love working for small companies that believe in doing the right thing. I made bad choices on which departments/branches to work for. Many long term people are leaving. I am VERY happy with where I am at today though and this experience gave me the opportunity to quit and find something better."

There are resources available to learn and study in order to educate yourself and move up. ATB is 100% behind the happiness of it's employees and is committed to being the number 1 place to work.","The only reason I gave a 4 star review is because the pay could be better. As a pay grade I, there is no choice but to be with the Public Service Pension Plan. The PSPP is fantastic come retirement as it's a Defined Benefit Plan, but it hurts the pocket during a person's younger working years.

The power to make meaningful decisions, and to be trusted to do so is why we are winning, and will continue to win.","I wish ATB could operate outside of Alberta... would have to drop the ""A"" though.

They treat their team members very well through recognitions, benefit plans and etc. Management and Human Resources truly care about employee engagement and always try to improve experiences for everyone. Also, what is expected of employees in terms of goals and standards is within reason.",One hot topic has always been ATB's conversion to SAP and their new core banking system. I believe this one of the down falls as their is lack of training on how to fully use the system or how to correctly use the system. One branch has a way of using it while other branches have another way. It can become confusing and reduces the consistency of operational tasks.
634,ATB Financial,Disappointing experience,2016-09-04,2.0,,"They have fairly clear goals laid out and do attempt to support their employees in achieving those goals, for the most part.

The pay was on the upper side of average and the benefits were wonderful. Their focus on the work-life balance is nice, when actually put into practice (most teams seem to succeed in this area).","I had the worst experience of my life at this company. I'm very disappointed that a job I LOVED turned into a job I hated to the point of having to leave.

Overall, the company has a good culture barring a few small pockets. However, I think that even in the departments that successfully follow the “ATBs” to a tee, they’ve managed to create a limited view of what success is. People who are shy, reserved, and just generally not type A personalities may find the culture here to be too intense. If you are an introvert who dislikes participating in constant activities designed for extroverts, you may find this company culture to be emotionally draining. People who express their passion for their job by simply being excellent at it may feel shoved aside for those who are more skilled at putting on a positive vibe.

The more serious side of things: I was put in a position to deliver poor service to my partners every day. I did not feel that management had a realistic view of the output capabilities of the team. I was extremely overworked, provided inadequate infrastructure for the job I had to do, worked under inefficient management that did not do their jobs correctly and were bullying staff to the point that all were actively interviewing for new jobs, was asked to do the wrong thing and consistently felt that I was compromising my own high standards for myself – and then had to read about how if I don’t “have fun at work” then ATB couldn’t be the right fit for me. Issues were repeatedly brought forward to upper management by many people and were not resolved. In a nutshell, the company lays out specific mantras you should be able to apply to your work, and I wasn't put in a position to meet them, and was then criticized for not being able to. Disappointingly, I had to walk away from a company I had hoped to be with for decades for my own wellbeing."
635,ATB Financial,Operations Analyst,2016-09-04,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Good company to work with. Excellent Benefits the company offers.he first thing most people mention when you bring up startup culture is the work-life balance. Or in some cases, the lack of work-life balance. Startups are filled with people who are passionate about seeing a product or service come to life, and that usually entails long or odd hours. Culture has us believe people at startups ride scooters to their next meeting where they play foosball to brainstorm, but the reality is that startups require a level of dedication from each individual that you might not see at a corporation or big business.","The drawbacks of working in a tech startup, and any startup, are generally related to short term risks. Pay isn't generally as good early on, benefits are limited until there are more employees, and the work life balance can be tenuous. In tech especially, there is always the chance that your major project could be circumvented by an unanticipated advance or invention,” says Sarah McMullin, Business Development Specialist at Camino Information Services."

The work culture is extremely unique for a financial institution (or any organization for that matter!), and co-workers are ambitious, innovative and intelligent.","There are not many cons to working at ATB.

ATB realizes by hiring the right people and treating them right, they'll stick around and do a great job. (9 times out of 10, that is). Depending on your role I suppose, there is always bound to be different expectations and duties. However, if you're considering transferring over from another FI, to a similar role here...you WILL notice a cultural difference -- along with a fun atmosphere and great leaders that filter down to the front lines. Better pay too - in comparison - for front line staff roles that are similar in other FI's.","The biggest cons are the technology and application software issues. It seems every other month or so, something crashes -- then it could be anywhere from a few minutes - to hours - to days before an issue is fixed.  Kind of hard to comeback to clients concerns when you can't access information specifically related to their account balances or investment holdings."

ATB's recruitment team brought together a great group of interns to solve one business problem over the course of the summer - a great experience for anyone who hasn't done a case competition. 
Every employee we came into contact with was kind, friendly and helpful. In my experience the students were all treated with respect and as equals rather than as entry-level 'assistants'. My managers are committed to my personal growth at ATB and will ask me what skills I want to acquire, what projects I'd like to participate in and where I want to take my career. Receiving this much attention and commitment from your manager when you are so new in your career is invaluable. 
ATB offers a results only work environment which allows you to work from anywhere and manage your own time.","Inconsistency of workload between different departments.

Flexible work environment (Workplace 2.0) convenient for many staff","Can be highly (and especially unnecessarily) political at senior and executive levels --- Too many egos, little trust, and a lack of communication is very present in certain areas of the business. Professionalism is also questionable. I remember taking my annual compliance recertification and one of the questions asked was (more or-less): ""Is it ever appropriate for an employee to yell at another employee?"" I know of executives at ATB who clearly have a reputation for doing so, yet continue to advance within the organization. Creating a desired culture comes from the top down, and when some leaders have trouble being professional, its a challenge to both enjoy your job and respect the company as a whole.

Poor engagement from leadership --- A few years back ATB had exceptionally low engagement scores. There was a big push to rectify this, and in recent evaluations many areas of the business did in fact improve. Within my team, that was not the case, and I'll leave it at that.  Adjacent leaders were available, but my director was anything but.

Lack of feedback from managers, team leads, etc. on associate performance --- Over the past few years ATB has voiced the importance for each associate to have an annual performance plan in place. Maybe it was just my area of the business, but the framework for the plan never really ""fit"" my role, and in turn they were done simply because it was a mandated task. Follow-up reviews if they happened were weak and half-(rhymes with ""massed""). ""Formal"" (and i use that team loosely) reviews aside, I never once received feedback on my performance from those above me (good, bad, or otherwise) at any time in my tenure with ATB.

Flexible work environment (Workplace 2.0) --- Yes, I mentioned this as a pro but it also has a downside. Since so many ATB employees are based in various locations throughout the province (business campuses, branches, or home offices), this can have a negative impact on communication and collaboration. Nothing beats seeing your coworkers face-to-face, and participating in virtual meetings just doesn't cut it a lot of the time.

I could go on, but I'll leave it at that. I'd love to provide specifics, but since this is a public forum you'll have to excuse my ambiguous and vague text. It may seem as though I went on a bit of a rant, but I assure you that it is not based on bitterness. I like balance in life, and I feel that my review is an indirect way of raising concerns that I was never able to express as an employee.  An exit interview would have been great but I never had the opportunity to participate in one."

You feel very valued as an employee, not just from your direct leadership team, but from the executive level as well. There is so much help and assistance available to you for personal development. Colleagues in your same role are always willing to help you out. As I am writing this, we are seeing hard economic times in Alberta, and ATB is doing everything it can to support Albertans during this time. It is great to work for a company that actually puts customers first and means it. The flexible work options are some of the best I've seen - I have never worked anywhere before that has allowed so many people to work from home either full-time, or part-time at home and part-time in the office. Lastly, I go to work every day happy and I leave happy and that is a great feeling!","The only downside that I have encountered so far, which is plainly obvious to anybody even if you don't work here, is that ATB is located in Alberta only, and sometimes moves outside of the province aren't always your choice.

There is a clear visions of where we are going and a well communicated strategy for getting there. I love the rallying call of making banking work for people, the ATB Story and the ATBs which are ten mutual expectations we have of each other that support the vision. In my view, ATBers are well regarded and valued by executive management and the Board. We have awesome working environment with opportunities for team members to grow, do their best and reap intrinsic and extrinsic rewards. The implementation of Workplace 2.0 a few years ago, which places emphasis on results rather than simply requiring rigid work structures, has created a truly flexible work environment. I simply love working here - the work is challenging, interesting and rewarding.","Due to the geographic constraints on ATB, opportunities to work for the company while located outside the province is very limited.

I never have felt ""in the dark"" and always feel heard by my leaders.","As a smaller, more agile company, there are a lot of great ideas floating around at any given time; this allows for a great deal of innovation and autonomy.

Love the drive to do the best for our customers. Our VPs and CEO really care about the customers and the employees.,I honestly really can't think of any issues I have with the company right now. Maybe the worst I could say is that there is a bit more focus on the city branches in Edmonton and Calgary than the small town branches.
716,ATB Financial,What a Great Experience,2016-02-01,5.0,Director,"ATB focuses on the little things while not loosing slight of the big picture. By the little things, I mean analysing and filling gaps in team members engagement. Taking action to improve processes and rethinking how we do the littlest of things to make the customer experience richer and team members engagement deeper. Great leaders spend time preparing to become better leaders, and strive to exceed organizational goals.

5) RESPECT! - being able to share ideas within my smaller team and larger department and enterprise wide and see them actually be implemented.  
6) Flexible Benefits - ability to move my flex credits into the health services I use.  I was able to afford laser eye surgery and InvisAlign braces.

I have always been treated with respect and other people have sought my input in all of the roles I have had at ATB.  It's the real deal.",I can't think of any real disadvantages to working at ATB.  Other than we are often in the spotlight in Alberta as a provincial crown corporation.  Sometimes people think we might be politically motivated which actually isn't true at all.  We run with a board of directors and CEO + Executive like any other company of our size.

725,ATB Financial,"The Place to ""Be""",2016-02-01,5.0,,"I have an incredible amount of flexibility in my role to define my work, how I do it and when I do it.  You cannot put a price on ATB's innovative WorkPlace 2.0. program which allows team members to work permanently from home.  Within this culture it's about getting the work done and being where you need to be, not putting in face time.  The ATB Story and ATBs create a culture, and a guide to action, that ATB employees actually live into - not just words on a wall or on posters, but things like accountability, fun and trust actually exist here.",The only con that I can come up with is that ATB doesn't have a formal maternity leave top up program.  They only offer the standard short term disability guidelines.  Some other employers offer up to 20 weeks of maternity leave top up - something like this would be very nice to have.

For my position now, it's a bit lower than comparable positions with say, the CRA or Shaw, but the attitudes of the people I work with and the overall environment make that an acceptable trade-off.  The benefits package is unreal, my parents who are nearing retirement and have been with their respective companies for 30+ years can't even compare, also makes the slightly lower pay grade worth it.  There are tons of opportunities and resources for learning.  It is quite easy to move up and around within the company if you have the mindset to do so.  Very flexible and accommodating for work hours, as well as the ability to work from home.","As with any office, there are examples of ""office politics"", which can be frustrating at times, but it's nowhere near what I've seen at other companies.  Communication is a huge problem, decisions are often made with little regard to impact or consequences that can make jobs much harder than they need to be.  Favourites are sometimes played by management, and as mentioned above, the pay for comparable positions is sometimes lower, depending on the positions."

Executive presence is very visible at events and in the community and there is strong support to provide learning opportunities for all team members so that they may grow with the company.  
I am fortunate that my position allows me to take advantage of Workplace 2.0 (do my work anytime, anywhere) which allows me to balance work with home and other responsibilities. If you want to grow, expand you knowledge, and learn from others- the opportunities are endless.","It takes a lot of work and dedication from all team members to ensure our priorities are met.  Often long hours are required to finish projects on time and team members are pushed to reach their full potential, which in the moment can be daunting, but the end result is beautiful.  ATB is a very driven organization and provides great opportunities for employees to be successful, but a lot of work goes on behind the scenes to make this happen and a great deal of  commitment is required from team members- so to be successful here, you truly have to be ""ALL IN' and a strong believer of our goals. This is NOT a con, but it's something that prospective employees need to know."

Workplace 2.0 program is great which allows flexibility for employees to work wherever they are in Canada (not sure if they allow outside of Canada for full-time employees). Salary wise, not bad but I think other banks could offer the same range as well. Culture depends which team you are from. I have worked for different teams in the company, and I can attest to that. It depends who leads the department/team then you can gauge how bad or not so bad politics is. Some are tolerable though.","There are some managers who need to act as leaders and not slave drivers. Favoritism in the team is too obvious but tend to be put in the back burner because if you raised the issue, it will be taken to personal level. Again, this depends on the team you belong to."

792,ATB Financial,Addressing,2015-07-06,4.0,Senior Financial Analyst,"Addressing the comment entitled 'popularity contest' and speaking from many years of work experience here at ATB and elswehere, I would like to share my thoughts.  There may be small / local pockets of dissatisfaction at ATB, this is natural and changes from day to day, period to period, monthends and busy times as well as personal life situations, all affect how we all interact with each other.  
Developing self awareness is the key to address and deal with these types of negative situations.  Approaching from a place of understanding, both myself and the other person and accommodating that person/s are some small ways in which I have been able to overcome my negative feelings and influence my local work environment.  It may sound counterintuitive, but this always works in the long run.  I am a happy person at work and at home because of this attitude I have learnt to develop.  Afterall, we cannot control what others do, say, we can only control how we react,  We all simply want to be happy, dont we?  Happiness takes effort.  I believe ATB provides the environment to flourish and be happy.  But it is a choice we make each day.  Our engagement score this year is 84%, the highest.  This speaks to most of us feeling positive about ATB.  
By the way, these are my personal comments that came from my heart :)","I beleive some leaders may be cynical about our new direction / vision of the ATBs.  I think each leader must motivate themeselves first and then inspire their direct reports to actually experience what we say in the ATBs - being happy, transforming banking, etc.  All of this comes only through example from our leaders.  I would like to see more leaders living the ATBs every day in small things."

807,ATB Financial,Biggest Mistake Of My Life.,2015-03-19,1.0,Customer Service Representative,- Coworkers were great to work with and offered me lots of help when I needed it.,"- Pay is too low ($16.30/hr). Especially considering that I have a Commerce degree and this is a bank we are talking about. 
- Terrible training. When I first started I was in training for two weeks which consisted of me sitting by myself on a computer and doing online courses which ultimately did not teach me anything that related to my position. Most of what I learned was on the job through trial and error, a tonne of mistakes, and my coworkers helping me. 
- The assistant manager was extremely passive aggressive. She would regularly call me in to meetings in her office and berate me for things that no one had shown me how to do properly before rather than try to actually teach me the proper way to do it. I was also told by her that I had ""burned bridges"" and ruined future career opportunities for myself because I missed a meeting, although I sent an email before the meeting stating that I was unable to attend and my reason. 
- There is so much talk about ""building relationships with customers"" but in the end they don't really care about relationships as long as you are meeting your leads targets and selling lots of financial products to customers. This makes the job extremely stressful because you have so many other tasks to do and on top of that you need to sell, sell, sell to anyone and anything that walks into the bank."

Nothing is too much to ask for, and everyone that I work with is friendly, supportive, energetic and great company.

Complacency is rampant throughout organization and much of the work is redirected to the do-ers regardless of their job.

There is a major epidemic of external hires in Sr Management positions. There have been 25+ positions posted in the past year for Middle to Sr. Management and not one of them was an ATB internal hire. Many candidates are coming in from other FI's that have a more rigid sales culture. It is evident that this is where the company is going. That said, if you are reading this to join ATB as an entry level position, then it's a great company. Be aware that the culture is changing, but that is not necessarily a bad thing. There are a lot of tenured staff at ATB that need a shake up. If you are a current ATB Jr/Middle management, I suggest looking elsewhere if you are looking for a promotion.

They want you to move up in the company, and reach for your goals (how this happens though always seemed a little hazy) 

The support was wonderful","As a member of the front line, and therefore the lowest paid employee...the wage was horrible. They want employees that are willing to commit, and stay at ATB, yet they cannot provide their lower level employees a decent wage. As majority of their CSR's are women, most of whom have children-the wage is not even close to being able to support a family, or a single parent. As a full time employee, with two children (one in school, one in day care), I was paying $700 per month in childcare alone. That was almost 50% of my income.  Yes, their employee benefits and perks are great-but you cannot live off perks.

There was the expectation of doing much more than your position required-sales, bringing in certain amounts of new customers etc (as a teller, I didn't expect to have to attain sales targets)"

I don't see any ""Cons"" with ATB, but we are definitely learning from past experiences and challenging new ways of thinking. Making changes to any company takes time and as long as we reduce the risks and impacts and can continue to acheive success with keeping the smiles on our faces, we will continue to do it."
845,ATB Financial,Go find something better,2014-06-05,1.0,,Lunch is the best time.,"If you have a degree, go somewhere else and use your degree and become more wanted and productive. ATB does not value your education. It values high schoolers and people with limited education. Most of the people that get promoted have no college education and are good at ""you know"". Work is repetitive and boring and mindless. Fancy job titles do not match the actual work. 

Qualifications to go up or move within ATB are really low and substandard compared to the big banks. Most of the management, VPs and Directors are caucasians. Most of the people that get promoted are caucasians. There is no diversity in the  mid to upper areas. Have a look at ATB's executive team- that says it all. ATB hired many upper management and VPs from the banks that failed in the US and TD Bank etc. They claim they are locals but they are not. Family members, sons and daughters of managers, get promoted faster than regular hard working people. 

The CEO and VPs like to boast about being for Albertans and ATB's financial successes but the reality is, pay is really low and benefits are mediocre. Every pay grade up is only 1k increase or so. They are not for Albertans. They fired many Albertans during the past couple of years. if you do not have a mortgage while working for ATB, you will be valued less or fired more likely. It's even tougher to get loans or credit cards with ATB than the big banks- even if you are a staff.  ATB hires many Temporary Foreign Workers to sort out SAP problems. Perhaps hundreds of them. New ones come and go. ATB could easily hire graduates from Alberta colleges and Universities and people from here to those tech related positions. It is cheaper to hire TFW. ATB probably does not even check their backgrounds and qualifications.

Not just for our Clients but also for the employees as well.,Being someone still new to ATB I find the Operating Guide not very helpful or easy to find information. Even when you type the exact topic your looking for it comes back with Item not found. Its frustrating to not have info right at your finger tips.
859,ATB Financial,"A supportive, people oriented company",2014-04-30,5.0,Team Leader,"ATB Financial does a great job creating a team environment where they focus on the people.  There is a large focus on leadership development where people are encouraged to display leadership qualities and support their teams/coworkers.  When I talk with employees from another company, the emphasis on leadership has not been as strong as how ATB emphasizes it.

There is plenty of opportunity for career progression throughout the company and if you are ambitious (and willing to work for it), this company is great for you.  Leaders can be supportive and if you show potential, others will definitely seek you out.  There is a lot of recognition based on merit and ability.

There are plenty of benefits which are generally overlooked and our benefits are probably better than other banks in the industry, based on conversations with peers in other companies.  I believe the salaries are generally more than competitive with our banking competitors as well.","The first con is the expectations for employees are dependent on the leader you report to.  ATB provides many tools and programs for their leaders, but if you get stuck with a bad leader, you probably are going to have a terrible experience in your role.  If your leader is good, they will help you with your career progression, support you, identify opportunities and give you coaching to improve.  If you have a bad leader, you are left to your own resources to figure things out.  This may be the same with any situation where there is a bad leader.

The second con would be defined performance management.  ATB, probably like other organizations do not have strong measurable performance planners for non-Sales oriented staff.  Therefore, if you have any work of a subjective nature, it is again up to your leader to be rate you.  This process can be a general void where team members don't fully understand throughout the year what they are measured on and where they stand (and if they need to improve)..  This may be a challenge in other companies, but this is still a con as it is hard to know how 'much' you have to improve to get to the next level when there are no defined measurements.  This also leads to low performers being unable to improve as there is a lack of specifics of what the gap is."

On a daily basis I see examples of team members and leaders who see the value in working together to achieve challenging goals that require collaboration and cooperation. I see people genuinely caring for one another, as well as a company that gives back to the community in so many incredible ways. I see ""dumb processes"" being eliminated on-the-spot, because that is the smart thing to do. I see an eagerness and enthusiasm to embrace new and innovative ways of doing things -- because that will make us better at what we do! Furthermore, in my flexible work arrangement I feel like -- for the first time in my adult life -- I have been entrusted to do what I need to do, when I need to do it...and no one is watching the clock to see when I check in/check out. The trust and caring and innovation that exudes throughout the company is contagious! Great people doing great things...with lots more ""great"" on the horizon!","The only con -- and it is largely self-induced -- is that having the flexibility to work from home, and loving my job so much, means that I am lousy at maintaining an effective work/life balance."

There has been a focus on employee engagement that has also helped build credibility both within and outside the organization.",After changes in senior management there was a great effort to bring down the number of positions which made the orgainzation less nimble. That pentulem has swung the other way and there seems to numerous positions and titles appearing daily with no proof of their value.

894,ATB Financial,A warm place to work.,2014-04-22,4.0,Customer Service Manager,"Friendly, team atmosphere, welcoming community, promote networking and engagement. Like to build the team from the bottom up, in other words grow their people from within. Its a place where you can build roots and then move into other parts of the company if that fits your skillset better. About Albertans helping Albertans not taking the customer for the highest profit the bank can get.","If the management is not engaging and willing to put effort into their people a branch can easily sink or swim. With how many administrative tasks are requested of not only the CSR's and PB's, but also the leadership team, it can become difficult to find time to coach and lead our people. The admin is necessary to keep the checks and balances of the branch, but for the leadership team, it can take away from developing a stronger thriving team instead of just a surviving team"

-Good starter company for 6 months to a year maximum
-Good place for students since you plan to move on after
-Direct management is fun, makes it a nice environment to work in.

Benefits are good
Compensation is bad- Rating is based mostly on compensation
I would and wouldn't recommend to others. I selected would not recommend because most of the people I know would be looking for a company to grow with which I wouldnt recommend to start here.","-ATB/upper management takes advantage of your hard work and pays you the bare minimum to try to keep you quiet regardless of all the extra work or new role you've taken on. They will also work everyone over the capacity in order to avoid hiring more employees to replace others that left. Not paid fairly at all. 

-Management does not deal with your issues or try hard enough to assist with your requests or what you need to keep work/life balance. In other words there is not enough cooperation when you express the need to your managers that you need change in scheduling between work and life... 

-No change or effort put to dealing with inadequate performance from other employees. If you are a hard worker it is not acknowledged other than a ""Thank you"" which is just simple words used to make you feel better and that is all. You will not have any other benefits of moving up or having priority in scheduling when working hard while others are slacking.

-Employees that slack, do not come to work, come at anytime or work 4-5 hrs a day instead of the mandatory 8.25 hours are not dealt with. There is no equality between employees, people are favored and it is extremely noticeable 

-Raises: You will be lucky to get more than a 2.5% raise per year. IF anything. 

-If you are a hard worker beware. They will depend on you and you will no longer have the flexibility in schedule or possibly looking for other opportunities.

-It is very easy to lose motiviation here, you will start out happy for a few months and it will start to go down hill when you really see the true face of ATB. We are constantly asked what we want to see improved/changed and have yearly surveys to express our concerns. I would not be writing any of this if changes actually happened."

The hours are not to bad.,They have little respect for single moms.  People are rewarded for staying extra hours and not on the quality of the hours they spend at work.

The people are good overall and the starting wage is pretty good.,"I find that its hard to move up within the company. They basically say, ""stay until an opportunity may or may not arise, but we can't guarentee that anything will"", while the on going trend is that nothing will show up. Also, I believe that becuase we are unionized, some employees don't take their job seriously and don't put in their full effort, despite their higher pay grades. I don't believe that you are paid here at ATB by performence, but by how long you stick it out.

938,ATB Financial,A great place to work,2014-04-17,5.0,Project Manager,"The new ATB Place headquarters and Calgary Campus encourage collaboration and have lots of meeting rooms for private conversations and conference calls. This is supported by a Results Oriented Work Environment which allows employees latitude in when and where they work.
There is lots of opportunity for learning on the job. The work variety so far has been great.
There are lots of corporate and employee initiated social activities.
Great support for a healthy lifestyle.",The preformance management practices are relatively immature (formalized coaching and pay for performance being two areas which could be improved).  The organization seems to have good intentions. Some areas (Business and Agriculture and Retail Financial Services) seem to be more advanced in staff development and coaching.
939,ATB Financial,ATB has been a great place to work and I look forward to a long career with the organization.,2014-04-17,5.0,Private Client Advisor,"ATB has created an increadible culture.

941,ATB Financial,Forward-thinking and fun!,2014-04-17,4.0,Anonymous Employee,"Great focus on work-life balance, forward thinking about people practices, flexible working hours, and a great benefit package, and overall just fun.  There is a fabulous recognition program and culture at ATB and quite a bit of out-of-the box thinking is evident.

943,ATB Financial,Great career decision to work at ATB,2014-04-17,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"They understand the difference between busy work and productive work.  They give me the ability to get the job done how, where and when I see fit, and I am evaluated solely on those results.  So many other companies I've been at seem to value face time over actual quality work. ATB has a philosophy on what is best for the client and they stick to it.  You don't have a sales culture where the company looks the other way and says ""do what you want, just get sales"".  Instead they will accept potentially lower short run sales numbers in exchange for doing what is best for clients, and building really great long term trusting relationships with those clients.","We lack the name recognition and visibility of the big banks and this can lead to some challenges.  Also technology and system upgrades over the past few years were challenging and costly, some of the issues these have created are not completely sorted out yet, although there is continuous improvement."

948,ATB Financial,ATB is my family,2014-04-17,4.0,Fulfillment Specialist,"ATB has provided me with great opportunities to advance my career, provides fair compensation and treats their employees as their most valuable asset.  Associates possess the ability to balance work/life and have many health/wellness resources at their fingertips.","Adequate training and preparation for certain roles is lacking.  In an attempt to stay current/competitive, oftentimes jerk-knee reactions occur which result in re-writing processes, restructuring departments and re-aligning duties, much to the frustration and anxiety of associates who are impacted."

951,ATB Financial,A small company feel with big banking dreams,2014-04-17,4.0,PERSONAL BANKING SPECIALIST,Flexibility as a parent.  Room for advancement.  Career changes are supported.  Benefit package changes as needs change.  Employee banking privileges.,Every branch operates differently.  The consistency and continuity could show some improvement.
952,ATB Financial,Why didn't I start here 20 years ago?,2014-04-17,5.0,Anonymous Employee,Great leadership. Smart associates. All with a common goal.  Great mix of community awareness and striving for growth. They treat their associates as well as any other company I have worked for. They expect a lot but you are well paid to do so. I want my kids to work here.,"It's a big corporation with some of the usual big corporate bs. Sometimes process gets in the way of progress. It needs to stop being so ""bank-y"" and be more nimble."
953,ATB Financial,"Come for a Job, Stay for a Career",2014-04-17,4.0,Service Coordinator,"Whether you're looking for one of your first real jobs or you're an experienced professional looking for a place to work, ATB Financial has a wide range of opportunities available for all areas of expertise. I came to ATB Financial as a new graduate as did a number of new hires who came on around the same time. That is one great thing about ATB Financial; they're willing to give new graduates and young people not only a job, but an opportunity to build a career. I can honestly say it's a completely different company now from when I've started; there's been a lot more focus on learning and development, people and culture, the way we do business and engage the community – all of which have been positive steps in the right direction to being a great company.

If you're looking for a place to make an easy pay check, get big bonuses and get ahead quick, then look elsewhere. ATB Financial is no Oil and Gas or Energy Company; ATB Financial is still a Financial Institution at the end of the day. You won't make the money you would in other sectors like O&G/Energy, IT, construction or even a trades job. If you can accept this however, there is an opportunity to grow with ATB Financial and put yourself in a position you can be proud of. Relative to the Big 5 Banks in Canada, ATB Financial definitely stands on top. Not only does ATB Financial compensate their employees better than their competitors on average, but they also give you the chance to be part of the corporate environment right here in Alberta. Normally if you want to be part of a major Financial Institutions Corporate environment you would have to move to Ontario, specifically Toronto. With ATB Financial you can be a part of the corporate culture in Calgary and Edmonton.

Lastly I want to comment on career development and advancement, I have mixed views on the topic but in the last year ATB has made big strides to improving this. There's a lot of opportunity to grow in your own community and within a branch environment, however entrance into either of the corporate centres may tighten up as a consequence as the number of transferable skills can be quite different between the two environments. I've specifically noticed it's gotten a lot harder to be part of their Corporate Financial Services and Investor Services group this last year. I would also note that vertical movement is very achievable within each strategic business unit, but horizontal movement is a far bigger challenge. Networking and getting to know people is a big help in moving around, otherwise most positions are likely to go to internal candidates within each business unit. On a final note you must be willing to put the time and work to get places with ATB Financial and you must be a leader or expert in your own role if you want to advance. They do prefer internal candidates, so don't be afraid of applying to a variety of positions and exploring your option.","For me the biggest challenge of working for ATB Financial has been the learning and development process. My first role was as a Personal Banking Specialist and my learning experience was very self-learned. As one of ATBs most common positions you'd assume the training process would be pretty streamlined and structured, but it was clear in our formal training classes of 20+ people that everyone was getting a different experience. It's not surprising for this reason that probably less than 20% of the people I trained with are still with ATB Financial. There has been a lot of work in revamping their training program, I can only assume its better now but there is undoubtedly some gaps that still need to be filled. In my second in current role as a Coordinator the trend continued, again it was very self-learned and I was forced to once again sink or swim. I currently deal with close to half a dozen company specific software products of which I received zero training on. ""Read the documents"" or"" read the manuals"" isn't how you set people up for success; it's very basic that not everyone learns best by reading how to do something. It can also be discouraging and even frustrating at times when there's no clear expectation or measurable result for certain roles.

Before deductions I think employees are compensated quite fairly, what really kills me is getting deducted 11.7% (currently) per pay check for a Public Service Pension Plan I have no say or control over. Any position under a ""J"" pay grade will automatically pay into this plan, pretty much meaning if you're making less than 55k which would be the majority of employees then you're paying into this. That's 4,000-6,500/year for most people for a plan that most people won't adequately qualify for when they retire. I rather have that money to put into a TFSA every year. Another thing we really hit below average on is starting annual vacation. Most employers start at 3 weeks, ATB starts at 2 weeks + 1 week if you don't take any vacation in peak travel times. Most companies would move you up to the next vacation entitlement jump at 3-5 years, but with ATB you simply get your normal 3 weeks without the peak period stipulation after 3 years. This kind of structure is well below a lot of top company entitlements.  Otherwise benefits are good, it's a flexible plan through Blue Cross so you can pick your benefits according to how you need them. 

Lastly, although corporate culture has improved a lot, there is a lot of room for improvement. I think it's a bit embarrassing how much is invested into corporate challenge every year and how it's organized. These are employees representing your company, invest in them, empower them and stand behind them when they're in the public eye like this!"
954,ATB Financial,Great place to work,2014-04-17,4.0,Senior Business Systems Analyst,"ATB's benefit package, support of personal growth, as well as the flexibilty to work-from-home are excellent.  With over 5,000 employees, the company still manages to maintain a 'small business' feel.

Most employees have the option of working from home.  Even if I am not in the office, I feel connected through email and lync messaging.  My manager is more interested in whether I meet my deadlines than which hours I work.  There is a high level of trust and confidence that I can do my job.  People are encouraged to recognize others for their hard work.  It is always a nice surprise to receive a ""you've been recognized"" email, where someone thanks me for helping them with their budget, preparing a report, etc.  I know these tasks are part of my job, but it is nice to know that my effort helped someone else with their work.",I've yet to find any cons.

Co-workers are typically cheerful and the environment is quite positive. The company will gladly pay for any relevant training that you want to take. From an IT professional perspective, ATB continues to invest in their new SAP banking platform which means no lack of work.","ATB's technical landscape is largely built on SAP, which, for IT professionals, means that you're working within the confines of the SAP product vs. doing any development from the ground up. There is really limited opportunies to explore new technologies, especially from within the SAP teams. Pay bands are middle of the road.

987,ATB Financial,"Profitable, despite managements best efforts",2014-04-16,3.0,Director,"Running a bank in economically booming Alberta is a license to print money.  So generally jobs are stable, salaries reasonable, benefits plentiful, and further corporate growth expected.","This is a crown corporation, not a publically traded company.  As a result, market-place pressures have not always prevailed and ATB has made some poor corporate decisions, and retained some less than competent managers and employees.  Business practices often significantly lag those of competitors, and current management is pushing hard to try to catch up in many areas."
988,ATB Financial,Excellent place to work,2014-04-16,5.0,Customer Service Representative,very family orientated.  good benefit package,They don't bring in their casual employees when we are short staffed.

I have the flexibility of choosing to work from home or different ATB location, and still be part of the overall team success.","Nothing that a dynamic workplace doesn't have, but I wouldn't categorize them as ""cons"".

ATB team members are recognized and rewarded through Everyday Heroes program and health and wellness benefits are given to each team member. Privileges in applying lowest rates and waiving fees in opening accounts, credit cards and mortgage loans are what team members are entitled to. ATB Financial really cares both for team members and their customers. It is really the place to work.","Competitive salary adjustments, bonuses and fair evaluation of salary level based on job profile must be applied more especially when ATB Financial is performing great based on Financial Reports every quarter."
992,ATB Financial,ATB has gone through many changes creating few negative but many positive experiences.,2014-04-16,4.0,Team Leader,The value proposition ATB has towards it's clients and staff is incomprable. For a job ATB creates value in ensuring the staff are able to have the tools they need to help the clients. The benefits are now more so educated so that most people are well versed in knowing what to use. The culture has always been to make ATB the place to work and it's showing more so today than over the last 7 years.,Given work loads or tasks related to projects/changes work life balance can be a struggle. This struggle is few and far between.
993,ATB Financial,Great company to learn and grow in,2014-04-16,4.0,Human Resources,"ATB has a tremendous worklife balance, I feel the company truly cares about their people and that goes a long way, they invest in their people and provide them with opportunities to learn and grow their careers further. I think they have so many different career paths for their employees that really the world is their oyster.","I think the only difficult aspect can be salary, ATB is very competitive as far as benefits but it is hard to compete in Alberta with the oil and gas markets, however I feel what the company can give their people makes up for any shortcomings."

I wanted to branch out and it was just a matter of finding the right job that fit my skill set. I found it here at ATB and I've never been happier. ATB provides a competive salery along with training and professional development opportunities I would have never had in the my previous line of work.  I am constantly encouraging my friends who are re-evaluating their career to keep checking ATB for openings. I had my chances to take some very high paying contract jobs in the Oil&Gas industry but I wanted a job that could be my home and something I could settle into for the long term. I am very happy to work here.,I don't have any. I would like see if ATB would ever expand into BC cities like Vancouver or Eastern Canadian cities like Montreal or Toronto.

997,ATB Financial,Great place to work,2014-04-16,4.0,Analyst,They promote good work-life balance and support (and pay for) continued education in your field. Most supervisors are accessible and helpful.,The only con I can think of is promoting one manager who provides no support to his/her people.

Pay is fair and benefits are great, including a variable pay program. I enjoy having a job where I actually like going to work every morning because the people don't ruin it. Frequent job evaluations and opportunities to bring up issues and contribute ideas. Many opportunities for growth and education within the organization.","Like anywhere, managers set the tone for their department and their disorganization/poor attitude/pettiness can counteract the overall attempts to create a productive and welcoming office culture. On the plus side, there is easy access to resources to deal with unfairness and poor behaviour."
999,ATB Financial,A respectful company that cares about its employees,2014-04-16,4.0,Business Analyst,ATB Financial truly values work life balance and respecting its employees. The benefits are above average and training is strongly encouraged.,Ineffective employees are often allowed to continue to stay dragging down high performing employees.

1000,ATB Financial,Positive and supportive environment with many opportunities to grow.,2014-04-16,5.0,Processing Specialist,"The great people I work with every day, the benefits, and the flexable hours.","Sometimes accessing information, or learning material is a  difficult and convoluted process."
1001,ATB Financial,Good work life balance,2014-04-16,4.0,PERSONAL BANKING SPECIALIST,"Work life Balance, ability to make your own hours.  The advancement possiblities are okay.   The ability to make your own decisions about your day and not being micromanaged makes for a much better run establishment.","Getting accurate raises to suit the evergrowing inflation.  Advancement possibilites that require you to move our of your home area, instead of being able to advance within your originating branch.  Not accurate training got positions.  Leaders need to be more adapt to what we do on a daily basis.  Pay scales seem to be low for some types of the positions that are available.  Our expectations seem to be higher while our pay for performance is lower.  Upper management makes a higher bonus while the people that bring in and do the business make substanially lower."
1002,ATB Financial,Profit hungry...losing sight of what ATB's roots,2014-04-16,2.0,Anonymous Employee,"Small regional financial institution with decent exposure to different roles in various departments (branch - external sales - underwriting - corporate office, etc.).  Has a good outward reputation in smaller markets, and is slowly catching up in terms of systems and technology.","Too focused on aggressive growth.  Trying to compete with the big national financial institutions while lacking the resources and capacity to play on the same field.  With the new focus now being heavily around driving  productivity/profitability to increase market share, they are forgetting the origins of ATB...to serve Albertans!

Doesn't see potential in their own employees.  A lot of senior leaders are hired from external sources, instead of promoting and advancing existing dedicated employees.  So even though there is visibility to different roles in the organization, don't expect to be able to advance even if you demonstrate ability...unless you play well into their favoritism and politics."
1003,ATB Financial,Disorganized and unstructured,2014-04-16,3.0,Anonymous Employee,Flexible work environment and working remotely is an accepted/encouraged practice.,"Culture tends to lean towards having meeting after meeting, often with very little being done in the meetings (i.e. minimal results or action items). Onboarding process is also very disorganized; for example, there is no formal new hire orientation, the LMS is extremely difficult to navigate and use, and there is an overall lack of integration/communication between groups (i.e. I provided a void cheque to HR upon contract signing for payroll, but was then asked again to provide another void cheque after I started because payroll never received the first cheque; I did not receive my benefits enrolment information until a few weeks after I started, and only after I sent an enquiry to benefits about it). Lastly, cafeteria pricing is very high; given that the office is not close to very many other food options and is not located downtown, I would have expected the cafeteria pricing to be lower - esepcially in relation to the food quality."
1004,ATB Financial,The culture at ATB Financial is excellent.,2014-04-16,3.0,Sales,"The employees are made to feel very valuable & appreciated by our CEO. And thats important. We all want to know that we matter & that our contribution matters to the organization, even if we are just a small part of it.","They are not good at promoting their staff, to move up the food chain. But, if you are a man, it will happen much quicker. We are not as much of an old boys club as we used to be, but, we still are. I guess that is the norm these days with most companies. Very very unfortunate.
Also, we have never been more top heavy in the organization as we are now. They keep hiring top executives, & expect more from those in the customer contact roles. They are hiring in the wrong area's. The expectations are not realistic.
Their is far too much admin work to do in a sales role"
1005,ATB Financial,Great place to work,2014-04-16,5.0,Anonymous Employee,This is a great Alberta company to work for.

In recent years they have made more of an effort to provide training in your respective field.,"A lot of the time you'll see low to mid-level job openings go to someone who knew the hiring manager rather than the best candidate. Due to this fact you may find a lot of people not right for the position, whether it be customer service issues or their management skills are lacking."

I have always been treated well all the way from the mail room to Business Analyst.  My hard work has always been rewarded appropriately.  In my role I am given the freedom to work the hours that work best for my family often working from home durring family illness.  Issues of favoritism have been mostly eliminated.  A strong focus on the right leaders in the right places is ensuring the ATB work environment continues to improve.,Wage for some of the more technical roles is not at industry averages.  Overall ATB culture is very secular with groups from different parts of the organization not communicating effectively.

Huge focus on the wellness of their employees, with a good pension plan. ATB has a great executive team with very clear goals and direction for the company.",ATB recently completed a transition of all of their core banking systems to SAP (in 2011) and are still dealing with stabilization in certain aspects of the day-to-day.  Sometimes leaders are brought in from other banks that don't understand the ATB culture that has been developed over the past 75 years and want to change us into one of the Five Big banks.

They are hands down the most forward and encouraging company I have seen when it comes to promoting career progression, along with tools and support to get you as high as you want to go. The benefit plan is extensive and competitve, and variable pay based on performance is a nice addition. New company buildings such as Calgary Campus are expansive, beautiful and modern. Community involvment is second to none and there is a strong sense of loyalty from our clients. Work/life balance is important and I have never had a problem getting the time off I need to with enough notice. Employee interest rates and financial perks are great as well.","The union holds many people hostage in the sense of pension contributions are mandatory, and among some of the highest percentages paid by employees I have ever seen, enough so that my contributions require me to have a second job to be able to pay all of my bills every month. Your salary may look impressive on paper, but it will not be the same near the same when it come time to get that pay deposit. Depending on the geographic area of your workplace, you will see some major differences in the attitudes of your clients and co-workers.

The company wants to head in the right direction and has started implementing some unique transformations to do so.  However, overall the execution of these transformations has been very poor.  It is one thing to have change negatively affect your employees during its initial phases (growing pains if you will).  But when your entire client-base becomes directly affected and frustrated by these changes, you have a systematic problem.","I worked for ATB Financial during the main phase of its transition into ""ATB 2.0"".  This most notably involved CORE and implementation of the new SAP banking system.  The execution of this change was done very poorly - the decision to ""go-live"" , when and how this was executed, ended up doing both staff and customers a huge disservice.  I left ATB Financial in late 2012 and there were still many business critical functions that were not working as intended.  It was very clear that there was a huge disconnect between those implementing the new system, and the eventual end-users of the system.  As an end-user (retail banker), it was evident right away that this software was not designed with the end-user's best interests in mind and failed to make our jobs easier or more efficient.  In the end, it just seemed like a modernized looking platform relative to the old system, that somehow managed to be backward in it's functionality in some respects."

A massive cutting of strategic support units in an effort to trim $30 million off the salary line; being delivered as ""doing more, with less"".

ATB is going through the pains of being the ""ginea pig"" in the industry for a so called new industry standard. 

ATB has invested ALOT of time and $ in this new technology platform. They are trying to work out alot of bugs in it which are leaving the frontline staff with thier hands tied in many situations. Branches are extremely challenged (especially if you add in some staff shortages in key roles at the branch level).
