Nice people",Sometimes can look to do too much rather than focus on one or two things
1,Admiral Group,Horrible company,2022-04-07,1.0,Renewal Consultant,Minimum wage is fun I guess?,"It’s a horrible place to work. They’ve recently hired 3/4 consultants that were undeserved but friends and had social connections and friendships with managers and seniors of their team. 3 of these people were caught for actions that were disciplinary worthy but measures but not actually carried out. It’s sad because Admiral is a great company that pays slave labour-esk wages buy actually favour/promote the horrible people in the company. FYI, one of these people wasn’t disciplined as he preached mental health for calling colleagues when he was supposed to be answers calls Tom customers during a pandemic. The other 2 (who did the exact same thing) are on course to get the roles they were demoted from after neglecting customers and Admirals key principles."

Share scheme (also a con)","Terrible pay for entry-level workers

Share scheme is used as an excuse for poor pay. If you have a decent salary when you start the share scheme is a massive plus, but if you start off at entry-level the share scheme is used as an excuse to not provide pay rises."

You get a free book","I learned a few things at AFSL

Redundancy is just around the corner if your face doesn't fit and it probably won't

No one really knows what 'The Admiral Way' is

There is a 'big book' that no-one reads

To be successful, you must be personally sponsored by some chap called Henry / Italian rising stars

Your experience will always be discounted 

A recent graduate hire will replace you through some form of favouritism, cronyism, turning a blind eye, head in the sand, mates rates, skip the interview and just turn up, the list goes on...

 You will be demonised an outcast if you don't instantly subscribe to the 'Henry' mantra - whatever that is

You will be 'moved along' by an overly strong-armed leader, you know the type of one that makes you want to go to an employment lawyer

You will observe the CEO being deliberately undermined on a daily basis

You might get to work with one senior leader who is destroying morale, causing chaos and making life unpleasant for everyone and seems to be able to do what ever they want without any challenge."

23,Admiral Group,Company has gone downhill fast,2022-02-26,2.0,Customer Loyalty Representative,"Great colleagues, I've made some fantastic friends in my 2+ years here but that's about the only positive sadly. The company was so different 2 years ago, the role was easier, there was more sense of fun in the department. Since the new CEO took over it's gone downhill","Base salary is low, incentive seems good but they can take money off you for small mistakes. They've also messed up people's incentive this month meaning so many of us have lost money and they won't do anything about it.

Don't care about their staff. All you are is a money making machine. My role was never a sales role when I started but now we have to try to sell to every single customer and be pushy with it, even the elderly which I think is morally wrong. If you accidentally go over your lunch break for one minute they make you work the time back, the same with your WiFi dropping etc. Everything needs to be worked back they're not at all understanding. 

Micromanaging. Now this is the big one...they watch EVERYTHING you do. If you've been on toilet code for 6 mins, expect your manager to message you asking what you're doing.

Long working hours and virtually 0 work-life balance. Working hours are 40-45hrs a week depending on your schedule. The late 10-7 shifts are scheduled about once every 3 weeks. They also like to try to pressure people into doing overtime on weekends as they're so limited on staff due to everyone leaving. You'll also get one week every month where you work 6 days, yes thats right, 6, meaning you only get one day off that week.

The job is also extremely stressful. The targets are way too high and not realistic. You often work 2.5 hrs on the phone between breaks which is a long time to just be sat talking. Expect regular headaches and sore throats. Your calls get dipped constantly and you always get negative feedback no matter how hard you try, the scripts are too intense and if you miss one word of a script you've failed the call and it impacts your incentive.

If you asked me a year ago, I would have written a different review, but these days I would honestly avoid. Plenty of other contact centre roles going that are better."

46,Admiral Group,"Good for a transition job, not for mental health or career development",2022-01-15,2.0,Insurance Sales Agent,"- If you get the right manager, the job can be quite fulfilling and you have a great sense of accomplishment. Those managers are few and far between.
- As a newbie to insurance generally, it taught me a lot of basics about car insurance in the UK, a lot of which is transferable to Canadian markets.
- It can definitely be used to hone your personal relations skills","Some of the management got promoted way too young or way too early in their career: others have been denied management roles for ""using it as a way to get off the phones"" when a lot of managers openly admit that it's why they applied for senior and management roles to begin with.

Other superiors are non-stop micro-managers. There have been times where people have been threatened to go to review and lose their job for not using the customer's first name when speaking with them. Others have been told they're being ""too negative"" for mentioning the soda machine was out of Diet Pepsi because they ""now went on to ruin somebody else's lunch break"". Petty stuff that has no impact on the business in any way, shape or form but they turn it into big issues.

There are way too many targets to meet that rely on random chance. Customer price is dependent on how willing the underwriting team are willing to insure the customer. If we're not competitive, or we don't secure the sale, our cancellation rate or call-to-transaction rate go up. If a customer says no to adding extra cars or homes to the policy, you're expected to push and probe into why and essentially force a price down their throat in the hopes that they'll change their mind. If they still deny the quote, managers will ask ""why didn't you ask them about other family members"". I don't know about you, but I'm not going to pay for my brother's car insurance. Pitching ancillaries is along the same lines; customer straight up didn't want the product? ""Oh it must be because you didn't use their first name"". If a customer straight up says ""no"" to multi-cover options, the literal feedback you'll get from all managers is ""they'll say no because they don't understand"" and literally want us to view customers as if they're stupid. Another rubric is ""3+ Risks"" - entirely reliant on how many vehicles or properties the policy holder owns or are willing to insure with us, which is again not something we can control.
TLDR; Unfair stat thresholds which come from luck of the draw.

In renewals, your stats and incentive come from whether or not a customer is willing to renew a policy, often hundreds of pounds higher than another company. Often in the Renewals department, you spend the first few minutes of your call trying to calm down customers who insult you or the company due to their high renewal price. Often the company doesn't give the best price out to the customer first, which makes them play a game of cat-and-mouse/

There's a line in the sand that needs to be drawn, and when it comes to customer interactions the sales are pushier than they need to be. When it comes to employees, Admiral will always take the side of management.

Keeping this in mind, there's obvious favouritism; I once saw a group of people wanting to be seniors go through the training program together. One person literally left for the entire time the training course was going on, and still got promoted to management while the person who actually buckled down and did the work got rejected. Others expressed that they were looking to leave the company, and then within a month or two they suddenly became full managers or positions magically opened up for them. I saw a hard-worker of three years get declined a senior role in favor of somebody who was still on probation and only worked for the company for three months at the time. Other jobs are literally created specifically for one person to apply, but they open the position up to the entire floor as a facade so it looks more above-board when it comes to the recruiting process. One manager got fired for sleeping with his employee, whereas another manager got offered a transfer to the other department, when the outcome should be the same universally.

Despite all the negotiations we deal with when it comes to customers, there still isn't enough pay. When it comes to complaints, agents are the first to handle it. Negotiations? Agents. We often annoy customers even more by having to put them on hold to do price matches that we should be able to handle ourselves; and we have to do this through Teams group chats, where half the time managers don't even respond to the request and leave it to another manager. Often I've been left to do managers' jobs for them including doing call listenings and helping other agents with improving their call quality, just to get told that ""all I do is press buttons all day and don't deserve a better wage"". Thanks, Admiral, for making me do the job your higher-ups refuse to do and then make me feel worse because of it!

Compliance is always breathing down your neck to the point where if you miss one word in a script and it doesn't change the meaning of your words, they'll still find a way to screw you out of hard-earned incentive pay. Some managers won't even fight on your behalf to overturn the decision, whereas others do.

There's no universal standard managers follow; what some managers condone, others don't, and you'll often find yourself walking on eggshells around them.

TL;DR
The office is very unprofessional and likes to preach perfect standards of conduct, but at the end of the day, they can't seem to uphold their own values of performance and instead would rather threaten review and termination over small, inconsequential things that make zero impact on job performance, or offer favouritism to the disciplinary and promotion process. No matter how well you do at the job, they're always going to find a way to make you feel like you've failed at something that you have zero control over. You'll never feel like you're compensated enough for your time there. You'll be pushed into rapport-building which opens you up to more red calls, and it's impossible to live up to every single standard they have - yet they expect you to.

Would you like a job where your performance and bonuses depend how willing your superiors are to insure the customer? Would you like a job where every single word you say is monitored to the point where you can get fired for not referring to your caller by their name when it's completely unnecessary? Would you like a job where you make all the money for the company on their behalf, just to have them look for ways to take it away from you? then step right up, this job is for you!"

Great opportunities to progress within the business (though you may need to move sideways at first to leave the call centre into a support department before skilling and progressing, as SNR/TM jobs are competitive within call-centres, with a long list of skilled long serving CCR's awaiting slots to open)

Share Scheme - minimum £3.6k a year shares. While this isn't guaranteed (business performance decides) it has never been anything other than the max £3.6k since floating.

Buy a book - If you want to learn skills for your role or for a role you want to go to, you can buy books through work. If you make the most of this scheme you can really improve your business knowledge.

Company base salaries are lower than others in the same city, yet alone similar roles in Bristol/Manchester/London etc.

COVID impacts - While they've responded brilliantly to COVID, many of the benefits of working for Admiral (the office environment, table-tennis/FIFA, Impromptu snacks/treats, free fruit daily etc) have essentially disappeared since people are WFH.

Good opportunities to develop if you know where to look. Good at innovating and looking for new ways to attract and retain customers. Treat staff well on the whole, especially during Covid and setting up home working as quickly as they could. Also they have been good with putting our health and safety at the top of the priority, rather than forcing or rushing people back into the office.","It can be difficult to find opportunities to develop unless you look - you're not recommended for roles based on your performance, goals and ambitions. The pay and benefits are also seriously in need of a review as I do not feel the pay is truly in line with how well we perform. I imagine a lot of our competitors pay a lot more for the same job. Also the benefits needs a revamp. As Admiral doesn't have a salary banding scale, there is a lack of transparency on where you are pitched against others that you work with.

Weekly games/quizzes to help boost staff morale
Frequent 1-1 meetings with managers to discuss how we are performing","Working on the phones is a low-paying, micro-managed nightmare! Your every move is recorded by the managers and if you've taken too many toilet/tea breaks in a month they will bring this up very negatively in 1-1 meetings.
The long hours, stressful phonecalls and low-pay were made even worse by the complete laziness of the managers - constantly taking extra breaks, longer lunches than allocated and last minute half-days.
In one instance, a manager had sent an insulting message about me meant for another manager by mistake, which has me believe that they are most likely extremely unprofessional about the underdog employees behind our backs.
Very competitive environment where employees are constantly compared to one another in our work performance. This normally lead to clique-like behaviour among staff and overall was sometimes a sly, hostile place to work."
154,Admiral Group,Great place to work,2021-04-26,3.0,Customer Service Representative,"This is great place to start out your career in the corporate world. The environment is friendly, but it is very target driven which can increase the stress level. 
You get adequate training before you start taking calls and most of the customers are polite and will tell you that they are not upset at you.
Great health benefits.
Buy a book program
Flexible and accommodating
Free food
Lots of cash give aways 
Work from home","The pay is the biggest con. It will take at least 2-3 years before you can start making extra money without working over time. To be clear the potential to make extra money as soon as you start taking calls is there, but realistically speaking, it will take 2-3 years before you will see a steady incentive and 4 years before you are enrolled in the companies share scheme. If you are university graduate chances are that you would not want to stay here the length of time you need to stay before you see a big increase to your pay, this is because a better opportunity is definitely going to present it yourself if you look.
There is also little room for growth, they will tell you there is and you will see job postings, but there is a hierarchy and when you do get to management you don't necessarily get paid more per hour.

I can honestly say that I have never been more proud of Admiral with our 'Stay At Home' refund. Knowing that we as staff were looked after through such a testing time is one thing, but for us to give £110 million back to our customers as a gesture of goodwill and help support our customers is something else.

270,Admiral Group,Tottaly opposite of their public image.,2020-07-06,1.0,Anonymous Employee,UK's Admiral Team is nice. They work with dignity and treat others the same. It's because of them that Gurgaon's Admiral is an office.,"A lot of managers are an absolute joke. A result of uneducated and thoughtless people working in a BPO, with no skill to work somewhere else, except for maybe as a toilet cleaner, get promoted as a manager for sitting dull in their chair till their youth fades.

- It's common for a lot of them to talk with dirty words with their team members about girls from Wales who generously come to Gurgaon to support these unintelligent leaders.

- A lot of managers don't even follow rules. For ex: They are supposed to accept complaint calls when customers request to speak to the manager a set number of times. However, even when customers complain multiple times, they do not accept complaint calls except in extreme pressure. This puts agents at risk, as customers' complain gets registered against the agent, while managers put all the risk to the agent when they don't receive calls.

- Careless managers often forget to complete their own tasks and blame the agents.

- While respect is declared important in Admiral, office in Gurgaon is completely opposite of it. Quotes like ""You came on your own, you can leave the company on your own"" is extremely common among managers who come to Gurgaon from Bangalore. It's so common that one employee publicly quit the company informing the same reason to everyone.

- If these managers from Gurgaon would have applied for jobs in Swansea or Cardiff, they would most likely NOT be managers.

- Trainers in Gurgaon are like the teachers from school no one understood. Training after starting job is not to be relied on. Such guys wouldn't even be hired if applied to a decent company.

- Illogical managers have no idea on how to manage, or lead, forget about being an example for the employees.

- These don't have their ideas well-aligned, and therefore, a lot of these 40 something year olds have to be taught by 19 something late teenagers who come from Wales to bring in some sense in these managers.

- Serious hygiene issues among a few managers. While health is declared a priority in Admiral, a few managers have extremely poor hygiene spreading, notorious for their bad breath and they stink. A few managers have dead chicken legs which they don't mind showing off. Can't lead by being an example.

- Very unhelpful. With almost no emotional quotient, like a monkey taught to dance with a set number of moves to keep themselves, a lot of managers in Gurgaon barely have any helpful knowledge about career, growth, or have the ability to lead.

- Almost all team members argue with a lot of managers. Big evidence of the lack of logic in managers and a few team members. That destroys a good workplace environment.

- You may start working for the company with excitement, but soon you may start cursing your manager, imagining slapping, punching, and kicking your managers in your mind. No punishment is enough for such so-called managers.

- Books can be written on the failure of these, and it would still be difficult to explain what a failure they are at it's fullest.

- Rotten potato rots other potatoes. Worse than Corona, rotten managers spread in entire office and therefore Admiral Gurgaon stinks."

Was told when I left that I hadn’t been promoted because there were simply too many managers and seniors in the claims department- this is true and stifles development amongst claims handlers.

On several occasions I was so stressed that I had to lock myself in the toilets and cry... no support from managers and some even found it funny.

Free fruit, most of the drones here consider this a “pro” when in reality that being a pro is absolutely mediocre. Everyone seems to think this is something remarkable, hilarious to watch when you see the slaves swarming around the fruit stand as you walk in watching them all taking quadruple the portions they require before you get the chance to even get close to it. 

How is Admiral? Interested in drink and drugs culture? Crack on. Anyone with a brain cell that left this cesspit let me guess your probation is going down hill fast? all because you didn't finish that Jager bomb and attend the 90 socials down brewhouse last month despite spending your entire week grafting for a pathetic wage with the Neanderthals. Why would I want to spend my spare time with you as well, get a grip. 

If spending your entire month grafting for a absolutely pathetic wage in between being held at gunpoint to take part in “Ministry of fun” which basically forced fun, taking part in the the most cringiest tasks you could possibly imagine to then so be it, this is the job for you. 

Full of brown nosers, managers who spend their entire shift avoiding doing their job completely MIA from their desks. Dreadful systems where you have to do 10 times the work you’re being paid for on rubbish hours. Can’t even plan your life as this changes constantly.  

“Oooo we’ve got an underground car park we’re so good” yeah there’s like a 30 year waiting list for that, enjoy. 

They bang on about the shares OH THE SHARES YAY CANT WAIT FOR THAT. What? Wait 3 years to receive the pathetic shares so you can catch up on pay that better other companies are giving their employees in there good salaries. Comical. Claiming you’re a top 100 company to work at any given opportunity is just merely a complete facade. 

The CEO who people worship and brownose about him at any given opportunity (they’ve never even met him) even admitted the fact the only reason there’s an office in Cardiff is due to the fact it was cheaper labour, says it all. 

Keep on thinking you’re something you’re not, plenty of people that have moved onto better things from this tip and the reviews prove it.

Avoid like the plague, your life’s worth more than becoming a drone to appease these dregs."

The UK CEO treats people like door mats of varying qualities, your desire to do a good right the right way can only benefit you if it tows the line of middle to upper management's egos, if you think you have a better idea it's best not to mention it, you are paid to be a yes man not paid to think.

Once you finally get your shares (3-4 years later) you are on a decent wage finally","Management have their favourites who they promote to a more senior level which means that most of the time the best candidates for the position are overlooked.
Broken promises.
They go on and on about shares from the start making it out that they are yours instantly, however, you do not start receiving the share money until 3 or 4 years after employment, so to illustrate this point: even though you get letters making you believe the shares are yours from the very start, if you leave the company within 3-4 years you won't get any share money at all, the shares go straight back to the company. It's a sneaky tactic to get you to stay and once you finally get your shares it's then difficult to leave.
Some tasks and checks are completely pointless, irrelevant and a total waste of time.
All this said, many large organisations are the same really so difficult to say whether they are any worse than other companies, some staff really do love their job here and you do meet really good friends and lots of them."

416,Admiral Group,Former Employee,2017-07-04,2.0,Anonymous Employee,"Shares are offered twice a year. This is a good addition to top up the salary.
Team and Department events - Admiral do promote and support social activities.
Having Admiral on your CV can be beneficial when applying to work at other companies as other companies hold Admiral in high regard.
They are a lot of opportunities to move around and explore career options.","Inconsistent management - at times you can feel like you don't know whether you are coming or going, up or down, right or wrong. One manager can direct you to certain objectives and another will ask you why you're doing things the way you are doing them. Also, if you have a thought, gather information to support your case and then present that information to your manager you could fine yourself in your managers' bad books, but on the other hand, your manager could then the following week explain how if you got an idea, you should do some research, gather information, then present all the facts. As you can see from just these two examples you wouldn't know if you're doing right or wrong, coming or going, up or down. And these are 2 of many examples I experienced. 
Some management aren't technical and don't know their department and what the team does, therefore, when it comes to training they don't know what to training to give. When you're new to the company you can see how this can cause a problem. Managers are supposed to know how to guide and support you not ask you how they can do their job.
Shares given aren't yours until you've held them for 3 years however you do get paid dividends on them.
Salary does not have a fixed range for a role, therefore, this unsettles members of your team and can cause upset. Do not get into a conversation about salary else if your team member is paid lower than you and complains, you'll be in the managers bad books.
Your commitment to your role can easily be disregarded. Example... you leave a secure job to work at Admiral, do everything that is requested from you, hit targets, get good customer feedback, and adhered to all Admiral core competencies, then you get a small misunderstanding and they let you go leaving unemployed without a second thought. Really consider making the move to Admiral if you're already in a secure job because you could fine yourself unemployed over something small.
Favoritism by management is something I also had to experience. You could be the highest skilled team member (not saying I was) but if you're not the favorite you'll be seen as one of the lowest.
Promotes ego's - Those who declare how brilliant they are often and sucks up to manage go further. Although this is against Admiral's core competencies.
You've no support if your manages decide your face doesn't fit. If you go to peoples services (HR) just to chat and get advice, HR will report this to your manager and things become even worse. You quickly become isolated.

Advice - give leaving your current position a lot of consideration before committing to join Admiral. Not all managers are this bad but if you're unlucky and do get a manager like this, you could find yourself signing onto JSA sooner than you think even when you do everything right in your role."

In brief, I started at Admiral just after college after making to decision not to pursue higher education at university. Starting as a customer services advisor, handling phone calls and e-mails on a daily basis, it allowed me to build a great platform to start my career here. As the company then grew over the years I grew with it, moving into the management teams in Customer Services as an SCR and quickly after that into a team manager position. Within five years of joining I was at team management level. This is where I have remained. However, as a team manager the opportunities have not stopped. I was recognised for my work and offered a position as Team Manager of a specialised area on the Customer Experience Team, soon after that a Lead Trainers position in the UK, managing our Swansea and Cardiff teams and most recently I have just returned from New Delhi as a seconded operations manager covering, running our offshore operation. 
As you can see opportunity after opportunity.

I left school after completing my GCSEs, as I was uncertain on what I wanted to do and wasn’t ready to commit to picking a degree which would decide my career path. 

I decided to apply for Admiral, as I heard it was a good company to work for and I thought it would be a good company to gain experience in. 

My timeline is as follows: 
Customer Service Consultant (call centre) for 11 months
Payroll Cashier for 2 months (gaining admin experience)
My current position in Recruitment for 6 months in counting (doing administration for MBA recruitment)

This shows how great Admiral can be for development. As long as you have a good attitude and you work hard, then you will progress. I am so happy to be working for Admiral, and can honestly say that I hope to retire here.

The support you have is incredible. All of my managers have been amazing - always happy to help, they want to listen to you, will reward you for good work etc. My favourite part about working for Admiral is working with the people around me. We really have the best people working here, everyone is friendly and happy to help each other.

I have worked here from the age of 19 I'm now 36! Starting on the phone in the Sales department and have had the opportunity to progress my career into management at my own pace. This has allowed me to work part time when my children were young then as they grew up I was able to focus more on my career advancement. Throughout my time here I have been supported 100% of the way. The management here really do recognise excellent work so if you're prepared to work hard and go the extra mile you will be rewarded.,The salaries in the call centre are not great but there is always opportunity to earn more through overtime and the share scheme. I feel that Admiral most definitely rewards those who are loyal. As mentioned above starting in the call centre gives you a great foundation to start working your way up.
449,Admiral Group,Review of Admiral's recruitment department,2016-07-27,5.0,Intern,"-Friendly working environment.
-Desk policy allows managers to work amongst their staff.
-Large number of experts who give good advice and help interns.
-Lots of support when starting work.
-Pool tables and table tennis tables for staff on their lunch breaks and breaks.
-Comfortable working atmosphere.
-Free fruit available for all staff.","-The lifts can be difficult to master for beginners as destination must be chosen from outside the lift. This can be catastrophic if you enter a lift that is going to a different floor than the one you intended on visiting.
-Unclear menu in the canteen."

451,Admiral Group,A great place to work with lots of opportunities,2016-07-27,5.0,Supplier Manager,"I started working at Admiral almost 7 years ago. When I started at Admiral I worked in the call centre. One of the things that has impressed me most about working for Admiral is the ability to try new things and to learn new skills. The company has been very supportive in helping me progress and build a great career. Since working in the call centre I joined recruitment where I progressed to Lead Recruitment Officer. I then had the chance to move to Investor Relations and recently moved to Telematics where I work as a supplier manager. As well as providing me with the skills required to develop and progress within the company, there are a whole host of different benefits available to staff.",When I initially joined the company I worked in an entry-level job in the call centre and therefore my salary was relatively low. The opportunity for progression coupled with the share scheme mean if you're prepared to work hard you will have the opportunity to move up in the company.

Free fruit is a nice option.,"The remuneration is very poor. You would think an organization like this would have genuine opportunities.  Progression is  difficult due to lack of opportunity.  There are titles available to make people think they have been promoted or are superior to others but this is just a management trick to create the illusion of progression.  Training and development is lacking and therefore the customer is the main victim as they receive a substandard service.

Management here is arrogant and contemptuous.  There is also a culture of blatant discrimination. 

The majority of people who work here are duplicitous, to put it politely.  

The ""benefits"" are only benefits if you have use for them, for example not many people need 10% off in a sandwich shop!  Shares only have a use if you give up long periods of your life to the company as they are controlled by HMRC rules. 

I would suggest this company as a last resort stepping stone into something more appropriate."

Also, IF you're the sort of person who enjoys going out every night, spending all your (tiny tiny) pay check on alcohol and have no real desire to move beyond this lifestyle ever - then you'll love this place.","EXPECT
- low wages for long hours which can change the day before you're meant to do them
- so low they actually give free breakfast towards the end of the month because they know none of their employees can likely afford to eat by then.
- micromanagement of every activity to the millisecond. Need the loo, recorded. Cup of tea? recorded. Put the customer on hold to ensure a good job, also recorded and sanctioned. If you do any of those things your pay suffers. Seriously.
- they say you get bonuses, but they'll fix it so you can't. Those sanctions I mentioned... this is what I'm talking about. Unless you have a perfect score (so no going to the loo, no tea and no looking after your customers!, no calls lasting longer than 6 mins even if the caller has a problem which requires it, answering calls immediately to the millisecond - if they drop the call that's your fault too) - you might get something small in theory. In reality since the above is impossible you won't get anything - but then they'll tell you it's your fault.
- the company to assume you're trying to do a bad job and treat you accordingly. But they will TELL you they're treating you nice, and give you chocolate. And expect you to love them for it - which actually works on some people.
- to have your meagre wages docked for reasons you can't control or appeal. Somebody else mail the customer docs out to the wrong address? Even though you told them the opposite? Your fault. Lose pay. 
- to foster depression and a low sense of self-esteem


DO NOT EXPECT
- any sort of joy coming into work. It is no exaggeration to say EVERYBODYS motivation is to ""get off the phones"" because of what a soulless job that is - but there is very very little chance of doing that. 
- to be promoted, especially for your skills. Unless your face fits, or you go out every night with the relevant team managers and lose all those meagre wages
- to be rewarded for looking after your customers. You are far more likely to get docked. 
- to be treated with respect, by anybody.

TLDR: admiral treats its employees like it treats its customers, saying they're doing something nice while punching them in the face"

476,Admiral Group,A Negative Experience,2015-10-07,1.0,Graduate Trainee,"Loose Work Culture, Working Hours","So, in essence, you need to ask yourself whether you belong at Admiral Group or not. They do not hire top talent because they are not given the money for it, and you need to be very careful about going someplace you will not fit in. Unfortunately, this was my tale. I wanted to write a very acerbic review, and I certainly had the material for it, but at the end of the day, I realized that I parted ways with the organisation at my discretion, because we were not compatible with each other. I am a very energetic, hard-working individual who is extremely well qualified, and who seeks qualifications and improvements wherever they exist (that is not hyperbole, that is fact). As Admiral does not hire top talent, I was not able to communicate effectively with anyone and felt extraordinarily out of place at the organisation. People began acting ugly around me because they could not match my productivity or the pride I took in my work, and attempted to force me out and/or lower my standing via rumours, running gags, jokes at my expense, so on and so forth (and believe me when I say that I have enough incidents I could repeat here to get a few people fired). I want to be nice here and be very careful to say that I don't blame the people that work in this organisation, because I do not hold ill-will for them, but you, the reader, need to be very mindful of what is likely to happen if you're one type of person in a very different type of environment.

Off of my soapbox, the organisation has a disingenuous practice of paying their employees very little, and then pushing the idea of a happy workplace that everybody seems to have bought into. Its nonsense. They compensate poor pay with throwaway gestures like free fruit, and gym membership, while they rack the savings into their annual profit figures. I don't want to use strong terms like this, but the company is organised like a sweatshop - a good-looking sweatshop, but a sweatshop nevertheless. The building is completely open-plan, with the bosses sat right by their teams, and their bosses watching right behind them, like overseers in factories. They spin this as something that fosters good communication, which it may well do, but I suspect what it's really about is keeping an eye on the employees. It's an almost creepy feeling you get talking to some of the employees - everybody feels underpaid, nobody wants to be there (not really), but everybody seems happy, like they've been brainwashed into thinking that way, because they've been given free fruit every single workday and their manager is right by their side to remind them of this fact in case anybody acts up. I don't know, there's certainly something to be said as to the quality of the facilities, but Admiral doesn't invest in its people, and its a point that's always brought up but nothing's done about it, as though its a part of the plan. They roll out food for people at the end of the month because the implication is that they've spent all of their money. If the employees were paid properly, first, there wouldn't be the money to give out food, and secondly, they would in theory then have the money to feed themselves at the end of the month.

For a company that says how much of a people business it is, it sure sounds like it's trying to compensate for something. I think that thing might be employee pay, and I think that's why they say that they're a people-driven business to begin with."

For what is comparatively low wages the management expect miracles. I was with the Admiral Group for 3 years and in my last year before I left i joined the legal arm of the company called Admiral Law which was recently set up. Admiral Law has an incredibly high number of people leaving the company for a number of reasons. The work load was just far too high because people were leaving faster than they could recruit. Management are out of touch. Considering people were working as hard as they could management treated the employees very badly which demotivated staff because you were never considered to be good enough. I left because i was tired at the way i was being treated with my confidence at an all time low.
