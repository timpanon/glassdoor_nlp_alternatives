4,,"Great for Experience, Non-competitive Comp",2022-04-05,3.0,Product Manager,"AB will give someone with little to no experience the opportunity to develop and grow their skillset. Mentorship programs and skill workshops abound.
Perfect for interns and new graduates needing to cut their teeth.

High performers are recognized and have visibility with senior leadership.

Good benefits and 401k

Hybrid work schedule (for some departments)

Great in-office amenities

WFH equipment

Promotes internal mobility","Compensation unfortunately will not grow commensurate with performance abilities, title, responsibilities, experience, or market. There is a lot of bureaucracy (i.e. meaningless and arbitrary rules and roadblocks) surrounding comp, that does not apply equally to all employees.

Many employees have left the firm and returned in order to get their desired title and salary."
5,,Great Place to Start,2022-04-05,3.0,Assistant Vice President,Good opportunities to grow because...,"... pay is horrible and they can't keep anybody once they gain experience.

8,,"Decent place to start if you're just out of college, have no other options, and a pandemic just broke out",2022-03-22,3.0,Video Editor/Producer,"flexible work from home (3 days in, 2 days remote)

very focused in contributing to LGBTQIA+, Black Lives Matter, and women movements + directly supporting those very workers in the business. It's actually pretty surprising how forward-thinking AllianceBernstein is in that regard, given they work in private portfolio management, stock trading, and investing. Certainly, a safe place to work at least. 

Long periods of doing absolutely nothing.","Did I say long periods of doing absolutely nothing was just a pro? It certainly applies here too. 

Pretty small team meaning everyone is stretched thin. 

White-glove service for very, extremely basic AV set-ups. Most of the time, it's just turning on the lights and testing the equipment.

Last-minute meetings are the norm here. Most of the clients and advisors tend to schedule events/updates 15 minutes before it is set to start. If you're lucky, they'll email you an hour beforehand. 

You'll spend a lot of time coming up with solutions only to find out we don't have access to a certain piece of tech. 

You'll also spend plenty of overtime since many clients like to have meetings running past 7 pm. It's also expected you're in by 7 am so... 

Expect to work 12+ hour shifts and be informed of such either the day prior or day of. Especially if someone on the team calls out. 

Technology is over 20 years old. Most of the focus is on the brand new Nashville office as the New York office is no longer the HQ. 

Coworkers are friendly but no one really talks to one another outside of meetings. the general age here is roughly 35-50 so if you're any younger, it will feel pretty lonely. The younger 25-30 workers are mostly the financial advisors so if you're working in AV or IT, you won't be interacting with them outside of a professional level. 

Also, you will be working out of a converted storage room with no windows. 

No formal training is given either. It is very much ""learn as you go""."

Fun, social, workplace culture with lots of young people (because of the extremely high turnover!)","Below market salaries and bonuses. 
A lot of talk about developing junior employees and retaining talent but little action. 
EXTREMELY HIGH TURNOVER. Especially during COVID. So many bright employees constantly leaving the firm - almost crisis-like. 
No upward mobility within Private Wealth Management - almost seems like they WANT top talent employees to leave. 
Lots of talk about the importance of DEI but little action from management and lots of diverse talent FLED the firm while I was there.
Associate and coordinator responsibilities are extremely mundane and soul-crushing. Requiring no creativity or strategic decision making. You will rarely be invited to client meetings or to share in the ""pie"" of the profits the folks you are supporting are making. 
Bosses who tell inappropriate and occasionally racist jokes but preface it with ""I know we value DEI here but..."""
25,,Not a great place to work,2022-02-10,1.0,Private Wealth Associate,"co-workers were young and cool, a lot of autonomy","you have to do a 6 month ""training"" program that is basically just forcing you to watch videos and do practice work that isn't helpful, in addition to your normal work (where you are just thrown into the fire). if you want to move up in the company, you have to go into their leadership development program, which isn't paid, and is essentially more work for no extra money."

27,,Great place to start career in technology,2022-02-06,4.0,Top Associate,"If you are lucky enough to land a Tech and Ops (TOP) Associate position at AB, you'll be exposed to multiple disciplines and be given very satisfactory mentor / leadership throughout the duration of your contract. AB is clearly trying to bring in young talent to build up the organization, going hand-in-hand with the recent headquarters move from NY to Nashville, TN. 

TOP associates will be asked to perform real high-impact work and will be evaluated with high expectations. In my personal experience, this is not overwhelming as middle management is willing to mentor and be of assistance when time allows. 

After a 2-year rotational program TOP associates are inducted into a full-time role with the firm (if their performance merits, which it usually will). The placement depends on firm needs and employee performance during their 2-year rotational stint. 

Altogether an overall high-expectation work environment, generally corporate if somewhat laid-back atmosphere, and good place to start a career in tech & ops out of college.","Somewhat high expectations for the medium pay.


Lack of work-from-home flexibility. Recent move to '3-in person, 2-from home' was begrudged, with hints that in the future the company may move back to 5 in-person per week, irrespective of department or ability to fulfill a role remotely."

Hybrid schedule: 3 days in the office, 2 at home. They were good to us during COVID. Tried their hardest to make sure everyone was dealing okay mentally. Lots of check ins and adjustments.","Depends on the FA team you get put on. Some are better to work for than others. Some give personal bonuses that are awesome and others give you like a $50 gift card. Volume is high regardless of the team because you’re almost constantly understaffed due to turnover. They’re trying to fix it by raising salaries for senior associates because after that 3-4 year mark, everyone would leave for higher salary elsewhere. Bernstein rewards those who stay but you have to stick it out. They’ve promised to be more transparent with salaries and bonuses at the associate level but they haven’t put out any kind of chart or specific range so while they’ve preached transparency, it was only lightly mentioned and dances around during YE conversations. And then they tell you your salary is confidential and you’re not allowed to discuss with other associates. But this is 2022 so we’re not gatekeeping that information anymore."

It completely rebuilt from almost death experience in 2008-2009 and was doing quite well until ill-advised decision to move to Nashville.","The move proved to be completely stupid idea, as it didn't save any money but instead pushed out a great number of talented and experienced employees.

AB was forced to dramatically lower its standards and hire a lot of unqualified people for open Nashville positions.

Even that proved to be insufficient and turnover spiked dramatically recently in both Nashville and NYC.

59,,DONT DO IT.,2021-10-27,1.0,Analyst,Every “pro” I used to see here is long gone.,"Zero flexibility for return to office, we will be required to return to the office even though it is very clear almost none of the employees want to. Special situations are not taken into account. Our RTO plan has been confusing to say the least and the attitude of senior leaders about this has been beyond condescending. 

Every employee I know is beyond burnt out and overworked. This company is so happy to take advantage of fresh talent and to squeeze you dry. In San Antonio, there is no opportunity for internal mobility. They will tell you there is, it is a trap. The teams are small, and if you want to work in anything outside of operations, making that jump into any of the other offices/SBUs is so discouraged because they can’t keep any talent in San Antonio. They will hold you back as much as possible to keep you from leaving. Promotions almost never happen, and they will hold back your development, too, so you feel stuck. 

We no longer receive regular career coaching or training, or have time to focus on development. It is constantly just being pushed to function at your maximum capacity, every single day, while your team is running on a skeleton crew. They will also track your activity/production numbers and micromanage you so heavily that it makes it difficult to ask your job. 

Our pay is below industry average, and I often hear about large discrepancies in what each team member is making that does not seem merited. Our “bonuses” and “raises” do not meet inflation. Our benefits are not great, and our 401k matching is flat out bad. 

The benefits I used to feel from working at AB largely came from the culture, but I have recently realized that the culture here is so toxic, and I truly do not believe they want what is actually best for employees. If you raise any concerns, they are not met openly."

Advisors abuse associates, they are overworked to the breaking point and blamed for errors that happen after working 70 hours weeks and killing themselves for the job.

There are many opportunities to get involved in the company- you develop relationships with people who you don’t always work with. 

My experience with management has been positive. If you show that you work hard and work with others - you should have no problem finding success.","The firm has made an effort to increase internal mobility but it needs to promote it more. We lose a lot of talent through this.

During my time there, I knew colleagues who left the firm and returned, telling horror stories of toxic culture at other firms. After the corporate relocation, I had my own short stint at a toxic work environment and it made me appreciate even more deeply the overall positive and effective work environment that I got to experience at AB.","As you might expect, the transition to Nashville created a more negative work environment for those that couldn't or didn't want to move.

Role overlapping for over a year.

HR is completely incompetent: told me the wrong bonus at hire,  told me the incorrect amount of vacation days at hire, consistently doesn't respond to emails.

Technologically they're stuck in the early 2000s. They like to throw around a ton of buzz words, but fail to execute on any of them. They do not care for quality of life for many of their development staff and expect way too much, when they provide less than adequate career support.

Extremely awkward time to be at the firm. Further, people who could not commit to go to Nashville are essentially being tossed to the side.

The morale is about as bad as it could get. Senior management is incompetent and seems only to care about their own payouts (see 8-K filings).

I was in Private Wealth Management in New York City, and I can say with absolute certainty that the location and department has a sexism problem. Qualified, registered, passionate women are frequently held back and not promoted over their less experienced/less qualified male counterparts. I'm not sure if this sexism is rooted in an issue with the financial advisers or with management, but almost every woman I know who has left the company would agree that sexism is rampant and real in this department. Centralized Human Resources needs to be aware of this issue and open a formal investigation.  I wouldn't be surprised to see a lawsuit arise in the next few years if things don't change.

This meant that I joined a team that was already down one member, and they had no time to train/answer questions. Although the company does have you complete an official training period, it really is not that helpful to the day-to-day work; it was more about working your way through a binder of facts.

I would describe the culture of the office as generally toxic. The associates and admin teams were stretched too thin, and it was not uncommon for them to disappear to the restrooms, only to have them return puffy-eyed from crying.

Instead, I'm one of a handful of folks in my 900 person business school class still at their same job (almost nine years after graduation).

From a client perspective, it's a great firm to manage clients' assets. The intellectual capital at this place knows no bounds – the portfolio managers/investors/advisors I’ve met over the years are intelligent, sophisticated and have the highest degree of integrity. Within my office and across offices around the country, there’s encouraged collaboration (which is somewhat of a rarity in private wealth management). 

From a personal perspective, as a working mother, I have felt the support of a firm who is willing to accommodate me during two difficult pregnancies and maternity leaves.

If you have a modicum of industry experience, you will be asked to leave it at the door in favor of the Bernstein way.  Your MD will secretly be in internal conference calls, your colleagues will steal your business and and your every move will be monitored.  Your training will help you make excuses for why performance is awful, and you will continually hear how active management is in its way back.

The associate turn over rate is pretty high and that makes keeping a steady work flow pace pretty hard. New associates take a long time to bring up to speed."

The culture is terrible. Nobody builds relationships to try and work together to solve problems.

Never go to HR if you have a problem with management because they will always side with the manager no matter what. HR is also not honest.

You can be in the same organization, but not have to abide by the same culture rules. Examples: Working from home is either banned or used up to 4 days a week all depending on a manager. There's no consistency.

Convenient cafeteria

Name looks good on resume","No structure in group for advancement; it's who brown noses the most. Movement to investment groups for those seeking is nigh impossible. 

There is no diversity within the group, it's literally the Greenwich, CT lacrosse team

Client Group has a tough time retaining talent due to very poor compensation and the     fact that most roles within the group are tremendously boring

Most managers in the group are there due to it being a progression of their career, not because they are actually good managers of people. For a first job, this can be very detrimental to growth

Entire group is tremendously top heavy. Because of this, there's no commitment to education or advancement of those at the associate level. Everyone in a senior position in the group has been at the firm for 10+ years, is buddy-buddy, and is paid at pre-financial crisis levels i.e. junior staff are horribly under compensated for their contributions

To those looking into the rotation program, be very wary, as an outsider looking in, the program is just a means to exploit young, talented workers and underpay/under support them every step of the way. Every other rotational program at AB blows them out of the water."

When you are interviewing (you get interviewd by 3 to 5 people which is crazy to me) they will try to sell you on what a great opportunity it is and the amount you will learn and grow. It's not true. It's a gloomy place with a lot of unhappy people. It's just operations so there's not a lot to learn from as far as Finance goes. The systems are painfully old, slow, and worthless.

The place is large enough to do big things, but small enough that an individual can make an impact.  The new CEO, Peter Kraus, after a rough introduction in the worst of times, has truly made a positive impact (this from someone who was quite skeptical about him at the beginning).  There appears to be an honest attempt at the top to make the company a good one at which to work.","Management shows complete indifference to workers (except in the money).  There is no concept of protection of work life balance, no attempt to facilitate (or worse, not even a passing interest in) my professional growth or the growth of people like me.

Some of their capabilities, especially in research and analytics, were superior to their competitors. 
Both business and IT had talented individuals who moved on to successful careers elsewhere.","The environment in the last few years has been one of relentless cost cutting. Many of their best people have moved on. Surviving employees have no sense of direction and purpose, and feel they are treated as appliances.

Bonuses have been slashed severely and show no sign of improvement even after the recovery.

Management has changed direction repeatedly with no accountability for failure. For example -
1. There was an expensive project to outsource most of Operations. This was abandoned after several years and many employees had to switch jobs from AB  to the outsourcing vendor and back again. 
2. Similarly, IT employees were relocated to White Plains which was an impossible commute for residents of NJ. The rationale was that the NY office space would be sub-leased to generate rental income,. After a couple of years, this project was also abandoned and the employees were moved back to NY.
3. IT management decided to start a captive offshore arm called AB Solution Center. The rationale here was that by eliminating the consulting middleman, they would be able to hire much higher quality resources who could replace onshore staff. This project also failed - AB did not have the scale to start their own operation, so they reached an understanding with AXA India. Instead of paying more, AXA started subcontracting to the same consulting firms who had been eliminated, but paying even lower rates to preserve their own margin. IT teams spent many months trying to get it to work, but gave up one by one. Of course, this did not save any of the staff who had been marked for elimination."

One or two are probably of average intelligence, which is pretty dumb by New York banking standards.  Simple tasks require extensive explanations, and even then they have difficulty.  There is hardly any career development.  The firm offers some training, but it's quite limited.  No career path is outlined, not just for me but for anyone I've talked to.  My boss lies somewhat often, but his boss seems honest as far as I can tell.  It takes forever for projects to be completed, mostly because IT has low standing and investment managers can't bother to approve our work, even if they need it.

The environment is fractured and not collaborative and very unfriendly toward new hires. There are few advancement opportunities with the exception of the few who brown nose and get advancement, promotions and salary increases by having friends in high places.

It is a typical nine to five job without too much stress.",You are poorly compensated at Alliancebernstein. Many people leave this company to go to other companies which pay much more.
685,,Good Stepping Stone,2012-05-10,3.0,Client Relationship Associate,As a small to mid company you have hands on training. A lot of learning and enhancements of skills throughout the way.,"The workplace can become stagnate and you can only go so far. To advance into a managerial position, it takes a lot of years and a lot of patience."

The company has not availed of the recent market upswing to the best of their strengths.
It seems that they have lost their edge in research."
687,,Company that turned from a top money manager into a sinking ship.,2012-04-29,1.0,Associate Portfolio Manager,"1) Reasonable work/life balance: job hours are usually 8:30 to 5:30 with a full one hour lunch break  when work permits
2) Cafeteria: cafeteria on 21st floor  in the building is the only place that is innovative, efficient and well-managed","1) Incompetent management
2) Low morale: 90% of employees in the PMG department are looking for another job
3) Favoritism towards certain employees
4) Vicious circle of low comp packages --> demotivated employees --> bad portfolios performance  --> low profitability --> low comp packages"
688,,It's been a good run but opportunity and growth is gone.,2012-04-29,3.0,,"more casual, laid back, coworkers become friends","stuck in your role. if you want something else, have to leave company."
689,,Once upon a time it was a brilliant place to work.,2012-04-26,4.0,,"Great (London) location, lovely office space (for now), one or two great people managers and lots of very smart, collaborative and frienldy colleagues who share knowledge pretty well.  It's a small enough company not to have the glaring fiefdoms and politics you can find in larger organisations.
A good place to work if your department is generating revenue (i.e. fixed income).  Not so good if you are a cost centre, whatever value you may add.","Endless, relentless downsizing, aka redundancies.  Cost reduction is king at the moment, but to be fair, if you're one of the lucky ones that are still there then the quality of life (apart from more work to go around fewer people) is still pretty good.  All depends where you work.
Not much money being spent on innovation (especially technology) - much more focussed on getting rid of wasted expense, of which there was plenty in the boom years."
690,,"Stable but behind the curve, too slow to react to this ever changing business.",2012-04-26,2.0,Research Analyst,"Great work life balance, benefits are good, cafeteria is good.  A rich history, though there has been drift since 2009.",Inability to adapt to the changing environment has resulted in diminished opportunity and pay.  It is also very difficult to advance and usually promote from outisde.
691,,Great learning experience for someone out of college,2012-03-30,2.0,,Gain wide array of knowledge and work with competent staff,Pay is below industry standards and management structure is very top heavy.  There is no room for growth or advancement

693,,Not what it used to be,2012-03-14,2.0,Quantitative Analyst,"Great cafeteria, good benefits, some pockets of extremely bright and collaborative people, especially the (dwingling number of) long-time folks who understand the company history and care deeply about the organization and clients.","Sadly, the company is simply not what it once was in large part due to the departure - some voluntary but often not - of tenured staff.  The prior collaborative environment, most similar to academia in terms of intellectual curiosity and drive for well thought-out decisions to serve the clients best, has been subsumed by individual competitive drive to (1) keep one's own job and (2) sell products that seem to be popular, regardless of sensibility.  Praise and recognition for work is increasingly taken by managers, not those actually doing the work."
694,,Extremely Disappointing,2012-03-09,1.0,Senior Vice President,"- Nice cafeteria
- A few very smart, competent people remain who are more than willing to educate and develop others.  They tend to be second- and third-tier people within the organization, rather than senior management","- Culture has changed over the past three years from being client-focused to being a ""me"" culture where employees only do what they THINK they will get paid for, with little guarantee of that actually happening
- Compensation is deeply below market with most of it seeming to stay at the ""C"" level
-  Few experienced resources left which cripples any effort to produce a good product and respectable client service
- Corporate strategy is completely opaque which feeds continued anxiety about the future of the firm, its clients and its employees
- Product development is always playing catch-up a little too late"

Everyone wants the company and their colleagues to succeed.",Constant layoffs have made it a dismal environment to work in.  Employees (and the public) have been waiting for a company turnaround for years and it just doesn't seem like it's going to happen.  Communication from executive management is very poor.

Great location in midtown Manhattan
State of the art cafeteria
Interaction with some very intelligent and hard working people","Compensation is below industry standards

Low morale due to constant layoffs"

-For a junior person, you are able to learn alot about the industry and gain some meaningful exposure to the financial industry","-Little to no growth opportunities unless it's a lateral move
-Compensation is well below market
-Recognition is only given to those ""superstars"" within the firm
-Cost cutting is very apparent, so much so that most employees are still thinking, ""So, who's next on the block?"""

Day-to-day interactions are generally quite good. Innovative investment strategies are being developed but it doesn't always seem like they're implemented.","Rather like being a well-paid orc in Mordor -- you may like your fellow orcs, but there's a pervasive sense of doom and a sense that as far as the top management is concerned, you're cannon fodder. It's gets a bit futile after a while."

* No pay increase and very limited bonuses in recent years, company under pressure to continue to cut cost
* No growth for junior people unless come back from B-School
* Promotion mostly political
* Management conservative on implementing new strategies and just watch asset bleed
* Too many old guards occupying top level posts and no upward mobility for talented younger people
* After 2 years there's nothing more to learn and your skills starts to get old
* Management doesn't have a clear strategy to revive the franchise
* Management says one thing and does another, communicate convoluted messages
* Endless employee and performance reviews just provide a justification to pay no bonuses and lay off people"
