Flat structure and the possibility of RIFs only when there is change of strategy. The current policy is focused in promoting women into management roles. The broken processes and procedures give top talent an opportunity to provide value to the organization but wait and read the cons below first before making a judgement call.","Culture is political and because of a flat org structure promotions are also political. The best person doesn’t necessarily get the promotion and teams are lead by status quo and mediocre individuals. Middle management, such as “Head” roles, are occupied by individuals who lack integrity, ability, and people management skills. They drive their top talent out. Annual assessments follow the same approach and don’t necessarily reflect reality, one sided and the house is not held responsible. A lot of finger pointing and nonsense that I witnessed across the different departments. Where is HR, some ask, no where (paper pushers). On top of this horrible culture then you have the broken processes and procedures that drive staff to the brim of insanity. Failures since 2011 with the global implementation of an outdated middle office system that no one was happy with. This place is not good for morale and management from the top to the bogus middle management is a big contributor to it all. Just look at their large list of open roles, those roles are not new but vacated by people who had enough."

Company is completely disorganized and chaotic. Everyone just does their own thing, their own way, like in the wild west. Claims has zero structure and segmentation. You will handle everything from the 15K PD claim to NY Labor Law to an amputation to construction defect, regardless or your experience or training or what your job description actually was when you interviewed. 
Management is very sissified and ineffectual. I have seen more spine in jellyfish. IT is a disaster with no accountability. HR is downright rude and unhelpful. Communication to the rank and file is non existent. Favoritism is very much present and they don't even try to hide it. They have no diversity and they do not hire from the outside unless it's for a lower level job. Expect to never get promoted unless you have been working there for decades and are part of the clique. Management is constantly ""reviewing"" and ""discussing"" but there is zero action taken. They made a huge deal about the new and improved Allianz but kept the exact same management and practices, ultimately changing nothing. Motto is ""this is how we've always done it"". Culture is awful. It is not surprising there is currently a mass exodus. They have a long way to go."

support during pandemic","Humble request to management - there were talks of flexible/hybrid working model during pandemic last year. But there is no news about that. It was also not a good feeling when management asked those willing can come to office ( though no one was forced). After many years I was able to be with my family for a long time. Office was about 400/500 km away from my home. so even travelling on weekends and going back on monday was a pain. Though there is some 30days of wfh , if an employee was availing it was being looked down. Very humble request to trust us. there was no dip in productivity during wfh. Though I am in my home town , I am still paying the rent because there has been no official date communicated yet. At least give a date till 2022 like many companies did.Allianz always took bold and industry first moves. Humble request to management to give a date attest till 2022 and after that please introduce hybrid working model where in an employee can work from office for 2/3 days and remaining days from home. Please don't leave this policy with approval of LM/line manager as if this is an option then they might not show that flexibility to give approvals. Please make it mandatory. With folded hands , It's a humble request ."

807,,At risk of becoming the titanic,2021-05-28,3.0,Underwriter,"Strong technical development on underwriting, policy wordings, trades, industries and other insurance concepts. I have worked at multiple different insurance organisations and this is some of the best training I have received.
You will be given a high degree of responsibility, dealing with a range of broker accounts, products and tasks from day one. If you want to become an underwriter this is a good place to start. 
Pre-covid, there was regular social activities both internally and externally with the wider insurance market. I am sure this will eventually come back. 
Staff are friendly and easy to work with. 
The board and senior management provide regular updates on company strategy via meetings and email. 
Discounts on gym membership, retail and a range of other things. 
The company supports national charities and you will be able to participate in thier fund raising activities and events.
The business is flexible on your life circumstances and you can work from home.","From the beginning of the covid pandemic, the organisation and running of the business has appeared to take a turn. The company has been under resourced for so long, morale has taken a huge dip and any staff that are left are burnt out. 
Staff turnover is high meaning as an underwriter, you will be spending a portion of your time training and retraining new employees. The company does not really look after thier existing staff in the way of reward and recognition, meaning the most experienced underwriters move on after a few years leaving the juniors to run the shop. This is counterproductive to moral because the juniors come in with little insurance experience and so this hurts both the existing staff who have to keep picking up the pieces and the new staff who are overwhelmed by the basics. Graduates come into the business on more money than non graduates for the same role which is also demotivating to some of the junior to mid level underwriters.
Expect to work very hard in return for very little pay and annual bonus. Allianz is such a large company you will be viewed as another number at the end of the day. 
Underwriters are left to manage thier own weeks, but when you raise issues with management they come up with excuses and don't do anything about it. I think they mean well but there's definitely some communication issues between teams.
Moving to full online trading and management has wrecked the core fabric of the team. 
Underwriting strategy is out of step with the rest of the market and can be challenging to execute long-term.
Pay does not increase with experience. 
Managers seem to care more about numbers and how it reflects on them, rather than the sustained impact on thier staff."

The tech in place now is old but billions of dollars are being spent to update it. Everything is changing to make it an up-to-date and attractive employer.

They are great with their D&I stuff. I worked in a major insurance brokerage previously and they said a lot of words but did not walk the talk. In Allianz, they really believe and act it.","Dealing with out of date tech now! Aaargh!

- lack of professionalism (no code reviews, no version control, data input files get lost, and no-one cares... [it is acknowledged that the status quo is problematic, but no-one has the guts to do something about it])
- Working students are treated like ghosts (never got formally introduced to the line manager, spoke to him briefly after one year; did many analyses and crafted many emails to him in that year with my name underneath, but never was involved in any oral discussions). Interns have it slightly better...
- Pay is low (""We pay in experience, not in money""... if only...)
- Colleagues know their business stuff well, but usually understanding is not too deep. Regarding statistical methodology and programming skills, I have experienced nothing but amateurism.
- Slogan says ""Home of those who dare"". If you try this in reality, you will not be rewarded. Allianz is a very rigid dinosaur, ideas and out-of-the-box thinking are not welcome. What matters is only ""what story we tell"", ""how we sell this point"" (note that this is about group risk, not a marketing department).

+ Central offices on the AZ HQ block, with direct access to the AZ canteen as well as many nice restaurants in the Maxvorstadt neighborhood
+ Back-office functions (Finance, Compliance) directly on-site and kindly helpful despite the pressure on them
+ Use of strategic consulting services of McKinsey & Company, given top AZ management being from McK and need for external intelligence; however, deep reluctance of AZX staff to cooperate with McK staff","- The calibre of employees is very low for an investing vehicle, and fallaciously stated on communications materials (e.g., website, pitchbooks)/over-exaggerated on AZX website/LinkedIn (e.g. the CFO pretends to have worked at investment bank ""Robertson Stephens"", whereas Google shows the latter as a wealth management firm
- No access to either the Allianz trade union or corporate advantages - the entity is standalone, so outside of the very advantageous Allianz Deutschland framework
- There is a pervasively toxic and conservative culture, whereby strong pressure from the CEO, ongoing fear climate throughout the teams and heavy-lifting to tame people taking initiatives instead of simply executing 
- Be careful upon joining: extremely high turnover, with almost half of staff having left during 2020 and probation periods used as a way to whimsically adjust FTE numbers (before financial reporting deadlines or to find cheaper staff on the market)
- Pay not in line with market standards, especially stated bonus potential not materialising year after year
- Very little upward mobility potential, with personnel either quickly moving to another Allianz organisational entity or leaving the AZ group to a real VC fund (e.g. Early Bird)
- Potential investee companies looking for funding are not treated with respect - they would not get a response or mocked when presenting to the AZX (almost all dealflow is inbound from AZ Board of Directors to please the latter)"

You may find (as i do) that you have ample more experience than other colleagues who are on higher wages simply because they had a 'little' bit of prior experience. But when a new joiner starts 2k above you after you have been for the company for 2 years, simply because of a summer internship... you have to question where the fairness is.

Salaries are hard to grow but overall if you negotiate very hard you can get a fair compensation (nothing spectacular),"It is a highly political company, where meritocracy which used to be one of the motto comes second. There is a plan to promote a certain amount of women over a defined period which is also embedded in the targets of the management, this means men are highly discriminated and promotions are given to friends of friends or for diversity reason. Many good people have left the organisation which leaves you with a ""lemon market"" as poor people are promoted and good people leave. I definitely do not recommend the company. This is also bad for women as promoting a woman just to have a quota gives the impression that none of them are actually promoted because they are good at what their doing.

The place is a mess and nothing will change until they fix management. This was by far one of the worst and unprofessional places I have ever worked. To move up, you need to know people in different places. This place does not care how many hours you put into it or how hard you work. So much for a bonus too, no salary increase either.

1696,,Allianz Pune. Honest Review!,2019-07-25,1.0,Systems Analyst,None i can recall of,"You are lucky if you are reading this before joining or still in training period.
01.Worked full time as developer
02. There is no process here . When you join they will keep you waiting for all the necessary access you require,VD ,work environment setup etc for 2-3 months so that you don't realize how  bad this company is as soon as you join.Smart guys leave when their NP is still 1 month.
After 2-3 months starts the Mindless video conferences, countless meetings - for no reason at all, nothing purposeful is discussed or achieved - ever. 
03.Full on politics goes here.It does not matter how good your work is,but if you know how to do politics and know how to lick managers at right place this is the best place.But all managers already have their favorites so for new people no scope for that also.
04.All the major,good projects have closed and existing ones are about to close.I hope they don't shut down this center.But looking at the state of management and quality of work it is better to do so.
05.Technology wise there is nothing to learn.They have a very old product(based on Core JAVA only).So if you wanna ruin your career join here.This is true for BA,java an host developer.
06.The senior management is all  from Kerala office.So they keep all the good opportunities for themselves and allocate all the broom work to us.So it is literally like you are working for them.So join here if you have no self respect,then you will do good here.
07. All they want is to increase head count for billing purposes. So that they can milk whatever they can from their parent  Global office. 
08. For  Kerala guys this is like government job,some of them are here for past 10-12 years.They lick the cherry  of every project and then leave it for us.
09. No one wants to work here.They are here only because of this reason even  if they pay them less as per market standard.So the company is full of dumb people with full on attitude.They don't have the etiquette to work  or talk professionally.On the floor you can see the manager shouting at his team and team members fighting with each other doing blame game.Worst work culture you can find here.BA blames tester,tester blames developer and poor developer can only blame his stars.
10.There have been cases when manager gives special favors(onsite) etc  to someone in return of some special favors. My manager used to text me at night and this happened with other friends of mine too.
11.HR is the worst here.They do not know how to do their Job. They will never solve your problem.Never expect anything from them."

Training is very minimal. I enjoyed then first leader - they brought back one from the Toronto office and she was a nightmare. We worked right by our supervisor and could hear her talking down to him and snap and snark at him in front of the team. He was so stressed out-  he left and went to another team.  Seems like she sold the director out as the director was let go and she was very vocal and proud about it, and boasted she did all her work for her and she knew nothing. The absolute worst manager I have ever worked for, will not make it anywhere else because she has zero people skills and treats employees like garbage. Account managers, some managers are hostile and talk down and use negative humiliating tones in their communications. There is no accountability or pride. Walking through the office all you will find is people on their phones or gossiping.  If you do the minimal and do not care about the customers and cause drama you will fit in with this culture. The pay is terrible. very low and you cannot support a family on the salaries. They just let a whole bunch of people go to save money but they really should have looked at the leaders and started training better people. They advance people to different departments that has zero clue on how the departments are run causing shortages of work,  and angry customers. The mail room also loses confidential documents all the time.  I am very happy to not have that toxicity and the stress of working for a hostile manager in a toxic environment fueled with fear, intimidation and negativity,  have not looked back."

1831,,CSR / Travel Sales Associate Experience,2019-01-18,1.0,Sales Associate,1. The building that the headquarters in Richmond is located in is very nice.,"1. No matter what they tell you, it's an inbound call center.  You are expected to be available on the phones from the literal second (that's recorded) you log on, to the literal second (also recorded) you log off. You are given two 10 minute breaks, and a choice between a 30 minute or 60 minute lunch. If you choose the latter, your day is extended to accommodate the lost time on the phone. 
2. If you somehow end up in this situation with a degree, you will be reporting to an immediate supervisor whose highest tier of education is high school. This individual is responsible for pulling calls you took, supposedly at random, and critiquing them. If you fail an absurd metric, such as forgetting to provide a canned sequence of information at the end of a call, you will fail. Fail a call and you will forfeit any possibility of seeing a monthly bonus. 
3. Monthly bonuses: During my time in this position, my team generated premiums in excess of one million dollars every month for six months straight. If you failed a call, you would not realize any bonus for your contributions.  Fear not, for you WILL receive a rubber bracelet similar to the LIVE STRONG bracelets that instead reads ""Million Dollar Club.""  In addition, you will receive a coupon for a cup of soup redeemable at the cafe downstairs in the lobby. 
4. Employee Appreciation Days: Other departments are invited and welcome to join outdoor cookouts and half days with a cold beer. It looked very pleasant actually. I would have enjoyed them had we not been required to remain on the phones to continue servicing calls instead.
5. Staff Development: Career development is probably something that is valued in other departments. However if you are one of the unfortunate souls that make up the claims, customer service, or sales departments - you're doomed. During my two years there, I knew of only one person able to break out of these departments in a vertical transition to something like Finance, Underwriting, or Marketing. 
6. Weekends & Holidays: If you are in this role, you will be working alternating weekends. I have heard that since I left, you actually are compensated better for the mandatory weekend rotations. That being said, you are also expected to work Holidays. Every time you work a holiday, you accrue points. If you have enough points by the time a major holiday rolls around, say Christmas, there is a lottery system in place that works like a draft. If you do not have enough holiday points, you're working Christmas. While I was there, I worked every major holiday including Easter, Thanksgiving, and Christmas.
7. Hourly Pay: As stated above, I'm aware that there has since been adjustments to the hourly rate of CSR and Sales. When I was there, the base pay for normal business schedule was $13 / hour. If you wanted to see the most pay, you had to be willing to work from 4:00PM until midnight for $15 / hour. 
8. PTO: You must accrue the PTO before you can actually use it. You may not take off the same day that someone else on your team has reserved. There must always be enough people on the phones to service calls. 
9. The calls: Be prepared to deal with the absolute worst that this planet has to offer in terms of humanity or lack-thereof. You are the front lines for servicing phone calls for disgruntled customers that were foolish enough to fall for the product this company sells in the first place. The majority of your calls will be to either refund people that mistakenly purchased the policy at the time of purchasing tickets, or sell the policy itself, or notify a customer that their claim is not covered by the policy. I unfortunately had to tell numerous cancer patients that their condition was considered pre-existing and likely would not be covered by the policy at the time that they filed. By the end of the day, it was more common that I received some sort of death wish from a cancer patient than not. I can't say that I blame them. 
10. Management: They are aware of all of this. They do not care. They will always have a pool of people to draw from that hold a high school diploma, or are under employed with a bachelor's degree."

The software is a mess that the processes and work experience is not professional at all. There is very little to no room for growth. Once you are hired, expect to stay in the same position until you leave. Allianz is the prime example if you know someone, you will make your way up the ladder.

1981,,"Deluded ""leadership"", cancerous silo mindset.",2018-03-22,1.0,IT Solutions Architect,"Life is easy, no much pressure is put on anyone.

There are some departments where there is a lot of innovation done, unfortunately they're completely bounded and gagged by bureaucracy and ineffectual leadership.
If you can bypass the useless, demotivating, upper management somehow, a lot of potential is there to creat great things.

Employees are cordial between them.  

Three month intensive schedule at summer.","Technological stagnation, low salaries and no career prospects whatsoever beyond promotion to Peter's level of incompetence. Which explains much of how the current leadership has gotten to where it is.
Low employee morale has left the company with low quality, unmotivated professionals; most of the good ones leave in less than a year. 
Technological decisions are made by people who have no knowledge to make them, ignoring the very people they've hired to help them.  They are often catastrophic.

There is no collaboration between departments, a lot of hostility and passive-agressive relations. And those departments are led by clearly incompetent people that ""promoted"" to that position to earn more money, since it´s the only way to advance your career in Alliance. Thus lowering overall morale. Everything is linked in a vicious circle of impeding doom.
Time flexibility is a complete joke. They will lie to you in the interview, also on the benefits you will receive, that only manifest after being some years in the company. Something you do not want to do if you like your technical career to advance.

Employees are not valued. Focus on external recruitment, no employee retention. No knowledge retention.

In the age of technological giants like Amazon, Google or Microsoft, that extend their reach to every business, Allianz is doomed. So are all other classic traditional insurance businesses. But Allianz is going head-on the path of obsolescence and irrelevance.

If you ever get an offer and you consider it, try to milk all the money you can get, because you won't ever get an upgrade while you work there. Also, do not fall into the performance review extra-work. You won't be rewarded by your extra work: salary upgrades are given by political reasons, not meritocratic ones as they like to flaunt."

Unbeatable 401K match
If you like to travel, you get to see different part of the world (and since most of the offices are in the business district, you would travel to metropolitan, urban setting)
You get to learn a lot","-Politics; German vs US approach, NY vs Chicago vs Munich vs [whatever office location], could be unending, tiring, and honestly petty
-We are big (although limited brand recognition in the US), however we are little bit of everything and it is difficult to make meaningful changes unless you are the top mgt or close to their circle (but see my point above)
-If you are not in the circle, good luck in getting their attention. Tried so many times to get their time to talk only to be rebuffed. Best example was when I made a special day trip to NY only to see (one of) my boss across the hall walking to washroom and I got a waived of recognition :-) 
-For a company this big, I am surprised at how limited the opportunity I can get the more I move up. At times, the message I got is rather conflicting: ""You are too expensive"", ""You may not have the expertise"", or ""Development is your responsibility so you figure it out your own"" or sometimes I got no response whatsoever. Keep in mind, I step up when my predecessor got let go, grew the team, integrated the team w/ Fireman's Fund, participated successfully in Navigator, DDI training for Executives, etc. It's astonishing how the accomplishments meant nothing or how much support not received when I wanted to learn more."

I am a former contractor turned FTE, have been awarded multiple times, highest performer because of my work, but could not grow in terms of learning and position because I am not a malayalee and a bum licker.
02. The senior management is all Malayalees except for one guy in Pune. All they want is to increase head count for billing purposes. They talk just about anything in the townhalls, and people who come form MNCs laugh at them.
03. All team leads are 10+ years experienced, Pappu's of their Managers in line and secretly try to hide their frustration.
04. The Managers hate it when you apply your brain and logic, because its only their way of thinking that is right.
05. Mindless video conferences, countless meetings - for no reason at all, nothing purposeful is discussed or achieved - ever.
06. Onsite visits for no reason what so ever, just for fun. Make a stupid business case and fly; thats it - its that simple.
07. People hired laterally are hired for any random skill and later given training for the real job. The KT never stops, 4 year old people are still taking KTs.
08. Out of the 400- staff in Pune, almost 80% has changed in the last 2 years including all the HR staff itself and half of the Senior Management. It is rumoured that the HoDs are running their own companies on family names.

2. Work space facilities.","1.No career growth, need to compromise with career if you are joining
2.No change in the roles for number of years ( most of the employees are doing same work in niche or legacy technologies/systems for the last 6+ years.
3. Very less inside job opportunities to move into, but micro management at its best.
4 Politics at its Highest level. From a systems analyst or G5 band role you can see the cheap politics.Real politicians will fail here. The current management is ex-Bajaj Allianz management which runs this IT/ITES operations of this company.
5. Favoritism at its best, will get good opportunities (if any) only if you support cheap politics.
6. Wrong information's spreading fast from the top level.
7. Senior Management will speak about career growth , role change by creating backup etc in meetings, but when we speak to our manager, they will say if you are fed up you can look outside, here these are the situations.
8. Manager(s) are not shy to tell lie to employees regarding opportunities and role change. They look only on their performance targets on keeping headcounts under them so they will not release employees to any other projects.
9.If any opportunities available through Internal Job posting- most of the managers will not release the employee by saying un-acceptable relieving time (3-4 months) to the hiring manager OR the manager will agree with the hiring manager in the background that employee will not be released, but they will not stop you from applying to that job posting because it will be an escalation on him. End result is - no change will happen.
10.For freshers recruitment there are also trap called ' contract employees'. Company will call for recruitment for permanent employees,  but after selection they will say no headcount available at the moment, so you join as a contract employee through a well known consultancy under their payroll and later we will move to a good role. It has very less salary and experience certificate will be from consultancy then and follow leave policies by consultancy which is not at all good. The employee will notice these things once they are IN.
11. As this is a global insurance company and huge IT support is required, most of the IT work are doing by other big service companies (vendors). 
12. Another hidden trap- Some of those big service companies (above said vendors) has made this company in their non-hiring list, so employees from this company cannot move to those big service companies.
13. Recently they introduced 5 point appraisal system ( previously 3 ) and promotion system, so now very few percentage of employees will enter in the first 3 buckets which has average salary hike.
14. Senior Managers will get role change or promotion.
15. For cost cutting they stopped the toilet tissues, but after surveys they put it back.
15. Recently reduced the flexibility of  work-from home facilities."

3. Employees are treated so badly that many of them had to abscond in order to protect their dignity and self esteem.

4. There are two groups here. One from Barclays operation and not IT and another from Bajaj sales. They constantly do politics amongst themselves to get the upper hand and hard working employees who want to work peacefully always suffer because of this cross fire.

5. Technologies being used such as Eclipse RCP, SOAP web services are obsolete in market. No market recognized framework is being used here. So no career boost in terms of technical knowledge of skills.

6. The management people literally treat employees as casual labour. They do not respect employees or any of your efforts put forth towards the project you work in.

Nice location of the building - it's next to a gym and darling harbor, so after all of your steps done in the morning, you can have a great sanity break.","I felt like I was in a maze of micromanagement. The staff are all required to 6-sigma their entire daily jobs into little tasks on spreadsheets with timers on it - and I mean that is all day, all week, every month, every year. It's so micromanaged that you don't have time to do anything other than these little steps that are crammed into your day so apparently you will be more efficient. I am NOT a robot, and I don't believe that making staff perform steps for their jobs allows anything other than stupidity. IE: NOTHING was automated. There were about a million of these bonker little steps you had to go through, every day and what a lot of trouble you would get into if you forgot a little bonker step. To give you the extent of their micromanagement: I remember aligning some tags on documents that weren't quite straight and having one of the managers in there rip them off because they weren't straight - the tags had to be perfectly aligned and in colour sequence (no business purpose other than to look pretty - don't worry about staff time spent and wages getting a ruler to align the little stickers on the pages so so). As I said, it was just bonkers. How can this company possibly promote creativity in such a regimented environment? Completely Micromanaged to point of complete lunacy. If you like to be controlled for every breath you take, go there. But if you are like me, you will run a mile. I went to another company and implemented a system with workflow to automate every single manual bonker step so I would NEVER have to do anything so nutty again. Funny hey but sad and true."

The management was always willing to purchase us new equipment as needed and the work environment was relatively relaxed.,As one would expect from a massive non-tech company there were ridiculous standards which hindered the team's ability to supply the best solution to many problems.

I know how this company works from my 4 years of tenure because the management structure is not very long. It starts with an engineer under me --> me, the lead --> My manager --> Divisional Head --> CEO. This is a shared services company of Allianz. Allianz is not yet confident enough to give all of it's projects to AMOS. So, less projects. Most of the projects are 'operations' kind of tasks, either L1 or L2 or both. Only few projects with L3 support involved. An example is - there is an application and a tool is monitoring it. Now, the operations team monitors this tool :. Very less workload in my opinion. Best company to work for if you are just married. No head aches related to work and you can dedicate all your time for family. One thing I like is there is a fixed/clear appraisal processes (No room for high expectations :P ), Flexible timings - No one cares when you come and leave but work should be completed in SLA. Flexible team members and work style allows telecommuting for short term. Employees are very friendly and their culture is very good. Its always fun in here.","Company structure is not good. No good middle/low level management. All tasks come eventually to a software engineer - be it an project analysis/evaluation, a board/customer presentation.

Connecting the two takes energy, however! Having said that, the strength of the group is in its operating entities (OE's in Allianz speak) and there is enough autonomy for them to do the right thing.","The overlapping responsibilities in Munich are a recipe for paralysis, especially when allied to the toxic gossip culture reinforced by 3-5 day a week 1-1 scheduled lunch meetings and a very very German hierarchical style. Another issue is that people are seldom fired but can get shoved from project to project - many seem to view it as a comfortable landing point and are happy to wait their time out.

There is an active Sports and Social club and a robust Reward and Recognition scheme. The culture at Allianz is extremely friendly and many staff have either worked here for years or left and returned to the company - a strong indictment of what a great company it is to work for.

2558,,A Firm With Low & No Growth,2013-02-03,1.0,Analyst,"Initially, this firm was booming and growing back in 2008. In fact, this firm was doing very well while the rest of Wall Street was crumpling. Overall, the vacation days are decent, good health benefits, fairly young crowd.

There is no cohesiveness or integregration, each department is in its own world. The RIS group is ran like a muck, they do their own things, have their own cake & coffee hours."

2584,,Dysfunctional. CS employees are given unrealistic goals and are penalized and fired when they don't reach those goals.,2012-03-14,1.0,Customer Service Representative,Decent salary and two fairly decent restaurants on site even if your break time doesn't allow you to visit them before they close for the day.,"CS employees routinely thrown under the bus by management when a caller doesn't get their way even though as a CS you've been explicitly told x is not allowed. However, if the customer complains loudly enough their bad behavior is rewarded and the employee becomes the fall guy. In addition, the technology they employ is decades behind the rest of the world and frequently fails or provides incorrect information with cumbersome work-arounds. There is little to no vacation time offered other than a small handful of days for an entire department for an entire year. But aside from all that, probably the worst aspect is the unrealistic call handle times imposed - as a CS employee you're assisting customers with complicated financial packages, often times the customer's life savings and/or retirement funds, but you're limited to only 5.25 minutes per call. If you do not meet this limit you're either placed on a firing warning for exceeding the limit and eventually fired for it or you choose deliver poor customer service to keep your calls as short as possible. If you see a problem with the customer's account and they don't bring it up, you sure aren't going to because that would make the call longer so you leave it be and the customer gets screwed. It would seem the mentality is that Allianz already has the customer's money so why do they care that their CS employees are giving poor CS? It seems that they're only concerned with processing as many calls as possible, it's quantity over quality. Even good employees that have been with the company for years must fear for their jobs every day and even though the company states they promote hiring from within, in the call center it's all smoke and mirrors. It's been years since an employee escaped the call center by getting another job within the company. For most the only exit is with their personal belongings in hand, escorted out the door by security. But there are always more warm bodies desperate for a job, isn't that right?"
