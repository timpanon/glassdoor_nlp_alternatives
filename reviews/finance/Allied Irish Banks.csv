1,Allied Irish Banks,AIB do not care about staff or customers,2022-04-10,1.0,Anonymous Employee,The staff who work in AIB ( level 4 and below ) are the hardest working people I've come across.,So many.. Staff are currently doing the jobs of 2-3 people due to staff shortages and the banks refusal to hire more staff. The front line staff are getting constant abuse and complaints from customers which is fed up the line but continuously ignored. The bank have recently created even more unneeded layers of staff in the historically complicated processes in every customer transaction which adds further delays for customers and unmanageable pressures on front line staff. This has led to staff being forced to stop caring about about the achievement of getting something over the line for a customer within an acceptable time frame because it is now impossible. This has resulted in a toxic culture where staff feel they are constantly letting customers down and frustrated that there is nothing they can do about it.

Staff attrition is ridiculous. Anyone with any sense or training moves. 
Management, particularly senior management, is so far removed from the core of what a bank does that they might as well work for another company in an entirely different sector.
Zero chance of progression in the organisation. See a career route you’d like to follow?

54,Allied Irish Banks,Not for everyone.,2022-01-06,3.0,Credit Analyst,"Different pros depending on your level. Assuming you are junior staff (level 1-3):

- Managers have great respect for your personal time and work life balance. Rarely asked to work late. In the event you have to work late you at least get paid overtime.

- Given lots of autonomy to manage your own workload. Very little micromanagement (YMMV depending on your team).

- One of the only places to get good experience in front office high finance roles without working ungodly hours.

- Get to work with interesting, friendly, approachable and super intelligent colleagues. This is harder to find in finance than you would imagine.

- Interesting work Much of the finance industry in Ireland is deeply monotonous or cut-throat competitive. AIB Capital Markets strikes a good balance.

- Decent education supports (pay for exams, study materials, 2-6 weeks study leave depending on the programme)","Management are highly focused on reducing their measured cost drivers with with no regard for associated hard-to-measure costs, such as reduced productivity associated with the use of obsolete IT systems, or hiring and training costs associated with high staff turnover.

Some examples:

- Chronic underinvestment in IT has led to complete reliance on very old, frequently broken or offline systems.

- Huge productivity burdens felt by all teams after years of creating manual processes to make up for inadequacies of the IT systems. Systems are highly non-intuitive. Mistakes are common.

- Response times for internal queries often take several days.

- Related to the 3 points above: getting things done can be very slow and you sometimes lose access to good deals if the Borrowers have access to foreign or private markets. The bank relies on its duopoly position to get away with terribly slow service. 

- The bank has leaned into WFH very heavily but has not adapted well to new ways of working. WFH rules are dreamed up by senior executives with no iteration or feedback and imposed on teams with little flexibility to manage their people. As a result the rules are clearly designed to suit the lifestyles of veterans with lots of living space and many years experience under their belt at the expense of younger staff.

- On the job and informal training is non-existent since going remote.

- Above 2 points are extra concerning due to massive staff turnover during the lockdown periods of 2020 and 2021. A very large proportion of current staff have less than 2 years experience.

- For early career finance professionals, developing a good work ethic is a key skill. AIB is more like the public sector than a cut throat investment bank. If you spend too long in a lax environment like this you can get too comfortable and struggle to adapt in a more competitive environment later in your career.

- Progression has more to do with being on a team with a growing balance sheet than with your ability as an analyst.

- There are some good exit opps in Ireland but most are in London. The AIB brand is known but not as well respected in London which can make it difficult to move if that's what you want to do. The Big 4 are arguably not as interesting or as good experience but carries better to London.

- Salaries are very low vs the same job London but competitive with domestic companies. Junior staff turnover can be very high. The bank has adopted a model similar to the Big 4 of hiring lots of graduates every year to offset dozens of L1-4 staff leaving each year. Can be a good platform to start your career but I recommend doing exams (ACA, ACCA, CFA, etc) in parallel to keep yourself working hard.

- Nepotism is absolutely rampant for internships and grad programme spaces. The most reliable way to get a position is to be someone's niece/nephew."

408,Allied Irish Banks,Disillusioned employee !!!,2019-07-02,1.0,Business Advisor,Colleagues.  The staff on the ground keep you going.  Everyone pulls together.,"Total and complete disconnect between head office and branches.  Branch staff esp in lending teams have huge workloads,  time pressures, constant competing priorities  and no support / insufficient resources to do the jobs. Our lives revolve around checklists and constant fear of 'breaching' a policy or procedure which dictates how we operate. 

There is a fear of speaking out in case you are branded as being negative or 'offered' a secondment to a project in Dublin which is hours from your home....Yes it happens!! Alternatively, you may get 'offered' a relocation to a branch miles away. 

There is no HR presence on the ground as the powers that be got rid of HR Manager roles a number of yrs ago. Now you can send an email to a faceless person in Dublin....No one cares. 

We do a pathetic staff survey every yr which is pointless as nothing ever changes. Most people at this stage just tick what they want us to say otherwise you end up at meaningless and mind numbing tick box meetings about how we can improve things...none of which ever happens . 

When will they listen and see that staff are genuinely stressed out, burnt out or on sick leave due to massive workloads!!  I've seen staff crying with the pressures while others have simply resigned. 

We all laughed at the recent award given by Gallup as it being a great place to work. Perhaps it is if you are working in head office or departments. For the rest of us at the coal face it's a totally different environment."

Unfortunately the recession saw a lot of the more balanced managers exit and the ambitious (ruthless) managers rise to the top.  The results are what matter now regardless of how it's done. If you challenge senior management or deliver less positive news, you are punished through isolation and badmouthing at senior meetings. I've seen them stand up in townhalls and ask for honest feedback and then a week later they hauled in the people who gave the feedback and berated them for their attitude. Those people were isolated after that. They view subordinates as a threat and not an asset. They dictate terms and expect compliance without question. It's nearly like a feudal system and they don't seem to recognise what they are doing is bullying. They believe the feedback they get from their cheerleaders - then they reward the cheerleaders regardless of how poor a leader that person is.

637,Allied Irish Banks,AIB IT - it really depends on your chain of command.,2016-07-16,1.0,Senior Software Engineer,"There's very few pros these days!!!

There's still some great people there and often a good atmosphere (if you take the attitude of not caring!)

Apparently, a great work-life balance (but again, this is dependent on you not caring!). If you don't care, life will be very easy. If you do care, it can be extremely stressful/frustrating.

In earlier years, I did work under a number of good middle managers and with a lot of excellent colleagues (but they are mostly gone now). 

Pay, including pension contributions was alright (not great, but not terrible) but there are zero benefits (it's a bank, so don't expect bonuses, profit sharing, health insurance or any perks whatsoever).","Far, far, far too much politics and incompetence in the middle management layer (and assume at the top layer as well). (also, way too many layers of management!!!). This is by far, the root of the vast majority of AIB IT's problems.

As one example, the mantra of far too many middle managers is that they will try to make a project fail and someone else take the blame rather than take a small bit of risk/responsibility themselves and make the project a success.

As another (specific) example, one terrible manager permanently destroyed an excellent a successful team over the space of just a few years. This happened right in front of everybody and was clear as day that the team morale/ability was in freefall, yet senior management not only did nothing to stop/resolve it, but applauded the manager's actions (ie gave the manager another promotion for their great achievement!).

Poor performance, in general, is (at best) ignored and often encouraged. Both the Dilbert Principle and Peter's Principle applies very much in AIB IT (google them if you are not familiar).

Constant talk of strategy and behaviors etc, yet zero impact on actual actions taken by middle management.

Management is in a constant state of change, so processes/policies/plans/goals etc end up also being in a constant state of change.

In many parts of IT, far too much reliance on contractors for knowledge/skills. A large percentage of  the permanent staff still left in AIB today have few relevant skills/knowledge or anything useful to add and are, thus, resentful of contractor's and often use them as political tools/pawns (take credit for work, blame them for poor results etc).

No clear career path.

The recent outsourcing means that bureaucratic processes and politics now rule supreme in IT. Implementing IT change is just one big mess of meetings, meetings, meetings, documentation, blame game, meetings, incompetence, meetings, reasons why nothing close to the desired result is possible, meetings, more blame game, meetings and extremely low targets nad measures for success. For a lot of IT change, the sizing for ""overhead"" work is 2-4 times the actual dev/testing work which is often greatly exaggerated to begin with and poor quality in itself.

The recent outsourcing also means that, in many areas of IT, anyone who was good has left or plans to leave. Thus, there is no one left in AIB with the desire/ability to fix/undo the damage caused, so don't expect these cons to disappear any time soon:("

There were certain aspects of the job that I liked and there certainly seemed to be plenty of training opportunities and potential for advancement.,"The whole company culture just seemed destructive to me, no doubt due to what had happened in years gone by. It felt like a lot of the work we were doing wasn't actually that valuable and we were just doing it to be seen to be busy. The senior manager of our department was completely clueless as well and pretty much summed up everything that's wrong with Irish banking culture."

705,Allied Irish Banks,"Don't waste 10 years like I did,  toxic culture, soul destroying work environment, a Draconian boys Club!!",2014-07-01,1.0,Bank Official/Personal Relationship Manager,The only pro of working in AIB was the friends I made. We kept each other going through the rough times.,"1. Company Structure -  I was working in branch banking where you went in at entry level as a Bank Official and in order to progress to the next level which is known as Officer Grade you need to get promoted.  Once you are an Officer you are considered a member of management and you can then climb up to Assistant Manager then Manager of various grades.  This all sounds achievable to anyone who works hard towards whichever level they are capable of however the reality for most of my colleagues was very different.  There are hundreds of bank officials in the network who have over 10 years experience, working roles such as SME Specialist, Business Relationship Managers, Personal Relationship Managers, Customer Service Supervisors, Foreign Exchange Supervisors, Mortgage Arrears Specialists and Mortgage Consultants who were never promoted and are still known as bank officials with a salary of buttons to match. AIB is returning to profitability on the backs of the poor souls left in branch banking.  We used to call ourselves "" The Ants in Dungeon of the Economy""  
2. Promotions -  Time and time again we saw those who treated others like the bottom of their shoe promoted over worthy candidates. When someone who actually deserved a promotion got one it was a rare moment of  joy. 
3. Redundancy's -  deserving candidates of 30 years service and more overlooked in favour of those who made going on the sick their career so AIB chose to get rid of them with a golden handshake rather than punish them through the proper channels. There are still people on the sick who regularly post their lives on Social Media for all to see. Sack them !!!  Everyone knows who they are. 
4. Culture -  you could only imagine the culture that results from the points mentioned above.  Soul destroying misery. 
5. Lunches -  AIB top brass decide that the minions in branch banking no longer deserve an hour lunch and slash it in half just like that.  People need that hour to recharge, to feel normal, to have a chat, to confide in a friend and sometimes to cry and dry yourself off.  I promised myself that day going back down the stairs from the canteen with my lunch still in my teeth that enough was enough.  I deserve better than this. 

To conclude It was the best decision I ever made. I only wish I hadn't wasted 10 years on them.  If your still in AIB don't be afraid to jump.I had a job within a fortnight. The one good thing about being ex AIB is that other companys know we are able for anything."

After working in AIB, I soon discovered that many other companies in Dublin have a ""no bank"" rule when recruiting - i.e. anybody who has worked in AIB or some of the other major financial institutions in Dublin/Ireland is considered undesirable - the reason for this is always that people in AIB and other places are technically weak and to a greater extent, they have no initiative, expect to work 7 hours a day, take a 90 minute or 2 hour lunch - total disconnection from the real world."

AIB has both. If I was given a choice between two companies, one that has both, and another that has neither, I'd go for both.
If you're a software development contractor, I'd say it's good. You'll get contractor rates but much better stability, because there's lots of work to do and very few permanent staff to do it.
There was a lot of 'dead wood' in middle-to-upper management","Before the pay/bonus/promotion freezes, it was widely known and openly spoken that, except in exceptional circumstances, non-management staff got the precisely the same % increase and bonus regardless of performance.
After the pay / bonus / promotion freezes,  staff who had joined as graduates and spent years working hard to become cornerstones of their departments, were still on first year wages.
Many critical teams lost skilled staff (in some cases, entire teams left) but were unable to hire replacements due to 'strategy'. Some low paid staff were 'double-jobbing' as team functions were amalgamated on top of them. Critical services were running threadbare, and underpaid staff at the lower end were stressed and overworked.

729,Allied Irish Banks,Responsible for analysis of potential investments,2012-02-23,2.0,Credit Analyst,"There is a good work ethic and the people around you tend to be friendly, smart and eager to help you learn. 
If you wish to advance yourself, at least in terms of knowledge and experience, you have every opportunity with a wide array of courses available both externally and from within. 
The pay is reasonable but can be described as nothing more. If you are working in the Corporate Banking department as I was you would be better off in a similar department in a better bank but the amount of learning available more than compensates for the first year or so.","There is no opportunity for young people now (at least there wasn't when I left in 2011) and the senior management have played a game of musical chairs, simply moving from department to department at no reduction in their salary when many of these people (and I'm not discussing board members here) should have been shipped out long ago.
I would venture to say that certain members of this ilk could not explain the difference between a debtor and a creditor. I can only assume they still have jobs due to the photos of members of certain political parties with goats that are in their posession, however this is unfortunately not going to be true. 
When you have no shot at an increase in remuneration and look up the ladder to see these clowns sitting at the top, you have no option but to be critical of their management, which has created a posionous atmosphere within the bank. However having discussing with ex colleagues, I'm under the impression that things are beginning to look up. But only a little."
