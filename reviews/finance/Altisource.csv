Work like balance exists due to the WFH situation. But this can b considered a bain too.","Cons:
Unrealistic deadlines set by senior management though the team is short staffed. 
Too many lay offs across the company and no hikes since 2 years due to losses in the company 
The Senior management does not care about the staff concerns and the work load even when 1 person does the work of 2-3 due to attrition. They consider this an obligation of the employee to fill in all the gaps which is highly insensitive on their part. 
Assigning us with heavy workload also comes with demotivated remarks and criticisms."

I never really figured out where Human Resources even was and my official ""contact"" that I was to use was constantly changing and moving. The positions in the United States now are, in my opinion, just a cover for farming everything out to highly questionable labor markets to cut costs. They treat the employees in India abominably.

WFH during covid.
Maybe one can learn new technology, depends on the team allocation.","Where shall I start?
Employees are treated as a measure of cost, can be fired anytime irrespective of how good a resource one is. Mass layoffs at least thrice a year, in the name of cost-cutting because CEO and top execs can't bring a penny in terms of revenue while drawing millions in salary. SHAME!!!
To clarify, I was not laid off during my 1.5 years of stint at Altisource and was a performer. But know what, there's always a gloomy environment in the workplace and colleagues are always discussing when would be the next round of layoff and who all will be thrown out. 
Coming to work-culture, it's non-existent. Management keeps on changing high priority every day or two and wants you to work weekends to align with their incompetence. 
Requesting Glassdoor to remove job-security and culture from Altisource reviews as it's opaque.
HR is non-existent, the only times you'll hear from a HR is when you join and when you resign.
No hikes or appraisal whatsoever, doesn't matter if you work 15 hrs a day. I heard from senior colleagues that Altisource is not even paying bonuses promised for the last few years.
I've no bad feelings about the people, most of the people I've met here are pretty intelligent and from top colleges.
But I'd request new joiners who is looking for reviews to reconsider joining Altisource. Do join only if you've no other option and in a financial crisis, join elsewhere even if someone's paying lesser. I had the chance to join some other organization at the time I had offer from Altisource and I regretted all my tenure joining Altisource.
It's not an easy exit either. Your pay will be put on stop without any communication while you're on notice period."

You will most likely know more about how to do your job than everyone above you in a position of management.

Sink or swim environment, no support or backup from management.

No raises, was only tempted with a pay increase when they needed me to move into the desktop support role and had no other options and 4 days before my last Friday.

No hardware and equipment. I was told we would be purchasing several hundred laptops 6 months before I put in my two weeks. No sign even as I was walking out the door. Keep in mind some users were on decade old laptops that still had stickers that said the machine ran best with Windows 7.

Horrible benefits, no cell phone reimbursement, no incentive for healthy living/being tobacco free. No gym fee reimbursement, pitiful point system used to improve morale. 5 years there and when I left I cashed in my ""Altisource Points"" awarded for ""Living our values"" and ""Going above and beyond"" for a measly 30 dollar Amazon card. New job I am barely there 5 months now and I have already amassed 175 dollars.

Super high turn over rate. IT rarely makes it past the 2 year mark.

Terrible implementation of IT tools, very few apps on software center, SCCM is a mess littered with peoples pet projects, queries and scripts that have long since been abandoned. Glitchy desktop image. No dedicated backup servers for offboarding. Imaging process actually does very little, you need to manually add the machines to the domain and name them. Ad hoc asset management system that is a notoriously slow and of course, free to the company. No direct access to the telephony management console.

No room for advancement (super rare)

No continuing education opportunities (no access to Linkedin Learning, Udemy or Pluralsight,)

All your support teams are in india. Infrastructure, Infosec, Engineering, License Mgmt, Provisioning . Good luck getting anything done on a US timetable.

You aren't valued."

Then things went down hill fast. The company cut corners in all the wrong ways. In order to save money they began laying people off and sending business units offshore or people onshore for a much cheaper pay rate. The results of this were seen immediately. ALS field services went from a top 5 servicers to now being about to close the doors in less than 3 years and they deserve every bit of it. The offshore team had so many shady business practices I had a weekly meeting to go over why they shouldnt be doing this or that and they could never adequately explain why they were doing it and we would end up just arguing over how they need to stop doing things that were borderline illegal."

This place will set you back financially if you choose to begin and remain employed at Altisource. Pay cuts in some form or another do happen, whether it's allowances offshore, reductions onshore, or even simply a pay cut. Culture is gloomy and depressing. When layoffs happen (generally at least 2x a year) they add the workload on to the survivors, again with no pay increase.

396,,Waiting for the shoe to drop.,2020-02-15,1.0,Processor,Friendly people to work with,"Senior Managers are nothing but numbers crunchers with no experience in preservation.  There is nothing positive, coming from our senior management.  They say that they can see the problem, but are not listening to the employees that do this day to day, from team leads down to your processors.   1.  The operation system here is a joke, and firing people/managers or complaining about things is not the solution.  There is a lot of talent in this office that would be better served else where.   You give us crap to work with, what do you expect in return. 
2.  The vendors that they hired are a joke, or the contract agreement must have been written by a 5yr old who has no preservation experience, with ADD.  These vendors have no respect for Altisource and are the main problem with our SLA issue across the board.  We do nothing to hold them accountable for their lack of work done timely and correctly.  We reward them with praise for doing a job in 90 days that should only take 15 days, that is idiotic.  I would really like to meet the person that set up this system with the vendors.  I was told that we have to ask the vendor if it is okay for them to accept a charge back for work they either didn't do or did incorrectly, or extremely late.  ARE YOU KIDDING ME!  95% of our problem with being out of SLA is our vendors.  We can't push back on them, because they know Altisource will not do anything.  Altisource is like a parent that lets their child run wild and walk over them PERIOD!   3.  HIRE MORE TEAM LEADS.  There should be a team lead for every division of work group.  Presale-Team Lead,  Postsale-Team Lead, Payment processing-Team lead.  Not one team lead for all 3 processes.   With this outdated system of a spreed sheet for everything that is insane and impossible to handle.   You can't manage your team correctly or reveiw files or give feed back or training to any of those on your team, because you are so busy on a conference call explaining to these number crunching higher ups why things are not done on time, and dealing with spread sheets.     You wonder why in the time that I have been here 6 team leads have quit.  I am a processor and I wouldn't want to be a team lead here, because we see the pressure they are under.    They are trying to hire more team leads and i really don't think anyone here is insane enough to step forward and offer their resume."

The ex-chairman and majority shareholder set in motion a culture of burning out employees in 2 years or less, not trusting anyone, illusory incentive plans (big promises with no real benefit),  micro-managing senior leadership, and a culture with no work life balance. 
We worked 8am-8pm or later and were still expected to come in on weekends and holidays to ""prove our commitment"". They actually fired a guy a few months back for taking his honeymoon, after he had cancelled it 2 prior times because the company pressured him to. We would fly 13 hours to the office location, then be expected to come in and work a 10-12 hour day within an hour of landing. They promised another division an equity piece and the group outperformed all expectations, but not one person got the equity.  If they have any extra money they will buy stock back instead of investing in their people or the platform. The senior leaders say one thing and then assail their employees and customers at every chance. There is a reason their stock went from $80/share to $25 during a time when all other financial services companies thrived. It's called bad management."

The stress here is caused by management.  All managers and most team leads act hostile and annoyed when you ask for their assistance. Their assistance is required for you to do your job.  Literally several times per  active call you won't be able to move forward without them coming to your desk and signing off on each step. They also set un realistic preformance standards. You are expected to make 300 outbound dials a day.  Okay that can be done,  if that was all you were doing.  However, you are also expected to field inbound calls as well.  Each inbound call takes time away from your outbound dials and they refuse to acknowledge this. If I'm expected to make no less than 38 dials per hour, then I lose 2 hours of my day to inbound calls,  how can I meet my goal? Answer: I can't, but during my preformance review I will be told I'm not meeting key preformance indicators (300 dials) and will be denied any raise. Additionally my work files,  needed to establish my bonus each month will randomly be taken from me and given to favored agents, thus decreasing or eliminating my bonus.

RUN!,2017-03-13,1.0,Recruiter,"Worked for Altisource for a year and was able to witness the inner workings of the company and a good portion of the Business Units that make up Altisource.   They have very small pockets of solid leadership and productive teams.   If you are lucky to work in one of these areas, you will enjoy your time at work.   From my personal experience, Owners.com has great leadership, vision, and team members.   Equator has excellent leadership team over Product, Engineering, and a few other areas.","Overall, this is not a company you want to join in any capacity unless you are in dire need for a short term job while you hunt for a great place to work.   Since I worked within the HR and Recruiting team, most of my comments will be focused on the reasons why I rate the company and this group so poorly.  (Before I get started, let me say I really look forward to the reply this post gets from the Leadership as they spends a good amount of time trying to discredit honest and accurate posts to cover their inability to lead a functional and productive group)  

1)  Leadership -  Every great team starts with a solid leadership team.  Great Leaders are typically honest, fair, and provide excellent communication.  They create a game plan, create action plans, and communicate the goals to the team so they can set out to accomplish the desired results.  The leadership team of this group are so far from being effective leaders, I hate to even associate this word with them.  

2) Communication -   For a long time I was blown away by the inability of our leadership team to communicate basic information, let alone vital information.   I have come to the conclusion that it is impossible to be this bad at communication.    Their lack of communication in every way must be done on purpose and as a way for them to manage their shady dealings and keep people from understanding the truth about their objectives.    Most recent example was a major change to our commission structure where they started to deduct commissions for past hires that have left the company.   This is a major change and one that was never communicated in any way to any of the team members.   When confronted with the major commission deductions, they told individuals that was the reason.   They never answered any questions or provided any supporting details around how they arrived at the final payouts.  The one excuse offered was, we are going to change the entire pay structure in the future.  Deflect and avoid confrontation is their idea of communication.      Poor communication, YES.   Shady and Dishonest, 100%.   
3)  Honesty -  There is a fine line between bad communication and just flat out lying about topics or situations.   This group has mastered both.    They go out of their way not to communicate and when cornered and forced to speak, they make up lies that they cannot support.    

One may ask why the negative post.   To be frank, people deserve to live a happy life and surround themselves with good people.    If you join this company, do so with your eyes wide open.  Read as many reviews as you can.   Some may stretch the truth, but they all have a solid foundation of the truth in the eye of the beholder.   From my perspective, the positive ones are usually from the groups with solid leadership.   Take note, not many, if any, positive reviews from the Recruiting or HR teams.   If you are thinking of joining the Recruiting team, understand the struggles you will face when dealing with morally corrupt and bankrupt leaders.  As an added bonus, you get to double up in a one person cube due to space issues and poor planning.   What fun!"

Dirty, dusty, gross. Dirt and grime on the floors, water dispenser, in refrigerators, on the tables. Very rarely are we provided napkins or paper towels.

Ad hoc work. No proper planning. Higher management has a blurry vision.

941,,A company with an ecosystem of Jungle (Kill or get killed),2016-11-21,1.0,,"Good Paymaster 
Cab service is fantastic for Bangalore location","First of all this review is not meant for the management as they are way beyond any possible reparations. Rather than even looking at the facts of the review they shamelessly try to defend by stating that every review has been posted by a single employee.This review is meant for talented graduates and post graduates from prestigious institutions who are deceived into joining this organization blinded by above market pay line. 
The company is no more than a BPO, they can continue protesting vociferously that they are a product company but they are not so. It's not bad if you are a BPO not at all but it's seriously a problem when you treat every Indian employee as a trash. There are many talented guys in US, no doubt about that but in certain functions US based directors and VPs are in no way qualified to be even a specialist. These guys concentrate on making the whole environment poisonous and recruiting deputies in Bangalore and Mumbai to spy for them. These spies update their masters on weekly basis through elaborate mails or calls. What an use of company resource? People with prestigious degrees and knowledge in their pocket are not required to play James Bond with you. A particular guy was being recruited just for the sake of spying and complaining about everybody without doing an ounce of work, swinging like a pendulum between offices in India. Couple of people left because of the attitude and many are looking for the job, all of this because of will of a single man. 
Altisource empowers these men to the extent that they are able to destroy the culture and organization within months before being fired them self. 
Request to people who join Altisource from prestigious colleges: 
1. Market is slump so I will not ask to reject the offer but try to run away as soon as possible unless you are proficient in company politics
2. Colleges Placement committees, just because they are paying well, you are not required to give them top slot. Ask your seniors about the company and then give them slot 
3. People who are highly intelligent yet working below their capacity and capability, don't worry you will get what you deserve. 
Finally to spies of the jungle kingdom, I know you don't have brains to do any real work but at least be a good spy"

This means that it's a company full of very intelligent people for the most part.  HR is working to ramp up employee engagement.  They pay pretty well, but unless you're hourly, it's not truly worth it.  Even if you are hourly.. it's not worth the stress that comes with it.  I only stayed as long as I did because I loved the people on my particular team.","Prepare to be overworked and in most cases largely under-appreciated.  It's also very difficult to move up or change departments.  Lots of red tape everywhere because you're dealing with departments that are based all over the world and TERRIBLE communication between those departments.  Zero job security.  There were major rifts with absolutely no warning.  No real sense of community because turnover is so high.  Walking through the office you feel like you're in a library, it's so quiet.  It's a very depressing place to work.  Even the employees that have poured their blood, sweat, and tears into supporting the company could be pushed out if they start to slip.. or for money reasons.  Sadly, there have been many cases of complete burnout.  It is awful to watch incredibly talented people reach their breaking point because of mistreatment.  I was there for two years and never received a performance review.  I asked on several occasions for some kind of direction and a way to move up, only to receive mixed messages and false promises over the course of 6 months.  Like many others, I had enough."

Weak HR leadership lacks the spine to do the right things. Vindictive people who will not bat an eye lid before deciding to demean the efforts of anyone who has decided to part ways with the organization. 

Leveraging core competencies of people isn't what the HR team does. Work allocation is pathetic. No one really has a clue as to what they are doing or what is it that they are trying to achieve.

It's become a great working place in a short period of time.

- Leadership:  we don't have VPs in our location, but the ones leading the three main teams and HR's are close to its local teams, are warm and genuinely interested in the development of their employees.  They are people you can look up to and from whom you can learn from.
 
-Involvement:  if you have a good idea, you can implement it.  That kind of empowerment is very motivating and that is what I value the most when I come in every day.  

-Career opportunities:  you look around and there are plenty of examples of people who joined at entry level and were promoted several times.  That is infrequent in our market.  

- Work-Life Balance:  the work is interesting, different and challenging and you work very hard during your workday; however the company respects your life outside work and in general you don't need to stay late to complete your responsibilities.

The current HR leadership is completely directionless and has no clue of how things work at the ground level. Some teams have excess of people with no work, while other teams are barely managing. People are being brought in from non-HR functions who have absolutely no clue of how HR works, nor are they ready to learn. Favoritism is clearly visible. We do have some good people in the senior management, but with the current leadership they are also struggling to keep people happy and retain them"
989,,This was not a good experience for me,2016-08-29,2.0,Anonymous Employee,"The new HR VP really seems to be trying.
The new casual dress code.
There are snacks (read: junk food) in the galleys","Benefits are well below what other companies in the Atlanta area offer.
Bonuses are discussed, but ......where are they?
Zero continuity from team to team and office to office.
Antiquated IT systems and software.
Still a huge turnover issue in the Atlanta office.
No ability to telecommute (at least in my department) and a horrible VPN network when you do need to connect remotely.
Too many small companies operating under parent company. Makes for inconsistency across teams.
On boarding amounts to, ""here is where you will sit. Good luck.""
The open office atmosphere, especially in areas with sensitive information, is not the ideal working environment. 
OCWEN is a HUGE question mark. If they fold or are forced to fold, Altisource folds. 
 In the Atlanta office, there are two sides to the offices. It literally feels like two different companies. Again, the issue of a lack of continuity across teams. 

There are certain teams that have new faces on a monthly basis. The legal team is a prime example. Meetings are set, meetings are cancelled. When you contact the attorney in legal, you find out they left the company. In the 2 years I worked at Altisource, I have seen at least 10 different attorneys and 5 different paralegals come and go. The mortgage services has been even worse. I literally could not keep track of the people who I was supposed to be working with because they were constantly being fired or leaving. Contractors are also let go on a whim and there is no communication to let the other employees know other than the, ""[insert name] is no longer allowed in the building.""
Very little room for advancement. I can count on one hand the number of promotions I saw vs new recruits being brought into to fill the middle management positions. I left the company and landed a senior management position, but my future at Altisource was never discussed while I was there. 
Work life balance in the Atlanta office is non-existent."

I have never had a problem getting a needed day off (flexible) and there are about 19 PTO days and 8 or 9 holidays per year which is certainly better than my last employer and good opportunities for overtime as well.

I really am excited to see what happens in the future...","There have been times during my onboarding where I felt that I was left to figure things out on my own.

Taking the existing training documents and templates and applying them to me has proven to be limited.  I have had to take the time to modify these items or develop new documents to better relate to commercial review.

The team I am a part of has monthly employee engagement activities, fun contests and giveaways to keep the employees involved and help them to get to know each other better.  
When I see something that I feel needs to be improved, my manager supports me and gives me the ability to make the changes.  There is no red tape that you would find at other large employers.  This company is growing and I would encourage anyone who is interested in working with great people and wants opportunities to grow with the company to consider joining.",The only con I can think of is technology related.

(5) Transport vendors ill-treat employees.
(6) If you are a new joinee then all people around you will do everything to make you fail.
(7) Departments are overstaffed with senior people. Resources are never hired/provided to do the ground work. Departments with team size of 25 comprise of only Managers, Senior Manager,Directors and VP‚Äôs. They are all so busy, trying to manage each other that in the process no work ever gets done by them. Every second person you meet in the organization is either a Manager /Senior Manager/Director.
(8) Employees are not treated as an asset. They can be removed or promoted on the whim and fancy of their bosses. Simple strategy to grow within the organization, if you know how to butter your boss and be his ""yes man"" then no need to do any work , without doing even an iota of work you can get your promotion letter that to along-with your confirmation letter(new joinee).

The technology used is all outdated. All these senior people survive by playing dirty politics. Inherent lack of ethics &  ""sweep it under the carpet"" culture everywhere.

With such high testing standards used in the hiring process I can assure you they are not hiring lazy employees looking to make minimal contributions and collect  a pay check. This company gets negative reviews from current and ex employees because they offer a dysfunctional & borderline abusive corporate culture perpetuated by ineffective leadership. It's not the technology or workload that's particularly challenging, it's the superiority complexes, abrasiveness and politics within upper management.

I put a dent in some big projects, changes etc","For the real story on Altisource, just Google ""Ocwen Founder SEC"". Ocwen is Altisource's parent company, biggest client, and biggest/ nearly singular source of revenue. The shanningans and ethical malpractice surrounding Ocwen are NOT separate from Altisource- they are one in the same.

Normally, HR should never be a reason to decide to work / not work for a company. In the case of Altisource, you should *absolutely* take HR incompetency as a major red flag - it's reflective of the deeper ineptitude of management practices at the company. The culture is one that is deeply suspicious of employees (i.e. most offices require a thumb scan to sign in as a way of tracking coming and going, approval processes to do anything and everything, mandatory compliance training ad nauseum, colleagues in India who are treated like criminals). 

On hiring: The tests you are forced to take as an applicant (Wonderlic / WPT and Personality) aren't taken with the grain of salt that such arbitrary measures should be; your career once you are AT the company can be deeply impacted by the score you receive in the one, silly test at your interview. I was doing a lot of hiring, and often told applicants that they didn't need to worry about the test. The truth was, if you don't score an obscenely high number - I was told by HR ""top 10% of all test takers"" is the standard - you simply cannot be considered for employment. 

Promotions: When a colleague of mine was up for promotion, she didn't get the role (which, btw, there are VERY few opportunities for promotion) despite being over qualified. I found out on good authority that HR keeps the scores, and when promotions are being considered, your score on the WPT is part of the evaluation. To understand how BS this is, you should know that the test is 12 minutes long and involves 50 SAT-style questions. I knew managers who rigged the scores to get people through the door. 

Benefits: The company's benefits were poor, non-competitive, and often mismanaged. For example, new hires had to wait 90 days for benefits to kick in -NOT the norm - and accrue health expenses in the meantime which were then reimbursed after a nightmarish review of expenses. A senior manager in my office once confided that he'd come to tears over the incompetence of getting health care reimbursements. 

Altisource Labs is NOT a startup. There are good people who are trying to make big changes, but they are hamstrung by the complete dependence on Ocwen, a huge, financial services company in the subprime mortgage space, which is essentially its corporate sugar daddy. REGRESSIVE is one word that comes to mind. OPPRESSIVE is another. HR and management views its job as keeping people in line, not allowing the status quo to be questioned. I had interns with more experience and people skills than the ""Directors"" of HR. 

I was privy to numerous conversations with very senior managers who openly disrespected others. Screaming and personalized vulgar insults should never be tolerated when coming from a senior exec: At Altisource Labs, this definitely happened. 

Rampant incompetence. Complete ineptitude in management and retention practices. Massive bureaucracy. Complete misrepresentation of the company as a startup, when it's truly anything BUT. These are the truly deeply-rooted practices and behaviors."

If you trust that the quality and strength of your daily work drives your future opportunities, then consider Altisource.  If you like to make an impact, then consider Altisource.

As I begin my 2nd year here at Altisource, I am really starting to appreciate the immense learning opportunities I have at my disposal.  My professional development rate has climbed sharply since joining Altisource and there is no slowdown on the horizon.  Make no mistake about it, you will be challenged by the pace at Altisource and you will need to adapt to keep up.  That pace, however, illustrates (to me at least) the huge opportunity all Altisource employees have to make their presence felt.  No company is perfect and there are still many changes that could make my daily Altisource experience a bit more pleasant, but Altisource provides me with the necessary support, tools and environment to make these changes happen myself.  I don‚Äôt have to wait for someone else to do it.  That is rare in a large company.","There aren‚Äôt any offices and you will age more quickly at Altisource than if you decided to be, say, a Wal-Mart greeter."

Many people are in-and-out within two years.  Employees past three years are considered ancient and have many battle scars.  Also, good luck on any pay increases.  Personally, after achieving my bonus with a high score each year, they did not bump up my base once.  I only stayed due to the job market.  I was pleasantly surprised when I nearly doubled my base, with bonus (slap my forehead for not leaving sooner).

There's a huge disconnect between what management thinks they offer and the reality of trying to function in an environment with a struggling infrastructure and leadership that doesn't honestly respect their employees in general. They are brilliant but simply incapable of leading and managing the company.

You'll find favoritism in many places, but here it truly affects the overall morale since several individuals have failed upwards to positions that require management and people skills. It's like dealing with poison ivy, painful and difficult to work around if you want to do your job and accomplish anything. In the meantime you blister and suffer when here.

The growth potential for the company is huge, and so are the career opportunities. You're able to carve your own path in the organization, have autonomy over your projects, and work collaboratively with other talented, passionate, vibrant colleagues who are driven to make the team and business thrive. Certain projects/products in the organization have a start-up vibe, which encourages entrepreneurial spirit, and has the added advantage of  backing from a major public company and buy-in from the leadership team. There's a great amount of exposure of your work to key stakeholders. It's been amazing to see the progress the company has made over the past year--and it's only going to get brighter.",Not necessarily a con as this is the case (or my experience) at many companies- but a better health insurance provider would be fantastic.

The bonuses discussed are never received. There are no office supplies in the Atlanta office. Workers literally scavenge empty desks for supplies. The overall feel of the company is very big brother. You get the sense that every move is being watched.  Look at their website. They are constantly hiring to replace the employees who quit. You will see new people daily. Their former CEO was forced to resign from Altisource and Ocwen through a settlement with the state of NY. They claim to be a new company, but they merely spun off of Ocwen. Ocwen is still facing huge regulatory hurdles and, as their largest client, could have a severe impact on their ability to remain in business. 

The upper management see the rank and file as cogs in a machine. People are treated poorly and spoken down to. I watched coworkers get fired for no apparent reason.

Altisource is honesty the worst company I've had the displeasure of working for. The dismissive way they handle 95% of their employees is deplorable. They treat everyone who isn't part of Labs like they're completely replaceable- I've actually heard from the mouths of some higher-ups that they believe the employees on the mortgage/finance side of the company (which is the majority of the company, mind you) don't have any valuable skills that make them important or irreplaceable. And you are going to run into this kind of thinking everywhere you turn in this company.

The work culture is stifling and oppressive. There is such a negative attitude radiating off almost every person you meet here. Only the recruiters are positive and peppy, and that's only because they have to be to get more candidates through the doors.

When I first started, I was warned by several employees about the ""Altisource mentality"" and how everyone feels it after a short time. The average time a person works for this company is a year and a half- that should tell you something right there. Working for this company eats away at you. Everyone is so unhappy and the company treats its employees so badly that the majority of people there are desperately trying to find another job. It took me all of two months to realize that what I was warned about was very much a reality. 

And don't even get me started on the legal issues surrounding Ocwen- who are very much in control of all things Altisource- no matter what they're telling the press.

Offshore is terrible, no one in management takes responsibility for anything that happens, the office is outdated and ugly even though it was built less than a year ago, the policies are nitpicky, and accomplishing even the simplest of tasks dealing w IT takes weeks of going in circles because your being handed off to so many different people in so many different countries (most of the IT department is in India which works out SO well...).

1276,,Horrible Toxic Environment,2015-01-12,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"Not much to ay, good location and view. Snacks that make you unhealthy","Toxic Environment
Altisource is the most toxic environment one can work in, worse than a chemical factory. In a chemical factory your body gets affected and if you stop going there your body can get cleansed. But at Altisource your mind gets poisoned to a point where your self- confidence gets shaken up. You start doubting your own ability. 
They shut down their products and let go off a whole bunch of people. All the senior people are secretly looking for new jobs and their subordinates don‚Äôt know that they are looking for new jobs. 
There were so many negative comments on Glassdoor and then the Senior management and the whole recruiting team ran a program where they ‚Äùincentivized‚Äù their employees  to write positive comments and the next thing there are a whole bunch of new positive comments on Glassdoor about Altisource. 
They hire South Americans, Chinese and Indians but the recognition/ promotions/ bonuses are not the same as other employees in the company. Also the salary structure is very discriminatory all across. I have seen 10 years experienced Chinese person make $30k less than a ‚Äúnon-Chinese‚Äù employee. 
They work only for one customer Ocwen and if that customer does not want or like something then the whole project can get scrapped off just like they shut down products right now. Extremely uncertain situation but the people are trained to promote the company as though it is better than Google or Amazon. 
Altisource hires a ton of egoistic people whose attitude is ‚Äúmy way or the highway‚Äù and hence every time there is a senior person hired the focus of that product changes and then everyone has to adapt to this new person‚Äôs vision. Multiple times they have hired people to run the show and then have hired someone as his boss and so everything that this first person has done gets wiped clean and then they start from scratch according to the new ‚Äúsenior‚Äù employee.  
Their hiring policies are discriminatory. They use AccessPI which evaluates a candidate‚Äôs behavioral characteristics and if they are not in line with what the company is looking for a candidate does not get the job even if he can do the job or has done the job for 10 years. Another discriminatory practice is the WPT. It is a practice done to ‚Äúweed out‚Äù people. WPT has nothing to do with coding and yet it is a mandatory hiring step. Majority of the people fail the test. Both these steps are harder for people who are not born and raised in America. The English is American English. 
Hiring managers bring their own ex-colleagues at very high compensations and even if they fail the AccessPI and WPT. While other employees who actually pass the two steps are not compensated as much. 
Senior Managers are already looking for other positions where as their team member have no clue about that. By far the worst place to work. The practice unethical hiring and interviewing methods. They use WPT and AccessPI as a method to set a standard for people. But both these methods are illegal. No one has the courage to complain about such unfair practices to the authorities like EEOC or Workforce Development. 
They shut down a product and now everyone is scrambling on what to do. They interview people and portray themselves to be better than Google and Amazon. They make their Hiring team say such things like this is the best place to work and they sound very convincing. I wish I had read Glassdoor reviews before I joined this nasty place. 

Most employees are good but the Managers and the Hiring team is a big sham. They are made to lie. They are also ""incentivized"" to write good reviews on Glassdoor and they post pictures and videos showing that they are a fun culture. It is far from it. If they don't know what they will do with the product then what is the need to build a product. They solely work for Ocwen and if Ocwen is not happy with anything they can completely scrap the product leaving everyone involved with nothing to do and without a job. 
All recruiting team is from Monster working through Argosight which is done  only to avoid non compete."

It is NOT a start up although there has been significant turnover.

Stock history: high of $160, currently trending at apx $30.  Carefully review that of both Altisource and it's former parent company, Ocwen, now Altisource's primary client.  There have been many news reports concerning various law suits.

1284,,endless politics and no respect for the employees,2014-12-27,1.0,Associate Product Manager,"While the perks of working at this faux startup by no way outweigh the cons, a few I can think of are:

- Lots of free snacks and drinks in the Boston and Atlanta offices. Boston office has beer on tap. Dinner is offered a few nights a week if you are willing to grind until after 7pm
- Compensation is at or above market averages
- The extreme lack of organization/structure/competence in the company make it easy to take advantage of the system. For example, HR is too incompetent to track vacation days so if you don't have a helicopter manager it is easy to take all the time off you need
- Some departments (basically just Consumer Analytics) appear to actually be working on interesting business/algorithmic problems. the rest of us grind away working on software that looks like it came from a Windows 1.0 advertisement","- I cannot stress enough the total lack of care for employees at this company. Just of a few of endless examples: (1) company forces a bell curve for performance rankings even on small teams and this essentially prevents anyone from reaching their target bonus, (2) all annual goals are evaluated by some evaluation team in India that has no understanding of the teams they are evaluating, (3) company conducted a ""confidential"" employee engagement survey and then published results to all managers in the company with all the names matched to the responses, (4) the President himself stated in December 2014 that there would be no layoffs due to the recent legal and financial issues, yet layoffs were initiated later that same month
- Executives do not agree on the direction the company should take and give conflicting orders to the employees. Turf wars galore
- Career progression plans are nonexistent. Yes, the Boston office hasn't been around that long but still I do not know of a single person that has been promoted here
- Benefits are far below market averages for a technology company. 401k only begins after one year of employment and only matches 50% up to 1 or 2%. Even accumulation of vacation days does not begin for 90 days, something I have personally never heard of before"

I would give it a zero star if possible. DO NOT BELIEVE THE HR PROPOGANDA REVIEWS THAT HAVE BEEN POSTED RECENTLY, THEY ARE COMPLETELY FALSE AND WERE COERCED FROM EMPLOYEES.

Some of the biggest cons of this company:
- Leaders are completely out of touch - they are hired for their educational pedigree and ability to pass an IQ test, not for their actual work experience and personality.
-Absolutely NO communications both within team and between teams- Everything is very cloak and dagger.
-Unethical practices - hiring people based on IQ test scores, company owners basically ordering employees to write positive Glassdoor reviews instead of actually fixing problems, blatant violations of NDA and non-solicitation agreements, ETC.
- No benefits offered to contractors - if you're a contractor, prepared to be treated like a second class citizen. NO benefits will be offered to you at all and you will not even be given access to basics company-wide flu shots. Also they will let you go with little to no notice at all before your contract is up (saw this happen on numerous occasions).
-Benefits for full time employees are below average at best.
-With the exception of a few teams, almost everyone here is miserable making for an overall depressing and draining workplace.
-You will be expected to work long hours with little to no recognition for your work.
-You may be hired for one position only to find yourself forced into a completely different role with no notice and definitely no increase in salary.
-You'll be burnt out and looking for a new position within 6 months.
-Organization is completely top heavy which means if you are not at the top prepare to be doing the work of 2 or 3 people.
-No upward mobility- they will just hire a manager rather than ever promote from within.
-NOT A START-UP - they bill themselves as some collaborative, fun, cutting edge technology start-up but to the contrary was actually one of the most corporate, stiff, oldschool, and bureaucratic companies I've ever seen.
-Comany does not appreciate it's employees - you will just another cog in the wheel.
-No company perks or outside benefits.
-Terrible work-life balance. 


Honestly I could go on but I think this gets the point across. DO NOT WORK FOR THIS COMPANY. They will crush your spirit and you will regret going there within weeks if not days of starting."

Management expects employees to work all hours of the day , night , weekends and holiday's without a second thought. It is normal for the average work day to be at least 12 hours. 
Finally the average employee lasts for a little over a year. However if you really hate yourself then you may last two years.
Also the company 401 k is a 1% match after a year. The guest you can get is a ""B"" rating on your yearly review unless your a CEO and then they will ""Allow"" an ""A"" rating. This results in the employee never getting their full bonus."

Three weeks into the job, my supervisor predicted a wave of resignations 'as soon as bonuses are paid' and whaddya know--it came true!

The last straw was the way they handled my exit. I've been in the software industry for twenty years and I've never been treated so disrespectfully. Despite strong positive feedback and good working relationships with peers and internal clients, I was asked to resign a few months after I relocated from another state to take the job.

If that is an issue for you, don't work in those divisions.

Aug 19 - 20? Or that big group back in April? That is because the C level management made a bunch of people log into Glassdoor and say something good about the company. Before that the CEO had a 45 percent approval rating and the company had less than 2 stars. Now look at the reviews on here that are comprehensive, lengthy and spell out specific issues with Altisource. Those are the reviews you should pay attention to. 

The simple truth is Altisource is solely interested in making money for its C level employees and shareholders. Do some research and look at its public filings. It is making a huge profit - $130 million a year - and has also borrowed $200 million but at the same time is cutting staff, salaries, bonuses, travel and everything else for its employees and customers. Is it losing money? No. It has a 30 percent profit margin and wants more! Why? Is it to put back into the company through staff retention or revamping its 15 year-old technology? No! It is all being used to buy back stock so that the C level employees and the shareholders get more share value, at the expense of their employees and their customers and the long term prospects of the company. To date they have purchased over $200 million of their own stock just to drive the price up and increase dividends. This only helps the shareholders and C level employees who hold over 40 percent of the stock. They are pillaging the company profits and saddling the company with debt just to add to their pockets now. 

Every day I see how the C level does not care at all about their employees. They recently moved all of our office into small cubicles, even senior staff, HR employees, compliance staff, attorneys, accounting and others who need privacy.  But of course the CEO, CAO, and Chairman have the only offices in the entire space and they aren't even based here and they rarely visit. This just furthers the divide between the C level and the staff.  Amusingly, the move was acclaimed as team building and to encourage collaboration, but in reality we all know it was just to save money to add to the shareholders return at our expense. Not only that, but there are no more secrets. We are all in cubes and can hear everyone‚Äôs phone conversations. 

Here is the deal. If you are really starving and need a job to feed your family, take this one. It looks decent on a resume but that is about it. You will be miserable and treated horribly in a matter of days or weeks. You will actually have to punch in every day, no matter what level of employee you are. And if you think that is so they can pay you overtime, oh no, there is no overtime pay. You are expected to work 60 hours or more each week with no overtime and if you don‚Äôt put in the hours, they will let you go. It is some weird culture that comes from the Chairman and permeates through all of his companies. I imagine they think why pay for 10 employees when you can get the same work out of 6? Does this burn out employees? Of course. Do they care? No. There is no work-life balance. On top of that you won‚Äôt be allowed to travel to supervise your teams, but you will still be held responsible for their work. You will also be forced to make all new hires in India, where you can't properly supervise your employees but they cost 20 percent of what they cost in the US so you have to hire there. Oh yeah, if you do get permission to travel they will make you pay for your own travel expenses and they will take months to reimburse you. I hear the CAO actually blocks all travel and only sometimes finally approves it just 2 weeks from the travel date when it costs double to buy the tickets. 

If Altisource is recruiting you and you make close to what they are offering you and relying on the equity rights plan to make a difference, forget it as it is completely worthless. They claim to be a start-up with good equity but in reality they are simply a spin-off of Ocwen and continuation of that business model. The only people in the company who are vested with equity are the CEO, CAO, the Presidents of a few divisions, and a dozen or so other people. That‚Äôs it! 15-30 people out of 8,000 employees. There is no time vesting, just multiple financial hurdles that are quite impossible to meet. By all measures this company is a great financial success, but it won't share any of that with the staff who made them a success or put it back into the business. We actually heard about a division that recently increased its revenues from $1,000,000 per month to $15,000,000 per month - a miraculous 15 fold increase - and nobody on the team vested a single dime.  

Most employees come here with high hopes to make a difference and an impact but it is quickly beat out of them as they realize they are not valued or respected. Then it is just a matter of time before they find new jobs. I don‚Äôt know anyone in my group that isn't looking for a new position as we speak. The average life cycle of an Altisource employee is about 12 - 18 months. 

I am not a negative person, but there it is. This is what Altisource did to me, turning me into a negative and cynical employee. I hope candidates do their research and choose more wisely than I did. All of the information I provided can be found in their SEC filings and investor materials or other public records."

The company is built of four or five (depending on how you count) semi-independent business units. There are lots of interesting and very talented people, at its best the culture is very informal, and the projects in flight are state of the art technology. What's even more important for me, the BU leadership understands the importance of proper market analysis and product management, and staffs accordingly.

He will yell at people until his face turns extremely red. Don't let him fool you in the photo's and video's that this company puts on its social media sights. This is not a fun place to work. 

No one knows what they are doing, but because the organization is so top-heavy, there is immense pressure to do things quickly and efficiently without error when there may only be 2-5 people on a team that is supposed to be 20. On the other side, some VP's feel that hiring solves everything and will just hire to get a body in a seat, but not tactically thing about what that person will be responsible upon hiring. 

The relationships between line managers and Execs are often contentious, as are the relationships with some of the Exec's with the CEO. 

If you want to feel good about the impact you are making on a company with out compromising your ethics or life outside of work (I worked 12+ hour days for months) then this is not the place for you. In a nutshell, Exec's are MEAN, the place is chaotic, expectations unrealistic, and is unethical. STAY AWAY."

1352,,Unstable,2014-09-26,1.0,Former Employee,My boss didn't work in the office. The coffee and creamer was always stocked. Air conditioner worked on a daily basis.,"Expensive benefits, $300 per check to have a 1500 deductible for a family.  They do not cover step children unless they live with you. That's right 7800 a year for health insurance so make sure you ask for more money. 

19 pto days a year but you don't start accruing until day 91. So basically it will take you 7 months to earn 5 days off.

Everything is offshore because Altisource is too cheap to pay American wages. With most of the staff in India it makes for a very frustrating work environment.  There is no denying the disconnect, on shore does nothing but fix offshores nonstop mistakes because of poor training and cultural differences. 

They do not give annual pay increases to floor employees. 

Only some of the floor employees get an Annual bonus even though everyone contributes to the bottom line.  This causes poor morale between co-workers.

Tuition reimbursement takes months and months to get approved because there isn't a set policy in place. 

There is zero employee appreciation events of any kind.  

There is one IT guy on site that is 100% responsible for 2 buildings. He is worked to death because Altisource doesnt think there is any reason why 1 person can't support over 100 people alone.

This company is tied to Ocwen, which should have been my red flag to turn and run in the other direction. 

Offshore is given better benefits and pto than onshore. Off shore also holds employee events.  If you are an onshore employee you are treated like a second class employee."

- Lack of vision.  If you build it they will come.  Build something... anything...  throw it up against the wall and see if it sticks.  Business requirements?  Say what?  Come up with your own feature set and run with it.
- Poor communication skills.  Low-level management lacks basic  communication skills.  A lot of can be attributed to cultural differences.
- Pretend-startup look and feel.  Smoke screen to entice college grads from ivy league schools to come onboard.  Not too many publicly traded startups with Indian roots out there to compare against, so perhaps I am wrong about this one...
- Antiquated development environment.  Locked down and tightly controlled workstations.  Low-end Windows laptops as cost saving measure.  Never mind simple math: number of builds a day TIMES number of minutes spent waiting for slow build TIMES number of developers = REAL WASTE OF MONEY

 I shud have doubted them as soon as they agreed upon my expected CTC without even negotiating. 
I was wondering how on earth can a service company pay that much. Soon after  joining and speaking with the director I realised their funda.

 I had seen the Glassdoor reviews before joining , which was very bad. But thought it might be only in some division. But trust me the reviews written are 200% true.  
The management thinks everything in the world is money. They expect employees to work and deliver from the first day 14 hours a day and also on weekends. And since they pay gud money they think people don't bother. 

    Trust me 5 of us resigned within 15 days of joining and more followed. And we didn't had any offers. Still we cud not convince ourselves to stay there 

  There will be no documentation or knowledge transfer or domain training. You r expected to deliver from day one. 

The behavior of management and HR are even pathetic. It can't be explained in words here. You will get a mail from hr and manager for petty things. 

Its a BPO . Its not at all a software company. You have to swipe in everyday, wear formals. Etc etc.

Free coffee? (I'm reaching)","When people asked me why I resigned my position, I can‚Äôt really say it was one specific thing. Here are some of them:

‚Ä¢	10 hour work days are the norms, so they say. Why? No reason, just because.  It was very job and manager specific though. Some people are paid by the hour, plus OT over 40 hours, plus do some of it from home, so they didn‚Äôt mind at all. I wasn‚Äôt a manager and there was no rush for my work so there was absolutely no reason for me to be working 10 hours a day, but I was made to just because my manager had to do it. He didn't seem to understand that he was a manager and I wasn't.
 
‚Ä¢	A lot of the employees work in India and the Philippines which led to an endless amount of frustration when trying to do your job.  It isn‚Äôt about saving money on salaries though.  I made a point to ask why they had this very inefficient way of doing business. My manager told me they do this to avoid US corporate taxes. The company is registered in Luxembourg even though all of their business is in the USA. To be a foreign registered company, a certain percentage of your employees must be based outside the USA, so that was the reason why Indians were reviewing properties even though they had never been to the US nor knew anything about the real estate market. It was the strangest business model I have ever seen.  

‚Ä¢	They have a finger print reader that you have to sign in on every day. They claim it is to keep track of people‚Äôs time off, but that is a lie. If that were the case, you would just have to sign in using your employee ID, but they want to make sure you are there and signing in yourself, so they make you record your fingerprint. That would become a central theme in this company and other reviewers have pointed this out. If you take nothing else from these reviews on Altisource, remember this:  Management doesn‚Äôt trust the employees. I‚Äôve never seen anything like it.

‚Ä¢	Two weeks before Christmas, they laid a bunch of people off in the St. Louis office and cut off their benefits immediately.

‚Ä¢	In the Atlanta main office, they are pressed for space, so more than likely, you will be herded into a large cafeteria/call center type area with absolutely no privacy or ability to concentrate. 

‚Ä¢	Every day you will see a new person walking through the hallways to interview. Every single day. It‚Äôs not because they are expanding so much as the high turnover.

‚Ä¢	Don‚Äôt count on remote access to work some of those long hours away at home. It requires an act of Congress to get it and even then, they won‚Äôt give you access to your email or the servers.

‚Ä¢	Those that did get to work from home weren‚Äôt allowed to work on any screen greater than 15 inches. No dual monitors either. ????

‚Ä¢	They also don‚Äôt like you to wear ear phones when you work and they will enforce that from time to time.

‚Ä¢	You aren‚Äôt allowed to drink coffee without a lid on it at your desk . ????  I joked with my friends that I was going to bring my 4 year old niece's sippy cup in and drink out of that.


There is so much I could say, but I would like to remain somewhat anonymous. You should know that I ever never written a review about a company before, and I have worked for dozens. That should tell you something about this place.

I used to joke with my friends that I was working for Potter. If Potter from ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a Wonderful Life‚Äù had lived and formed a company in mortgage services, it would have been Ocwen/Altisource. I am so glad to be free of that place. 

So my advice‚Ä¶ if you get a job offer and you don‚Äôt have anything else on the table and have bills to pay, take it. You might end up in a better job with a better manager.  If you are looking through the reviews, I would sort them by locations in the USA and ones in India. Some of those people in India are just happy to have any job.

In any event, you have to do what you have to do. However, if you have any skills whatsoever and you have another competing job offer, even if it pays less, even if the commute is a little longer, even if anything really, take the other job offer or stay at your current position. The grass is not always greener."

The employees in the office are excellent. Use to be the best in the city, but with the high turnover only a few of the original are there.

This company, and it's original parent company (Ocwen) profited greatly from the housing crisis, so you don't have to worry about the company running out of money. 

Free lunch on Fridays. Free dinner on Tuesdays & Thursdays.

If you don't have much outside obligation (i.e. family) and would like to jump start your career by working hard and working a lot, this is not a bad place to do it. Even after the mass exodus, you'll still be working with some bright people...but bonus season is around the corner, so don't know how many of them will be staying.","Bureaucracy of a large financial company. For example, it takes 3 weeks to get a virtual machine spun up in their data center. You need to take frequent compliance training. Paperwork gets lost and they've been known to not pay bills on time. It's common for people who have quit, to keep receiving a pay check (maybe that's a pro?) 

There is a policy that you need to punch into work everyday (like McDonalds). It's a biometric clock and you use your finger print  (so worst than McDonald). If miss a day you'll get hounded, and need to justify why you missed a day. If you could not punch in because you were working from home, you need to get that approved.

Work life balance dependent on project, but mostly not well balanced. Some employees sit there and do nothing, some have a position of a regular 9-5 job....a lot are slaving away. So depending on the roll of the dice, this may be a non-issue.

Altisource has one main customer (Ocwen) that calls all the shots, so if they ask that you bend over, you better bend over.

You earn your bonus during the calendar year, but do not get paid for it until March. If you leave before the March pay out date, you don't get the bonus that you have earned already. 

Altisource's legacy products are developed and maintained in India. The US offices are developing the next generation product. If you need to deal with anyone there (which you probably will) you'll be pulling your hair out while on the phone trying to get something accomplished. 

Upper management for technology is mostly in Boston, even though Atlanta is the original office. What, is there no talent in Atlanta? 

It's been 8 months and still, the CTO position is still unfilled. 

HR is understaffed and thus leads to mistakes. Have you ever heard of someone asking for a raise, but end up having his raise given to someone else, because they share the same first name? Ironically, they both ended up quitting.  

Even though the compensation at face value is good, but if you end up on one of many projects that work long hours...when you consider you are working 50-60 hours a week you are probably underpaid."

1460,,The Environment Is Improving;  The Technical Team Is Brilliant,2013-10-10,4.0,Engineering Director,"There are two sides to Altisource - the servicing side and the technology side.  I can only speak to the technology side - specifically Altisource Labs.

1) Altisource (and Ocwen) is sitting on a pile of cash and they are not afraid to invest.  They actively hiring, and they hire only top talent.

2) The technology is leading edge.

3) The technical team is incredibly bright and very effective.

4) The management team recognizes the need for changes to improve the culture here, and they are actively working to make those changes.

5) There is a lot of upside here - both in terms of career growth and wealth generation.  Altisource Labs is being set up as a well funded incubator company.  It has many of the advantages of the start up with benefits of a long-term investor backing it.","1) Achieving work life balance is a challenge.  It's doable, but starting out of the gate it will be pretty nuts.

2) When Altisource Labs opened an office in Boston almost a year ago, the execution of that decision and how it was communicated to the Atlanta office was handled very poorly.  It was very sudden with no follow up, and it left the Atlanta-based team with the impression that they were going to be shut down.  This led to a downward spiral in employee morale in Atlanta and an exodus of talent.  This is the single greatest issue that has affected the perception of Altisource Labs in the Atlanta area.

3) Altisource Labs hired a bunch of people with experience that was exclusively from start ups, but Altisource Labs is not a pure start up.  They are a large company with all of the standard bureaucracy when it comes to infrastructure.  This - coupled with the fact that much of the IT support is based in India (making it harder to access), was very frustrating to the people with start up experience.

4) Historically, Altisource Labs has not handled interviews well - especially for technologists.  The interviewee has to run a pretty serious gauntlet of tests coupled with a rigorous panel interview.  After a significant investment of time and energy to jump through all of the hoops, the candidate may not get hired and is provided very little feedback.

Some of them take this out on their team members.
In retrospect, my year there was working for a company that does evil (even if technically legal) things, with fingers in the sort of dealings that collapsed the markets.  This trickles down.
They started making some changes to try to pretend to have an innovative and open environment, but the multi-national corporate nature can't be hidden with a coat of ""start-up"" paint.
Some people like this, but it was expected to have Formal Business Environment mode on at all times, up until about a month before I left where we moved and could go business casual.  What you wear doesn't matter too much if you like your job, but it just made things that much more uptight."

2) Company doesn't have stringent Background check in place, resulting in hire of people,who have charges of sexual harassment in previous employment.Now, one can easily imagine company culture.
3) Highly unprofessional leads and managers, can harass and demotivate hard workers, by their sick behavior. 
4) They call themselves product company, but don't even have policy of 360 degree appraisal.Managers are as good as dictators.
5) No parity in terms of salary as well, its upto your managers, can be given 100% hike at the time of hire and appraisal.

There are many subsidiaries within Altisource that correlate to each other. For example, Hubzu lists foreclosed properties that are brokered through RHSS and maintained by another Altisource-owned company. The way they move money from one subsidiary to another is incestuous. I felt dirty working there.

Almost everyone in customer service is in India, which is extremely frustrating to customers. 

There are many leaders at Altisource, but little leadership.

No work ....Small company...","Hi...first every company has pros and cons.

1. But  altisource's biggest cons is there is no job security . It doesn't follow any process or rule book regarding it's employees. Like ..in any time be it recession time or not...it starts laying off it's employees without any warning...They will ask u to put down your paper  and leave the office immediately...even if  u r middle of a  project..and u will get shock of ur life..And they lay off in bulk...

2. Technology wise also there is not much scope to learn...Not much projects to choose from..Any how they will not going to let u  choose...

3. 90% are maintenance projects...

4 .If you r reading any good reviews...dnt go 4 it...they r all put up by HR's...

Company is confused whether it is a Product Company or a BPO Company or Portfolio Management Company. Even its name represents this confusion.

2. With every change in a senior position like VP or CTO, the company changes its direction, which means there is no company vision anyway.

3. You are at the mercy of individuals in the company. Your well-being is depended on them, not necessarily on your performance.

4. Most projects are maintenance projects.

5. Few development projecs are totally haywire and directionless depedent on whims of people leading them.

4. There are layoffs."
