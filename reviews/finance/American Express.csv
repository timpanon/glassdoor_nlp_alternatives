36,,Good opportunity,2022-04-09,3.0,Sales Manager,Great place with nice work culture,Salaries is not competitive and increment is low
37,,Organisation Structure,2022-04-09,4.0,Project Manager,"American Express (UK) looks after its employees extremely well. Type of health insurance, support and other benefits can be one of the best in the industry. Company can contribute up to 11% pension if you contribute 7%. Not many companies do this. They would pay good bonus and pay rise if you have done well in your performance ratings. Also, company performance is taken into consideration when adjudicating bonuses. Flexible work pattern (working from home) exists and some people can apply to work from home 100% time - sometimes it is granted. There are opportunities to learn additional skills and you'll be supported by your manager well in this.","Beware of various bands within Amex. This is somehow kept secret to outsiders. Ask the recruiters - what is the job band for the role that you are applying. It (job band information) won't appear in public job board - only available in internal job board.
If you have several years of experience, you still may be applying for Band30 which is a junior position. A senior (manager) position is Band 35. It is almost impossible to get promoted from B30 to B35 unless you are engineer (software developer). B40 are called Directors. B45 starts at Vice President (4). VP III, VP II are also there. B70 is called usually Senior Vice President or Country Manager. Next level up is Executive VP. Next is President and then C roles. 
There is no automatic progression or promotion within Amex. For each role, you have to apply and unless you have something called great ""networking"", i.e. you have the sponsorship of influential people, you can forget about promotion. There may be exceptions but this is how it generally works. 
It does not matter what is your annual performance - best performance won't give you promotion. The only way is - you impress your leader by agreeing to everything they say and then they internally open a role and promote you. If you are not in the good book of your ""leader"" i.e., line manager, nothing will happen and you may have to look for jobs elsewhere if you want to be promoted or earn more money.
Some ""leaders"" can be jealous and try to block subordinates to be promoted as best they can. However, American Express should not be judged by the bad behaviours of minority (leaders), but you still need to be mindful of this situation."
38,,"Great people, inadequate compensation",2022-04-09,3.0,Technical Delivery Manager,"Collaborative and friendly people, good benefits, flexible working","Low compensation compared with market, overly bureaucratic, fast career progression is reserved for those who know the right people rather than talent"

On the other hand, if the hiring manager is a man and one of the candidates a pretty/hot woman, the chances to get the promotion are low, that happened in Platinum Travel with the Japa-Argentain manager that was recently promoted."

But honey, they repeat this every month to every different batch of newbies coz mark my word, people leave after 3 months. 
At some point, Customers' screaming, yelling, cursing, and crying is not an issue for you anymore coz there's something more stressful coming your way...the metrics. The leaders are going to ask you why the calls are too long, why didn't you extend your ""SALES"", why did the customer call back (even though they called back coz of different reasons). Even if you feel sick and needed to take some off days to heal up, they will make you sign a paper saying you promise to take care of your health and not get sick again. They micromanage you to the point that you can't even pee. If you missed your break time coz some calls are too long or uncontrollable, you CAN'T replace the break time you lost, and also get a backlash about not taking the break on time. 
They question you for 1 bad review from a customer instead of acknowledging you for the other 10 Excellent customer reviews you had. (just an example). They will do anything to bring the mood down really."

When my uncle passed away and brother got thrown into jail they paid me in full and gave me compassionate leave as well. I had covid and was taken into a quarantine center by the government and American Express covered me in full. When it came to looking after me they really went above and beyond.,I didn’t enjoy the pressure of the job as we have to answer anything from 40 to 60 calls per day/shift and sometimes even up to a 100 calls. I started to feel a shift in my mood after talking to all these people that were of course calling in due to their financial frustration but I learnt a lot from this role.

Good place to coast along unless you upset people
Very honest and transparent business practices","It is a large company, slow moving and decision making is by consensus. People who move ahead are those that ruffle feathers the least and have the right connections. Risk taking is genuinely avoided. This leads to unqualified and inept people, who are part of the family, moving into leadership positions. Senior leaders are part of an old guard, they make many mistakes , setting direction first, then giving up, then setting a different direction, with no accountability. The story inside is that it's not lack of accountability at Amex, it is just slow accountability, which is a terrible confession to make. No significantly successful new business idea in the last 10 years."

That can be a bit hard when you are first learning. The benefits are solid, but not great. In light of the pandemic, they have made changes that are good.","You cannot grow and gain skills in your role. If you want to move forward in the company, you need to do trainings on everything. There's no hands-on experience. There's no desire to up-skill employees. Senior Management wants everyone to be the same type of manager and worker. When you want or try to do thing differently, they tell you to stop. There's fear of trying new things and taking a chance on someone. Instead, it's all about playing it safe.

Things take way too long to complete, with some exceptions. For some projects, you need to have 3-4 teams involved in the decision process. That's not efficient. Everyone is stuck in back to back meetings all day. Processes are inefficient. There is never enough time or people to get work done. You always seem to be on a small and mighty team trying to do the work of a large team. Based on how projects are run, there's never an end game. There's never a light at the end of the tunnel."

For example giving the customer some wrong information to access airport lounges is construed as a gross misconduct. Compliance management have never been in sales and makes up rules every other week for example not being able to use the word return when it comes to membership rewards points when that is exactly what they are getting a return. The company doesn’t have anyone’s back, we have your back is an understatement. It’s a joke. Very stressful. Not worth the stress.

If you have zero talent, you're fine.","Making high sales gets you zero reprieve, and they will just expect more and more. If your numbers ever drop despite being better than your team, they'll make it seem like you're the one slacking.

Because of covid and cancellations and everything else the government does, the job is incredibly busy. It is nonstop calls from 10am to 9pm. Seriously, nonstop.

They will badger you if you spend a minimum of 1 minute longer on your breaks or sign in late by 1 minute.

They live in this delusional world where their job is so great and so fun but everyone can't wait to leave.

Teammates will sabotage you with responsibilities so they can leave when scheduled. 

They had manual overtime for several months and likely still do.

I left every day mentally exhausted/numb. I never felt challenged, appreciated or inspired.

The workforce is very diverse, so long as you define diverse as female.

Way too many responsibilities. 

Calls are incessant and every booking you make you have to babysit every day and make sure there aren't issues from the vendor.

It's entirely too much work and if they aren't robbing you of your bonuses by writing you up for non-customer-related-things, the money you do get is not worth it.

If you don't need money you can't tell them you need a break. You'll be worked until you snap and then they'll blame you."

First of all, the metrics and requirements to certify are RIDICULOUS. Out of a class of 8, only 3 people certified…. What do you think that means… Hmm. 
The card members are EXTREMELY RUDE and if you say something they do not agree with they will refuse to get off of the phone until they speak to a supervisor which will never happen because your leader or coaches will NOT speak to cardmembers. So.. you’re stuck on the phone with a very angry cardmember who ends up insulting you. After that, the leaders will find a way to blame it on you for not de-escalating the situation even though it was completely unavoidable. 
The pay may seem good at first but for everything you need to do, it is ABSOLUTELY not enough. You will be doing the work for 3 different departments but only getting paid for one job. 
Since 5 of the 8 did not certify, they were laid off. Which is so ridiculous to me. All of the trainees were extremely intelligent and did a much better job that any other department. I attest to that. This company is a complete joke and the worst and most stressful job I have ever had in my life."

- AT YOUR OWN RISK, LACKS JOB STABILITY. Middle management is safe for a year or two. However, Senior Manager/Executive/VP/GM are generally the first to get redundancy packages when there is a cost-cutting measure. If you are in a sales position (non-leadership role), you have about 6 months to 1 year to prove yourself to stay in the job. Reducing sales pipeline and your target DOUBLES each year!

- Slow career progression. Only when there is an opportunity is when someone goes to a competitor. There are many internal politics at play and behind curtain deals. They already have brought someone from other business segments to fill in the space. However, for hiring compliance reasons, they would advertise the role and interview others just for the sake of it. So don't expect any career and personal development.

- Most leaders lack skills, experience and knowledge compared to other competitors.

- It was only bearable before the pandemic, during COVID, and now, the company has no strategic direction. TARGETS are unrealistic, and there are no exceptions."

WFH once or twice was allowed before the pandemic, and they have made efforts to review what other supports can be given to employees since then. At managerial level, this is a place to learn as much as you can to grow at a rapid rate, but you must accept the workload and stress that comes with it.","Lots of turnover. There is equally as many people holding roles for a year on average before leaving for competitors or people who leave after several years at Amex without promotion.

Great rotation policy (your leader expect you to change your role within 2 year);","Closer to 'Finance' than 'Tech' compared to other Fintech company, slower moves in fintech industry. Not using the best tech in the industry, always following. 
Innovations usually happen in M&A or VC part of the company (buy startups instead of launching risky features directly), not in your day to day work. (If you happen to join the startup team in Amex, you won't be able to enjoy the great WLB)
Unclear career path on manger level - there's no IC upside ladder, you have to move to leadership path if you want to go up - therefore tech/ analytical skills are not that valued compared to communication or upper management. (this is biggest issue)
tradeoff - No RSUn and only a very modest profit sharing into your 401k account... salary quite not comparable to other fintech... but you also work less hours...."

No flexibility on schedules, PTO, etc. They even dictate when you can use your Paid Sick time ..they seem to think people can control or predict when they will be sick. Team leaders have no accountability…mine was always making a smoothie, getting coffee, cooking dinner , or dealing with children when I needed assistance. When she was available she was unable to grasp the issue I needed help with and I had to spend call handle time explaining it to her.

1145,,Join if you’d like to ruin your life,2021-10-04,1.0,Customer Care Representative,"1. Nobody bothers you outside working hours
2. Decent money (only if you’re just starting)
3. Brand name","1. People here only care about the business and not 1% about their employees. They would sweet talk and potray themselves as extremely professional and the sweetest most understanding people on the planet, but are the exact opposite.
2. Every single employee I’ve know for the 5 years is extremely frustrated and if only working there because they’ve got no other choice.
3. Growth is slower than a turtle walking
4. They make you work like donkeys and pay you pennies 
5. Most of the managers hardly appreciate the work you do. They’re only best at pointing out your flaws
6. One of the worst parts of the job is they’d make you work at unnatural hours, completely disregarding something known as the body clock! One month you’d be doing an early morning shift and it would take a 360 degree turn and you would get a crazy graveyard shift the very next month. Instead of a gradual transition, they would just suddenly throw the next shift at you. 
7. Probably the only organisation where you aren’t allowed to reschedule breaks. You miss your ‘15 min’ break, your fault, even if you’re helping customers. And you sit for hours and hours without taking breaks. 
8. The work is so monotonous, you’d want to kill yourself. The same thing every single day. No learning, no growth opportunities, nothing new to look up to.
9. Absolute disregard for mental health. 90% of the top tier managers don’t even know what terms like ‘therapy’ is. And ironically they have a wellness program.
10. You try to give them feedback, they’ll turn it back on you, make it your fault and you can do nothing about it. We’ve been told to give anonymous feedbacks, but somehow these ‘anonymous’ feedbacks reach the leadership and they would make your life living hell thereafter. 
11. The attrition rate in this organisation is sky high, but they still have the audacity to tell people to ‘just leave if you can’t work’ without and inch of shame."

Also you dont get any break between calls you just have to take one after another after another. You only get a role/promotion you are going for if you have brown nosed the ""VPs"" otherwise there is no career progression. They tried to sack me as I needed to have my tonsils removed as I kept losing my voice and they would send me home rather than let me take a small break between calls, i never once asked to go home yet one day they say I've had too much time off!

You are expected to take on new roles with no proper training, barely an overview, and no additional pay. Ample PTO but cannot really take it when you need or want. Very high volume with a bunch of entitled people, very stressful. Sales is now mandatory and a top priority. Employees are definitely not treated like the customers. High deductibles and insurance not great."

6. You have ample opportunity for growth (learning opportunities are immense).","1. Clear difference between Indian Managers and the ones outside.
Some of the ones in India have a Boss(them) to Slave or Servant (you) mentality. It's sick and a mental harassment. 
2. Salary raise is on the lower end and vertical movements can be slow unless you have Tier 1 college education or certifications (that can cost of thousands really).
3. Reporting an older employee (some of them are fossils here, 15 years+ in the org.) for unacceptable behavior in almost sure to have ill effects for you. They claim to be transparent and that it has no impact on the reporting party but its far from reality."

It is a serious company that walks slowly because it walks firmly. People are good and it really is a great place to work.","It is a bank. No matter how cool the new tech behind the screen looks, banks move very slow for safety concerns. Although those concerns are very well founded, the paranoia makes for work to be extremely focused on security and development is hard since there are so many security features. Also the work can sometimes become somewhat boring for creative minds and vertical mobility is very slow. However, depending on our career priorities in a specific moment of your life, I really do believe that the Pros far outpace the Cons."

The work/life balance is also excellent.,"Amex does not give their employees the salary they deserve. If you come into the company at a certain price, they'll low ball you every time you get promoted. Some divisions also have a very strict promotion cycle.

There is an auto answer phone system which was brought in while working from home with no regard to personal living situations. All the team leaders concentrate on is agent availablity and not loosing calls. There is no support for the actual job as the team leaders do not even know how to use the systems. There was a reduncency scare during the pandemic which saw many talented and tenured individuals leave. The travel and lifestyle team is now so understaffed it's unbearable working conditions. New employees are currently in training and will be expected to hit the ground running. The Membership Manager position is a joke and card members no longer receive the personal service they once did. There are no suppliers for anything and most of the time agents are just googling answers for Card Members. There is a pay for performance bonus scheme which makes no sense. When you question it you get beat down. Some months you could get £1.00 or £200. If you don't agree with something you are basically treated so badly that your only option is to leave.

Has brilliant people in the Risk side. Probably the best strategy teams in Risk management are at AmEx, years of experience does actually make the difference here. Risk and Operations are probably the biggest drivers or revenue at AmEx. 

Polite leaders and people. 
Its a feel good on your face kind of place. You will barely ever receive negative feedback, or any criticism. Great place for people who do not like being told truth to their faces. 

Overall a great place to be for someone who has a side hustle and need a job for the sole purpose of a job.","Legacy IT systems, imagine a BigData financial analytics company still working on SAS !

Everything takes too much compliance time. From super slow Database systems to super slow project management and backend systems. Most crucial things at such a great firm still rely on Internet Explorer to open them, beat that !

Although this might not be an issue for most people who are used to slow pace at workplaces, but for someone from the new blood and recent graduate world and low patience, you will probably face existential crisis on a regular basis. 

Negligible tech learning. Barely any scope to drive projects and make a difference.

Basically the dream sold to you by their amazing brand for hiring, just does not stand up. Atleast won't if you are from Tier1 universities. 
 
Too much diversity push!
Promotions have baseline tenure criteria. Then your ratings (which is honestly a funny system). Then how well you might know people. Then if you are a diverse candidate or not. Merit might take a backseat at times here, diversity is more important for their brand. 
Eg. If the bar for a position is to obtain 70/100 points, and if you fetch 96/100 you might still be rejected for a 'diverse' candidate with 71/100 points. Not sure if this culture is good or bad for the company, but it is sure ah not good for many employees. 

*diverse means : females, and other lower represented groups. In India, it only means one, guess which one!"

Extremely competitive environment. It's an excellent place to grow your career from start if you're competitive and ambitious, but not empathetic.","It's nearly impossible to succeed in the engineering director role if you're hired from an outside firm. Amex has a cut-throat competitive culture, constant chase for numbers, lack of attention to individual colleague's needs. Many Directors are required to lead often times upwards of 30 people without the ability to re-structure the reporting relationship. Consultants are mainly treated as numbers, however full-time colleagues enjoy significant benefits, such as 6-month child-care leave, while the rest of the team is expected to pull the burden of delivery.
The leadership expects innovation and delivery of exceeding outcomes at every step of the way, beating your past numbers is not rewarded, it's expected - personal sacrifices that mid-level leaders make to keep the team spirit up and deliver on these needs often do not matter. Every month engineering has some kind of a competition and there are numerous favorites on multiple teams that persistently winning the game, while no one cares about specific people. It's all about the numbers. Budget decisions drive every major decision. Very few team members have significant tenures unless they're in a competitive senior leadership roles."

 credit rights to to Credit Acts and Violations. 3)Three-of-three new mothers who were promised the 22 weeks of Maternal Pay in the 2.5 yrs I was there, all had issues with getting paid on-time and were not instructed properly initially on how to submit by HR then told it was their fault for not submitting correctly(while away after the fact). 4) Different area's like in-Customer service are worried about Their CFR metrics then helping the client, In-Credit more worried about their ACM metrics then helping the clients, 96.5 % of the time different departments(fraud , travel, opening, commercial) screen calls when I was internally trying to get help for clients. They all would NOT take calls unless they would get credit for their metrics by, Using filter questions before they would accept a call internally. 5) When issues arise company asked all reps to document and obtain coding, all the analytic work to solve your issues that Operations Analysts are not doing, you are expected to document this all while your talking to a Card Member or counting against you while you are in after call waiting time counting against your metrics. 6)The Company Campaign that they are ""Putting the Customer First "" in Aug. 2018 has not changed, the Amex culture is very disturbingly embedded of a culture of commission incentives, is still, as I left the company April 29th 2021. 7) Company allows you to uses your sick time and PTO that they load in the beginning of the year of 120hrs and TL's approve time for CCPs like candy when sick time of 90hr is not being use appropriately as sick time, 99% of sick time is used as a personal time request and managers put it in for reps. creating a very volatile workplace and not consistent hours works by employees a violation of company reporting standards to regulators."

AmEx is more transparent in terms of policies when compared to other financial services companies, and they try to treat employees well. They try their best to put the customer first.","Many folks are leaving. Every day I get multiple notification emails that people are moving on. Morale is low. Compensation is really not competitive for today's market, and there were no raise increases for 2021. In the last couple of years it's been very apparent that people are coming here just to get the company name on the resume, take advantage of the long parental leave, and move on. Unless you have a family and a very long commute, where the work-life balance is extremely important, chances are that you will probably not be incentivized to stay for a long time.

2127,,A good experience to have in CV but not for a long term job,2021-05-08,4.0,Lifestyle Manager,"- a big company that you can learn a lot or build your connection with other colleagues from various departments, they often have cross-department events or groups
- they respect the staffs overall
- salary is above average as a customer service role in HK, with good package such as medical insurance","- work shifts
- very stressful because they spoil their members very much (due to the nature of the job), they do not have a decent database,  system is old-fashioned, not many supportive partners in the list, hardly to find support to fulfil the requests
- basically you are like a personal assistance, one day the boss asked you to book a restaurant that no one can ever get a table for on day dinner, the next day he said he wanted you to do whatever researches. topics are always unexpected, you have to use your own way to solve problems for the bosses and they seldom appreciate what you did because they think AE can do everything, if you cannot do it by the timeline they set? they give bad feedback 
- cannot see the future for this role, there is no technique or skills and working experience here is basically just a call centre job nothing special. it sounds cool to be a lifestyle manager, but actually you use google to search everything like everyone else can do. getting bored and tired very easily.
- nearly no promotion chance even you have a good performance consistently, they would have a lot of ''reasons'' to tell you why (of course if you think twice, the reasons are not valid...), and just chose someone they like to be friend with. And they do not really care about operation, many agents did not follow standard of procedures and leaders just care about the KPI, but bare in mind that this is a financial institute...

I would say this is good to have an experience in this company for your CV, but if you are looking for a career instead of a job, my advise is do not stay in this role for more than 1year or you are just wasting your time, unless you really enjoy playing mind games with the clients."

Steve (CEO) is likeable, honest, and his priorities seem to shift with that of his employee base (e.g. a strong emphasis on D&I in 2020 and beyond).","Amex pays about 30% below market value against other financial institutions. It is also incredibly challenging to get promoted at Amex, and you often get stuck in a role for much longer than you'd like. Even when you do get promoted, there are VERY stringent guidelines about compensation attached to promotions, so it's hard to secure a significant raise at any given time. The annual review process is also extremely over-complicated."

The benefits are very good compared to similar size companies.

Amex is very open to allow working from home, often working 100% from home.

Amex largely lives its values, called its “Blue Box” values. Its employees buy into the values as well.

Pay is very competitive.

2335,,Culture pros and cons.,2021-04-13,3.0,Analyst,Receive annual raises for inflation.,Irrational employment ratings if 1 difficult customer with a challenging personality complains/ if another department messes up and the company receives a bad rating. It's unfair. No training to deal with difficult customers and an irrational expectation to have 100% customers happy. Doesn't matter if you have 99% of customers liking you. What matters is how many customers complete your surveys. And that 1 mean customer can highly skew your stats. Yet they don't have training as a whole at the company to teach you how to handle difficult personalities inside the company and outside of the company as you have internal and external customers. Lots of processes are old fashion taking 20 steps when it should only take 5. Extra work and less efficient. But nice in general.

Each team in Amex (at-least within Risk Management) is assigned to work on same projects for a long time. Anyone who wishes to work on diverse projects may start to feel disengaged soon. It is also not that easy to switch teams, as the leaders would like to tell you.
2. Too much red tape. Every minor change is under a lot of scrutiny and requires many levels of approvals. Makes it extremely difficult to challenge the status quo.

-Decent salary and benefits
-Flexible for and remote work policies (check Cons)
-Solid company that has been around for almost 200 years.
-Great brand values (check Cons)","-Your career path and the flexible policies depend on your leader: some people in one line of business may have flexible hours while some other people, doing a similar job, different LOB or manager, might be enslaved by their leaders or commanded to chair heating. HR is totally out of everything related to promotions, internal movements, career paths, etc. No support at all.
-A lot of managers, a few workers... You know what I mean: one is working, four are watching.
-Leaders do not have a clue about what they are doing. Apart from that, they usually do not get well with data and reports and do not give clear actionable feedback to their teams. You can be wrong at your decisions but at least deliver projects and guide your teams... Is not the case.
-There's no product development for the market, no IT or development resources...
-Self-service culture for everything, from invoicing your activities to hiring new people... You end up buried in administrative tasks.
-Despite company values (standing for equity, inclusion, diversity, supporting some important causes and movements...), the office is full of intolerants and snobs that complain about these values... Honestly, don't understand how they hire but most of the people are unbearable.
-Weird organization: There may be 3 directors for the same area. Some other people earn a lot of money but do nothing (and brag about it). However, hiring a new executive is like asking for a kidney......"

-Good health benefits,
-Fun colleague promotional events throughout the year
-Flexible work environment,
-Great CEO (he is very candid)
-Getting further in diversity and inclusion for employee groups/events.

Overall, a good place to start your career if you're interested in learning about the company, and enjoy the 9-5 work environment.","-Bureaucratic ways of management 
-Undervalues hardworking staff,
-Promotes often based on nepotism
-Slow to drive agile mindset across the company
-Lower wages compared to others in the industry, outdated technology, and not all leaders are promoted due to leadership abilities, more overly promoted for technical abilities or overall tenure. It's assumed, the longer you're here, the more you know- this is not always the case.

Buyer beware, if you accept an offer at this company- the furthest you might go comp wise is going to be very dependent on what you enter the company at. In terms of promotions, you must find influential leaders that can help get your name out and support your growth. If they are leaders who might not be as well perceived by their peers, you might not want to be associated with them for too long. 

Program teams have slow movement and multiple meeting requests- it can feel like you're going in circles to accomplish anything . There are alot of bottlenecks when multiple teams have to work together."

If you’re on a big project it can definitely help your career otherwise it’s sink or swim as nobody will focus on what you do.,"Given I saw hiring and year end rating processes it is even more frustrating in hindsight how this company focuses on playing favorites and making it incredibly difficult for some people to get promoted while others play the coffee chat culture and move up quickly while just delivering their work.  On top of that the salary is absolutely mediocre compared to other companies in NYC, especially in financial services.  Stay here too long and you’ll forget that companies are giving you total comp packages that are a minimum of 20% more for the SAME job level. Yet for a promotion here, I had to fight for a 8% increase and I wasn’t at the top range of my level.   Come here for a couple of years for the mat/pat leave benefit and get out ASAP."

Between cash bonuses, profit-sharing, and 401k match, there is a reason why my colleagues have spent 10+ years with the company. There are always trainings being offered to acquire new skills as well as programs to loan employees to other business areas in order to gain exposure. Lastly, hierarchy, at least where I am, exists only on paper. I have gotten as much 1-on-1 time with my VP as I have my director as I have my manager. If you seek to make connections, your efforts will be rewarded.","As with any large company, understanding where there are opportunities to advance your career can be difficult to find and navigate. There are resources to help, but not really guides on how to properly use those resources.

Insane amounts of PTO (7 weeks, the let you 'buy' an extra week)","I could write a novel on the cons. I was hired as an engineer, but I haven't written code longer than five lines since I started here. We just slap spreadsheets into tables, and voila! we're engineers.

Our leader is unable to make and adhere do a decision and severely lacks leadership skills. It has taken us nearly one full year to build a report portal. This is something that could have been done by a group of high school kids in a few weeks.

Trying to bring in external tools to make our jobs more efficient is nearly impossible. The red tape is so thick, it would be faster to build your own operating system than try to buy useful software.

The group I work for seems to want to find problems for their solutions instead of solving actual business problems. I heard a funny term, ""resume driven development"".

As mentioned in other reviews, AMEX is not a place to grow your skills, but a place to get complacent and cash checks. If you're eager to learn, grow, and do amazing things, keep looking. This is not the place for growth. If you're close to retiring and want to put your feet up on your desk for 7.5 hours a day, welcome aboard."

- There is absolutely no growth opportunities in this area. The product team isn't ""real"" product like at other companies -- its more product MARKETING and a lot of administrative work involved.
- The leadership on the team was not motivating, they were demeaning, and do not look to encourage employees in what they would like to learn. The folks on this team that caused the biggest headaches have now switched departments and/or left, however the management focused more on ""looking good"" to senior level management (i.e. EVP, VP, level) during fancy dinners and lunches.. vs being innovative and creating new solutions. 
- No sense of teamwork, and mostly a lot of backtalking"

Health benefits from day 1. Insurance is good overall...","Work hours are definitely not the usual 9-5. Everyone needs to engage working on a weekends and stat holidays. 

No work from home flexibility. 

Too much talk about your numbers. The way they talk about it is not motivating at all - it's just an endless pressure, as if you didn't reach your numbers on the first weeks of job training, ""something would happen"". 

They have this certification thingy going on for new hires. People have to worry about their 3 month probation period PLUS about getting ""certified"". They talk about it as if it was a degree or something like that. Guys, this is not University...

People talk about about career opportunities but I'm not sure I've seen this happening to my coworkers that have been working there for many many years. You do get a chance to moving from one department to the other (credit, new accounts, etc.), but at the end of the day you are still over the phone. I'm not sure how that plays out.

Over all an amazing company to work in. Although some things depend on what team you are in, my Pros apply to most of the company. Have not really seen bad culture/work life balance teams, but have heard of them through word of mouth. Great learning Financial Service opportunity without the hyper A Personality culture of the industry.","-PTO days do lack a little when starting as an Analyst. Due to the fact that holidays must be taken from your PTO totals. Also PTOs do not roll over or get paid out (You can buy PTOs and you get your money back if not used during the year). For me this balances out due to the work life balance I have.
-Health insurance has a high deductible even when getting the most expensive (even then not too expensive if Single or Married). This does balance out by being offered a HSA which the company contributes a sum at beginning of each year (which depend on your doctor would cover your copays).
-Layoffs and Reorgs. Like many companies you hear of layoffs and Reorgs which suck and it is a con. What many people do not tell you is that Layoffs usually occur at VP or higher levels and a Reorg usually gets a couple months notice and a package if you do not find anything. Again does not feel good if you end up in this situation (and hope I never have to be in it), but it is not like the movies where the same day you pack your things and go."

I was told that the diversity at Amex was a facade when I first started. I ignored the warning and didn't believe that an industry leader such as Amex could partake in discriminatory and exclusionary practices. There's a reason that discrimination is mentioned in Glassdoor reviews. It's prevalent. Amex claims diversity and inclusion in their Glassdoor intro and beyond for marketing and recruitment efforts only. They're checking a box because it's trendy and upheld by law, but there's nothing done in practice. HR does nothing to stop discrimination when reported and will protect their racist managers even when showing proof of discrimination and harassment.  The racial tension that's on display throughout the country right now is alive and well at Amex. You'll be shocked by the amount of stories that you'll hear about former employees leaving because of the discrimination they faced while working there. This is the reality. You've been warned."

4459,,PTO could be better,2019-11-25,4.0,Systems Analyst,Flexible and focused on technology and customers. Great culture.,PTO is deceptive because the number of days they give also includes all holidays.  So you are required to use PTO for any holiday.  Other banks will give you about 20 days plus all federal observed holidays.  That's around 27 days off per year.  Amex only gives about 23 days so that's translates to 16 days if holidays are not counted.

4481,,Very poorly organised team by inexperienced managers,2019-11-19,1.0,Employee Relations Specialist,"Friendly team members
Fairly interesting work
working from home options","Constant changes and decision making by management, promoting people with no management experience who then make a hash of things but the team gets the blame for work not in a certain style that hadn't been directed clearly,  while 2 people (33%) down and thus stretched already. This happens a lot because they are too slow to retain people who then line up new jobs and leave, who would have been asked to stay longer. 

They love to start people on fixed contracts, fine - but dont then offer an extension (this time agreed) only to pull it at the last minute citing poor performance. When challenged on why an extension has been offered if performance is so bad, newly promoted manager blames the other manager saying ""he didnt have time (6 months!) to check your work and realise its poor"" what a load of rubbish! Plus this, despite the VP giving regular positive feedback over the period and agreeing the contract extension. 
Said manager was promoted after 5 years as a team member and began to throw her weight around, the whole team agreed after just a week she was verging on bullying. One of the best things about being led up the garden path with a contract extension, only to have it mysteriously pulled, was not having to report to her any longer. It was a classic case of someone being good technically, so getting promoted, but then having zero management ability and a big ego. Seemed to be no support from VP to get her settled into the role properly and reign her in."

Also, depending on your role, you might be able to work from home if stakeholders are located in various time zones.","Lack of pre- assessment  (planning stages) to better prepare for resources, regulations and technical requirements which lead to delays in project and just being ill-informed.

No real examples of what the job entails. You learn as you go and fill in the blanks from talking to other confused colleagues. Not all but a good bit of Team Leads are rude and short with you. Asking questions will be hard because the department is run on a teach yourself attitude. Condescending leadership. Everything you do effects their bonuses so many are not friendly. I literally have only worked here 8 months and already looking for new employment. Working here has taken my 5+ years in travel and made me re think my degree and life choices. Lol. The customers are absolutely rude and treat you like servants. Ofcourse their are a few that aren't but most will rush you and demand the moon. There's so much more. Just make sure to take the things you may be reading seriously into account. Most of it is true. I looked at Glassdoor before my start and didn't take the things I saw seriously. I fully regret that now. I'm depressed and it's time to go.

4500,,Exciting time to be working in Technology at American Express.,2019-11-13,5.0,Engineering Director,"- Truly attempts to uphold what Amex calls ""Blue Box Values"". Not just lip-service.
- With recent transformations especially using the Technology-first approach, the company has molted from its state in the first decade of the millennium. 
- Like with any very large global corporation, cannot expect the agility of a startup but company places very high value on agility and speed of decision making.
- You are treated as a person, not just a body with a brain and hands.
- Senior management takes employee feedback seriously.","- Very large matrixed global multinational (couple more adjectives) corporation. Makes it a challenge to get a grasp on the who's-who in the company.
- Being a bank-holding company, technology decision making does get impeded due to strict government regulations around the finance sector."

Despite the positive reviews of Amex, this depends on the market.  Leadership will not recognise your efforts or provide opportunities for your career growth unless it is for their own self-interest.    

Even with the protests in hong kong, you are expected to perform and deliver to metrics and meet with clients endangering your own personal safety.    Lack of compassion for employees, only numbers matter- not your life.   

There is a general distrust of employees - stemming from top-down.  Think twice before joining."

Something as simple as taking off your headset to go to the restroom at your own discretion is not so simple at AMEX.

The problem with the company is that they speak a lot about having interest in their employees careers and growth however there is never any action from the words no matter how hard an employee tries to grow and accelerate their career at Amex.

What they didn't tell me is that AmEx keeps moving the bar further away as you get closer to the finish line.  The metrics are unfair and unrealistic to earn a regular bonus.  Every customer gets an opportunity to submit a survey, however, the LAST AmEX employee to speak to the customer, during each call, is upon whom the survey falls.  Therefore, if the customer speaks to collections first, and gets angry during the call, then collections transfers the call to you to discuss having misplaced their credit card, everything they say in the angry survey is credited to YOU.  One survey with a ""poor"" rating will cause you to lose your entire bonus for a rolling 3 month period!  Another unfair metric is counted when you assist a customer and they call again within 7 days.  Even if the customer calls back for a totally different reason, the fact that they called at all within 7 days means you did not properly assist them.  For example, if the customer calls you to pay their bill, then 3 days later calls again for a password reset, THAT is counted against YOU because the customer called back within 7 days.  This, too, counts against your bonus.  Further, there are no assigned workspaces.  Seating is in a first-come-first-selected area.  You are assigned a locker for your personal belongings, but change desks from shift-to-shift.  The workspace is approximately 20x40 with only a small panel between each desk.  That, coupled with changing each day, makes the area unsanitary, and presents a high risk of illness due to spreading germs."

4790,,Great work culture; need to back off on the multi-level approvals,2019-07-26,4.0,Manager,"- Amex has one of the best work culture. There are always ""activities"" to keep employees engaged. I love that we can bring ourselves to work, unlike other companies where you have to act a certain way. However, there are disadvantages to this - some people forget that they're in a professional environment and should act with respect and (real) courtesy. 
- The benefits are great. 
-  The Corporate Social Responsibility team does a great job raising awareness, acting on its commitments, and pushing employees to give back to their communities through service or donations. However, I would like to see Amex go beyond sustainability initiatives.","- ""Alignment"" is a term that I never thought I would hate. Everything (even the most minuscule thing) has to be reviewed by each level before it can go out. This delays projects and is rather counterproductive, but yet Amex continues to do it. 
- This year, the company launched a campaign that focuses on the employee culture. It's supposed to include internal, but at the moment is focused on external applicants and sharing ""why is great to work at Amex"". I haven't seen much benefits so far. 
- There are too many tenured employees. While they do bring value, there's not enough out-of-the-box thinking or fresh perspective. Everyone speaks in Amex-speak, which can come off as cultish.
- It is very hierarchical - I've never seen a company so fixated on hierarchy. I would never recommend, with experience, come in as an Analyst because the benefits suck - like they have less vacation days (WTH). Fortunately,  they're now finally eligible for bonuses.
- I get strategy change, but Amex takes re-orgs to another level. In my less than 2 years at Amex, there have been many re-orgs. I'm anticipating there will be a big one based on movements. 
- The salary is lower in comparison to  similar companies. The bonus is not bad."

I'm excellent at sales but this is a whole new level.,"1.  Since focus has changed to hardcore sales management and leadership treat you like a number.
2.  Reps know more than their management who only know how to copy and paste.
3.  If you're amazing at customer service and average at sales, they will never acknowledge it
4. To advance in the virtual environment you have to be kissing management Butt by laughing at their dumb jokes.
5. Expect a lot of interim roles which allow management to test out how much you kiss butt, if not enough...back to the phones you Go.
6.  The India and Manila centers hardcore force sales down card members throats.  And their communication skills between other departments lack.  And they cold transfer poor survey calls to U.S. Reps
7. Card members a entitled and defending as if you are beneath them.
8.  Tech team we reach out to for troubleshooting our computers and phones from home aren't nice.  So good luck getting help.
9.  Team leaders make commission off us reps so they hinder you and talk you out of applying for advanced positions as that will cut their pay.

Job security is decent. Be a top performer and you will never need to worry. Also they love it/value when people stay in the same field for 20+ years. They treat you well.

It is a good starting point at American Express.

Vacation time is a nice amount if Full-time.

They are good at meeting you where they can. The minimum, average, and maximum hourly pay is accurate on Glassdoor. So negotiate.

Potlucks and parties are good. Co-workers really make the days go by faster.

You can move to a different department after 12 months (see cons).","Unfortunately, if you want to move to a different department it is hard. Leaders/Managers will get discouraged and possibly jealous if they hear you want to move. Be tight lipped if that is your goal. Seen too many people passed on for leadership roles because they mentioned they want to move to other departments.

Leaders do not like it when you discover things sooner than them or know more than them. They get intimidated, which is human. 

Hours can be tough if you lose out on shift bids. 

Good luck taking off on major holidays.

If you dream of more than answering calls all day, this career path may not be for you. 

Some people have MBAs, MAs, BAs, or Associates. Some people have life experience. Some people have little to no experience. All are paid the same.

A new recruit can surpass you in a few months because seniority is not important anymore. Performance is the new seniority. 

No discounts on cards."

All necessary work equipment is provided by the company (laptop, printer, docking station, monitor, etc). The job requires you to travel to meet with existing clients but the company either pays for your mileage or they allow you to rent a car. 

Management has been terrific, in my experience. I feel like my directors and VPs have my back and I don’t live in fear of termination if I have a slow month or quarter. Leadership is good about being transparent when change occurs and they set clear expectations. They are also really good about setting time for 1:1 calls and making themselves available when needed. This is important because working remote can sometimes be a challenge when you need help or have a question. 

The final thing I’ll say is that the paid time off is very generous (and you can buy more) and the company doesn’t let your PTO roll over into the next calendar year. This is amazing because it encourages people to take their PTO without guilt or fear of backlash.",The only cons I can think of are the standard ones that come from working with a big company.

Some fresh out of college ""consultant"" recommendations rewriting the core authorization platform (currently written in Assembly language) in Go and leadership takes it under serious consideration.  LOL!!!  Really? 

Again, they're trying to be something they're not and that spells disaster for the ""workers"" that have to ""tow the line"" to meet unrealistic demands while dealing with constant reorgs and cost cutting initiatives.  It used to be that Lead Programmer Analysts should be SMEs and team leaders that didn't code much at all.  Now, even the VPs are expected to be able to write code and pass coding exams if applying  from outside of the company  and that is just a tad ridiculous.

4904,,German speaking Credit Specialist - Brighton,2019-06-19,1.0,Credit and Collections Specialist,"- Your colleague’s will often be nice and interesting people, which helps ‘survive in the jungle’
- Company benefits","- No ownership of your time and work flow
- No space for personal input
- Strict application of processes 
- No spectrum for personal development
- Awful management 

You will be working in a call centre environment, so be prepared to have to justify yourself if you need a personal break. Your entire activity will be controlled and monitored by ‘metrics of productivity’ which are in fact counter productive, since you can’t expect people to function like robots. 

Obviously this is not something my hiring manager told me in the interview otherwise I’d never ever have taken the job. 

She sold it to me as a client relationship management role which is a very different thing. A lot of things will be promised to you in the interview, as they are so desperate to find people to do this job. Very few of these things will be true and that’s a hard reality to swallow once you realise it.  Within the 9 months I stayed in the role, 14 people have come and go and that tells a lot. To justify this they’ll come up with excuses such as ‘the millennial generation’ - hilarious!!!

Good luck to apply for another role that would suit you better: you’ll suddenly hear about a 12 month rule that stops you from applying for another role. If you eventually you get your ‘Leader’s’ approval to attend the interview, she’ll come up with the last minute excuse that HR have opposed to it. Well, if you call HR they’ll tell you that you could attend it, with your leader’s approval.
I let you make-up your mind on this one.

Again, good luck if you can stand all that non-sense and make a request to work one day less. You will be asked to give reasons for that and be prepared, ‘improve your work life balance and personal well-being’ given how monotonous and repetitive your work is wont be enough. Your lovely ‘Leadership Team’ might well want to refer you to occupational health, because they’re concerned you might have mental health issues - wtf!? 

This was probably the worse experience of my career. Awful management. It gave me nightmares and caused me a lot of stress. That’s not a place where you’ll develop your skills and grow your career. Good if you have no plans, I guess it pays the bills. If you’re ambitious, avoid the place at all costs. Still thinking about what this experience brought me and I can’t think of anything except a waste of my valuable time and I’m so glad I left."

1. The work life balance highly depends on your manager and teammates. In my case, the situation is really, really bad. I devote extra hours in the night as well as on weekends.

2. I expected to get some recognition after all the hard work that I've been doing, but all I get is more work and complete neglect from the manager. I've raised this concern to him several times, but every time he questions me about what work I've done even though he is the one who directly assigns projects to me. 
 
3. Even after being an FTE here, I get less flexibility in terms of work-from-home and shift timings as compared to the vendor resources. Moreover, they are free to take as many leaves as they want, since my manager doesn't care to check their inputs and logs. Every little work is pushed on to me.

4. I can easily see and prove that I have accomplished more work than any of my teammates, but not a single word of appreciation has come my way. On the other hand, even those who openly boast about taking long holidays for leisure trips are lauded for petty things.

5. At Amex, the HR doesn't exist. There's no exit interview for employees who are leaving and they don't even have the right to mention the reason for resigning. The director will write whatever reason he wants. There's nobody an employee can go to if the director isn't listening to his or her problems. 

6. In my team, only 2-3 people who are close to the director will get farewell party or b'day celebration. For others, the teammates and the director won't even realise that they're missing until some work comes up. This has created an atmosphere where everyone is buttering the director. Sincerety and hard work hold no value here."

Newly formed teams are great. Not so much the same for teams with directors who are in the company for more than 10 years . They do not connect with people well.","Well .. where do i start ?
Politics is clearly visible in every decision taken including how parking spaces are allocated.  As for progressions , If you are a woman -  make sure you dress and make-up well to be recognised by inexperienced engineering directors(well they do not do engineering btw,they are team leaders conducting 1-1s) and in recent years 1-1 has been the most important meeting for anyone in Burgess Hill. Gentlemen - be prepared for your skills and experience and creative ideas to be overlooked if you are thinking skills,expertise and experience are criteria for progression .  Glorified leaders are looking for something additional which will not be your core skill that you are in the company for. Dont blame the directors though, it is few engineers who encourage them by giving importance which is unnecessary.
Which organizations allocates double parking spaces for leadership and denies a single parking space to other employees at lower bands ?

They do pay you well as a Travel Counselor . But you become a prisoner at your own home . Not worth the money .,"Hiring process was ok . The training was long , is about 12-14 weeks long .They cover so much unnecessary information , I feel like some parts of the training are useless and they don’t prepare you in any way for the real job . They want you to participate in class so be prepared for instructor to call your name if you’re quiet . Listen & Interact and you will make it . 

During end of training most our classmates wanted to listen to recorded calls so we could see the the flow of a call . They were never able to provide  a call from beginning to end with a a screen . They could only provided a few sloppy calls where they were just short & no screen just audio and not even a sale . We couldn’t believe that a company as big as Amex couldn’t provide a decent recorded call .They weren’t able to provide a clear  understanding on how metrics & surveys works. (It was probably our team lead who wasn’t well informed) . 

When you start taking calls be prepare to deal with customers who feel like they’re the queens . Some would talk down to you & be super rude . Most of the calls are from members who are well traveled and know what they want . You’re just an order taker , also be prepare to deal with multiple different systems at the same time .(always slow and crash often) you’re not allow to tell customers our system doesn’t work but you’re not allow for dead air . Customer don’t care to chat they would keep asking you to hurry up because they don’t have time . Also be ready to deal with rude employees.  if they’re training you they would talk to you as if you were 5 year old . You can also find them in other departments. They would just hang up on you or wound school you for “not doing your job “ correct ."

In 2017, the diversity in the mid-manager level of Risk department had significantly decrease as I observed. The upper executives promoted/hired his/her homies. Competency is not as important. The reorg was supposed to trim fat. However, AMEX became more bureaucratic with more redundant and incompetent mid-managers . As a result, smart talents were treated unfairly and there was a talents exodus in 2017 to 2018. 
- I still remember 2 years ago when my boss saw beef in my lunch box she would give me a stupid look, and sometimes gave me some hard time to humiliate me. THIS IS the U.S.. I am not up for whatsoever religious reasons and I LOVE BEEF. I didn't bother to report to the HR back then because I know the AMEX bureaucracy doesn't care.

It is a mutual admiration society, and on most days, resembles an incestuous clique. If you are part of the right team, and should be lucky to find a good leader, then all is well. If you find yourself on a team where you don't fit in, you will suffer a lot, as it is a consensus culture where your ideas will not be respected unless ALL members of your team agrees. The by-product of this culture is SUPER SLOW BUSINESS SPEED and total LACK OF INNOVATION.  They always promote from within, so its the same people in 12 different roles and titles. Same boring ideas, same pat on the back for mediocre group think.  Leaders are generally poor quality, even though they are forced to go through this Harvard leadership certificate program (most don't even show up to class or do their work but get the certificate anyway). There are few opportunities to move up as everyone stays around forever because of the benefits."

Expect to make less than all of your peers and to be told at year end that ""2%"" is a great raise!

Political garbage masked under the facade of jeans and sneakers. Make no mistake, everyone here is eager to throw you under the bus. I have never met so many mean people in competition with one another (as a result of poor leadership, also throwing their peers under the bus). 

Too many MBA's in mid-level management who don't know how to do work but frantically run around from meeting to meeting, giving the illusion of doing work. People with airs of self-importance over meaningless jobs are at every corner. What takes any other place a week would take Amex about 6 months - no one here is brave enough to make a decision and VPs are micro-managers who need their managers running through every rabbit hole before getting to ""yes."" And when something does take too long for a reason, there is always someone to blame, rather than the understanding that Amex is a huge company that requires a lot of back and forth and facilitation among the teams. 

It doesn't get any more political than this place, where you're valued on how many coffee chats you have, how pretty your decks are (for internal meetings. Did I miss the memo on needing an agency design degree to present to my boss?), rather than your work. ""Thought leadership"" constantly pushed, but then ideas are dismissed immediately. Incredibly de-motivating place to work when you have to jump through hoops and are encouraged to fake a personality if you are not exactly ""Blue Box.""

I've heard of someone whose leader now makes the team do two networking activities a week. This is more like summer camp where employees are scolded and babied rather than treated like adults with decision-making power. 

This place is utterly lacking in heart. The eagerness with which tones of condescension are employed rather than camaraderie and light-heartedness is astounding."

You can't gain experience in your current role unless you move into another role and support one thing.  There is too much specialization at the Manager and Director level in the company.  If you want to have a wide role with more responsibilities, you need to work 10 years doing 4 different jobs.  Of course, that's if a role opens, which they rarely do because nobody ever leaves their position.  Your career path is essentially a game of darts.  Good Luck getting a bullseye."

All job openings except the very most senior ones are posted openly on the internal job site.

Amex usually does not have the highest salaries in absolute terms, but it's always increasing its benefits. In 2008, it opened a backup onsite daycare for employees and their children. About three years ago, it introduced 6-month paid leave for new parents. And this year it introduced a new bonus program for entry level employees.","The focus on collaboration can sometimes be overdone, and we lose speed as we try to get consensus. As i mentioned, the salaries are not in the top percentile so you may be frustrated here if you value compensation above everything else.

You develop severe anxiety because your micromanaged, watched and listened to every single second of the day.  Every single thing about American Express is a con. Promotions are based off who you know, not what you know. The new upper management only cares about sales. Money is their only motive and if you’re not making them money in sales you’re deemed useless. Upper management has no idea how to coach people, and normally will only coach the people they want to fire. They will document, document, document until they have enough to fire someone. Professional growth is impossible since they never let you off the phones. And the people they do promote are the idiots that sucked up.

US citizens have poor job security.  Watched many talented individuals lose their jobs so that the company could hire replacements in India. Not because those individuals did not perform well, but only because they were tenured and at the top of their pay ranges.

It's a closed culture. Not really open to new ideas. Not inclusive.

The company is known for its customer service. And yet, product folks are stuck on their project code names and climbing up the ladder, while playing lip service to the customer's real needs and pain points.

 A glaring lack of empathy due to a culture of arrogance and self-absorption. You will hear ""This is Amex. We do not hire stupid people"" even in large meetings. And some people will laugh and cheer."

I also know of men in leadership who have touched women inappropriately, specifically platinum TLs.

2. Leaders working since last 5 or more years are the best people to work with. You will learn a lot from them which will eventually make you a better person.","1. Since their cost cutting initiatives have started from last 2 years, they’ve started hiring leaders from outside which are paid handsome amount but doing cheap tactics to save cost. Feels like a typical 3rd party BPO environment now. Even people working from more than 5 years feel the same.
2. Agent level jobs are most unsecure now since automation has kicked in most of the processes. You will not be sure when you’re going to be kicked out. I was part of a batch which was laid off suddenly without any notification as we were no longer required in the process. I don’t blame the company here, but the leadership team. Most of the lay offs are happening in India only as they have their one of the biggest offices outside US in India only.
I myself saw at least 4 top executives from executive board leaving after almost 15-20 years of career because of some or other reason just after cost optimisation started.
3. Now, a project that can be handled by 8 people if they work 9 hrs a day, is being done by 2-3 people on,y by working at least 12hrs a day. Work life balance has gone for a toss here especially back office operations. They are facing the maximum lay offs.

That being said, each of the three buildings have some type of store or cafe, and there are vending machines in every break room on every floor. I felt lucky to be working there when I would walk in the building. 

In addition to having great facility, the culture at this location is really interesting, and varies from team to team, department to department. People talk freely, and collaboration is easy to accomplish. I happened to have excellent leaders above me, who valued work-life balance, and took a practical approach to the logistics of accomplishing task.","While I was working there, parking was a nightmare. I have heard that a parking structure has been/is being erected, but I can't speak to its efficacy.  Another con is privacy. The facility is mostly open floor plan, long tables with low partitions and mounted monitors. Seats were not assigned, and reserving your seat was a very frustrating task for some.

Amex pays staff below the market average for wages across the board, unless you earn commission (which theyve even cut back on massively from customer services)
I have seen staff treated illegally and refused requests to see the occupational health dr because they werent believed, they ended up coming to work when they were unwell for fear of punishment

AXP is always looking for fresh talent to fill roles in the private cloud space and in sourcing support.","Once you get to a leadership role the rapid development and progress halts.  There is a very strict type of person that gets to go much further then Director or VP level at AXP.  The CIO and EVP are hand-in-hand the organization setters and is their way or the highway.  There has been lots of attrition since these two joined the company and they have been 'cleaning house'.  Most leaders can't stand them, some respect them, some 'respect' them out of fear as they wait for their options to vest.  There has been a massive talent drain from AXP in the past few years and many that have left have been much more successful at other companies.  I have seen Directors go to SVPs at other banks in just a few years.  That is a signal of how much talent suppression goes on at AXP and many realize to get promoted or to succeed they need to leave."

Not just people, but entire departments. Feels like a slap in the face when the company literally says ""We would rather pay someone in India or the Philippines $8 an hour than pay you a decent wage"". Also, like other reviewers have stated, the environment can get a bit toxic. Not in a ""there's alt-right trolls up in here"", but more of a ""management makes incompetent decisions that makes everyone feel nervous/uneasy"". While I was there, one of my co-workers pointed out to management that the monthly performance goals seemed to be shifting based on employee performance. What this means is that management would look at the previous month's results and shift the monthly goals based on that. This would create scenarios where ""low performing employees"" who were trying to make an effort to improve their stats (harder than it sounds) would still be considered ""low performance"" and be fired with no severance or benefits.

5655,,Too much brainwashing,2018-07-29,1.0,Anonymous Employee,Great company benefits and salary.,"- Management is constantly only talking about building relationships as the way to be promoted.
- Employee cannot fully be themselves, they have to blend into the mold the management want to create
- A lot of herd mentality, whoever who disagrees to them will silently suffer
- Micromanaging staff to the maximum
- Staff at lower levels all will suffer
- Although company discourages discrimination, discrimination happens all the time and there is nothing the employee can do about it. When a case is lodged over to the internal whistleblower team, the victim gets a serious repercussion, questioned by their leaders and they will try to take action against the reporter.
- Does not help employee who are not performing too well. While it is survival of the fittest in every big corporation, but AMEX in Malaysia is cold blooded. The management only keeps the people they want to keep.
- Country Executive Team tries to pretend to be nice and polite. Always try to brainwash the employees to vote for the company so that they can win JD Powers Award or AON Hewitt.. but the truth is, people are really afraid of doing otherwise because of repercussions. 

Even posting this in glassdoor is a risk to all the employees because they will silently investigate who the employee is and take action against them"

5677,,Its alright,2018-07-19,3.0,Senior Manager,A very strong brand. Lots of flexibility to work from home.,"Moving up is slightly difficult if you are not based in the HQ in NYC. Being based in Toronto, opportunities are very rare. If you are a part of the clique with certain senior leaders, then your chances are better than those who are not. Moving up from a starting level analyst level to senior manager might be pretty easy as it can happen as quickly as in 5 years. Moving up beyond that level is a little difficult as the opportunities slow down. If you are an external hire who joined directly as a manager / senior manager, you will have a tough time moving up to the director level since the current management gives preference to those who have been in the company in a variety of roles even though they may have less experience then you do. In a way, the company kind of ignores anything you did prior to joining Amex.  In some departments, Canadian employees don't get promoted even if they are very qualified. They end up promoting someone in the US HQ and bringing them to Canada. This really affects the morale of the team. In recent years, there has been a lot of employee attrition as many employees got better opportunities with competitors like Scotia. At the VP level it seems everything is fine as they keep getting broader roles and promotions. Its a case of rich getting richer. Across the entire Canadian business, have only seen one Director getting promoted to a VP role in the last one year."

5792,,Senior Analyst,2018-05-24,3.0,Senior Analyst,"Work life balance is unquestionably one of the reasons that Amex retains talent. Most teams work from home on Fridays. Casual work environment, people are extremely nice to one another, sometimes to a fault. 

People are really warm and they are all about the coffee chat culture to help advance your career and learn more about different business units which is great when you feel like your work scope is narrowed.","Sometimes its not just the work you do, its what people perceive of your work that can get you ahead. People are expected to move roles every 18-24 months generally on the lower levels (analyst, manager) but its a political process at any large organization. 

The rating system is down on a bell curve and people are rated against their peers who all have absolutely different goals and metrics. I wish Amex was similar to Goldman Sachs and abolish rating their employees with numbers, it is outdated and archaic. 

Lack of diversity in business teams is really frustrating at times. Being a part of a monoculture doesn't allow different thinking. 

What I also am disappointed in seeing in all of these glassdoor reviews is the lack of transparency in the ""displacements"" that goes on at American Express. Amex goes though many reorgs, usually 18 months on a wider company scale, but still occur on a yearly basis for many business units where people are reshuffled around. With this reshuffling, people are told they don't have jobs any longer, ""displaced"" and they have to apply for other roles within the company. I thought I was joining an established Fortune 100 company that has been around since the 1850s, but Amex still lays people off under the guise of being ""displaced"" and that still doesn't sit well with me.  So people applying to Amex should be cognizant of that.

No bonus for analysts which is super disappointing since they are the backbone and unsung heroes for many of the great initiatives going on at the firm."

5798,,ECP Group - This should be a case study in a business school textbook,2018-05-20,1.0,Software Engineer,"* Work/life balance is good and usually don't work after hours unless on call.

* Colleagues are friendly albeit don't talk to other ethnic groups much; tend to stick to their own cliques.

* Managers are very supportive of their direct reports","* Massive exodus of senior leaders and top performers last summer. Everything was reorged and the leaders that took their place made increasingly poor management decisions. They did not inspire or establish a vision or goal. Everyone saw through their forced optimism.

* Worst silo'd teams I have ever seen in my career. Seriously, this was even worse than a case study I read in business school. Work was often doubled, tripled, and quadrupled in some cases. People sitting 10ft away would never speak about what they were doing design wise and other teams would flat out refuse to collaborate.

* Common to have production outages due to the most abysmal IAM I have ever seen.

* The most tedious and complicated CM system I have ever seen. Someone's job is literally to fill out CM. No, I am not joking.

* This is a MASSIVE H1b shop. That's not a problem, many companies do it and do it well see: Apple, Facebook, or Google. However, this office is probably ~90% H1b's. Just keep in mind the cultural differences may make it difficult to build friendships or report.

* Contractors are commonplace here. Management is unable to get FTEs (see below).

* Compensation is quite below average for the area. If you are going to be in Palo Alto and not be a sexy startup, you need to pay high salary or bonuses. You are competing with FB, GOOG, NFLX, and AMZN. Talented engineers are turning down positions here due to compensation. This leaves management to hire the bottom performers. I do not believe this org has a ""bar"" or if they have one it is pretty low.

* Managers/Directors would go behind your back to skip levels if you disagreed with their designs or requests.

* Managers/Directors only want to prove their worth to their manages/directors. No semblance of a unified vision or direction. Everyone is out for themselves.

* Documentation is sparse, incomplete, and out of date. You will be lucky for someone to even leave a comment about a library function.

* Rats fall out of the ceiling (actually happened)."

As a company American Express is failing miserably to maintain its position in the credit card business of which they once were the leaders. For the past few decades all they have done is launch various fancy looking credit cards but failed to think of ways to revive/innovate the modes of payments. I mean, it took companies like Paypal, Apple, Samsung to come up with innovative ideas to make payments.

 The top leadership consists of people who graduated from various unrelated streams like English literature, psychology and were probably classmates with Bob Hope and obviously think the best way to cut down on expenses is to lay off people or move departments to India. The people who are laid off are usually the band 35’s and lower. The VPs who generally are band 45s and up  remain unaffected. Not to forget, there are several layers of VPs. There are more VPs in a department (band levels ranging from 45 to 65) than the people who are actually hands on and working.

Coming to the technologies at Amex, it does not matter if you spent a good part of your life getting education (a BS and an MS in CS), you would be reporting to directors who are not even from the engineering background (being a BS and an MS in Computer Science from an accredited University in USA, I reported to a director who had a Pharmacy background and had nothing to do with computer science/technology). Kudos to the legal team to even justify his H1-B managing engineers. If you want see the H1-B abuse, you should work at Amex. People with textile engineering background are on H1-B and working as Lead architects.

You get promoted only if you are the favorite of your VP and you don’t question any of your leader’s authority. I have seen couples working as VPs (both husband and wife are VP) in the same technologies department, reporting to the same Senior VP, not sure how have they been able to fool the system. Don’t even get me started on the contractor culture.
They hire contractors from companies you have never ever heard of. For some contractors there are layers of contract companies behind. Most of the contractors cant even speak English properly leave alone writing elegant piece of code.

Most of your time on a daily basis is spent typing emails to other teams that you are collaborating with on a platform. No body/team really owns up if something breaks/needs fixes. You will end up spending most of your time trying to explain the flaw and ultimately things get done only if you CC your VP in the email. God forbids if you are trying to get access to a system. It took me over 5 weeks to upload images on an internal image hosting server since I didn’t have access to it. Your access requests need approvals from not only your manager but a couple of VPs.

In the name of cultural events they celebrate Indian festivals,  perhaps a no brainer since Indians are the majority here. Never could really comprehend, how doing a fashion show in funny looking Indian outfits was celebrating Asian culture. Come on now, there are so many other countries in Asia. 

Every VP conducts a quarterly town hall. You can imagine the amount of time you waste attending those, given each department has a dozen VPs. And did I mention the presentation is more or less the same. I have been to town halls where they play videos of some south Indian/bollywood actor, now being a non Indian/asian not really sure what am I suppose to do with that or what has that got to do with quarterly town halls? 
At the technologies they even host some award functions. Somehow for the 3 years I have been there, I see the same handful folks sweep all the awards. The funniest part is, the same guy can win a platinum reward, gold reward and silver as well. Can Hussain bolt win the gold, silver and bronze at once??"

5888,,American Express Travel,2018-04-06,2.0,Travel Counselor,The company itself is really awesome. There are many benefits if you are a platinum travel servicer that to some-may make the job worth it. The pay is really good for an entry level call center job and you start earning sick days and PTO immediately. There is a 4 month training period in which you are also paid for.  For the most part- everyone is really nice. Have to think if the pros outweigh the cons for your situation.,"The job is extremely stressful. In the first few weeks of on the job training several people cried and I heard from people who have been in the position for a while that it is very normal to see people crying because this position is so stressful- not really something I think should be a job ""norm"". There are several systems you use and while a few of them are user friendly the others are not. Not to mention your systems crash, act weird, and can be slow making your calls awkward- but you are never supposed to mention faulty systems to customers. Management pretends to listen to feedback but nothing really changes. Customers are terrible but we are supposed to bend over backwards for them: survey results are the biggest drive. You are graded on almost everything for you call. Although this is a decent paying job- way to much stress and pressure put on call center employees. My biggest letdown for this position with ""growth"". All over you would hear about how people would say that there is so much growth in the company and if you stay for a year you can move into different departments or get promoted. What management failed to realize is that a year is a very long time to do something you do not like. Secondly the ""promotions"" are positions that do not take you off the phones but instead have you dealing with even wealthier customers, or working on different travel needs. Sometimes people get promoted to become coaches or leaders. If you are a leader you are basically micro managing people or just walking around answering everyones questions."

Nobody here gets a specific job because they have experience or the right things for the role, it's always about who is your buddy.
- never expect credit for something you've done, you can have had the best stats for 6 months but nobody will care or give you credit for it, especially if you're working for another market than UK. 
- changes will come and they will never be planned enough.

They talk a good game, but when it comes right down to the nuts and bolts of the company,  the managers and supervisors were all company oriented.....probably due to politics..  Very political company especially when it comes to management.  You don't want to step on their toes--otherwise you are out the door.  They did not stand behind me when a vendor was verbally abusive-eventually let  me go from the company as a result of it.  I was a top performer- received multiple accolades and perks from clients.  But if management  did not approve of the gift from a Centurion or Platinum card member- they made you return it.   I worked for it - (in the customer's  eyes, therefore  I should of been able to keep it.

Obviously it’s. not near the level of Facebook and other tech companies where food is completely free but at AmEx, there’s always some event going on where you can nab something to eat for free at least 2-3 times a month, and especially during the end of the year.  

The only con about working here is I gained a lot of weight so I’m trying to work it off by walking the stairs, personal training, and yeah now passing up the free bagels, ice cream and donuts. At least there’s a gym!  I love working here even if it made me fat."

Have sat around and waited 5 months for a simple fix. 

On my team, they managed to break so much work over such a short period of time and act completely clueless about it. Turns out, one person manually ran a script monthly, and only she was on the email if it failed, then it failed for months and months while she was gone. We check and mountains of data is missing.  When this was brought to their attention, we realized nothing is automated, their code is sending in duplicate data, they didn't test anything and it happened for months. The response is the typical 'Uhh.. can you test our stuff for us?""  It is unreal this is allowed at a professional level. Ask yourself, do you want to be an engineer or project manager when this is the level of talent Amex?

Management doesn't care because Amex views IT as a cost-containment and not an competitive edge. All their 'Big Data' systems are abhorrent. They're horrendously slow and poorly maintained. To date, after working at many Fortune 50s, Amex has the single worst systems I've ever experienced. Simple SQL queries take  5 minutes. Nothing is properly optimized because it's all outsourced.

Level 40 and above (directors) get 'Diversity' as a goal. Hire women and minorities, basically.

Legit, working here with such a low-cost outsourced model is unbearable. Most American Express workers have been there so long, they know no better. To them, dealing with this level of absurdity is all they know.

Was recruited back after 20 years and found that front line folks are not appreciated.  Punitive management style.  Cardholders send in surveys that you may not have had anything to do with aside from answering the phone.  The surveys dictate your schedule bid (once or twice a year) and one bad survey can put you so far down the list you are working nights and weekends.  My team lead was incredibly condescending..no one on our team respected her. We started with 18 highly experienced agents in our training class, a year later only 6 are left.  And they are looking for other jobs.  Very little management support.  Also, the new online booking tool, Encore, was a bust...very disappointing considering the fact Amex piled millions into the product.  I lasted 8 months, was productive and had zero customer complaints but I just couldn't stomach it anymore and I left. .  It is not pleasant being a highly valued and skilled agent for 30 years only to be treated like you are expendable.  Not worth it."

The most political and beauracratic place I've ever worked in; you're promoted not based on merit, but who you know and sucking up, yet leadership will not hesitate to tell you the many ways you can improve. Too much focus on feedback doesn't leave room to do actual work.  Pay isn't even close to competitive. 1% raise year-over-year is not even on par with inflation. Culture is masked niceness with secret back-stabbing and politics constantly. Work can be very duplicative and documentation for the sake of documentation."

You'll always have to manage up, your boss doesn't know how to manage you.  Your boss may not even understand what your projects entail because all they do is report up to their VP.  Too many levels and so much redundancy, a really frustrating experience and inefficiency everywhere.  Digital transformation is a joke, agile is a joke when you have 20+ people on a conference call.

I have a team leader who is bad at her job, and everyone is aware, though she happens to be best friends with our Dept. manager, so the politics are heavy. Most can recognize my quality but none of that matters apparently when your TL doesn’t put any energy into seeing you succeed or even taking the time to know you and your qualities. If I were to apply to another position within the company, it would all be based on her vision of me... but she doesn’t have an accurate one. Over all, I feel stifled in the travel department even though I kinda like the type of work I do and the people I get to speak with.

Yay for us women holistically, but from the inside perspective it's not as diverse as one would think. Fair warning, this will be very direct. White women at this company simply love hiring other white women. Looking at some of the micro-organizations here, it's as if they are arming themselves against diversity in thought. Make no mistake, there are heaps of ethnic backgrounds at Amex, but  the majority will be found in the bottom half.  To use myself as an example, I've been honored with the highest year-end rating possible, have the support and confidence of layers of senior leadership and I've been up for a promotion for nearly 9 months. I've been on 8 total  interviews in the past year, studied rigorously for each,  and have been succeeded by a white woman each time  (I wish this was an exaggeration.) Not to mention that each of these jobs  were interviewed  exclusively by white women. It's more than a coincidence. I won't hold this singular observation accountable for my personal experience, but I would urge the leadership of this company to expand their ideals about the eligibility, skill, and intellect of those who aren't a married or engaged young white woman. Much of the stellar and hopeful Amex talent end up accepting external opportunities."

Also, the people, you get to work with very talented and smart individuals. Finally, if you work hard and deliver climbing positions (up to the Director level) is relatively easy. Depending on your team your work and contribution will make sense and you will be actually able to see (and even use) what you created. Also, at least in the engineering dept, senior leaders try their best to showcase their vision to their teams so everybody is clear on what is the objective and what is expected to achieve.

In terms of benefits, PTO is the best perk, you get plenty of it and basically are free to take it whenever you want. Also the tuition reimbursement and health insurance is ok, it is not very expensive, has good coverage but the deductible is high. 

Salary-wise I believe is not bad to be honest, could be better, but not bad.","If I say it’s people in the Pros I need to say it’s people in the cons as well. There are plenty of unprepared, with lack of vision tenured employees, which makes everyone’s life harder. Their unwillingness to help and support other teams is exhaustive to a point that people quit because of this (even me constantly thinking about it) it is an inexplicable level of laziness, that basically shames everyone else in the enterprise. I would say the constitute maybe 20-30% of the workforce, hopefully in some years this isn’t a problem anymore as I know that amex is trying to hire talented and prepared individuals. Believe me when I tell you that dealing with people who are there just for a paycheck and nothing else is EXHAUSTIVE.

Then after this is bureaucracy, you may lose days, weeks and even months getting alignment on next steps on projects.  I have been in a situation that I had basically nothing to do on a day just waiting on an email to come back and proceed (thankfully for the company I always try to keep myself busy helping others) This makes this move slow, the amount of time wasted on formalities is unmeasurable, and some times you don’t even know what is the purpose of what you’re doing.

-majority of clients were fabulous","-no work/life balance - be prepared to work EVERY Christmas, New Years, Boxing Day, etc (originally they demanded you work 2 stats, then, even after they hired numerous people it suddenly became 4)  Mind you, of course, any of those above direct team leader NEVER work those days so they just do not care)
-promotions based strictly on favoritism, not education or experience.  Laziness and clock watching seems to be admired
-constant lies-to the point that you have to keep a copy of EVERYTHING. They will cancel your CONFIRMED vacation and the attitude is too bad, so sad (just did this to a co-worker that has already BOOKED a trip...employee too afraid to say anything as does not want to lose job after they laid off the most qualified, experienced and educated employees in two blocks in 2016
-you are set up to fail.  As an example, RTF.  The score, if negative, is often based on something that is COMPLETELY beyond your control (upset about half-truths told to them by the marketing team, travel policies).  Worse, sometimes a client will assign a 1 thinking it is best when it is the worst (you can tell the client loved you by the comments assigned).  When this is brought up, again, too bad, so sad
-more on the point above the company can magically alter stats when it benefits them but not when it is a benefit to you. Furthermore, as to RTF, how can you explain a score of 10/10/9/10/10/8/1/10...suddenly your RTF is 20%....that some spectacular math let me tell you
-terrible office morale, everyone is unhappy and miserable and over 10% of the staff is on either short or long-term disability (quite obvious something is VERY wrong as all those off can be linked directly to stress
-terrible scheduling - some employees are required to work 10-hour shifts, sometimes with double weekends, others forced to work staggered days off.  This
 shift will often last a year, two years (this is, of course, on top of working Christmas, New Years, Christmas Eve, New Years Eve and Boxing Day)
-management is abusive and sometimes misogynistic.  Management and some team leaders are COMPLETELY unqualified
-promised work at home and then canceled it.  This is AFTER they moved to an unsafe location (get it, to save money, but your employees lives also count) that is COMPLETELY isolated late at night (many shifts end 11 pm) as there are tons of unbuilt condos in the area that are obviously abandoned late at night.  If this is brought up to management you are construed as being negative and one (former, I think)employee was allegedly told not to worry as there are cameras)
-no FAMS or FAM budget, even if you use your vacation time (remember it is impossible to get time off).

-forbidden to speak out, even if it is of concern for life and safety.
-terrible facilities - no coffee machine, no plates or cutlery in the kitchen and absolutely NOTHING walking distance for those with no car (to get there and back on your dinner break), lights (it is a 10 minute walk through deserted area with no sidewalks or even proper lighting) are dimmed to near black as the important people leave by 6 pm and the rest of the building is vacant by 6 pm as well, toilets do not flush after 6 pm and no heat on weekends (was working on a recent stat and the temprature in the office was 15C...it was FREEZING...team lead went to facilites and told that temprature is kept at bare minimum on weekends and stats despite people working...I think it is intentional to save money

Incentive is mostly based on customer surveys. If you receive a bad survey you could lose a portion/all of your incentive that you worked hard for. Even if you received the survey by error and it clearly wasn't intended for you, they won't do anything about it and you will lose and incentive because of their error.
They penalize you for taking a bathroom break even if you have a medical condition and provide them with a doctors note.

Premium travel and call center can not be combined! Period. They will force you to take calls and no one cares you work on big sale/client at the moment and in the end ask you to achieve aggressive sales targets. You feel watched all the time (because you actually are) and not only by manager/team leader but I had feeling that colleagues are in a competition of rating you out by any reason and any chance they get.
Things take extremely long: if they say something is coming in quarter 1, expect it in quarter 4.
They laid off people and took on new market of calls at the same time which resulted in long waiting times and not happy clients. 
In general Amex is not the same as it used to be years ago and clients slowly recognize that as well!
Every 2 weeks you have a one on one coaching with your leader which lasts 1 hour. In reality it is even more often as you get pulled over to the separate room for every small mistake/comment about you. 
No work life balance as shifts can be between 7 am and 11 pm, weekends and holidays as well. Shift selection is only every 6 month or every year so if you stuck with no Saturday or Sunday off, you stuck for this long! 
Favoritism. 
Office moved form Downtown to North York because they are too cheap.
Outdated IT systems.
You measured against customer surveys that gets triggered by the call, so even if you very just doing transfer and customer gave you bad survey, guess who is going to be coached on it...you! You measured against a lot of things.
On interview they will tell you about quarterly bonus but they will forget to tell you that it is pretty much impossible to get it because it once again depends on many measurements.

I have watched people whom I have trained myself, be picked up and put in positions of authority in no time at all, because they are friends with the team leader. 

After bringing a huge problem with a team leader to the attention of senior management, one level and two levels above and also reporting to the ombudsperson, I know that nothing has changed.

- Good Benefits. 21 base days + 6 flexi leave etc. Pretty hefty Flex $ benefits. 

- Work Life balance in most teams (except crunch times). Get to leave early every last Friday each month.

- Hints of Senior leadership trying to improve the situation (See cons). To be fair, there are a handful of kind and great leaders within. Currently, most Team managers all seem decent, with the exception of 1 or 2 Support functions. 

- Superior Brand name. Though frowned upon for the costly tough to waive card fees, Amex is still best in class for customer service.","- Internal people culture. This is perhaps the largest Con. Promotes and Favours a certain ""Mould"". Those who don't get the short end of the stick, are spoken down to, or despised. It is especially disheartening to hear leaders bad-mouthing their own team members.

This is a Pro if you can deal/are comfortable with the following traits: Pretentious, Political, Judgmental, Ability to network and socialise well, ability to form Alliances/Cliques. 

There are chill and great people within Amex SG who are genuine, but numbers / motivation is dwindling. 

- Career development: Once again, same theme, play the game and you go up. Trip one mine and its over. Good Ratings sometimes mean nothing while poor ones get actioned upon. Be wary.

- Cost Cutting / unstable environment: Fresh from the wounds of cost cutting , with potential future re-org's on the platter."

6605,,Indian bureacracy claims another victim,2017-07-05,1.0,Engineer,"Okay health benefits, good vacation perks. Decent cafeteria, some people are nice.","Imagine getting up in the morning and getting ready for work, like always. Now imagine not having any control over anything in your house. The only control you have is a form that you fill to get access into ur restroom, brush your teeth for example. Imagine a person opening the door and holding your brush and he is  brushing ur teeth with it. You ask for another brush, maybe an electric brush, but they say that they don't have a template for this brush, they haven't heard of this brush and they don't have any training either. Either way, it's their hand and they will brush ur teeth the way they want to do it.


Similarly, imagine the same process for everything else u do in the morning.  Now imagine 1000 ppl living in your house . Ur house is big enough to accommodate all these people, but it's still their house as well. Their job is to make u get ready every morning and take over everything that u used to do alone. Not that u NEEDED any help, you sure as hell don't WANT any help, but the help is FORCED on you.

 

Now imagine all these people are smug and cocksure of their job security. 99.99% of them are from the  Indian outsourcing companies - unqualified and not interested in engineering. All of them are given the more challenging work while you are relegated to be a sitting duck, acutey aware of the frivolity and absurdity of your situation... A target for layoff. Imagine your boss, a robotic product of this environment, just doesn't give a damn abt your career. He just wants to impress his manager to get promoted. Agile is a word they use to get promoted and never practice. 


Imagine that you have nothing to do all day at work. You are depressed that you now have at least 50 people who do what you were in charge of in your previous job alone. You have to deal with a labrynth of political mazes, other people's emotions and, infuriatingly, other peoples languages to make any headway here. You ask for more work, but you are given documentation work. You ask for more technically challenging work, you are told no. The reason is obvious - thou shall not threaten managers position. Also, another bugaboo they like to throw around is security. They apparently have all these layers of unnecessary manpower ""for security reasons... Amex is finance company.. reputation at stake"" blah blah. This is an empty excuse. No correlation between restrictive engineering practice and security and privacy.


 The end result is total inefficiency. There is a reason why Indian bureacracy is one of the worst and most inefficient in the world. Well, it's taken over AmEx. "

I was connected with my mentor who set up weekly 1-1's for questions and system training.  I was given a specific set of online courses and field time to help me learn our products and value proposition over the next few weeks.   My leader put together the most thoughtful and productive onboarding plan to make sure we maximize the first weeks to learn as much as possible. 

The culture here at American Express is truly best in class and has exceeded my expectations to infinity and beyond.  They care about their employees and customers and truly demonstrate that in their actions.  I'm so grateful to the universe and everyone who helped me get here!

But a company that fires thousands of people at one time (therefore making it impossible for them all to find new jobs) just to make more money so the top people can make millions more each year is  horrible.

- 35 hours per week, 
- convenient office location (UK)","- lots of people taking lots of sick days (it's because of the job),

- outdated systems,

- ridiculous work processes due to those outdated systems,

- ridiculous processes relating to when you're 1 minute late, or when you can't take your breaks on time because you're on the phone speaking to a customer - in every other company your manager would be aware when you're on the phone and doing actual work. However, at Amex you have to explain yourself in writing to a different department and the people there may or may not adjust your times. If you think this isn't important, think again because 'adherance' (your adherance to your shift and your brakes) is important when it comes to your bonus! 

- the department works with a caller, this means that people are called by an automated system, and as soon as a customer answers their phone, the system connects the customer to a Credit Specialist. This takes a few seconds, so by the time the customer is put through to you, they've already shouted ""HELLO"" five times down their phones because there's no one on the other end... be prepared to have people shout in your ear all the time. And be prepared to have people tell you that they've been called 10 times in the past hour which, of course, isn't reasonable for a person to do, but they were never called by a real person, and obviously you're not supposed to tell them they were called by an automated system - and it gets old and it's a waste of time explaining this to every other person you speak to...

- middle management is useless. All the team managers in my department were robotic box-tickers. 

In a nutshell - the job itself is terrible because you're supposed to make people pay off their credit cards debts - but not every customer can or wants to pay. So you'll have a lot of shouting, complaining, lying and even crying - many customers have a tragic back-story to share, and you'll have to deal with the occasional suicidal customer which, obviously, is not only difficult, but it gets to you."

THATS IT.","This is a VERY stressful call center environment. The turn over rate in the customer service department is high for a reason! I had to deal with abuse day in and out from customers who speak to you as if you are a dog. The supervisors you call for ""help"" are not very helpful at all. In fact, they all hate their job, which makes yours even more difficult. I had to deal with other departments dumping (transferring calls without letting the customer know) calls on me when the customers were upset so that they wouldn't have to get a bad survey. 

OH and the survey system they have in place is ridiculous and put in place just to avoid paying you a bonus. The bonus structure is very generous, but you will never see an ounce of your money you worked for if you get a bad survey.(bad surveys to amex means a survey that is not EXCELLENT, so even if the customer rated you VERY GOOD, its still bad to them). Bad surveys stay on your report for 30 days and commission is paid once a month so you do the math. 

The schedule is soooooooo strict. You are not even allowed to use the bathroom whenever you want with out being questioned. You get one 40 mins lunch break and two 10 mins breaks if you work an 8 hour shift. If you don't handle your bathroom duties during that time, you can expect to have a meeting with your team leader about you not adhering to your schedule. 

The PTO structure is also generous (23 days per year) BUT, if you work in customer service and you want a federal holiday off you will have to use your PTO days. But you can even forget about having any holidays off your first year working there. Time off requests are based off seniority and availability. Once everything is taken, then too bad for you, you just lose your days. The sick time was accrued at a rate of 4 hours per month and you can roll over sick days."

6811,,Worst management,2017-04-26,1.0,Travel Agent,Work at home.  Somewhat good benefits. Would be a good job if not so badly managed.,Management in travel area is so afraid of losing their jobs.  They drink the kool aid and throw travel agents under the bus to keep their jobs and bonuses.  They save money by closing offices and coming up with ways to cut incentive pay.  They lie to new hires about how much their bonus will be when it's all based on surveys and very rare to get top payout.   A low survey for something like long hold time goes against the agent who has no control over it.  They get tenured agents to leave with shifts so they can outsource to $14/HR who have to be trained.  Turn over is high because shifts r based on what u get on surveys and they make u bid once a year.  Custmers have to hold because it is understaffed.   All of this has led to a decrease in service.   Also the medical insurance isnt that good for such a big company with very high deductible high premiums and you have to fund your HSA.  With the cut in pay from no incentive it doesn't leave much to live on.

6884,,My Experiance with American Express,2017-04-01,5.0,Risk Analyst,"American Express is very employee friendly company. It is flexible in terms of working hours and work location. Also, the leaders are very open minded in terms of understanding your views.","At certain times you will feel your work gets stagnant. As its a big company the projects are long-term. However, you still have lots of opportunities to change your team after spending relevant time in your initial position."
6885,,You WILL be laid off,2017-04-01,1.0,Membership Rewards Consultant,At least you don't have to buy government insurance since you'll get benefits from day one.,"These positive reviews crack me up. These are written largely by the blissfully unaware. Sure, if you're under 35 years old, you have a chance to be happy at Amex for a little while (until you realize that you're doing the work of three people, with nearly impossible-to-meet goals). There is ZERO job security because Amex is completely un-innovative and seeks to cut costs by sacrificing the employees that had nothing to do with losing major contracts like JetBlue and Costco (how long before the last big hold-out, Delta Airlines, realizes they're still partnered with an outdated soul-less dinosaur)? Until you do get laid off, be prepared to be reviewed annually (actually twice a year, because you have to write your own ""mid-year"" as well) based in huge part on customer surveys. That would be ok except for the fact that customers are asked questions about experiences over which you have no control or were even a part of. How blatantly unfair. Also, be prepared to work for a team leader who is dumb as a bag of hammers. If you work in Fort Lauderdale, you know who you are - you may have been fooling those above you all these years, but you've never fooled those of us who work under you!  I had in excess of 15 different team leaders (management confuses shuffling people around with employee development) and MAYBE two or three of them had any knowledge (or ability for that matter) to do the job of the people they supervised. Some of the other review writers here seem to think that those of us who had direct customer interface were treated well. I don't know where that idea comes from because Amex treated all band 25 employees at our location like yesterday's garbage and the Fort Lauderdale location is very heavy on customer contact. (I spoke to 20+ Cardmembers daily). 
Also, if you like attending endless mindless meetings, you'll love working at Amex. I can't tell you the number of countless, tortuous hours spent listening to some dumb dumb or another drone on with their artificial ""I'm so happy I work here"" face on, designed solely to impress whatever dumb dumb they report to, none of whom dare rock the boat with any original thoughts; that would be too risky. You can read it on every one of their faces, ""God, just let me not be in the next round of layoffs...."" 
American Express first lost it's way back in the 70s from what I understand. They were too cocky with their ""we're all that"" attitude. They did manage to get back on track but they still coast on their artificial reputation. They no longer provide exceptional customer service, which was the thing that differentiated them all these years. It's now done mostly ""offshore"" by non-Americans who use the short time they intend to be with the company as a resume builder and couldn't care less about Amex or its customers and who, by the way, severely lack integrity and work ethic. So it's no surprise that the JD Powers award has gone to Discover the last few years, after having been given to Amex for the prior 8 or 10 years (I forget how many in a row, but a HUGE deal was made of winning it every year, all the big wigs patting one another on the back for a job well done, while pretending to give us low levels all the credit by handing out cupcakes on the big day. Golly! Thanks!). Suddenly, when Discover realized that one great way to win the hearts of their customers is to get the word out that when you call them, you'll get a US-based (translation: American) representative, along with the fact that there's not one good reason in the world to use a Card with an annual fee (a substantial part of Amex's customer portfolio), the JD Powers award is barely whispered about in the halls of the Amex building I worked in, other than by us lowly band 25s who frankly giggled our butts off about it since we knew we were on the chopping block anyway. 
Since Amex let me go, I'm having trouble paying my credit card bills. I've prioritized which will get paid and which won't. I find bitter justice in the fact that I'm going to pay off my Discover Card but not my Amex. There's a bit of karma for you American Express."

All levels have a lot of responsibility and room to showcase skills, and there is a corporate value of career development and promotion from within.","Whenever Amex reveals losses, there are infamous, giant re-organizations, which becomes a drawn out time of uncertainty (goals, priority, leadership, etc), and people start being treated as cattle. Moved to a new VP's 'world', now a new role, new product, basically new job, really just a warm body to fill a need, despite your expertise & goals for which you were originally hired. Also, the 'new class' aka recent college grads, are extremely competitive with one another, gossip and salary comparison is commonplace, and makes it feel like a bad highschool experience. The 'professional growth; rating program Amex has definitely fosters this behavior, you compete against your peers and coworkers annually, its quite disheartening."

Good working hours - some people work late but you don't feel obliged to work past 5pm and many people leave early and work flexible patterns.
Occasional or regular home-working is possible in many teams
A fair amount of 'fun' activities and training opportunities onsite to keep employee morale up
Lovely new office building","- Typically male dominated workplace in tech organisation. A macho culture in some teams - if you're not into sports, cars and going to the gym, you might not have much to chat to your colleagues about.
- Performance/year-end ratings process is tedious, draining, unfair and unpleasant, nasty feedback is given under the guise of 'constructive criticism'.
- Frequent ""restructures"" - redundancies nearly every year, job doesn't feel secure
- Have seen leaders bully employees, no easy way to report this without fear of consequences
- American corporate culture - for obvious reasons - and a lot of the 'good stuff' happens over in the US so UK teams are often left feeling powerless or second-best.
- Have also seen younger colleagues ostracized in teams of long-tenured employees
- Lots of secrecy about all sorts of decision making, lack of openness, of course some things have to be confidential at a financial company but some decisions that affect employees, should be openly discussed rather than whispering about literally everything as if we're cold war spies!
- Lots of incompetent people holding onto their positions by charming leadership - 'networking' seems more important than actual competence at doing your job
- Likewise, incompetent people seem to feel threatened by employees who are actually talented, so some of these talented individuals end up at the bottom of the pile, of course the sensible ones leave for greener pastures!
- The year-end rating system pits employees against eachother instead of encouraging collaboration, and again, charming your leaders and blowing your own trumpet loudly seems to be a faster route to success than actually doing a good job.
- It's even worse the higher up you go, with VPs always trying to protect and expand their empire as if it's Game of Thrones, this is not immediately evident when you're lower down the ranks but have a frank discussion with a VP and you realise how much they're playing eachother for bonuses and survival.

While I worked there we were switched from salary employees to hourly and management never informed us.

This is a sales environment so quotas are expected to change. Unfortunately as the quotas increase the amount paid for production decreases. You could easily be told to produce 40% more while experiencing a 30% pay cut to your commission.

While it was barely legal, it was definitely highly unethical. I consistently worked 10-12 hour days due to the volume of work assigned to me; when I tried to raise concerns about my bandwidth, I was literally told that ""[you] can't say no to any [assignments]."" 

When I informed my manager that, after careful consideration, I had applied for a move to an internally-advertised role, I was released from my job three days later with no explanation as to why. No, literally: when I asked why I was let go, my leaders responded with saying they legally didn't have to tell me why due to some fine print. 

Analysts in marketing are overloaded with tedious, manual work with little to no formal training for their actual jobs within Amex. I found a dearth of clear direction on how the Analyst's actual work supports Company goals. As the Analyst is typically the most junior member of a given team, s/he is assigned responsibility for tasks no one else wants to do, such as tracking budgets and reconciling spend at end of each FY. Why assign the (arguably) least experienced member of a *marketing* team the responsibility of accounting for millions of dollars when they're usually not hired for / trained to do actual accounting? 

Overall, I heard from colleagues that I had a uniquely poor experience in my time at American Express. Many feel the company is a great place to work, and I was excited to join the company for the same reasons. Unfortunately, that was not my experience, and I feel I would be remiss not to warn candidates who are considering applying to work there. I honestly hope that this experience is not common."

Additionally, there is still some cachet behind the Amex brand, which makes it a great stepping stone into other opportunities outside of the company.","Very political force-ranking review system. At the end of each year all members of the pay band above you meet to force rank employees as a class and determine merit increases and bonuses. E.g. All managers meet to rank their direct reports against those of other managers, all Directors meet to rank the managers on their team against the other managers in the company and apply ratings on a bell curve. The bell curve provides prescriptive guidance for merit increases and bonuses. In many cases, the merit increase and bonus (where applicable) for an employee is not determined by their individual contribution, or measured against a yard stick. Instead, the force ranking system leads to less than idea outcomes based on the ability and desire of a given leader to influence his/her peers during the rating session. As a leader, this can lead to strange conversations with your direct reports - In some cases a direct report will receive a middle of the road rating simply because of their position on the bell curve, while the leader can provide no specific guidance for improvement. In other cases, employees who would have been rated poorly by their managers were instead lifted into the median rate and provided with a raise and bonus while the leader has to deliver the message that they are not performing up to par, but will be compensated as if they are."

New building in Brighton with a good gym and excellent classes, also recently renovated office in Burgess Hill are highly recommended.","Heavily US focused as can be expected and as there are greater opportunities for career progression in the US, less experienced staff can find themselves getting a promotion much quicker than those based outside of US.  This can actually present a great opportunity if you are happy to move over to the US.  

It can be difficult at times to grow internally as a specialist as the Company proactively encourages staff to move around and tends to then hire externally into more senior specialist areas.  While this is less the case in US it is felt more in other countries like UK.

There may be high turnover in some of the call center roles and such, but everyone fortunate enough to be with AMEX in a sales role seems to understand that this is the absolute cream of the crop as far as sales jobs go.","The consultant role has a commission cap with a more modest base salary, but it's not meant to be a long term role. Most ""CBD's"" (as we're called) will move into Manager, Business Development roles within 6-24 months which is an uncapped commission role. So, really the only con I've experienced is a short-term ""pay your dues"" kind of thing that totally makes sense."

Small balances are easy to deal with, but if one is moved to high balance, $50,000, $100,000 etc, it's not as easy.
Training consisted of four weeks within a classroom setting and then there was on the job training. One had to meet the necessary metrics once the four weeks of classroom training was complete.

While working at Amex I was very happy and adored many colleagues and each boss was wonderful. The company is big on career development and your next steps at the company.

7173,,The Hunger Games Rank and Yank,2016-12-26,1.0,Anonymous Employee,Decent work life balance if you're responsible for little and you have GREAT leadership all the way up to the VP level. Pay is decent (although I left for a small raise),"American Express doesn't rate you on how well you perform your position responsibilities.  They FORCE RANK you against your peers.  This is commonly referred to as ""Rank and Yank"" or ""The Hunger Games.""  Amazon recently caught bad press for this and changed their practices.  

American Express uses the Rank and Yank process to quickly and without thought or leadership, artificially bolster their stock price.  

""Amex earnings are down, oh wait they're cutting costs!""  The joke is that the total number of workers never really goes down.  They seem to focus on their oldest workers (most expensive) and then simply rehire after they burn the remaining people out over a period of a few months.  There is ZERO loyalty to long term staff here.  If they can outsource your job to India or hire a contractor.....they will.  Many of the long timers at Amex have been laid off multiple times.  It's sad.  Unless you're a phone sales person who constantly has high numbers, you're expendable.

The layoffs are every single year and destroy morale.  I've never been at an organization where there was so much fear every single day.  Everything you do is based on covering your rear so when it comes to review time, your list of things you've done is longer than the others on your team.   

Working with your cheaper outsourced labor from India is not bad, but the incessant late night calls are.  Do you like phone calls at midnight?  If you don't I'd highly suggest not working here.  They are also exceedingly difficult to understand over the phone.

The pay at the executive levels are INSANE.  While they lay people off, they give themselves multi-million dollar salaries and bonuses.  I remember listening to a town hall where one of the executives was talking about her dog walker.  Yes, while they lay off in mass, this lady is worried about her dog's twitter/instagram account and her private dog walker!  This really is The Hunger Games!

I wrote an earlier review stating I was trying to get out....and it didn't take me long to find a much better.  I left a young high performing up-and-comer.

In my short time at my new job, I have saved my organization literally millions of dollars using new financial models and knowledge application.  It's amazing what you can do when you're not guided by fear."

7178,,No Change...,2016-12-23,3.0,Finance,"Flexible working, cultural diversity, great training resources and programs, supporting local communities. Opportunities are great to learn, develop yourself and connect with wider global network.","Innovation is limited due to size and complex structure of the organisation, reengineering is constant with huge obsession for cost savings and ongoing lack of focus on revenue growth. Management knows well how to play with the numbers to deliver on short term targets. Unfortunately ""change"" does not last long due to the same old politics and US centrism. Senior executives seem somehow very comfortable and even not trying hard to lead by example. Career progress is dependant on networking and superficial requirements on how you need to fit in the corp institution. Leaders look very robotic and out of touch."

There is also a multiplier system in earning incentives which helps employees to multiply their incentives by x times.,No work-life balance. Sometimes you have to work on Sundays.

The company is not doing well - they are losing partnerships right and left (eg Costco)
You are not treated like a human - the company views people like puzzle pieces. I watched my co-workers get tossed around and laid-off like I had never seen before.
Senior management is indecisive- there is lack of direction and it trickles down
The culture is inefficient - there is a lot of talking and not a lot of doing 
It is difficult to get promoted in role - you have to climb the ladder by hopping around departments"

Hierarchy matters, people really care what band level you are
Unequal distribution of work - some parts of the organization have people who are 30% utilized while others have people who are 150% utilized"

7189,,Manager,2016-12-19,1.0,Senior Manager,"Average Pay, average healthcare, decent vacation time, they attempt to make employees a priority.","There is no opportunity to climb within this company unless you are 1) an feet kisser 2) have a friend or buddy who can promote you 3) are a minority or woman that is less qualified, 4) spend a majority of your time playing  politics and a very little percentage of your time doing your actual job, 5) you are super close with the decision maker in HR.  There is so much waste at American Express it's shocking.  They spend countless training hours and updated training in departments that don't even benefit from the training.  Front line employees, customer service, credit, TSC, Billing (outsourced) don't want to work, and most of the time supervisors or team leaders don't want to work either.  Performance goals or RE's are often not accurate and not used during reviews (instead favoritism as usual prevails).  Service Delivery Leaders are like Supreme Court Justices, they are in their roles for life and most of the time they are educated by there subordinates on what is going in the department.  Lastly reviews are done on a curve, meaning if an entire department saves the day, breaks records the entire year, is the best department ever at American Express there still has to be a percentage on top reviews, very good reviews, good reviews, and bad reviews = idiotic.  Lastly, discrimination is tolerated, one service delivery leader discriminated in TSC, was moved to Customer service, discriminated in that department, was moved again, and discriminated yet again.  The ombudsman department are puppets, if you have any real problems as an employee on any level there is really no one you can turn to.  I was disgusted with everything American Express for my 15 years, I needed the money, but I'm excited I left.  If you want to work in the house of fake people by all means apply."

The hiring manager pretty much said why didn't I get the GCP role, I said I don't know I explained what happened, he then said he had 4 great candidates and wished me luck.  Talk about being jinxed.

2. Inspiring Senior Leadership (VP and above only)

3. Good brand value if you try switching to other companies.","The job is best suited for people who seek a peaceful workplace with little or no challenge or intellectual application. There is no appreciation for more qualified technical work and people show tremendous inertia to switch to newer methods or technology. They would rather have the old school ways of doing repetitive things.

The job is not at all recommended for people from highly technical institutes like the IITs in India or the Ivy League schools in the US. You will be working exclusively on MS Excel or archaic tools like SAS. The role has no requirement of technically qualified professionals. There is no real ""big-data"" or ""analytics"" here and they are just buzzwords thrown around to attract talent. All the core algorithm development happens only in the Big Data Labs team in Bangalore (India) and your team in NYC or Gurgaon (India) would only be using these tools as black-boxes. 

To makes things worse, the growth is really slow and you will watch your peers at other firms grow at a terrific pace. The compensation is also sub-par.

The senior leadership is impressive but Mid-level leaders are mediocre at best.

If you are a technically qualified professional, you are better off working at a start-up in Silicon valley or any other part of the world rather than watching yourself degrade here."

Noisy unprofessional environment.  The collection floor looks like a long skinny bench with 70 people calling from a headset sitting barely a foot apart.   Like an old television whacked out phone telethon on T.V from the 1980s.   People yelling between tables raising green & red flags. Much disrespect in the training room by team coach.  When doing role play in training the coach kept acting like a stupid customer calling in first in a Southern accent and then in a British accent. A big mess.  VERY sad.  Not all people with an accent are dumb.  I don't think the American Express customers should be portrayed as stupid.  SAD SAD SAD.  Lets just say I got out of there quick. I am a professional collector who was laid off after 20 years of employment.  I shed a few tears on this mess I got myself into. No wonder there is a big turnover I heard.  My training class peers were dreading being called on to role play to understand the different accents.  More diversity training needed there with team coach leads.  Nobody makes it to high $ collector as there is too much seniority in high dollar.  Even when sitting with high dollar collectors to observe they tell you that and say you just stay in low balance even though you are on the bench tables.  Totally blindsided. They definitely deliberately hid the whole thing about the position.

Good Infrastructure

No pros apart from above.  U will be highly disappointed considering the brand name and will wonder why why why why its is a brand name??????","If ur a technical personal never join this company.  It's an old company,  where your manager will tell you to Build networking in the company rather than doing good work.  They still follow the Yes boss culture.  There is so much politics around that a person doing work will not  be able to stay for a long period. 
As soon as u join one needs to struggle to even got a laptop and basic logistics. 

In the interview they asked me the toughest interview questions,  but on joining I was disappointed to see that no body has even implemented those things in the entire company,  rather every technical person is doing vendor management out there. U will realize that the brand name is just a showcase and u will regret why did u join this company. 
Vendors will visit onsite but the permanent employee will never go.  On top of it,  if ur not good in politics u will not be able to survive for long. 
It's an old company which runs in old fashion, 
your manager will tell you to Build networking in the meeting,  rather than focusing on work. 
They show themselves as they are one of the big companies,  but as soon as u join u will feel that life here is pretty slow and in my view even a start up would have better processes. 

Join this company only if u want to ruin ur technical skills and u like Yes Boss culture.

7574,,Be Very Careful!,2016-08-18,1.0,Anonymous Employee,The clean and sweet smelling cafeteria. Courteous doorman. Nice furniture.,"Worked at a department that was quickly spun off due to fraud and scandal. This was not a traditional AE credit card department but one of their ""other"" departments. WON'T NAME THE DEPARTMENT NAME DUE TO CONFIDENTIALITY AGREEMENT AND CO-WORKERS WHO WENT TO JAIL. 

There was a lot of inappropriate behavior taking place at this particular office. Semen left on chair near my desk, shady people that had no education or experience being there, a crazy co-worker who was supposed to be institutionalized would rant, yell and harass people constantly. Managers only came in twice a week to the office but the other times were out of work for weeks. There was a situation once when someone sftole an entire cabinet full of documents from the office and no one cared, co-workers took laptops and flash drives back to their apartments even though AE clearly states that its against company policy to do so. The work was never properly explained, they kept on switching what they wanted you to do, no follow through, lots of gossip, blame and overall idiocy and un-professionalism. Various MS Ex cel files were erased and lost due to carelessness and lax behavior at work. 

There was a manager who would constantly flirt, sniff and gyrate his tongue at young females. Co-workers who would stalk you at lunch and look for you in the bathroom. People dressed inappropriately with pants, shirts falling off, drinking alcohol during lunch and coming to work drunk and stinky. One guy was caught sleeping on the job. Another manager lied about his work experience.

The supervisor and those below him were caught in a huge scandal. He was supposed to be sentenced to JAIL with ten other people for fraudulent activity. Most of the people couldn't find jobs afterwards. I can see why they got rid of this fiasco so quickly. In hindsight, should have went to HR or higher management and escalated what was going on there. AE's reputation took a nose dive after this."

Not true!!  Beware!!  It only applies if you happen to get one of the rare few team leaders that want you to succeed.  It took me forever to get hired, a year and 18 applications later, I finally made it.  Being a single parent, I just knew it was the career path for me.  I graduated 3rd in my training class, worked hard, never had a write up or verbal reprimand, made lots of money for the company by selling on almost every call.  What happened you may wonder?  I had the unfortunate deal of having a team leader that didnt like me for some reason.  I wish I could tell you why, but I dont have a clue.  I even asked her and she assured me that she liked me.  But I could tell by her actions that she didnt.  So one day, she accused me of intentionally dropping calls, which I did not.  I answered more calls then anyone on my team and had some of the highest stats, as well.  She fired me with no warning, none.  I was there one day aand gone the next.

7633,,Employee abuse = customer neglect,2016-07-28,1.0,Customer Service Representative,"Decent pay and benefits, some schedule flexibility.","A 'certain orientation' (that Glassdoor does not allow me to mention) and women make up an inappropriately huge percentage of the Amex workforce. Management blatantly supports feminism and people who commit acts of 'a certain orientation'. Amex likes to brag about their great customer service but in reality, they outsource to ridiculously incompetent call center reps, overwork their employees due to corporate greed, and coerce their employees to make cardmembers 'feel good' while rushing them off the phone at all costs, whether or not the info given to cardmembers is helpful, accurate or even true. The reality is that leadership doesn't listen to customers or employees and is extremely slow to recognize, respond to, or fix known issues. It takes years, literally, to fix even the smallest glitches. The money invested in new technology must be minuscule as we use ancient PCs and our work takes twice as long as it should due to PC loading issues, slow internet, constant server disconnects, etc., smh. Amex supposedly 'encourages new ideas', and on-the-job learning, but has an unspoken policy that it be done off the clock (e.g. compulsory trainings must be done, but no time is allowed off the phones to do them, etc.). Breaks/lunches have to be cut short in order to meet abusive ATS goals. There is extreme micro-management and pressure from above at all times. Low and mid-level management spend eons of time micro-managing and critiquing calls but zero time addressing blatant failed Amex processes, botched accounts, and cardmember situations which require personalized handling versus rulebook procedures. Endless bureaucracy and lip service followed by inaction and the status quo. A great example of the typical Amex 'solution' to an awful card product would be to change the color of the card and run some new ads versus improving the inferior product."

-Leadership only out for themselves and they do not care about their employees.. will string people along and make false promises of promotions to convince people to stick on their team so that they do not have to deal with any transitions
-Strongly averse to switching teams.. one would think branching out and learning a new function + business would make you a more valuable employee but not the case here. Your career essentially starts over once you switch roles despite being more well-rounded and knowledgeable. In fact, RIM has a rule in place that you cannot be promoted when transitioning to a new role to specifically deter people from moving around.
-YoY salary increase is less than inflation
-Difference in bonus between high-, average-, and low-performers is not nearly enough to justify putting forth the extra effort
-Promotion to Sr Manager comes with a laughable 5% raise
-RIM works significantly harder than the rest of the company

My suggestion?
Amex is (or maybe was) a good brand that would look good on the resume. However, the career development here is a joke and not worth sticking around for unless you're not very ambitious and you just want a steady paycheck.. but if that's who you are, then you might as well just switch to Marketing or Finance where you can work less, get promoted every 2 years, and be the smartest one in the room (although the $$ is less). If you're an intern, stick around for the nice signing bonus and bail. If you're a sponsored employee, life is similar to that of an indentured servant so just wait until your green card comes so you can bail. Regardless, don't work your butt off for an improbable promotion that comes with a raise less than what most employers offer each year"

7723,,"Mass layoffs, offshoring of US positions, toxic work environment",2016-06-27,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"From everything I have heard from the veterans of the organization, it used to be an AMAZING place to work.  With the right leaders, you can have a good experience if you're OK with constant layoffs, downsizing, force ranking and attitudes this toxic environment creates.","With the loss of CostCo and the organization's failure to attract new clientele, American Express is going to what it knows best.  Layoffs.  You'd be absolutely amazed by the number of people this place has let go over the past 10 years.  The pace has picked up considerably as of late with the announcement of a billion dollars in reductions.  Every meeting we are reminded of the layoffs that will be taking place well into 2017.  Thousands and thousands of employees will be out of work.

Additionally, the organization is a HUGE believer in moving formerly American based positions to India.  While our Indian counterparts are smart, it's difficult to understand them and the hours are almost completely opposite.  So if you have a question or need something, it takes a full 24 hours to get a response slowing the process and adding unnecessary frustration.

From what I have seen, the organization focuses on laying off their most tenured (expensive) employees, but what I don't understand is what message does that send your current up-and-comers?  That you work hard for 10-15-20 years and you'll be replaced by the cheaper alternative?

The organization also force ranks its employees meaning someone has to be the bottom.  So if you have a team of 10 AMAZING employees, the organization still forces the managers into ranking someone at the bottom.  The purpose of this is an ever-ready list of people to layoff at a moments notice.

The result these company practices is nothing short of a toxic workplace.  The high performers seem to be leaving in droves.  The employees who don't know if they're being laid off are upset, anxious and apathetic.  I always hear the phrase ""honestly I don't care"" when trying to get work done.  

The executives are just absolutely clueless on how to lead people.  In a townhall recently someone asked ""are you worried about great people leaving?""  The exec's response was ""well those aren't the type of people I'd want here anyway.""  So let me get this straight......you want people to be loyal to your organization, but your organization shows absolutely zero loyalty in return?  Please.....

I began looking for work as soon as they announced the layoffs as no one (especially me) wants an uncertain future where any month could be the month I can't pay my mortgage.  I can happily say that I will be leaving the organization shortly!

I cannot wait to quit this company for good."

Higher management is very good and focused.","Middle management is full of inefficient people. Project management is worst, they say it's Agile, but half Agile is more dangerous. Multiple teams (report to their own directors) don't collaborate for common project, it's the headache of the tech team who is driving the project. Every director is running his own shop without helping Amex as a whole. Complex team engagement process with no pro-active planning, reactive engagement process kills the essence of true Agile. No Biz Analyst in the team, Product owners are worst, they are the old CCPs with no understanding of IT, they are not sure of requirements and the system. Tech team struggles to get the clear requirement. No documentation, most of the applications have only Vendors and Contractors hence Amex herself is unaware of her own system/application. COE team takes limited responsibility, Directors and VPs take no action on escalations. No roadmap before starting a project, Biz doesn't have clear governance process on the projects, they just fund and think something magical will happen after 6 months. Enterprise Architecture team is not involved during Impact analysis, no body knows the exact amount of upstream/downstream systems are involved. No one takes accountability. Amex is losing lot of money due to this. Please fix your delivery process, otherwise it'll impact Amex in longer run.

They promote a healthy work life balance when you start, but this changes when you get on the floor. You will give every bit of blood, sweat, and tears for your money, bonus or no bonus. You will not be able to use you PTO that YOU'VE EARNED. You are not able to request a new Team Lead even though your current team lead has ulterior motives and only cares about her stats as TL and how she looks over all. You have to finish EVERY call in 4 MINUTES! All while giving ""soffers"" (soft offer) or ""recommendations"" as they call them, but basically they want you to sell card holder MORE CARDS! Also in this 4 minutes you have to transfer points to miles, dispute charges, explain bills, set up payments, online accounts, apple watches, etc... But most importantly sell sell sell more cards. The end of call surveys will land on you regardless if you caused the issue or not. When I left the pay was $17.00 per hr, but now I see its $15 and bonuses have probably changed too. NOT WORTH IT!

7895,,DIRECTOR,2016-04-27,3.0,Anonymous Employee,"American Express is a terrific company given its well respected products and name in the marketplace.  The company's reputation is built on the notion of excellence - from product design, to customer service, to employee know-how (thought leadership).  The caliber of business minds are top notch (predominately) so you really get to sharpen your own business skills and acumen by being surrounded by great talent.  In addition, expectations are high and the bar to outperform always increases each year, so you're never bored, but stimulated to do great things and to have a meaningful impact on the business.  Likewise, roles at all levels can be robust, some coming with a high level of autonomy that you might not enjoy at other large corporate entities.","American Express is a company that operates on relationships and while this can be very positive from a team, cross-functional aspect, it can be nebulous when moving up in a promotional sense.  It quickly becomes the who-you-know game, who has tagged you as a future leader or someone they know and want on their team now and/or in the future.  Leaders often choose people they know to be on their teams and these individual often follow them throughout their career at Amex, getting promoted as their 'sponsor' gets promoted.  What's challenging is that there is not always a correlation to that person being the best, most suited talent to get promoted and so you find some really smart people who despite having the chops, never reach the level in the organization that would truly mirror the value they bring.  Naturally many of these people eventually leave the company out of this frustration, though primarily they enjoyed the work and the challenges that working at American Express can bring from an enrichment standpoint.

The other major challenge is that while there are a bevy of really smart, talented individuals, the quality of leadership is lacking.  Many leaders simply don't know how to inspire their teams, enhance their employees' strengths, and set the tone for a collaborative, positive working environment.  Likewise, the culture can vary greatly by business unit.  It can be shocking, the variability in culture, particularly since recruiting is done from the same suite of schools where there is typically some uniformity in culture-type, it's not like most of these individuals come in as bad apples.  The problem lies in the top down leadership, poor leadership behavior that is 'bestowed' upon employees to adopt and emulate.  This is in stark contrast to Amex's CEO, who has charisma leaping off of him and recognizes, celebrates, and inspires people at all levels.  He's an individual that you immediately feel genuinely welcomed and respected by...but it doesn't trickle far past him (by and large) to senior leadership, which is quite a disappointment.  People leave Amex either because of the challenges of moving up or a leader who makes what could be a cool gig if you will, miserable or a chore to come into every day.  A change up in senior leadership, many who have been with the company for far far too long, could bring in some new blood that welcomes Amex's storied history in a forward looking, game-changing, and inspiring leadership way."
7896,,Don't work with them.,2016-04-27,1.0,Customer Care Professional,A place to learn multi-task skill.,"They use their survey to rate your commission. When customers call you there will be e-mail send to customer to rate your service but when it back customers always rate whole American express experience. Especially Card acceptance, Annual fee. If customers give you 1-8 you get nothing which the most result are below 8 but not because of your service was poor but it was from card spending experience. This is really unfair. So I quit."

Decent benefits
There are some really great people that work here and will do everything that they can to help you.","Scheduling flexibility is really not very flexible

TL's force and coerce employees with disciplinary action if they don't comply to made up expectations that are not part of performance metrics

4 hours of sick time per month--that's only 48 hours per year--if you don't have enough sick time you get written up

Not able to use all the PTO they give you because there is no time available (which in many cases were not major holidays or weekends..just random days requested 3-6 months in advance that were NOT available) AND you can not carry your PTO over year after year---use or lose

There is no recourse for employees when they have a complaint about a TL being abusive

You get harped on about what you didn't do right, versus all the things that you ARE doing right.

The internet service providers that they are contracted with are absolutely horrible. You are not allowed to switch service providers, but it is held against you if your internet service goes out  too many times. Most times we have to wait for a technician to come out, which for some ppl maybe 2-3 days before a tech can come out. If you have too many problems with your ISP then you get written up for that which makes no sense at all, we are not in IT--we didn't purposely cause our internet to have an outage, or for their to be something wrong with the cable lines outside of our buildings.

When many of us were hired, we were told that there would be some sales involved, but that wasn't the primary focus. They pulled the wool over us on that one. That's ALL the tl's care about are the sales that you make. If you get a bad survey but you make the sale, then they want to jump all over you about not following the call flow, but in the same breath if you don't make an offer they tell you that their research has proved that when an offer is presented, that the survey score will be higher.....sounds like quite the contradiction to me.

NO ONE gives recognition for the EXCELLENT surveys that come in...attention is only paid if a negative survey comes in.

The hiring manager flat out lies. During the hiring process, I remember distinctly asking if this was a job that required a lot of sales. I was told no....but here we are...all I hear all day long is sales, sales, sales."
8113,,Amex,2016-02-22,3.0,Manager,Good benefit packet with most of it beginning from day one.  Many positions allow flexibility in schedules.  Opportunities around the globe.,Continual fear of reorganization or movement of positions to overseas locations. Frustrating and lengthy mid-year and end-of-year process that is really decoupled from immediate feedback and rewards.
8114,,Can't beat the culture,2016-02-22,4.0,Digital Marketing Analyst,"American Express boasts happy, smart colleagues. Though we worked on a complex product that can easily feel boring, the culture made everything fun. If you work in acquisition, it's intense, fast-paced and long hours but the good energy motivates you to push the boundaries. They heavily promote movement across the company.","Though I would follow the top senior leadership anywhere, the mid-level leaders could use more training, or passion or both. Typical company politics. Your manager has too much say over your promotion worth. Processes take forever."
8115,,It's all who you know!,2016-02-22,3.0,Lead Project Manager,Good PTO policy + sick days.  Ability to work from home when needed.  Great people who are more like family than strictly co-workers.  Most people willing to help others and step up.,"Politics and cliques are openly rampant.  Decisions are made by management with seemingly no logic behind them.  Career advancement slim unless you were in the ""in"" crowd."
8116,,Changes Needed,2016-02-22,4.0,Human Resources Manager,"Good benefits, OK work life balance. Paid Tome Off is generous and you can buy up to 5 additional days","Very paternalistic, old way of thinking where your level in organization matters. Results are not rewarded, accolades, promotions are based on who you know."
8117,,Great place to work at,2016-02-22,5.0,Customer Care Professional,"Lots of benefits that are offered to you as an employee. Schedule flexibility, excellent customer service internally. Great career opportunities","Be mentally prepared for stressful work.

Good work/life balance
A lot of opportunity to move around if you are located in a Hub cite (NY, AZ, FL, UT)
Empowered to make changes once alignment is obtained...have to sell it.","Too much management layer.  Umpteen VPs in chain of command.
Collocate push is nonsense.  Wants to be like Yahoo and seems to be working out exactly the same way.
Layoffs seem to happen more than you would think.  When the company does well there are layoffs.  When the company does poorly there are layoffs.  No safe season."

8121,,Great Company,2016-02-21,4.0,,They have great values regarding their employees.  The opportunity for advancement is alive and well.

Interesting work, colleagues are great on a whole plus really good work-life balance with good opportunities for flexible working","Not a lot of career progression in the UK as most senior jobs are in the USA and a lot of functions have been outsourced to Phoenix or India. If you want to go past Manager, then you'll have to wait a VERY long time or move abroad.

Pay lags around significantly not just vs. financial services but London at a whole. This is compensated by the work-life balance.

A lot of decisions are made from the States and tend to be US-centric. A lot central control and the regions have little autonomy. As a massive multi-national, decisions are also made VERY slowly."

Every year they conduct a pulse survey and results are made public by team. Most Leaders take the results very seriously and action the feedback. Some even go as far as put together task forces to address problem areas. 
2) Career Development - you can move around and grow and develop your skills in many different areas. The company main focus is on driving results so if you have good transferable skills you can have a great long term career.

Good work/life balance,"Risk management is allowed to drive the bus in to much of the non-Risk functions. This is a conflict of interest. Simply because an organization has the skill set does not mean that they should be driving the function. 

I also agree with the lack of meritocracy. There needs to be clearer metrics on results and rewarding people accordingly. Promotion and bonus should not be related so much to whether people ""like"" you."

Senior management does not listen to employee's suggestions/complaints. They continue to believe they know best, and lie to employees. 5. You have to plan all of your vacations out a year in advance, and it's very hard to switch with other people.  You will most likely be working holidays. 6. There is almost zero room for advancement, even though you're told there is. Like I said, it's all lies."
8164,,Great Company for A Type Pesonalities,2016-02-08,3.0,Lead Technical Architect,Really enjoyed my time at Amex.

Culture is cut their throat before they cut yours.,Dog eat dog sweatshop culture where is appears that people are working hard but not working smart.

Benefits are good except medical, that high deductible plan with HSA, is expensive.  Most of the time you will pay out of pocket except if there is a high cost medical procedure or incident.  I believe this is where many corporations are headed though.
Their severance plan is very good if you are a long time employee.  You want to make note of this because the chances of getting laid off are very high.  They lay off every year - its common practice - again probably on line with most corporations though.  Nothing unique to AMEX.","Very antiquated Performance Management review.  This is probably the core of their problems.  It causes lies, deceit, cheating, back stabbing -  only promotes individualism and keeps the 'team' spirit down.  Be prepared because this is a cancer that is killing the company.  It almost killed Microsoft - they got rid of a similar review program.   This is why many of the leaders don't really deserve the positions they received - because its all about marketing yourself at the expense of all else.
Too many Indians.  They lost the way of diversity.  I can tell you there are thousands of jobs that could easily go to Americans - especially those out of college.  Instead, they recruit the H1B, bring them to the U.S. and many, many of them get converted to employees - at the expense of releasing Americans of their jobs - here in the U.S."

Some of the smartest and most talented individuals work here. There is a strong focus on ethics and compliance, but at its core, the company truly does look after its customers' best interest (which cannot be said of other banks), and this of course is exemplified by its much-vaunted customer service, as any cardmember can attest to.","Innovation can be slow sometimes, although for an ancient company, it's doing a decent job at staying relevant. As a whole, it is risk-averse and more of a fast follower than an early adopter, so to speak. Compensation is at par with, or only slightly better than, industry average, which means that in super-competitive NYC, yes, you will get paid more working for a competitor (although one has to keep the work/balance thing in mind)."

Might be a great 'first job' if you are willing to take below market rates

A veritable smorgasbord for any workaholic.

Broad range of exposure to technology.","Let me first state this is not a complaint against the company, American Express - but do want to 'tell it like it is' for any starry-eyed job seeker thinking to venture in to the work environment. AXP is everything you would expect in a shrinking workforce full of desperate hangers on trying to compete with everyone around them in order to position themselves to avoid getting laid off as the stock and company spiral.   H1B visa program is used to the maximum to displace long term, competent and dedicated employees to satisfy short-term financial goals. Do not plan to retire there.  There is a rank 'em and yank 'em mentality where excellent, invaluable employees are being let go because they have to make excuses to get rid of people to save money.   I think ENRON invented that process & we all know what happened to them. This 'culture change' AXP is embarking on is simply barefaced outsourcing program which is bringing people into the US on the visa program, which would not be so bad if the people they hired had talent, but most only have one major attribute - being cheap. This 'financial engineering' is akin to giving yourself cancer to lose weight, or a surgeon removing vital organs and replacing them with newspaper stuffing.  Many people over the last decade, with the sharpest skills and inventive minds that covered lots of critical capability and those recently laid off engineers with talent immediately end up working for competitors, which are undeniably now 'eating Amex's lunch' all thanks to the ingenious employee shedding practices AXP engages in.  Yet AXP leadership is bewildered why they are facing headwinds.  If you are an exempt salaried employee, to compete and fight to stay on, expect to wake up around 6:30am and immediately start reading email, the conference calls begin at the same time you are supposed to getting your kids ready for and taking them to school. Meanwhile the company  touts 'work life balance' and 'family values' but you don't get angry about that, because wisely you instead save your energy because you  know you will need it for the frequent after-hours work that you get to perform from home dialed in with your laptop, with no overtime pay.  Saturday became a regular work day, and all of it was absolutely thankless, just expected. Directors have it even worse, with blackberry pages and calls around the clock. AXP offers a generous 2+weeks of vacation, but do the math - you will work two weeks of OT during your first month there and will continue to provide OT every month for the remainder of your dubious tenure - There is pressure for innovation which on its face is an admirable and desirable goal, but what it originates from is the desperation from the top leaders in the company to somehow find an 'Uber - like'  magical fix to recover ground to competitors."

For those of us who spent most of our adult life there is was our second home and family. And in many ways Amex encouraged strong team spirit and inspired loyalty. Also it still has a good product and brand which make employees feel proud to work there and create opportunities to get good jobs after they leave.","Unfortunately in the past few years Amex lost its way. On one hand it hasn't been able to innovate enough and stay current while the market pressures are making it very difficult to maintain its current position. On the other, the formerly great employee culture has eroded in several areas turning to extremely competitive, over-pressuring  and unforgiving.

Generally high salaries for comparable work.,"Rounds and rounds of layoffs mean fewer people with much higher workload (no way to work only 40 hours a week).

American Express has a large and affluent client base. The company offered a competitive salary, good benefits and prospects for advancement within the organization.",The cons of working for American Express Travel mainly stem from constantly changing priorities and organization. During my tenure the metrics we were judged on were changed each year. Sometimes the new metrics would be announced after the first quarter of the year. This made it very difficult to judge ones performance. The constant drive to lower expenses also caused problems with staffing. Within the same month we would go from mandatory overtime to being asked go home early to cut labor costs.

The work life balance is great where you have the option of working from home at least one to two days a week.","It is difficult to change from different departments. Once you are in a specific area, such as compliance, or marketing, it's difficult to meet and network with others in other departments.

Amex has a young work force, at least in New York, so if you are not a Director by the time you are about 33 or so, you start feeling a little out of place.
The salaries at Amex are usually lower than at other Consumer Banking companies, they compensate for this with their better and more innovative culture. I used to work at Citi and the culture at Amex was a lot better, but they pay less (usually)."

On top of that, during the same period, the president, Ken Chenault passed on his own bonus to trickle that down to employees. That's why I took the job. I know what American Express stands for, it cares about its people, has great benefits, has great stability, and you feel proud to say you work for this company.","Painfully slow to adopt new technology (completely normal for a financial institution)
Too many veterans and not enough fresh talent. 
Terrible work-life balance
Extreme and dated outlook on working from home/remotely. Working from home/remotely is frowned on and discouraged. If you're looking for flexibility, go elsewhere.
Outsourced, contracted and, in some cases, grossly underpaid and under-skilled technical talent.

Stupid bonus system for full time employees that ""unofficially"" unfairly pits you against your peers to determine what kind of bonus you're going to get this year. I say unfair because it's completely subjective, is based off of your top 3-4 ""goals"" for the year, and has more to do with who knows your name than how good of an employee you are. Unless you are really good at bragging about yourself or making yourself sound important, you won't get a good bonus/raise.

Incentive pay calculations constantly change, up to several times per year - could earn a 2K monthly bonus in October, have the same performance in November, might get $300, if any, because of the ""re alignment"".  Single track counseling: if you get to a level two or three, you're doomed.  You can't apply anywhere for up to a year after getting off counseling, and you have a black mark on your record forever, regardless of what they tell you.

Took away permanent desks and employees now have to sign up for a workspace each day at the Director and below level. Loyalty programs were once the hallmark of the brand but values are now among the weakest in the industry. Customer service constantly cross-sales to existing customer base to generate revenue. Leadership doesn't embrace diversity the way it once did with no women at the top tier of leadership. The company posts salary ranges for internal positions with transparency but rarely pays employees anywhere near the upper range, which drives employees to competitors who happily pay more.

8841,,Travel Education Program Travel Specialist,2015-07-04,1.0,Travel Counselor,"It seems as though they have good benefits with hotels.  However, management and trainers would never tell you about them or allow you time to search for them. 

Other departments seem to be getting good reviews.  This review is only for Travel and Lifestyle services, Travel Counselor positon.","Horrible training.  The trainers seemed to think indimidation was a more effective motivator than actually inspiring employees to do their best.  An example of this intimidation is the trainerss telling our class that management can fire you for any thing at anytime. The training also lacks any formulated structure or plan that they stick to.  

Even something as simple as not verifying an email address.  Outdated technology (In Travel and Lifestyle Services).  All GDS systems are old (developed in the 60's) and require an extensive code input system.  However, as long as you know the correct code to imput, they work.  However, American Express created an overlay developed 20 yearss ago that crashes as frequently as every call you receive. I might be the only one bothered by this as I am have a degree in computer science,  and I will note that it appears as though they are working to come up with a new system.  In the mean time when the sytem crashes you still are expected to make the entire reservation in the amount of time alloted.  They use metrics to measure performance (as all call centers do).  The technology they use to measure metrics is very good.  

You do get a bonus, however, your bonus is structured in a way that you will almost never recieve it.  The bonus is only received if you make a 9-10 on every survey customer's return.  Which is not a problem, however if you get a 1 because the person the card member spoke with before you was rude.  It still counts against you.  Management will tell you not to ever expect a bonus. 

Also, it appears as though the company does not let you transfer into another position very easily.  Most people with a bachelor's degree are still stuck in the same call center environment 10 years later.  

If you're a recent college grad (like myself) looking to get your foot in the door at a large company, this is not the job for you.  

If you are a person who is looking to take advantage of the work from home positions that American Express offers for this position, This job may be for you.  I would only recommend that you have ver good computer skills and extensive domestic and international travel destination knowledge."

And there's the odd little fact that most of the employees, for whatever reason, hate their jobs, even when their job isn't that bad.

8853,,fulltime,2015-07-01,3.0,,i have been working for American express for 4 years,not available at this time
8854,,Great experience in the Business Insights team,2015-07-01,5.0,Senior Manager,"I spent nearly three years in the Business Insights team of American Express in London and had a really great time there.

The extensive data capabilities of Amex make the day-to-day work both unique and interesting. A lot of autonomy is provided to the consultants, as long as they deliver on their objectives, which are usually related to client satisfaction. This autonomy is also reflected in the possibility to work from home on a regular basis.

The Business Insights team is mostly composed of former consultants. Leaders are among the very best within the whole company. This creates a professional yet fun atmosphere at work. As in most companies, you will unfortunately not be able to avoid some annoying politics, but the corporate and team culture is truly excellent (at least in London and in France).

In terms of compensation, you cannot really compare it with that of a consultant in a Management Consulting firm, as the hours and the pressure are not the same either. Personally, I thought the total package was competitive given the proper work-life balance. Days are very busy (because the goals of the firm are ambitious) but working hours are relatively standard (from 9am to 6/8pm on average). No face time is required.

Finally, I appreciated the opportunity to move across offices in Europe. It is not easy but it is completely feasible. I personally managed to move from London to Paris.","As mentioned above, there is a bit of politics in the firm, that needs to be taken into account when performing your work. It is not worst that in the other companies I worked for. It might actually be slightly better. Still, it can be annoying sometimes.
Also, it is easier (for obvious reasons) to move offices within Europe versus being transferred to the US. If your objective is eventually to move to the US, it can be done, but you will really need to prove your superior performance first. It will take some time."

-Leadership-  I was on the Consumer Marketing side at one point and I don't think I liked my job or the company-- but my Director at the time really worked hard to make sure his team was happy and he made working fun.  Now that I am on the Merchant side, the culture my previous director carried in Consumer is really fostered in my new organization.  It really is why AXP has been successful, its leadership- open communication, foster its employees at all levels, have the hard conversations, think about the future and the next steps, and be kind-- Ed Gilligan philosophy.
- Opportunity for growth- There's always opportunity for growth, you just have to take the initiative to get to the next level/team.","- Pay isn't terrible but it is not comparable to ""real"" banks, but this isn't a real bank
- The launch time for any initiative takes about 2 months to launch, in the tech and marketing industry, this is equal to 2 years
- Not all organizations in AXP foster the same leadership/people mindset
- I think it's hard for introverts here because this is a people company.-- Which means you have to own your own brand; coffee chats, meeting new people, and selling yourself.  Not everyone can do this, so it hinders people's ability to move around.  But I think if you secure an advocate, even if it's your own boss, that can be a solution.
- They hire extremely talented external employees and put them in less-than-fitting roles.  If your analyst takes the initiative to automate and essentially fire himself/herself from their job- maybe the role was not challenging enough and you should think to find a job to promote he or she within the company to retain the talent"

Office culture isn't aggressive (though it can be passive aggressive). Lots of opportunities to move to different departments and roles to gain experience","Organization is highly matrixed, so navigating the various stakeholders to get their involvement and approval to get things done can be a challenge. Goals between groups often don't match up or can even be contradictory, also making it hard to get things done. It can be political -- who you know is often more important than what you know. (Building relationships with people is ESSENTIAL) Regarding the ""work from home"" comment in the ""PROs"" section, the company is increasingly moving to a work style where employees no longer have dedicated cubes and offices, and instead work in a small workstation, different each day.

8917,,Director,2015-06-13,3.0,Director,American Express is a solid company with great top level leadership.  Senior Management at company Headquarters does a great job of keeping employees informed of the direction the company is taking.  Very good benefits although they have passed on increased healthcare costs to employees which has caused frustration among employees.,"Lack of consideration for mid management growth opportunities.  When making personnel decisions they would rather layoff experienced Directors and VPs leaving Managers to fend for themselves with incremental workload, which causes moral issues within the employees that remain.  This leaves a huge void in Thought Leadership which is apparent in performance results and negative feedback among key clients.  Most experienced top performing Directors and VPs are forced to look elsewhere for career growth, most end up in top performing Tech companies such as Mastercard and Visa.  Many employees at Mastercard Miami are former AMEX employees, there are no former Mastercard employees at AMEX.  This should be a message to Sr. Management something is definitely wrong with personnel decisions that have been made in the past.  Ultimately, employees in the Miami office are overwhelmed with work, with low morale and feel there is no opportunity for career growth.  Although I recommend AMEX as a company, I would not recommend the AMEX Miami Latin America International office."

The top leadership does a very good job and have a sound vision on how to grow the business. Very flexible across the board, some departments allow to work remotely, plenty of vacation days and flex days. Good benefits, performance bonus, profit sharing. Average health benefits compensated with contributions to HSA accounts.","Although the CEO and his executive team have good vision and are great leaders, under them there are layers and layers of managers which create a complex spider web of politics. Its a mission to get anything done, one more time did I mention politics? Middle management is the problem in this company.
In technologies specifically this is even worse. The knowledge has been outsourced through the years to offshore companies in India. Most of the actual employees are not technical and spend their time playing the performance review marketing game, most of them don't do any real work. In ""lean"" principles, everything that is done should somehow benefit the customer, but not in American Express. Making presentations and sounding smart will take you far, even if what you are saying is total BS. This is a place for posers and brown nosers, not for real engineers.
As of the last couple of years the company has acknowledged they have to transform, but this has been a total failure. The titles have changed but the problems remain the same: red tape, politics, superficiality. If you are an engineer you will come here and you will lose all your skills as you will spend most of your time dealing with idiots and wannabes. There is no real collaboration, everyone is after each others lunch. If you are willing to play the game you might end up in a management position relatively easily. Oh by the way, they say they are agile, because they think that making people sit in the same room is enough. My advice is to go somewhere else where developers and technical skills are valued."
8922,,Travel Dept is terrrible!,2015-06-11,1.0,Travel Counselor,Ok salaries and can be interesting and varied  if the consultant was allowed to do their job.,"The environment is very oppressive in travel.  They are not loyal to their staff and are always looking to find a reason to put you on ""counselling"" which means you don't get your incentives.  They always come up with new rules to make sure you don't get your incentives and always feel like you are about to loose your job.  They will take your incentive away even if the client was grading your call on AMEX and NOT YOUR SERVICE!

Lack of governance and controls that creates audit issues.  Due to this being a technology center with most managers being promoted based on technical abilities instead of leadership and/or management ability, the is little attention given to performance development let alone completing goals and performance reviews in a timely or consistent manner.  Finally, a significant amount of those being hired and/or promoted at the Desert Ridge technology center is race based - if you are Indian (from India, not native American Indian) then you are automatically pre-qualified.  98% of the newer Big Data technology hires are Indian.  Internal company nickname is Indian Express instead of American Express.  This is no joke...

I am entitled for shift allowance and hence I informed my leaders throughout my tenure about shift allowance not credited with my monthly salary. I was promised every month that it will be sorted out but my trust was not kept and that never happened throughout my tenure. 

When I was serving my notice period I raised this issue again and was informed by my leaders that shift allowance will be cleared in my Full and Final Settlement.

In FFS also I didn't receive my shift allowance and It was also not informed to me that shift allowance is not credited as part of FFS I received, until I saw the FFS statement.

After checking the FFS I sent mail to my Leaders, HR and Payroll India team informing same on 10th March 2015. (You can check the mail trail for all the mail communications happened.)

I was promised(on call) by my leader that the amount will be credited by 25th April 2015. Even this didn't happened.

So, I spoke to Payroll India yesterday on call and they informed me that they received information about the shift allowance only on 17th April 2015 and as the cut-off date was 14th April 2015 hence they could not process in April's payroll. Now the dues will now be credited in May's payroll.

I sent my first mail after checking FFS statement to my leaders on 10th March 2015. I am finding very hard to understand why this took so long to process even when this is known that the amount is pending for more than a year.

And, Now I cannot wait for another payroll for my payout as I have some commitments and also I am not able to trust that this will be done in May as well.

I am stressed as this was never expected from such a large and reputed organisation."

- If you play the game, suck up to your boss and speak up even if you have nothing valuable to add, you'll move up the ranks quickly 
-Quality of work has little to do with how you're evaluated. Your direct manager is usually not in the meetings that determine promotions and raises, therefore you're judged on how much others know about what you do (at a company of thousands of people...)

You've done everything possible to satisfy these callers but if they are having a bad life it's your fault and  potentially your job.

They use excel a lot and need  to update their programs! When they build in-house applications they seem to only meet half the needs of their customers. Their IT acts as if it is a different company from the rest of the group and is extremely difficult to work with.

Your merits are based on a curve!

Stable job if you can keep up with frustration working in slow and chaotic environment.,"Company has too much of bureaucracy. Too many people working since last 20, 30 or 40 years and don't want to change. Company culture is to keep everyone happy than get the actual work done. Employee/contractor ratio is around 30%/70%, so employees are only supposed to only manage contractors and not do any work. This adds up huge costs to any development/maintenance activities and creates very high political environment. 
Year end bonus system is very contentious and creates toxic environment. Top 5% employees get 5-10 times more bonus than rest of 85%. This makes people not to collaborate, not to share knowledge and not to respect colleagues in the same team. Everybody is more concerned about what the best about them they can put in the year end paper. Leaders look at only the individual contribution and not at how this person helped the whole team.
Experienced employees are expert enough to take advantage and steal the ideas from new and naive employees and present to senior management since they have better network. Promotions are non existent which in turn makes environment more frustrating and good bonus is the only way to make more money. 

If you are looking for collaborative, challenging and productive environment, this is definitely not a place for you. If you want a stable, average paying job, willing to put up with ugly politics and deceptive colleagues, not want much growth in your career, you will enjoy this place."

4) Amex is undergoing a digital transformation which will position the company well in the next few years
5) Good corporate social responsibility initiatives","1) You need to be good at politics - if you come from the outside, you'll be surprised at the level of politicking required to push your initiatives through
2) This is a matrixed organization and you will be working with cross functional teams on a daily basis. This creates a confusing, consensus driven culture where no one is willing to put a stake in the ground. Lots of swirl and nothing gets done
3) The current performance rating system is crazy. You are rated against 'goals achieved', 'leadership skills' and stack ranked against your peers. This creates a competitive work culture where you're incentivized not to help others so that you can one up your peers. The kicker is that since Amex is a matrixed organization, you still need to work together to get things through. It's like pushing a bill through Congress.
4) Be prepared to make decks. Lots of it. It's something to consider if you don't enjoy powerpoint.
5) Promotions and high profile projects are based on favoritism. You need someone in your executive leadership to like you and champion you otherwise you're not going to grow.
6) This is not a place to specialize. Everyone is trained to be a generalist so that they can move from role to role. That's not a bad thing, it's just everyone eventually become project managers without core skills to offer

If you go to HR to file a complaint in Florida - expect to be Fired.  Amex has been fined under $1Billion from CFPB for banking violations: discrimination, deceptive advertising, illegal card practices, charged unlawful fees, failed to report consumer disputes, billing customers for services they did not receive. AMEX takes away their employee’s and merchants CIVIL RIGHTS through FORCED ARBITRATION. Currently a lawsuit, they are not paying employees for their overtime – AMEX would rather pay for a lawsuit and for lawyers than pay their employees overtime pay. Just laid off 4,000 employees. Several lawsuits in the past few years for FMLA discrimination but were all dropped after AMEX showed proof of arbitration. How do you have so many lawsuits against the disabled?

They also have tuition reimbursement if you're in school.,It can be very hard to promote with a lot of competition.  The benefits are also expensive and leaves a lot to be desired.
9185,,"I want to stay at American Express, I really do, but they don't make it easy to love them.",2015-03-01,3.0,Manager,"Adequate benefits. Good time off policies. Plenty of sick time. Lots of internal programs for wellness and family support. Some job descriptions get work from home opportinites, others have mandates for in-office only 5 days a week. There are some great leaders here, people who make you want to do better. Amex follows a balanced scorecard approach to performance that enphasizes goals and leadership. It's not really pay for performance, since you are competing against your own group(no matter how large) in your own pay grade, but if you're a top performer, and you navigate the politics correctly, you will be rewarded.","Not that this is a con per se, but it's a bank. Make no mistake about this fact. This is a bank holding company that has a large adversion to risk. If you're looking for somehwere to fail quick and often, this is not the place for you. They feed on sure bets, and if it's not a sure thing, they have no problem crashing projects over and over to make them look successful in the end. Unfortunately this really affects the project management and technical staff and their morale, it makes them look like they aren't doing their jobs correctly, however, in reality, they are doing their best to make it all work.

Amex is becoming more technologically driven but blocked by legacy midsets. Most of the tech management here are middle aged guys(and women) or older who are used to legacy IT project, operations and engineering development. When they attempt to implement development techniques like Agile methodologies(by decree of upper management) it looks gangly and disorganized. They fail to realize that a mindset change must occur across the whole organization in order to become a high tech, fast moving, technology-based company, not simply introducing a bunch of mis-managed and disjointed methodologies that are trying to be forced into place.
 
Advancement is a tricky thing here at Amex. Politics play a large role. SVPs choose VPs, VPs choose Directors and Directors choose managers based on unpublished and many times intangible criteria. Again, if you are a top performer, you WILL be recognized, but you may not even be close to getting a promotion. There is a standing mandate for preference towards women and minorities(if applicable)  however, in my experience, the pool for outstanding women and minorities is very small compared to other demographics. However, the biggest CON is the lack of a documented path to advancement. No one can tell you exactly how to move up. They will tell you what they ""think"" is the way, or maybe the way ""they"" did it, but there is no documented or accurate way to plan your development. The real answer, as someone already reviewed, is to build sponsorship and followership within the company and hope that a well fitting position opens under a leader you know."

Amex is a very relationship based culture but also very hierarchical so you spend a lot of time managing senior leader egos.

Pretend AMEX was a newspaper. Imagine you have to write an article. First you have to wait for permission to write a single word. Someone will crunch numbers and tell you you have 100 words to write no more. You start writing. The moment you want to edit a sentence you have to go back to request more permission. A lot of times you'll be told they are out of words so submit your essay and move on. Now add in the fact you're a bit of a slow writer so your topic sometimes gets outdated by the time you finish. Now imagine trying to get readers (customers) to read your crappy article that you were hamstrung in writing when they have all these wonderful other articles out there to read instead.

Excellent brand recognition, gets your foot in the door. Unafraid to defend its market position. The premium brand amongst global travel management companies.","Career progression takes time, need to be in role for at least three years. Excellent benefits ensure employee tenure but too many low performers stay on, and it is difficult to release them. A few too many who rest on an excellent brand name, their focus is managing up and internally and not ensuring the client or the team is satisfied. At Director-level ego and integrity levels need to be checked, most borderline behavior happens here. Must have a Masters to qualify for a VP role."

9355,,"Good brand, good people, unclear vision/strategy, poor leadership",2014-12-16,4.0,Senior Manager,"American Express is a great brand that treats its customers very well. I learned a lot about all the factors to be considered when launching a new customer experience or product. I was happy with my pay even though some people complained about it not being competitive to the New York market rate. Obviously it's not competitive if you're comparing it to investment banking, but I thought it was very competitive to market rate. Work life balance was great and there was a high degree of ownership. The company also encourages you to move around and explore other areas of the business, so it's a great way to explore other interests (e.g. if you're in finance and want to move into digital product management, if you're in New York and want to explore a career overseas). There are also lots of interest groups and activities that the company promotes to encourage personal and professional growth.","I found that people were often too nice and would avoid confrontation at all costs. The result is that sometimes the culture feels passive aggressive and people spend a lot of time trying to build consensus vs. working on the actual project. Since it's a heavily regulated industry, things move quite slow and they're late to adopt new technologies. Once you get to a certain level, it's nearly impossible to get promoted because there are so few positions open at the VP level, especially if you're outside of New York. Organizational changes are common; during my tenure there, I've seen entire teams being restructured when they thought they had just started on an initiative that leadership cared about. The whole time I was there, I felt that there was very little clarity about the vision and the strategy, how my work was contributing to the overall business goals and objectives beyond the immediate customer impact of my work, and I felt that people promoted to leadership positions were not necessarily great leaders (which is common in other companies too, I'm sure)."

Opportunities to work with many people, with very diverse backgrounds.","The most painful part of working at Amex is the constant restructuring.  Layoffs are constant and happen for all sorts of reasons: downsizing, resourcing strategies (e.g: outsourcing), or sometimes they just feel like shuffling things around.  Who gets laid off seems arbitrary - unless they decide to just eliminate entire departments (a fairly common practice).  I've seen many good employees get laid off.

Review process is painful and often unfair.  Promotion process is also unfair - they often post jobs when they already know who they are going to give the position to.  Or, when they don't , it is usually because they want to bring in someone from the outside.  In such cases, existing employees are again not given a fair shot."

Not only can this be a hassle and unorganized but it takes away from our jobs.  Pay is a big issue, the longer you have been with Amex the less pay you receive.  An example of this is say you like the department you are in and have no interest in moving to another department, basically your pay from year to year will only increase slightly not even the cost of living.  However if Amex hires new employees into your department they will be making at the very least $2.00 more an hour than the person there with knowledge and years of experience.  More and more of our jobs are moving over to India."

Co-workers are awesome","You have to know somebody to get promoted. Manager's already tend to have someone in mind when posting for a position, and post a job only because they are ""required"" to give everyone an opportunity to apply. 
So unless you are  a VP or Director's favorite, forget it. You will stay in the same role forever.

They would say how great you're doing and then complain to their leaders about how their team doesn't do well. So all in all the leadership could be better. 3) Trying to get promoted or move to a different department is near to impossible. I knew people that had been ""on the floor"" for 3+ years and had been trying to get into a different department but couldn't.

Positives have included high loyalty of employees to the company, strong financial performance, variety of job openings (however usually lateral positions).  Work/Life balance is very good and one of the few reasons I have stayed so long.","The company constantly reorganizes and has no problem giving employees pink slips.  It is not uncommon to see your position eliminated once every 2 to 3 years.  Shareholders come first, then customers, and employees are dead last.  Phoenix office has recently converted to BlueWork--cubicles have been removed and now everyone sits at open tables that need to be reserved everyday.  Everyone complains about the environment, it can be extremely noisy and disruptive.  Many jobs have been outsourced to India, and more and more people from India are being imported to work in Phoenix; displacing employees who are US citizens.  It is not uncommon for calls and conversations to be in Hindi, where I've had to remind people that not everyone is from India so meetings need to be conducted in English."

They want you to have your very own ""development plan"" but don't give you any tools or encouragements to get there. Encourage metnorship and networking, but don't tell you how to advance your career. When you do get a raise, it's only 2% and that's for working your a** all year.

Boring monotonous job even though you are at home you are chained to computer and calls for entire shift with very brief breaks.

If you want to move up, you have to suck up to everyone. Amex is not a company that recognizes talent unless your kissing someone's butt. It's like a cool's kid club. Management gossip about each other and employees."
9416,,Great Company,2014-10-27,5.0,Customer Care Professional,Amex has a great work environment; it's not only a priority to take care of card members but the employees as well. Awesome benefits from day one. Pay is great for what you do with a very obtainable bonus structure. Met the CEO in training. I don't know any large company where you have that opportunity. High management maintains in touch.,Growth is prevalent but I've come to notice growth doesn't always mean anymore pay and actually less pay in some scenarios which I find odd. The work is tedious and not very challenging before long if you are on the phones.

Management seems legitimately interested in keeping up moral with frequent events and projects. The environment is constantly changing and evolving, which keeps things fresh and interesting if you're flexible enough to learn a new job every few months.","Adherence to policy and procedure comes with no exceptions. If you try to make an argument that you've got a better way to do something or need to step out of procedure and have reasoning to back it up, you either never hear back, are instantly rejected or it takes so long that the issue becomes irrelevant. My personal record is asking my boss for permission to talk to another department, whom I asked for permission to talk to the department above them. Once I made it to the top, they reviewed my request and gave permission for the lower department to give permission to my boss to give me permission to actually do my job. If that sounds incredibly confusing and frustrating, it is."

The people you work with on a day to day basis will be great.

Although they have a large finance presence in Sussex, the main movers and shakers are in London so you'll need to take a role there to really get on.  The Corporate ""family"" values of the company don't seem to be embodied by the upper management and seem only to be there to keep the masses content.

Lack of communication, poor guidance, No ability to move further or advance in the company, several operational changes that are not beneficial to the job performing, Company metrics are not beneficial to the employee (It seems like the system is place is designed for you to fail), There are always loop holes that are in place to eliminate you from receiving your quarterly bonuses, I have never worked for a company that penalize you for working overtime (for example. if I normally work 40 hours and decide that I need to make some extra money, so I will sign up 15 extra hours for the week. Because I have signed up for those extra hours my sales goals increased. My sales goal is $950 an hour and for a normal 40 hour week I should sale $38,000.00 for the week, and because I signed up for 15 extra hours that is going to be an additional $14,250.00 that I am required to sale as well.

Would recommend working at Amex for 3-5 years and then leveraging that to find a better advancement opportunity externally.,"- Off-shoring U.S. customer support to cheaper markets like India.  U.S. customers want U.S. support.  
- Lack of transparency among leaders; they end up going in different directions only to later find out they are not aligned in their strategies.  They need to correlate more effectively departmentally and across business units.  
- Eliminating positions and firing high performers and keeping low performers - that doesn't make sense.  
- Concerned about impact to the prestige of the brand as they move from serving the financial elite to serving the
""unbanked, under-banked, and unhappily banked"" consumer.
- Ineffective stack ranking review process that prevents rewarding all high performers, which in turn discourages high performance.
-  Some leaders invite input (as if they want to consider your input) only to sweep it aside and inform you that they want you to do what they already decided before they invited input.
-  Failure to invite input re: strategic decisions which results in many issues at time of implementation that could have been avoided if sufficient input had been sought.
-  Underpays for internal advancement.  Pays far more to bring in outside talent."

Mandatory shift bids based on 75% performance and 25% tenure (do not recognize long term employees at all - all about what you look like on paper). No shift changes even if you have childcare problems or school. Training was great but it is rushed as they want meat-in-the-seat. PTO is great if you can use it!

Amex is incredible data driven meaning that we have the insights to make good decisions especially against marketing elements.  I was always impressed by the intelligence of my colleagues.,"Working at Amex has a political element that can be difficult to swim with.  At times information trickles down from the top even when rumors are extremely accurate.

Unbelievably slow and risk-averse, reflected in hiring based on capabilities rather than aptitude - and leading to stagnation.  So consensus-driven that nothing happens, and it feels like most management drive forward by checking themselves out in the vanity mirror.

Sometimes the supervisor ( COULD BE JAPANESE OR ANY...) is very rude and do not provide you and tools and proper training. It is not fair to the new employee.

They are stuck with the concept of employees are pawns in which you can treat and move around as you wish.  The reason I stayed as long as I did was I liked the people I worked with.
9613,,Awful.,2014-07-08,1.0,Merchant Services Customer,"The benefits are fantastic, especially their vacation and time off. Excellent training.","Where do I start? The company is obsessed with its image, sacrificing quality for quantity and ""brand"". They are very top heavy, there are so many managers there, it's no wonder they are so slow to act and react to customer needs. They have a holier than though attitude. Being good at politics at Amex, is more important than your skills or contributions. Their systems are out of date, slow, complicated, patched, and their rates essentially pick on the little guys. Phone reps are so micromanaged, you feel as though you're in the 1984 novel. Everything is monitored, watched, scrutinized, and criticized. Your tone, your phrases, your language, your dress, everything will be up for review, and they always have an ""opportunity"", for you to ""improve"" even if you're doing a fantastic job. 

If you care about merchants, customers, consumers, and workers, I strongly advise that you do not use American Express. Do not work there, do not get their card. Yes their benefits are great, but they treat their employees badly on many other levels. Most of the people I worked with were very stressed out by this job. The calls do not stop, there is practically no down time, the metrics are almost completely random, and you will be lucky to see any bonus at all, ever, doing what I did. (Merchant Services Customer Care Professional). I know there are employees who are lucky enough to have good managers at Amex. I, unfortunately, ran into ambitious politically minded people who turned on me as soon as I voiced legitimate concerns they were unwilling or unable to do anything about. 

I could write a novel about all the things that make no sense there. Stay away from entry-level positions in Merchant Services, they will woo you with their flashiness, and grind you to the ground with their hypocrisy."

At the manager and Sr. manager level you are overworked with little work-life balance.  There is a very selfish culture of wanting to move up quickly, so a lot of the leadership are inexperienced and lack real leadership or mentorship skills.

Annual performance appraisal ratings are not always fair for departments with small staffs when everyone has excellent performance and ratings are required on a bell curve forcing many to receive unfair low ratings when in reality they excelled. Frequent reductions in staff.
9649,,"Great work-life balance, good pay, passive-aggressive culture",2014-06-08,3.0,Manager,"Most of the people are great; I built great friendships with a lot of the people there. Work life balance was great; I was out the door by 5pm most days during my 3 years at Amex, which is unheard of in New York. Salary was good. Maybe I'm not greedy or maybe I wasn't very smart and didn't do my market comparison, but I was happy with my salary and the 15-20% bonus I got as a manager (sometimes more depending on business unit and self performance). I also liked the fact that there's an on-site wellness center and a very well promoted list of benefits (such as free therapy/counseling both on- and off-site, healthy living incentives, and more). There's a great opportunity for advancement (up until a certain point). Depending on which business unit you're in, you may end up getting very valuable international experience.","I saw some of the most horrible, selfish leaders at Amex. Not to say that they're not great people, but it just seems that as people move up the corporate ladder, there's not an option to be a high-ranked individual contributor so you end up with a lot of high-performers who are terrible leaders, making team members miserable. There's no way to truly provide anonymous 360 feedback in a meaningful way for your leaders, so these terrible leaders rarely every grow or improve over time. There's also a very passive aggressive culture, especially within the New York office, and transparency is something everyone would talk about but no one dares to actually be transparent. Most of the time, we felt like it was one big puppet show. That the senior-level people with all the information controlled everything and your leaders really had no idea what's waiting for the team aside from what they could see for next month or quarter. I saw so many teams getting blindsided by ""sudden"" layoffs. On another note, bad news is discouraged; you never want to report a red status on your project unless you can spin it in a positive way (i.e. you're already working on a solution to fix the problem by next week!). Things move really slowly (as other reviews noted, it is a bank). I think what bothered me the most was that there was rarely any passion and developing employees is typically a second, third, or fourth priority. Of course, the culture across the different sites vary. I love the Brighton, Phoenix and Florida offices! They have a very different, people-oriented culture."

Working from home when needed or wanted is a huge benefit, especially as a modern, working mom.",LOTS of processes.

9669,,Conspiracy to term as many of the tenured individuals as humanly possible!,2014-05-28,1.0,Merchant Services,"When I first started working for Amex, I thought I had found a gold mine. They seemed to be the type of company that had disregarded the fact that they were doing business in a right to work state and were committed to giving their employees a fair shot at an amazing career. The benefits were awesome as well and the employees bonded like family.","After being at Amex for 1 year +, I quickly learned that employees were just as, if not more disposable than most other companies. In the course of 1 month, I watched 4 of my co-workers who had been there for at least 20 years get fired for minor hiccups like falling in the bottom 20% on surveys and others from a technicality resulting from a misunderstanding of a policy being deemed a ""critical infraction"" by management. From that point on, my faith in Amex was shot and I suppose it is of no surprise seeing as all of the new hires have ridiculous and stringent metrics to uphold after only 4 weeks of training before they are released with the general population. Case in point, why pay the reliable veteran more when you can still program the thirsty newbie to do what you want them to do and for peanuts? Makes sense to me."
9670,,Overall very positive,2014-05-25,4.0,Director,"Smart, talented, professional nice people. There is (or at least there was a few years back) a tremendous culture of respect for other people, a highly diverse and interesting workforce, and a very collaborative and teamwork-oriented work environment. In a number of ways, Amex is not the typical cutthroat corporation, but a bit of a 'kindler, gentler' place - although I have heard that has been changing over the past few years. I was always impressed with the proactive and professional internal communications  - they typically did an excellent job communicating with employees, whether for planned events or late-breaking news bulletins. They are very good at retaining talent by encouraging movement around the company. Performance reviews are taken seriously.","While Amex encourages people to move around the company, a number of the business units are not strong at integrating people from other parts of the company - from what I understand, the Consumer business and OPEN in particular are very insular and often don't have as much respect or support to help people who come in from other units be successful."

Depending on what department you work in, they invest in your development and training; however, operations seems to not invest anything in certifications and up training. Amex has many career paths that allow you to ""try it before you buy it"" and really feel what another role is like before moving on.","There is a lot of operations outsourcing to other countries, which eliminates jobs here in the U.S. In addition, gaining additional up-training and certifications in operations is near impossible. The company is also very political as you'd expect Corporate America to be."

Overloading Team Leaders with so much ""reporting responsibility"" that they have little to no time to develop their direct reports.  The ""development plan"" program appears to be nothing more than an empty promise, as there is never time allotted to work on your plan, so you are rarely ever able to obtain your goal.
Rolling out ""cookie cutter"" initiatives, which are branded to increase customer satisfaction with no leeway given to personalize the initiative to fit the individual clients.  These often result in the exact opposite of what was intended."

When you are hired, you are told that this is not just a job; it's a career and that you are now here for life...you are now PART OF THE FAMILY. You are given the impression that you are a permanent employee from day one. Unfortunately, that is not the case.

You must go through a training process and instead of basing your permanent hire on how well you did in the training program or how well you grasp the systems or procedures.  No... your permanent hire is based on two things:  1) how much you kiss up to the management training team because you final hire rest solely in their hands and has nothing to do with your skills or performance; and 2) surveys that you receive in a very, very flawed system. You will receive bad surveys from card members you never even talked to or regarding issues like...American Express making a corporate decision to remove an airport lounge access which has nothing to do with the service you provided that card member, just their dissatisfaction with a corporate decision that you took no part in but YOU will get that bad survey and they will constantly tell you that there is nothing they can do about you now being stuck with that bad survey although they listen to those calls and know that it had nothing to do with you but that one bad survey may very well keep you from getting a permanent hire. Also, keep in mind that in order to wipe out 1 bad survey, you must get at least 5 excellent surveys...yeah, that math makes no sense to me either. Additionally, with the mess they have with the company that manages their surveys, your surveys are sometimes held for 10 days and when 1 bad survey and only two good surveys in a week can destroy your possibility of being permanent, you can understand that they holding surveys back can affect you in the worse way.  But remember...this all revert back to #1...if you didn't make good surveys but you kissed plenty of training management butt or if you're a man...YOUR GOLDEN!!!

Their system frankly makes no sense because they spend all this money on background checks, training, paying into your benefits from day one, etc. and pay you a good salary just to walk 50% of a training class out of the bldg. based on surveys that you have no control over and have nothing to do with the customer service you actually provided. Someone at the top either doesn't know these dumb business decisions are being made or they just don't care to realize that this can only serve to breakdown what was once an amazing company to be a part of.

You are even required to select your health insurance within 60 days of hire although you may very well be walked out of the bldg within the next three months and ultimately be left with no health insurance whatsoever because you cancelled the insurance you had prior to working there and now after Obamacare, you can't get it back.

Also, remember all the above if you are considering leaving a permanent position you currently have to take a job with American Express. You may be leaving something solid for a very, VERY shaky possibility. Do you really want to risk your security that you've worked hard at, on the luck of the draw? The grass isn't always greener on the other side is absolutely applicable when considering a position with American Express. It's unfortunate because every actual permanent employee I spoke with told me it was an excellent place to work but again, to actually get to that point you have to walk on hot coals and glass. It's all a matter of luck and being liked by the training management and not experience or skill, which in the long run only serves to hurt the company and its card members.

Additionally, if you are female; are even remotely attractive; are slimmer than the training management and/or you happen to dress more professionally or fashionably than the actual training management staff, they resent you and they will use this to hinder your final hire.  After your first orientation day, no matter how cute or fashionable you may see some of the trainers dressed and believe me, some of them wore skirts so short the queen waved...DRESS DOWN...DON'T WEAR MAKEUP...NO BRIGHT COLOR...NO NAILS...KEEP YOUR HAIR AS PLAIN AS YOU CAN...NO HEELS...NOTHING FASHIONABLE...IF YOU'RE SKINNY, WEAR VERY LOSE CLOTHES...IF YOU ARE EVEN REMOTELY ATTRACTIVE, PLAY IT WAY DOWN...DON'T DO ANYTHING THAT WILL RUFFLE THE MANAGEMENT TEAM BITTIES because that will be the end of you!!!!  None of this applies to the men because the men can do whatever they want."

This includes middle management positions and higher level roles (3 years).  This gives most people the opportunity to learn a wide set of skill sets over their career.

-People are very supportive across most levels.  When you have a question, you can reach out to any individual in the organization and expect a response. 

-The caliber of people from an intellectual and social perspective is second to none.

-Customer satisfaction is a high priority in the organization.  Any initiative that could impact our customers is taken with a high degree of seriousness and thoughtfulness.","-Upward mobility has become a huge issue at AXP.  As the company grows at a slower rate, fewer new roles are created in Finance.  As a result you have fewer promotions and people leaving the organization.  

-The recent downsizing disproportionally impacted finance.  As a result, you have fewer people performing a lot more work than before.  Prioritization can only go so far.

-Inconsistent experiences in Finance.  Each finance group takes after its leader, some groups are better than others.  Some groups have slower growth, and some prefer to hire externally over internally. 

-Ratings don't always equal performance.  The subjectivity that goes into ratings can make it difficult in some groups.  Sometimes alignments are performed too locally and not across broader organizations.  If you end up in a very strong strong group with clear favorites, you could end up being rated lower than if you had joined a weaker group.

-Salaries can be on the lower side particularly if your ratings are on the average side.  If you outperform, your salary is lower by roughly 10%-15% versus similar jobs externally."

Most business units offer flexibility to work from home either all the time or two days per week.,It is extremely competitive - very hard to get ahead.  People cannot get promoted within their jobs and there is so much competition for any open opportunity.  Hard work does not pay off here.  The way to get ahead is through self-promotion and having a leader who fights for you.  There is very little collaboration because people are trying to make themselves look better.  It's all about the politics here and some people play the game well.  HR is useless at this company as well - they are solely there to help managers and don't care about employees.  Also the company frequently downsizes so there is little job security.

For a company that should treat employees and potential employees nicely, I have often been disappointed by HR. They seem to want to place warm bodies in seats, but are either not empowered or don't care enough to find a good match. They don't seem to care for developing long-term relationships.

As a hiring manager, some of the resumes that HR ""screens"" for me are laughable. They could not be more out of touch with what the job actually needs. I have done better to post the job somewhere else and do all the sourcing work on my own. Which makes me shudder to think how many good candidates Amex has turned away because HR simply does not get it. They actually send me the opposite of what I need.

It also bothers me that they constantly pat themselves on the back for a job well done, but from what I see, they do very little apart from enforce things like an antiquated ranking system.

Which brings me to my next point. Amex uses a stack ranking system, straight out of 1950. 
Most reasonable companies have gotten rid of this (eg, Microsoft, etc.) because they realize it does not work and only fosters a non collaborative environment.

This means your performance is graded on a curve (1 = best 2= average 3= worst). You are compared to your peers, who may have a totally different job than you. You are also rated by people higher up than you. That's right. You are rated by someone who has no idea who you are or what you do. How to get around this? Spend less time on your job and more time meeting higher ups. Makes sense, right? So, even if you work 24-7 you will likely still get rated a 2 (almost no one ever gets a 1). The same rating as your coworker who worked half as much as you, but is not quite bad enough to be a 3. Motivation loss, anyone?

This brings me to my final point. Willful ignorance. We know at Amex that certain things we are not good. We are not going to be competitive in the global marketplace much longer if we cannot figure it out. Look at what companies like Square are doing. They are eating our lunch. Yet, we continually make poor choice. We promote people out of loyalty, not competence. We allow incompetent high level managers to remain in their jobs, even after they are rated poorly for years. We allow our technology to be stuck in 1990. We care more about recruiting some MBA than someone who knows how to get the job done."

Take away the niceties from customer service. ""We won the JDPower award 7 times, there's no way we can lose it, no matter what we do"" is the new mantra. Stress is the word of the day.

For the past 12 months I had no work-life balance because of the ever conflicting directions that you get from senior leadership and the very poor management in my direct chain.

They have an awful and obsolete rating system so even if you do an excellent job you may not get the rating you deserve just because you have to be rated against your team. When the team manages different functional areas this rating system is simply absurd.

As someone else mentioned before, people get promoted to management roles just because of their tenure with the company. Again, if someone is a good individual contributor that does not make them good people managers!

You will see that Chinese have Chinese employees. If you are not Indian you may have to ask one of your Indian friends to ask an Indian team to do something. If you ask the team directly they may not reply. Some teams are great; some won't do anything unless you are Indian.  It's disheartening, if you were born in the U.S. or came at an early age you won't be prepared for the tribalism.

    Be leery of the top ten places to work rankings. Notice that it is very often based on diversity. You have race based, gender based, country of origin based organizations in AMEX and even things like women's leadership book clubs. You will receive notifications from VPs saying they want to promote more women. 

     Pay attention to all the comments about re-orgs. At least one a year. At first they got rid of the under-performing employees. Now it is anybody.

     Some teams have bottom up initiatives. You create your own opportunity. At the end of the year you get evaluated on your work. Others, though, are run by the whims of the leadership. You will chase bad idea after bad idea. Leadership will squash anything that is not originally theirs. You will become inefficient by templates, formats, MIS requirements, changing priorities, and unresponsive capabilities teams. You will spend five minutes of analysis and five days on putting together a presentation. Then months will be spent on low or negative valued alterations Driving implementation is not a priority for these types of teams.  No prioritization or consideration of opportunity costs.  At the end of the year you get evaluated on how lucky a guess the leadership made.

If the job requires a Ph.D. and you get a rigorous technical interview don't assume that the work is engaging. You may very well find that the most engaging thing you do is addition. It can be a real bait and switch."

The brand name also looks good on your resume.","""Suitable only for pregnant ladies and old women""- I read this in an earlier review. Could not have been more apt.

Growth is deathly slow. You can never be promoted in your own role. You have to apply, interview everytime- almost like an outsider- for every promotion. If you do not make any noise about having done a great job, the company will not promote you for twenty years! 

There are ZERO documented goals for a lot of roles. All promotions and appraisals are thus based on face value and politics. 

The senior mgmt has their blinkers on, still believing it to be one of the best financial service brands in India while competition is eating their lunch left, right and centre. The organization wastes money on one hand and then resorts to hiring freezes to tide over plan shortages on the other. The myopia is all too obvious. 

The work life balance thing- the so called ""Amex Culture"" is a myth. You will end up working late or even on weekends- if you are lucky you will be able to work from home on weekends. 

If you are a passout from an ivy league campus, DO NOT JOIN. Your career will die a slow death here. The most irritating thing you will find esp if you are from an IIM or pedigreed institute is that most people in middle management are from third tier B-Schools (or worse graduates) and lack basic communication, time management and leadership skills."

If you're interested in working at AMEX because of what you read or see in the press - take a closer look. This is a bank first and foremost. The cool stuff you see and hear about is about 1/1000000th of what really goes on and a cloud of PR fluff. If you accept that and are still interested that's fine and to be fair, the cons of what you'll find here are probably no different than any Bank job you'll see on Glassdoor:

1) Lack of risk taking. Senior management will always take the safer route or one backed up by overwhelming evidence. We're a BANK. With a lot of regulation and oversight. This usually means following the middle ground or being late entrants. You'll have good ideas. Your co-workers will have good ideas. If it's risky though and unless it comes straight from the top down - your idea is guaranteed to go no where beyond a deck. You could spend a whole 12 months writing a deck about stuff you'll never get out the door. It's amazing how the year-end cycle comes and goes and the only tangible output people have is a whole lot of documentation about what we would ""like"" to do. Crazy!

2) Overuse of the word Innovation. People love to throw around the word innovation. It's like people using the word API in their pitches but can't even explain what REST is. Innovation to your managers is different from what you think (or would like) innovation to be. Innovation is cost-efficiency, it's taking an existing process and fine-tuning it or a big biz dev partnership. It's not hacking away like a startup or being agile (don't get me started on agile). 

3) CYA, CYA, CYA. There is a lot of covering going on. Due to the hypersensitive combination of bank, lack of risk taking and personal ambition - you get a lot of meetings and calls which really are for the purpose of individuals to cover their rear in case things go wrong down the line. This creates abysmal layers of bureaucracy. Next result: slow like molasses to get decisions and things done plus watered down outputs due to design by committee."

10080,,Steadily going downhill,2013-07-12,1.0,Account Services,"Above average pay and benefits, relatively speaking. Doesn't suck as bad as the competition.","Stress level is through the roof. More and more responsibilities are piled on the employees as the staff gets cut repeatedly and less new employees are hired. Most employees now do 3 or 4 former employees' jobs. Pay is rarely 'cut', but the ever-changing bonuses become harder and harder to attain, which results in worse pay each year. 

Management is extremely pro-gay and pro-female, so prepare to be forced to listen to gay groups caroling in the hallways, etc., and be fired if you complain. Qualifications are of little importance as long as you're female/gay. 

Never ending errors and system 'glitches' that never get fixed. Double check your statements!

Product is stable and not part of the more hated portion of Wall St.  Good company to have on the resume.","Mass layoffs every two years or so (seriously, ask around).  Performance management system requires a minimum number of low performers in the annual review process, so if your team is high-performing, someone still gets a low rating.  I was told that I was ""the one"" despite strong results.  This reduced my bonus and later prevented me from transferring to a new department, which was very disappointing.  The culture is extremely risk averse, so there is often a groupthink mentality due to leadership who embrace the status quo.  Not a place for innovation."

It is a fun environment with great perks.,"They are constantly reorganizing - every year there are large layoffs, so it's not a very secure environment.  Also, to get promoted, it is often a lot of additional work - they encourage movement at the lower levels so you have to work on building your ""brand"" outside your group in order to get a new job - and you have to apply for promotions for the most part.

Do not expect to do something earth shattering or extremely dynamic - Amex does do cool stuff but it pails compared to the number of employees it has employed and unless you get into the right group you might not get the opportunity. If you come from a startup you will do in 8 months what it might take 2 months to do in a startup. 

I would recommend that you evaluate the Job role and prospect of the group you are potentially getting hiring into much more than American Express as a whole.

The atmosphere is very positive and the pontential to make good money is there.",They are open 24/7 so schedules can be in evening and weekends. The health benefits are not that great.

The bonuses are nice too.","Even with more flexible work arrangements, you are still expected to work 50-60 hours a week, or however long is needed to complete the project.  Then once that project is complete, there are several more already in the pipeline to replace it.  Additionally, most leaders expect you to be available 'on call' via cell when they need to speak with you outside of normal business hours.

Also, while the bonuses are good, the raises are terrible.  The first two years I was there I received raises of 2% of my gross salary- less than inflation- meaning my actual take home salary in real terms was reduced.  My most recent raise was 4%- and this was with me being ranked in the highest-tier performance grouping.  Bonuses average between 8-10% of my salary each year.

Leadership is also wanting.  Many times, I have felt bullied or manipulated by my leaders in order to complete tasks or made to feel guilty if I refuse to work longer hours.  Disappointingly, this appears to be a common strand in other groups in the company."

-Willingness to work with parents
-Lots of perks such as free food, free hotel stays/trips and nice quarterly bonuses","-Inability to work with people who need to take FMLA
-Management breathes down your neck
-Management can and will twist anything you say to use it against you.
-Allow far too much time to pass between training and implementation
-Just an overall inability to work with employees.

I worked for Amex Travel for a little over a year. In that time, my team switched supervisors twice, changed our seating arrangements around 6 times, and just dealt with a lot of general chaos. During that year I developed severe carpal tunnel and was advised that I required surgery. After approaching my supervisor about getting the paperwork for FMLA, I was suddenly written up for ""performance issues"" and let go a week later. I was one of the top performers for productivity (every month within the top 5 EMPLOYEES out of 200+), yet I had ""performance issues""? My supervisor also took a private conversation we had and twisted it around to give me a critical infraction that helped lead to my being let go.

As for the time passing between training and implementation, they had my team take international training, yet not start taking any international calls until over 4 MONTHS later. After that amount of time, none of us could remember the training. The only refresher course was to sit with a more senior agent for a hour to listen in on a call. Essentially, they throw employees to the sharks, then blame them when they get a limb bitten off. I would never recommend working here to anyone, small perks aren't worth being treated like garbage."

- Encouragement of lateral movements, great mean to get into other business areas where other companies would not even consider you given your irrelevant background
- Bright and educated people
- Reputable brand name which gains trust from clients","- Closed-loop network has always been a product benefit, ironically, people there also work in closed-loop networks making cross unit collaboration extremely inefficient and this killed numerous opportunities as a result.

- Too much selfishness in place, performance metrics does not reflect the true picture. Concerns with personal metrics outweights the well-being and benefits of the business as a whole. In many cases quality of work is sacrificed in order to ""make up for the numbers"" on their own scorecard.

- Too much brown nosing, it is not rare to see someone with a usual snobbishness rating of 10 to completely go out of their way to lick the soles of the so called band 50+ and get rewarded.

- People outside the US are treated like second rate citizens.

- Productivity is low, excessive internal procedures, some are even redundant. Most Town Halls are a complete waste of time where the so-called ""information"" conveyed could be read and obsorbed in less than 3 minutes if passed by e-mail.

- Be more prudent on your outsourcing to India, in one case, I had problems understanding what the IT support is saying to the point that I gave up talking and communicate through email instead...and getting her email address alone took me more than 5 minutes because her English was as bad you could imagine."

10195,,"Good company, but there are some very fundamental flaws",2013-03-17,2.0,Director,"-   Overall, the vast majority of people are great to work with.
- Great name to put on your resume - it really opens doors externally.   Funny enough, it also gives you something to talk about socially as everyone has an opinion about credit cards  :)
- Lots of basic training available
- Forces you to learn new skills to do your job.","- Performance review process punishes risk takers or those who push for multi-year transformational projects.   Those with minimal risk or small projects that are implemented in less than a year receive favorable ratings.
- Everyone is graded on a curve - which does not work well when you are on a top performing team being compared against middle performing groups.  A person rated at 50% in a top 5% team will not receive recognition (or very very minimal) different than someone who is rated at 50% at a 50% performing team.   It does not make sense to go above and beyond at American Express and expect corresponding recognition/compensation.
- What once was a very collaborative and engaging company is rallying around silos, personal projects, and avoids risks.   Too much finger pointing happens from long entrenched middle management who are able to manage through the basics.
- Blue Work program, while highly regarded by the HR department, has forced many employees into situations that have negatively impacted ability to perform.
- Innovation is talked about frequently, but strict adherence to quarterly results drives funding for new programs.   Great ideas that align with long term market/industry trends get cut all the time if they don't deliver within a very short timeframe.   All technical development of new assets is handled by 3rd party firms that staff with low cost resources - almost always with offshore teams that lack the qualifications needed.  It is no surprise when the products are of mediocre quality at best.
- Everyone is scared.  With layoffs, inconsistent ratings, and constant budget cuts, it is hard to predict what comes next.  The Execs are fighting over who will be the next CEO which has a downstream impact over their organizations.
- Ken Chenault yet again had a 24% pay increase to $28 million dollars last year.  Many  employees made less this year than last (lower bonus), due to “tougher company performance” which included an artificial restructuring charge so they could lay off 5500 people.   How can someone trust their company after seeing that behavior?"
10196,,Awful company with a bad culture and poor management practices,2013-03-16,1.0,Manager,"- Good training to manage up well and learn about personal brand
- Good work life balance on the whole. Working day between 8am-6pm","- Stack performance ratings unfortunately inhibits collaboration and innovation
- Poor management practices- army style ranking. This inhibits innovation and demoralises many employees. Unfortunately, the different ranks are not equal, so you could have a person in a lower rank with a larger and more senior role than somebody in a higher rank. Also you can have people in the same rank with 2 years experience up until 15 years. However, they are both treated as being at the same level of experience.
- Poor pay and is a lot lower than competitors
- It's all about who you know, not what you know
- Tenured professionals end up getting promotions over more experienced and more intelligent less tenured people
- Senior management are very arrogant and think you are too far beneath them to even say hello
- Senior management don't have enough business experience to lead or manage a business as they've all just worked their way up the chain and have been promoted due to tenure
- Poor technology and systems make the company very slow to react
- Performance reviews are based on who management like opposed to who has delivered more value to the business"

10253,,Emotionally disconnected,2013-01-19,1.0,Customer Care Professional,Game Room at Phoenix campus,"Everything else. The training is terrible. One particular coach is racist and treats the white people better than the other races. She has a bad attitude covered by her super fake perky tone of voice. She talks down to people and it doesnt matter because no one does anything about it. If you ask her a question, you'll be lucky if she answers you without making you feel dumb. 

The ""metrics"" we had to have to pass training are super unattainable. They tell you your CHT has to be at 341 and you have to have 12 TBASS over a rolling 4 week period to graduate. Then they make you use a stupid instant messenger where there are 10 people to 1 coach answering questions. Putting people on hold to have to wait for a response raises your CHT. How is this fair? It isn't! It's a joke! Do you feel that emotional connection?! 

The RCAs are SO subjective. It depends on who is grading them if you will get an excellent or not. One coach tells me to do it this way and then a different coach listens to my call and gives me a ""not excellent"". It's not fair!"

They are a very stable, mature company who treat their employees with respect and courtesy.  As a result, they have a freakishly low turnover rate.  I used to wonder how they managed to make money with all the employee coddling they do... but they make money hand over fist, year after year.","Like most tech groups, they are outsourcing a TON of jobs to India.  This creates a lot of stress for US-based employees, who struggle with both time differences and culture/language obstacles.  Amex goes on a 12-18 month cycle of layoffs, and they seem to be getting deeper and more frequent.  People don't often quit the company, but the constant spectre of layoffs feels like a game of Russian roulette sometimes.  

Because the company is so mature, they have very rigid processes.  They're trying to establish an entrepreneurial splinter group to develop mobile applications to stay competitive, and they've deliberately kept it separate from the rest of Technologies so it can function more like a west coast start-up company.  However, peeps who are used to the silicon valley atmosphere will HATE Amex unless they get into that one mobile dev group."

You won't receive a laptop, printer and office setup until at least 6 weeks into the job. You will have about 20 different passwords for systems that do not integrate.  Formal training happens anywhere from 3-5 months on the job.  Working at GCP is like being on a runaway train, departments do not communicate.  Example: the underwriting department needs 14-25 days to review financials to provide a line of credit.  Account setup teams refuse to communicate necessary information to aid setup.

I asked the interviewer numerous times why was I in training for 3 months she said ""Oh just so we can make sure you know the product."" They have all these rules on how they can fire you. Call avoidance, Taking too long on a call, System Issues, Transferring, being in auxillary mode and Surveys. Let me just talk about surveys for a second. They will hold you accountable even if it's something that is totally unreasonable and out of even their own company policy and the customer complains in a survey about it. This company is run by a bunch of idiots.Then they have micro managers on the phone that will hold you accountable for what the past rep did to the customer and when you try to fix it for them, management tells you , you were on the phone too long. We asked our trainer what the success rate was for graduating training we were lied to and told he only got rid of 1 person all the time he has been training . While I was in training 3 people were fired just in my training class.They also put a Webcam in your house during training .STAY AWAY!"

Large enough company to enable various experiences in different business units, different functions as well as different level (i.e. central vs. local).","Somewhat slow processes, due to the fact that it is an old and large company in a field highly regulated and requiring high data protection.

Good career opportunities if you are not in CAT.  If you want to get anywhere in this company stay away from the CAT department as it is a career black hole that gets little respect from the rest of the sales organization and is almost impossible to post out of, due in great part to the department head not standing behind his people and caring more about his own interests than those of his employees","People are arbitrarily let go.  I was one of the top ranked employees and was let go because of new manager.  There is no rhyme or reason for firings, they keep under-performing employees and get rid of high performers.  The CAT department is a sales group run by number crunchers that have no idea what it takes to motivate sales people.  The department head and managers are clueless as to the sales process as few have ever done sales.  It is highly political and brown nosing is encouraged and rewarded.  Managers will are selective in their disciplinary actions and if you are ""in"" with them and suck up to them, you will do well but if you challenge them or question policies and procedures, even in a constructive way, you'll get on their bad side and they will find a way to get rid of you.

-Good starting salary which is above the general trend.
-One of the few companies that have 8.5 hrs shift.
-Good work culture. Better than most other companies.
-Easy to have a good work life balance.
-Number of training programs.
-Good infrastructure. Feels good to be there. (This should not be ignored while considering a job change. I found this to my peril. Went to the second company and the surroundings there, left me disappointed from the very first day). There are few companies which have better or equivalent facilities and what Herzberg called the Hygiene factors. E&Y is one example. Went there for an interview. Good package plus very good infrastructure.
-Management quite friendly.
-Very quickly one gets used to the company. To me it was like second home. Used to feel very comfortable there. Even if the job's not to one's liking you feel like going there.
- It is a testament to these facts that AMEX is usually in the top ten in India in terms of employee satisfaction.","-As mentioned one gets used to AMEX and then moving on becomes exceedingly tough especially if the next company is not in the same league.
-Everyone working there or going there might not agree to my views as it's my experience and what I felt personally. Somebody with more experience in more companies may not agree or may not find AMEX so agreeable.
-Again it is, at the end of the day, a place of work, a firm on a contractual relationship with thousands of employees. Whilst better in many ways it still has the other issues usually found at companies. To a lesser extent but yes they are there. The company is far from being a Semco like company which I feel, based on what I've read, is an ideal place."

Too much emphasis on job titles, and not enough on experience and expertise.
Like most large financial services companies, projects tend to be quite conservative and long winded.
My onboarding experience wasn't well designed, spent much of my first few weeks bored, with little to do.
When people move roles internally, there is very little handover, which can be very frustrating.

- Fellow employees are usually very smart and well educated, but rarely overly competitive or rude
- Relatively easy commute if you live in Manhattan;
- Jobs are fairly clear in responsibilities and narrowly focused, so you can develop deep expertise in a subject 
- In most cases, you have to take all of your vacation (use it or lose it) within the year
- Lots of non-financial resources to leverage (local discounts, on-site gym & medical center, online financial planning) that you'd expect froma big company
- 6 month Global Rotation Program, Externships with Small Businesses, and many other volunteer opportunities (consulting, board service, Junior Achievement, etc) all encouraged and supported 
- Not a stickler on face time as you can be pretty flexible in working arrangements (working from home, coming in late/leaving early for valid reasons)
- Work/life balance is what you determine it to be - usually you can get out by 6-7pm each day and not be expected to log-in from home unless you're really trying to move ahead quickly
- Feels like a smaller company given culture is relationship driven and people rotate often","- Pay lower than direct competitors and can vary wildly between employees doing the exact same job
- Tons of processes and redundancy with little training other than baptism by fire
- Pre-Amex experience is not really valued and not a lot of focus on external competition
- Poor performers at all levels and out of touch senior leaders are retained and rarely asked to leave
- MBA hires aren't treated consistenly at all; some move up to director in 2-3 years and others get stuck in multiple rotations. 
- There are no clear rules regarding performance management or promotion - ratings are simply based on having 1 big (and often heavily self-promoted) accomplishment and being well liked rather than comparison of standard metrics; analysts and managers rotate to new positions based somewhat on ratings and interview performance, but who gets the job/promotion is based more on what more senior employees do behind the scenes aka ""informal sponsorship"" - putting in phone calls/e-mails, vouching for your skills aka ""likeability"". This has led to a lot of frustration, particuarly on who gets promoted to Director and Vice President. You can have more years of experience at Amex and ""stellar"" performance reviews but others are hired because of personal connections they've developed - and the company does not apologize for it

This segment  (RLA/Dart) pays the least in incentives.

Technology is outdated compared to industry standards but the level of service and performance expected is extremely high.
Most compensation related issues are brushed under the carpet by the HR and management 
Vast gap in the treatment of Operations and support functions.

10558,,An evolving culture from Great to Not As Great,2012-03-01,4.0,Marketing Manager,"Once you're in the company, there are many opportunities to move around and try different roles.  The culture of American Express not only encourages this, it expects it.  Lower and mid level employees must stay in role 18 months, but are then encouraged to find a new role.  

The culture, as a result, is very open and career-oriented.  The objective is for each employee to find his/her ""dream role.""  Leaders and Employees have very honest and open conversations about this.  Hiring leaders will call current leaders for information about an employee before making an offer.  Networking within the company is a must.","PROCESS, PROCESS, PROCESS!  You can't get anything accomplished without the help, approval and support of at least 3 other people/groups in the company.  Lead times are long, especially for anything involving technology.  Senior leaders often don't understand the process and have unreasonable expectations about how long it can take to complete a project.

The downside of the career mobility within the company is that employees that don't switch roles can be looked down on.  It is the same story with employees who don't wish to take on leadership roles.  

Since the downturn in 2008/2009 and the reorgs that resulted, the culture seems to be changing.  There is less job mobility, but still the same stigmas for employees that don't move.  Hiring freezes and reorgs are frequent and company morale seems low.  Many groups want to hire from the outside to bring in new skills, so the open, career-oriented culture feels like it is changing.  The company seems much less supportive and much more results-focused."
10559,,"Poor managment, Lack of Direction",2012-02-28,2.0,,If you are an FTE they have decent benefits and seem to treat you ok.,I felt ill treated as a contractor.

Your performance is based on those surveys even if it was out of your control.  If the customer notes that they were unhappy with a long wait time on the phone and gave a score that was less then""excellent,"" your performance for the month goes down.  ""Very good"" on a survey WILL bring your score down! Anything less than a 9 or 10 on customer satisfaction, will also bring your numbers down for the month. Also, at times a survey is meant for someone else. Your team leader will listen to the phone calls with poor scores, and even if determined that you are the wrongful recipient of a survey, you are stuck with it. It cannot be removed from your stats.
