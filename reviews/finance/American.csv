4,,Pros and Cons,2022-04-13,2.0,Branch Specialist III,Great pay and opportunity to grow.,"Very high demanding and expect you to make cold calls to existing members to solicit other benefits and promotions. Lots of goals that need to be met that are often unattainable. Fellow employees are very cliquish and do not work as a team, lots of backstabbing and unhealthy work environment. Integrity of fellow employees and management do not follow ethos of the company."

13,,Location... Location... Location...,2022-04-07,3.0,Life Insurance Specialist,You CAN make 6-figures by obtaining a life insurance license and following the process that they teach you. AAA works toward making a positive office culture and yes it is flawed but the intention is good. They incentivize other agents (P&C) to send you life insurance leads by offering them 20 dollars. You are assigned several territories and as such don't have to worry about other life agents stepping on your toes or vice versa. You get offered great benefits and mileage reimbursement.,"You HAVE to make OUTBOUND calls to survive. Unfortunately, you are at mercy of the P/C agents and the quality of leads they sent you. If you have agents that truly care about helping members with their life insurance then they will send you great leads and the earning potential is great. However, because of the high turnover rate, it is difficult to have a long-lasting team that can mutually help each other. The only way to remedy this is for you to make as many outbound calls and most of them COLD CALLS. 

People HATE talking about life insurance.

Recruiters will tell you that agents will send you leads but it takes months if not years to cultivate a great working relationship for them to send you quality leads."

They started to give paid holidays off but that was a lie as they will make you work and use the excuse that the region is behind

One month you may have far exceeded your sales goal and received praise for it, but the next you may not meet even your goal due to missed opportunities or just being dealt a poor hand that month by having to take care of current customer issues in policies, etc. You may have helped 200 customers with policy issues, but all you’d made made aware of is that you didn’t meet your goal.

Sales opportunities given to favorite teams and taken away from entire teams even if individual team member meets individual goals. Unethical behavior of top producers rewarded as long as high sales numbers are being acheived. Rules and pay plans change every other month. Live leads never given to field agents, only to call center agents. Be ready to Smile and dial and service your own customers for no compensation and expected to meet sales numbers at same time.

219,,Things Recruiters Don't Tell You....,2021-12-27,2.0,ERS Advocate,"I like that ERS advocates are being pushed back into the office, especially with the uptick in covid cases in Michigan.

Training consisted of daily training via Teams (course work, modules, lectures). last two weeks of training is on-the-job training where they have you take 'easy' calls (safe at home) to get you accustom to being on the phones. Trainers I had were really knowledgeable and patient.","Company is a numbers based company. nothing else matters. Hit your numbers you are fine. Don't and you will get notes to file (written up). 

Phone calls should only last 3 minutes or less. more than 3 minutes you'll get talked to about your handling time. Continue and you will get note to file.

Light services are preferred. Triage for tows will get you marked down. I've had calls where advocates are putting in light service when the member specifically asks for a tow because they don't want their numbers to go down. how is THAT helping the member? Remember...numbers, numbers, numbers. Cheat if you have to is what seems like most people are doing to hit their numbers.

When recruited, you will pick your work schedule. please be aware that scheduled days off (SDO) can be taken away and you will mandated to work these days without an alternative day off but you do get overtime (big whoop). 

Between Christmas and New Years, i worked 6 days a week for two weeks all because i had the misfortune of picking days off considered the busiest. Seems like they would block those days off but whatever.

Breaks/Lunches can and will be suspended at a moments notice (you'll get an email or your schedule will change). 

You will be 'graded' based on your schedule adherence. All lunches/breaks/trainings/meetings must be coded or you will get marked down for adherence. If you are on a call and miss your break, you can still take it however it lowers your adherence. Numbers, Numbers, Numbers

If you want to move into another position, you can move within ERS after 6 months. If you want to move outside of ERS but within the company, you have to be in your present position a year before you can move out of ERS. They want to make sure they get their monies worth from training you (per a trainer). Supervisors are overworked, given tasks that they at most time have to complete on their own time (like listening/grading your calls). 

Review and get to know your job aids. once you are on the phones, there is no one out there to help you. They claim supervisors are 'always willing to help', they aren't. most are extremely rude when you contact them or don't even respond. 

Compensation is a joke. $16/hr. If you work past 5:30pm, you get a $1 for shift premium. You also get $5 each time you recommend a AAA facility for towing and mbr is serviced there.

In certain areas, response time for members will be 3+ hours because they don't have enough providers to handle requests. Please be prepared to literally be cussed out every day by frustrated members stuck on the road for hours. I had an elderly man, on the side of road, waiting hours for service. REached out to my supervisor is there anything we could do (maybe Uber him home, off the highway), no too expensive. Have him phone a friend. Sadly he didn't have anyone. *I* called state troopers to come check on him. next day I looked up the call to see if he got service. He did. Four hours AFTER he called me crying for help. Yeah. AAA really cares about their members.

Think long and hard about working here. Work/Life balance for ERS Advocates are non-existence. They don't pay enough for that."
220,,Don't believe the made up reviews,2021-12-24,1.0,Team Member,401 K. Co-workers. Customers. Commute to and from home,"Unfortunately a lot of the reviews that show a positive rating are made up by the AAA marketing department. Overall I am a positive person and love working with my coworkers and customer. I have been on the Job for about 5 years and have been receiving excellent reviews from my manger ( exceeds expectations). Based upon this I asked for a raise and it was denied.

A later learned that a person that just got hired and I was asked to help train was hired at a higher hourly wage than me. When I asked my boss he said that this is the going rate for new hires and it wasn't in the budget to give me a raise at this time.

I asked why. My bossed disclosed that the executive staff CEO Tim Condon and COO Osh O Crowley feels that the current staff is over paid and they feel turnover is good for the company.

I see the positive reviews and it makes me so sad that the company is paying the marketing department to write them. No one at my work speaks in the same manner as the person who wrote the review.

The insurance agents at AAA unionized and now I know why. This is the only way to work with our upper management."

During my training experience (which I’m still in) I hear F bombs daily, I’ve heard the N word and I’m a protected class. 

Triple AAA just wants to fill seats. They are vague on the compensation and also they extended the training from 6 weeks to 10 weeks which was not in the original offer letter. 

Also, the management has an us against them mentality. The issue and why there is a great turn over rate, they sell you a dream to get you in. 

They mention a top sales guy John Lee daily who is making $200k plus but he’s the only one. 
The computer and systems are dinosaur age, and the sales process is redundant. Furthermore, the entire training program needs to be revamped or they will continue to lose real sales professionals."

Always there to answer questions and/or help when encountering issues with policies. The office environment feels like a little family, we all get along.",Only the top agents stay on top based on the sales model managers are running. You get new business shifts based on your production. The more policies you sell the more shifts you get. Many Agents are frustrated and stressed out because of this set up and are struggling to generate new business by making a lot of outbound calls and asking for referrals while the top Agents sit there and get new business incoming calls from people that are ready to buy new policies. They make all the money with less effort. Managers don’t listen and to make it worse drive competitions to give out new business shifts that again benefit mostly the top Agents. No vacation or sick pay. Every time you take time off it effects your money as your unit pay is tied to your production.

They have lost over 50% of their travel staff and all those agents retired because they won’t make the money they use to make it and got feed up with all the additional work that was put on us. I highly recommend not working for this company! They don’t care about their employees and you are just a seat filler.

Other supervisors have their favorite employees and somehow always find time off the phone for them but not for the rest of the employees that actually have high scores on their calls. AAA is crazy about their employees sticking to the script, and they seriously take off points for the the tiniest little thing that can be out of your control. You have to try and offer a car rental or an approved auto repair shop when the last thing the member wants to hear you is upselling something while they are stuck in the snow without a snow chain and their 3 babies crying in the background. They always manage to give you more work, all for the same pay and expect you to do it with a smile. The work environment is toxic. This place deteriorates your mental health. If you have any love for yourself, stay way from this company, they do not care about their employees, you are just a number and easily replaceable.

841,,Terrible company,2020-12-08,1.0,Customer Service,My co-workers were the best part of the job.,Back stabbing management. Pit employees against each other. Always worried about losing job if we didn't sell enough insurance or memberships
842,,A lot of work for very little pay,2020-12-07,2.0,Travel Agent,"I was looking to get into a job with mostly customer service and restaurant experience and it provided me with a chance to break into the corporate world, working M-F instead of weekend and off hours. My manager was great, and working there long term will get you a lot. The company still offers a pension which is amazing.","The commission structure is absurd. You have to work there for a couple of years to get into the higher pay grades, less at my branch but Travel Agents at the senior level are extremely competitive, and will take clients from you and not be fair with the distribution of clients. I did about $600000+ in sales my first year, which my counterparts hired at the same time did no where near, so I was pretty good, but I ended up making about $35,000 total for the entire year because you literally make a percentage of a percentage with their commission structure. The higher ups will talk about how this makes sense for commission protection but as someone who had to take a short leave of absence for personal reasons, it did not protect me and I was forced to forfeit any commission I should have received from the carry-over due to the rules. They have more managers then employees. Literally went to a 'team-building exercise' where we formed circles of managers and employees and the managers circle was 30% bigger. If you want to be a successful Travel Agent, you have to put in the hours. The other Travel Agent at my office who had been there 15-20 years was probably making around $90k a year but she worked about 60 hours a week."

853,,??,2020-11-30,1.0,Service Provider,Help people who are in need,Micromanagement by unqualified supervision. The Senior Manager is a disgraced former cop who ran a family over killing some of them. This is the person the company chose to get on people about being safe on the road and that is indicative of the entire nightmare that is AAA. There is an elitism complex and that idiot is a trust fund baby. The clime is extremely corporate and their is a lot of good old boy club favoritism based on how much of a yes man you are. It's a rough neck job that is also with constant cutthroat politics. Employees are under-equipped as a general rule. This job should definitely be unionized at fleet and the call center/dispatching. Cameras are in the trucks staring at the driver constantly. Drivers and call takers are constantly pressured to do more with less and are measured with computerized calculations that don't see the whole picture ceaselessly and excruciatingly which are used to justify stiffing you on a raise. The data is always manipulated against you with it interpreted in a negative light and everyone is made to feel disposable. They got caught dumping chemicals directly down the storm drain because they were too cheap to install a filter/separator. They illegally conspired to cut down trees bypassing approval of the city. They don't post safety info as required by state and federal law. They lobby extensively against infrastructure that would get excess vehicles off the road and lessen traffic congestion. They are notorious greenwashers. The club is honestly run like a Mobster organization behind-the-scenes. They illegally fire people with protected medicical conditions. They monitor phone calls to misconstrue cherry picked segments in order to punish you over. They openly admit to burning people out as business as usual because they can always get replacements.

Each branch is different so I saw a lot of inconsistency of morale and performance expectations from office to office. In addition, I also observed high turnover for lower level travel agents (not sure if it's because of miscommunication of expectations), which was a point of frustration for me.

They  offer a work from home program with a $400 monthly fee that none seems to be able to explain why this is the only department that is charged to work from home. The systems and policy process is completely outdated. You are expected to not only achieve your sales goals but also achieve another 10 plus goals for your score card. There is a lack of leads compared to the sales agents. Which has caused a huge amount of turn over. This place is ran on favoritism.

They try to sell you this dream during training that you work Monday-Friday, and that you can make 6 figures. Once you hit the sales floor there is no guidance and everything you learned in training doesn’t even apply. The managers do not help you transition. You are constantly getting harassed on the job. NO PAID TIME OFF. If you take time off, you are still expected to hit goal, and you do not get paid. They will write you up for not hitting goal even if it’s your first month on the sales floors and you’re still learning. If you don’t meet your goal they start taking your time on the phone away, oh but they still expect you to hit goal. I was REQUIRED to work 7 days a week at some point. Working every other Saturday is also mandatory. You are disposable, and they will easily fire you instead of spending time in finding ways to help current employees better themselves. Everyone I started with either quit or went on leave because the job is so stressful. Call volume is low, and you are required to do customer service calls all day on Monday. Oh but you are still required to hit goal. The pay isn’t that great either. I have yet to see the 6 figures they hype you up about. In fact no one I work with is even close to making that.

 Please pay attention to the reviews your reading. Where they are from ie..call center, ERS (emergency roadside assistance), insurance sales, travel agents. As a travel agent working in the local branch you will be expected to reach unatainable sales goals. Besides that, it is almost like you need to bring a list of contacts with you. If you do not know a big list of clients to bring with you (they do not have the clientele) I would not recommend working here. Also they do nothing to back up the travel agents. They focus more on the branch side and it honestly seems like they are slowly working toward online sales."

And the only person of color. It was challenging for me but I thought I was doing good. You have to ask every customer about the “AAA Visa card”. If you don’t sell it they fire you. Which is what happened to me. Got 6 people to sign up in Aug and they fired me in September. It’s also a career path. Agents who sell cruises and other big trips always seem stressed. I’ve also heard them complain about quitting everyday. Makes it hard for newer employees to even picture being there for years. What a joke. Good luck to anyone who works there.

1164,,AVOID this place if at all possible - drains you dry!,2019-06-11,1.0,Inbound Customer Service Representative,"AAA, once known for its’ high level of service, now places the highest priority on selling products. The intelligence level of effort required to successfully perform the Call Center job is not very high","Supervisors micromanage every word spoken by the call center agents, as the phones and screens are monitored. Workplace rules are very rigid, bathroom breaks occur only on scheduled break and lunch times. The inflexible work schedules ranges anywhere from Monday-Friday 8a – 9p which includes mandatory work every Saturday 8a – 4:30p. Witnessed agents have been carried out on stretchers! The stress level is often so thick it can be cut with a knife as agents are continually made aware of where they stand relative to the set of performance expectations. Customer interactions excessively monitored like prison inmates and must repetitively and roboticaly follow the script.  For employment of a call center agent is solely based on the NUMBER of products sold and on “keeping the member happy” at all costs – even if it means violating AAA set policy to increase membership sales. The data driven call matrices as well as the critique of how effectively call center agents handle complaints and demands from their “entitled” membership” determines if you remain employed. For a measly $13.50, call center agents end their days feeling drained and depressed; believing they are trapped, hopeless, “stuck in a rut”, caught up in the AAA vortex, virtually powerless with no choice. You always have choices. Choose to work somewhere else!"

1173,,Looks can be deceiving,2019-05-22,1.0,Claims Specialist,Decent Benefits.  The PTO off has been increased for new employees to be compliant with the minimum Michigan Law requirements.  They mandate getting a AAA membership that you are taxed for as income at the end of the year.  New employees are paid more than current employees except if you hire in as a trainee then you are paid the same.  Employees who have been at the company for a number of years are grandfathered into the company's traditional retirement plan.  Recent hires and those who have been at the company for about about to 10 years or so are not.   They are compensating new employees more because those interviewing with the company often reject job offers or back out.   You don't need relevant job experience.,Short term company.  Not for long-term.
1174,,AAA of Missouri is a Complete Disaster for the Employee and the Customer,2019-05-21,1.0,Insurance Sales Agent,"The co-workers in insurance sales attempting to make an honest living were good people who trusted that the company had their best interest and shared the struggle with each other. They all came to find that it is a horrific, dysfunctional nightmare of dishonest upper management, horrendous systems, and embarrassing ability to help the insured while juggling about 8 different jobs for their cheap bums. Allegedly, AAA's claims have a good reputation but I think that's just something they say to prepare the customer for a meaningless array of questions intended to minimize every possible risk to the insurance industry, which of course is impossible and AAA certainly doesn't have a prayer of having the technology to handle it. I didn't see any difference in AAA's claims than in any other company, and they all say they are number 1. I think AAA made up its own survey to say they were number 1 in. No one knew what it was or had ever heard of it. You might be ok with the AAA roadside but don't find yourself out of territory or you will find yourself like countless AAA members, lost in another state far from home attempting to figure out why you were connected to 17 different AAA affiliates that couldn't help you while you spent 4 hours on the side of the road. It's all good. We've got fried Grandma for supper. Stick to getting your battery charged. They have great service for that. Forget all of the other departments, if you need travel you seem to be ok. Yep, the travel agency no one knows about because AAA's archaic ideas of marketing line up with Joe Blow's at the gas station, seem to give good service and not screw all their customers and employees over. You just have to deal with embarrassingly low pay but if you're good, you can overcome that with decent commission because at least you won't be baiting and switching your customers, unlike in insurance.","Company is attempting to phase the local office insurance agent out by promising a big ole new business commission paid by the car you insure. However, you will be expected to service every customer that has ever existed in AAA insurance in a 200 mile radius, because conveniently, they don't get to pick their agent, they just take their service to the brand new one. Don't forget that you will be expected to service these customers on the technologically equivalent system to that of a Commodore 64. What's it like to open a customer's billing table, not understand it, ask everyone in your office and not have them understand it, call your manager who doesn't work on site and doesn't have time to help you, call California where the system was allegedly born and have them go hmm, I think that there's bug #184567 and we have no idea how to fix that? Come to AAA! They will show you how this is done. Ever desired to receive a phone call from a customer who wants to put a car on the policy but you can't because you have a system error that won't let you and no one knows how to fix it and you babysit that policy for the next four months? Let AAA escort you in a fancy new way of life! Feel the need to sign someone to an auto policy than have to call them back two weeks later and tell them their policy went up $300 due to an ""unexplained system error"" or a ""careful review from underwriting""? AAA can magically do this for your life! Ever wanted to service a customer who called your 800 number from the enticing Sunday commercial that was created in 2002 and got an auto policy that was written horrifically by some stranger out of Texas who never followed up with the customer and refuses to take their calls? Well, step right up buddy boy! It's your lucky day! Grandpa's only 85 with three at fault incidents but you're the one who gets to set him up on auto pay before his 36 day cancel takes effect. So you're a new recruit and you want to make the big bucks, do ya boy? Ok, well keep up with everyone's screw ups but your own and make sure you babysit those bad boys till the end of time. Watch those days fall through like sand in the hourglass of your sales career. And hey, why aren't you meeting that sales quota? Not enough time you say? Well, we've got one hell of a deal for you. You can save time by...da ta da duh....buying your own leads. Sure, throw your money away to make us money. It's better odds than a slot machine. You won't be able to get off service desk to get out and recruit your community business anyway. Besides, your community doesn't think too highly of you and your rates suck outside the big city. If that doesn't deter you, you can always find some obscure rule for underwriting to cancel your policy. But that's ok, AAA will market for y...nevermind, we're back to some 1-800 number that's forbidden to go to any offices. Hey, no one's bigger than the company right? Besides, the agents at AAA are dishonest, lying crooks. Just ask your management, your corporate office, the people that train new agents, and everyone in your community after their policy got cancelled while they were in the hospital and they forgot to sign their middle initial. Those other companies who advertise and focus on their agents as super heroes really have it wrong. Finally, buddy, let's introduce you to something called ""forgivable"" draw and ""charge backs"". We'll throw you a bone or two called ""internet"" leads. We'll advertise to all the customers who are under 25 and haven't had insurance for a year. If you can get them on the phone after they've seen a bogus price in the quoting system that makes no intuitive sense, you might get a runner to put cold hard cash down for $370 a month cause it sounded so good. You know darn well that's good business that has a high quality chance of staying on the books so go ahead and bind it. Your manager will get a submit towards his goal and you won't get it taken out of your check until, hmm,  at least next month. If this sounds like the million dollar money making operation that you've always dreamed of, step right up, come on in, cause you're about to take the grand tour that not even George Jones could have sung about."

They only offer an HSA insurance plan that covers practically nothing. You also have to pay for your own short-term disability. The organization prides itself in having an open door policy, but the reality is further from the truth; associates are afraid to speak up and voice their discontent for fear of repercussions. 

Due to the average tenure of employees, seasoned associates can be highly cliquish and unwelcoming of new ones, especially new people with great skills who bring in new ideas. This is a place where your skill sets will quickly become obsolete. 

This organization is so siloed, everything takes twice as long to complete. Depending on the business line, some managing directors are flat out incompetent, insecure and disrespectful. 

Finally, the building itself might look great on the outside, but the furniture is dated and worn out; there are no kitchens; some floors have one microwave — there are no refrigerators.

Reasonable salary but bonus opportunities are laughable.  
Some of the people are great to work with.","The money wasted on major telephony and WFM systems that were changed and changed AGAIN within 1 year is deplorable.  These changes also contributed to low employee morale and high turnover in the call centers.  

Consistently merging with other AAA's (approximately once every other year) created a lot of anxiety, reorg's, and ""deals"", made to keep exceptionally unqualified and incompetent people at the helm. That is what started the downfall of this once excellent company.  Changes made since merger with the Mid Atlantic club were especially brutal and negatively impacted the way the Allied club was allowed to work with their members.  Every employee became expendable and management (new and old) had an annoying habit of saying how lucky we were to still have a job and how great THEY were to keep us employed after the merger. 

Staff everywhere (not just the call center) was miserable and membership (new and renewals) declined.  And, I suspect, will continue to decline, because they also feel the difference.  The national office is completely hands off of everything - except for figuring out how to make MORE money off the clubs, they have NO idea just how far we've moved off the mark.  (Maybe they don't care and everything now is just a big cash grab until the entire organization tanks.)

There was a culture of reacting to problems rather than proactively creating solutions. As an example: Nothing was done to address (never mind compete with) the new competition we had. (such as Urgent.ly and Honk)  

It's just a matter of time before the incompetence and arrogance from above topples the entire company."

-They lie about everything.  Upper management is deceitful and if you question anything you see as a fishy you'll be let go.
-They lie in the interview process about hourly pay and commission.  Let me tell you what they don't: you will only ever make $15/hour and maybe $300-800 a month TOTAL in commissions, if that. ( most months in your first couple of years you won't make any commissions.)  And trust me, you have to bust your butt to make that much.  
-Understand that the club will make commissions from you.  thousands on commissions.  but they won't give it to you.
-Familiarization trips are taken by higher-ups in headquarters.  Some are given to employees, but they're not the good ones and you have to use vacation time to take them.   Most of them are taken by people who don't even sell travel.
-Management is spineless and let members walk all over them.  Even if the member does something and complains, AAA will roll over and reimburse them for their own mistakes and guess what?  You get to pay for it too.  Literally.  AAA will deduct the money from your paycheck.  
-And if you make even a simple, fixable error, AAA will deduct $25 from your pay for it.  Even if it means that it took someone in HQ 30 seconds to type something, $25
-You're given aggressive commission goals and then harassed to coddle everyone who calls or walks in, pushed to get people to apply for a AAA Visa card, and every phone call is recorded and most are listened in on.  The second you pick up the phone someone is listening and watching your computer screen.  Big Brother?

Just avoid it at all costs.  there are so many companies you can begin a career with that'll compensate fairly and give you a positive experience.  Do yourself a favor and don't step onto this sinking ship."

Successful sales at this company is a joke, if you get 20 cars in a month your a legend there.. the sales are pitiful. Since 2011 we have lost 40% of our policies due to ridiculous rate increases.

You are expected to be punch in 7 minutes before your shift starts so you can sit down at your radio and be brought up to speed on current calls and priorities; you are not paid for those 7 minutes though, if you work 5 days a week, you're giving them a half hour of your work for free per week. Punching in at the time your shift starts is frowned upon.

During and after snowstorms, you are asked to work through your breaks to deal with the influx of calls. If you are asking your employees to work through lunch, you should provide them something to eat throughout the day instead. 

Not working overtime counts against you in your yearly reviews.

About 9 years ago during 2nd shift, a member broken down on the highway (in an active breakdown lane) called in several times to say he felt unsafe and that cars were barely missing him. He was eventually hit and this caused a huge stir in Road Service to revamp how priorities were treated. As a result, police are called in the event of a member feeling unsafe. Meetings were held with all Road Service employees to advise on the new procedures. During these meetings, the manager of Road Service told us all; ""You are all easily replaceable"".

1687,,Worst place to work,2016-12-02,1.0,Call Center Representative,No good pros. Waste of time and a very hostile work environment with very little work life balance. It's a job that's all I can say!!,"Uneducated management.  Racist, sexist attitudes, and guilty of unsavory business practices. If you have any business ethics or morals,  don't work at AAA Tidewater. Some employees miss their goals three years in a row and were still allowed to get their bonuses and most importantly,  keep their jobs. They actually let a supervisor with 20+ years go for ""poor work performance "" but how is it possible to be at a job for that long and not ever been accused of this issue some other time in the past? It appears Management resented this employee mainly due to racial issues and being the most qualified person in the department  including the manager, to get the job done. New management is best friends with the ""ceo"" (small letters for small  people). Perceived favoritism,  racism, and overall incompetence rule at AAA Tidewater Virginia from HR to Membership, to ERS. If you really care about people,  stay away from this company, they couldn't care less about you or their members."

1704,,AAA Missouri is MISERABLE.,2016-11-04,1.0,Anonymous Employee,Free AAA membership.  Pay at the supervisory level is decent.,"Where do I even begin?  Management is completely out of touch with their employees and no one has a clue how to appropriately talk to people.  The HR Department is a joke and does everything it possibly can to avoid having to investigate sexual harassment issues.  The Call Center is absolutely disgusting - the carpet and walls are stained.  There are loose wires and equipment laying around everywhere. 

The supervisor staff has people who have absolutely no people skills whatsoever.  The goals are not just unrealistic, but if you don't meet one of their precious numbers, you immediately go onto a warning that you'll inevitably be on for months because everything is based off of the member's perception of you.  

Policy's change daily and it's barely communicated to anyone.  They look for every reason they possibly can to put you on a warning.  The attendance policy is BRUTAL - if you call off on January 1, 2017, you get an 'incident' that does not fall off of your record until January 1, 2018.  If you get 5 of these incidents - which are not hard to get, considering that you also get them for being even one minute late - you're put on a warning and there goes your bonus.

And if all of this wasn't enough, employees are treated like sub-human garbage.  Employees are harassed constantly about spending TEN SECONDS in wrap up.  At one point, our RTA was telling people they COULD NOT GO TO THE BATHROOM!  People get sick and are forced to stay because they don't want to lose their jobs.  I've seen people vomiting in trash cans at their desk between calls that have been told they can't leave because of CALL VOLUME!

During the height of the summer, the air conditioning went out 3 or 4 times and employees were forced to work in offices where the temperatures were over 90 degrees.  People were getting sick and having to go home.  

This is one of the most toxic, terrible work environments I've ever been a part of.  We have had close to 30 people just up and quit in the last two months.  Besides maybe three supervisors in the Call Center, no one cares about you, your development or anything but the numbers.  You will be nitpicked, harassed, talked down to and treated like a child.  Do not work here.  You are making a giant, giant mistake."

Avoid this place like the plague! Upper management has an ""good old boys"" feel and the CEO won't hesitate to make a sexist comment in front of employees. Management is unprofessional and will pass off their work to their employees. Management is not held accountable for their actions and will do everything to save their own skin. Qualified, good employees are let go and replaced by employees that do not have the work experience or education fit for the job. Employees that remain try to avoid coming into work at all or are barely surviving. If you have any self-respect, do not work here! I had to ask permission to leave for lunch or go use the bathroom."

1741,,Customer Advocate I,2016-09-18,2.0,Call Advocate,"They're willing to work with you on some aspects like helping you learn how to talk to people. Also, the pay is pretty good and it's fairly easy work when you get the hang of dispatching for service providers. Along with that they give you free food sometimes when it's busy.","Very tedious work and you have to memorize a script for the customers. Yes, that does come with the job, however, they treat this job like you're still in school. To add on to this, you actually get marked down on this when your supervisor hears these service requests. No matter what. Yes, that does mean that even if you get a customer that's already angry/upset/refuses to talk to you, you'll still get marked down. 

They literally grade you on every aspect of the calls you take (which are at random, mind you) and they have you work in a specific uniform. In all honesty, I understand why they want you to dress professionally, but the problem is that you're in a call center; you don't see the customers and you have no one to dress for. 

To add on, supervisors are very up-tight and they don't really have any power over their team. In fact, half the time the supervisors are ""working"" I see them just talking to each other walking to their desks. I know this because I sat right next to my supervisor's cubicle and they were just talking about what's going on in their life while there are over 120 people holding on the phones waiting to speak to someone. 

To top it off, I worked with this company for about 3 years and helped out with management duties when it got busy and never once have they given me an increased pay rate for a job that requires more work (i.e. calling backup providers that don't work with AAA and work on pricing with them since they don't have to abide by any contracted rates). 

Oh and I almost forgot, they'll add mandatory overtime whenever they feel like it because it's busy unless you work 45 hours+ per week. If that wasn't enough, they'll cut your breaks from 15 minutes down to 5 and your lunch from 30 minutes to 15."
1742,,"Great company, Branch Managers make you want to leave.",2016-09-17,1.0,Anonymous Employee,Really great trainers and training provided.,"Company drills vision, mission values of respect and teamwork but when you get into the branch, you receive a cultural shock of no one living those values, especially those in sales positions that compete against each other in the branch such as travel agents, boy, they hate a new travel agent in their branch and go out of their way to not speak with you and discriminate you. Even worst, the branch manager looks to make your life stressful and worst thinks you are dumb or stupid to not notice their clear favoritism towards some employees over others. I will keep the specific examples to myself but the environment in AAA branches is highly political and makes travel agents leave managers, even though they like the company, resulting in high turn-over, and costly hires and training of valuable employees. Career opportunities are plenty but again your manager has to like you in order to get ahead but some managers can make it very difficult to like them. Most TA's work 6 days a week with half Saturday and also compensation is not livable on until one starts earning commission which is a year down the road. Senior management lives in their nice bubble of ignorance and looks at you as the one with wrongful behavior or attitude when you bring light to a problem/issue and has a very diplomatic way of wording and stating the reason why things are the way they are instead of investigating and or believing you or making the company better. They embrace the conservatism and are not ready for 2016 fast-pace change, because the conservatism has brought the company this far... so if it ain't broken, don't fix it. The branch managers are my biggest problem, you go to HR they tell you go to the manager, you go to another manager they tell you to go to your manager - and if your manager pretends and is good in every one else's eyes then you are out of luck - HR pairs with managers and so do other managers so you really don't feel comfortable going anywhere and start looking for other jobs in your training. That is the reality. Week 3 into your job, you face political problems in your branch as you would in year 3-5 with another company. Co-workers that don't talk to you because they cannot stand that you are hired to eat a part of their business from their eyes instead of welcoming you in to be a part of the team."

Not sure if they still do this, but we got to 'work' the Mariner's games and other sporting events. Good benefits and perks. Regular raises based on performance.

Other major drawback is it is a dangerous job.

1831,,Call Center,2016-04-27,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"If you switch departments at some point, and are a decent writer, this can be a decent resume builder for younger workers. 

It's not too hard to request time off, but schedules are done a month in advance, so you have to plan your entire life 30+ days ahead of time. 

It's not a super difficult job, just requires some degree of  attentiveness and attention to detail.
It's something you might be able to fall back on in a pinch, and potentially kind of work that you can leave at work so you can enjoy the rest of your life.","Ultimately this is a customer service position with sales goals, which is terrible. That means you rarely get the satisfaction of actually helping another person, because for the sake of your job, you have to sell people extra products, whether or not those products are relevant to the individual. 

For context, this smaller branch of AAA was in recent years absorbed by AAA of Southern California. Since then, a lot of the work environment has gone swiftly downhill. At this point it's an awful call center job with no advancement opportunities that aren't more awful call center jobs with little extra pay. It's sort of like working at a McDonalds that pays better. 

You will most likely work on Christmas, Thanksgiving, and New Years. 

You will not get more than a 15 cent raise per year, regardless of how well you do or how hard you work. You'd probably start around 11/11.50 per hour. 

Management expects employees to work a ton of overtime, especially in the winter. I'm not sure how to explain how awful it is to work a snowstorm at AAA. There are no breaks in between calls, being screamed at, etc, and they also expect employees to work through their 30 minute lunch breaks. That means 8.5+ hours of being constantly barraged by angry people with only 2 ten minute breaks. Management will expect this of you every time a storm hits. 

Middle and upper management are very cliquey. They chose people they like to promote almost regardless of job performance, and some supervisors are actually useless. To be fair, there are a few fantastic ones, but they are currently working second shift. During the day, supervisors are rarely at their desks. That means if you need help with a problem, there is none. You'll need to figure things out on your own, most likely because your airhead sup is too busy watering the plants or stringing decorative lights to do their job. 

If you progress beyond road service, go to dispatch. You will never get a raise if you go to membership. It's the worst department to work for in the entire building. The supervisor openly ridicules her subordinates, so don't bother with that. It's currently $1 raise to transfer to dispatch, thought, and many people feel it's worth it."

1850,,Probably the worst place to work,2016-04-07,1.0,Customer Service Representative,You get good benefits after 90 days.,"Worked at the Burbank office and when you walk in you will see a banner saying they are always hiring. There is a reason for that, its because people are always leaving. During training you get paid an amount that does not even allow you to live comfortably, they then raise the salary a few cents when you start. I was making $11/hr. You cannot live off of that in LA. 

When you get onto the floor everything changes. The managers will hound you as far as why you are going to the bathroom or taking breaks. Its back to back calls, so you will get burnt out and may need an extra break. You cant do that and they dont care. You will get written up for this. Its a horrible place to work, not worth the money and you should move on if you're looking for new work. 

Not mention they are very conservative, you required to dress up for this call center position where no one sees you.

Quick pace environment in the call center which can become stressful but also never fails to surprise :),Company has been really focused on numbers recently and trying to get rid of people who do not meet their expectations. After working there for some time they will ask or recommend that you do additional duties on top of your regular work but they do not offer you a raise for the extra work you are doing. In addition they do not factor that in when comparing your time to others who are not doing additional duties. Also be sure to move up in the company after 2 years of they will look for reasons to get rid of you by year 3-4 since they can hire another person entry level for less.

This, however, does not apply if you are a relative or friend of someone in management.  It is a very nepotistic organization placing unqualified people in management positions.

There are employees working 6-7 days a week on a 12 hour schedule because they want the OT pay. The benefits are ""okay"", the health coverage is expensive (in my opinion) but other than that the benefits are decent.","They have a thing called ""Mandatory Attendance"" it forbids any use of VTO/PTO or calling off while this is in effect. This has been bad the last year, mandatory attendance has been in place for almost 6 months now. It will lapse for a couple of days every two or so weeks but then it will be renewed for another two weeks.

They also have a LOT of MANDATORY OVERTIME. Regardless of whether or not you already work overtime, you still have to do this. This is 30-90 minutes (90 minutes is REALLY rare, but can happen) added to the end or start of your shift (depending on where they need staff). If you fail to come in you are put on a 90-day warning. This is very, very frequent. When I say frequent I mean it's 3-5/7 days of the week, every week.

This company can NOT keep staff. They are constantly training due to losing people. They will have training classes of 20 people and 4 will make it out, maybe 2 will last longer than 3 months. Training is a 4-6 week process, too. Almost everyone you talk to is new. There are frequent mistakes with call handling and general procedure because they cannot keep tenured associates."

You will have an opportunity to bid for a different shift time based on your performance.","AAA is very inconsistent. The policies and procedures change from day to day and is based upon how much money the company makes. As an employee you have to wait 2 years before you can move into another position. Salary is very subpar based on the amount of work you have to do as a licensed call center agent. Especially since you have to clean up the NUMEROUS MISTAKES of the incompetent AAA Agents, who the company seems to praise. The phone system is HORRIBLE. The new call monitoring process is too subjective. The call center is open on Saturday to take calls from the rudest customers who work Monday-Friday.

2131,,Stay Away! Toxic.,2015-02-22,1.0,General Service Technician,You get a paycheck and hour break.,"I recently graduated from Lincoln College of Technology and had earned six ASE certifications. I am a retired veteran that was in a technical field working on diesel engines for 20 years. Even with that I was hired as a general service technician and paid $12 an hour. Before I started I was told by the manager I would be starting as a C technician at $18 an hour because a guy he was hiring took too long for the HR process. That didn't happen and I was lied to. My training was very limited or non existent and if it wasn't for the fact I went to school or worked at Sears Auto Center I would have been left completely in the dark. My manager consistently made degrading comments to me on a day to day basis. One Saturday morning we had a meeting and he accidentally gave me a coworkers auto count sheet for the previous week and told me to give it back to my coworker. He then said you only wish you were that efficient. The day before I decided to quit he asked me if I was going to make it. One time I did a an inspection a an SUV with 133,000 miles on it that had nothing wrong and he told me why I didn't find anything wrong with a vehicle with that amount of mileage. Well it was in good condition and needed nothing. I was working very long hours as well. My days were mostly 9:30 to 7pm. It was a rare occurance to leave at 7pm. One day I was there til 8pm. The day before I quit I worked 12 hours. They also scheduled me to work seven days straight and I asked if they could break the days because I was tired. They told me nothing. I was left in the dark. One Sunday I worked with two other techs and I had 5 oil changes waiting on my toolbox while doing an oil change with customers waiting. The other techs didn't help. The customers at this company are very impatient but they want all the free stuff that AAA offers but it takes time to complete properly. This was a toxic place to work and I am glad I left. I also had a coworker tell me if I was pissed off because I wasted my time going to school. When I first started I was told by the assistant manager that I would be told when I could take a break. Usually I wouldn't be told until 3pm or I usually had to ask while the rest of the staff went on break hours before."
2132,,Ever changing company environment for the worse,2015-02-21,2.0,Insurance Consultant,"Profit sharing, paid PTO if not used at the end of the year","Long hours, poor morale, culture of micro-managing individuals, compensation plan continual changes and most times in the favor of the company.  Advancement opportunities are slim and most times agents that are good employees can be blackballed by HQ preventing them from advancing.  A number of opportunities are limited to the HQ employees and it is difficult for field/branch agents to promote into desirable positions outside of sales/sales mgmt.  Company is in aggressive growth mode that is alienating tenured agents by bringing numerous new employees with low knowledge of the industry.  Turnover is evident and looks to be growing."

2135,,A Company of Comrades.,2015-02-18,5.0,Insurance Sales Agent,"From day one until my last day I can honestly say I've had a positive experience.  I felt like my dreams were always a group goal. I worked in the call center in Hamilton NJ. I went to AAA with a goal to eventually get into the Insurance department. I went in for a Roadside Assistance RACC position. While in the interview I asked about the insurance department and was told applying for Membership MCC and working sales would be a good route into getting to the Insurance department. So I worked in membership as an occasional and I was promoted to a permanent part time then full time and then given a raise. At the end of the year I applied for and got the Insurance position and got it just like I had been hoping for so much. While in the membership department I found everyone was friendly and genuinely caring. The building was clean and had easily understandable computer systems. For a call center the desks were more spaced out then expected. The membership department and Insurance Department had about the same size desk except in the insurance department the cabinets caused the cubicle walls to be high up so it was difficult to socialize. Not to say that was a bad thing though because sometimes you really needed that to concentrate. The insurance department was the first time that I ever felt stressed working for AAA. However, the Insurance department definitely paid me well enough to compensate for the additional stress. I loved every person I worked with and for the most part I can honestly say I was treated fairly the entire time I worked there. This is a very organized and systematic company and I was not. Having ADD I would tend to be distracted allot and my supervisors all worked with me to make sure there was always a system for me to succeed and it was not difficult to succeed there you just need to keep applying for and asking about promotions and take advice from your management when it comes to your plan to reach your goals there. I would still be working for them if I hadn't moved. 

PS: they have a Lyncs program which lets you IM anyone in the company and it's pretty cool.",It may be a call center job but if you are doing RACC or MCC (Roadside Assistance or Membership) then it can also be dangerous. I had some snow storms I had to drive in for that I ended up stuck in a ditch. I still got compensated a bit extra in my paycheck for driving in hazardous conditions but I still would have rather not. Also during holidays it is hard to get approved for PTO. There are strict adherence policies for break and aux times so you are going to be sitting in one place allot. Day shift was much more fast paced and sometimes a bit overwhelming during certain times but there was more opportunity to make sales on each call. Night shift was layed back because there were less calls but you will find yourself using PTO to leave early when things get slow. They will never make you use your PTO but if there is no one sitting next to you it will get boring enough that you will want to take them up on it. The Gym is nice but small and costs like $8 or $9 a month . If your Gym badge randomly stops working it takes nearly two weeks for it to get fixed and you still get charged for that time.

If you have the right manager, your workday is primarily based on the system that you create to make your day go smoothly. Most of the manager's are open and available, ""I'm here if you need me"", instead of constantly looking over your shoulder. All but one. The company gives a lot of free-bee's from vendors and company engagements. It is pretty much, work at your pace, which if you do not want to get behind (in claims), better not be a slow pace, you handled a lot of different cases all at once and there is minimal time for leisure. The pay isn't bad at all, especially for someone new/out of college, looking for entry-level, or a single parent looking for stability, etc. I really think the compensation is what keeps you there. I liked the involvement of the upper management as far as making you feel apart of a team or organization and actually noticing and acknowledging the effort that you put forth.","Initially, coming from training, your told that you will be slowly introduced into the claims process, which turned out not to be the case. After training, it went from 12 cases at time to 30, to 60, to 70 cases within a month or so. Therefore, a lot of the cases were being worked by trial and error because you are not allotted sufficient time to work or build upon the minimal training that you received. Work-life balance, initially we were told no weekends, then it went from 1 weekend every 5-6 weeks, to 1 weekend every 4 weeks, which also mean added expenses to those with children having to find additional daycare."

- The grading scale for CSR evaluation is somewhat unfair. One mistake in certain categories can result in 20 percent or more being deducted from your score. This, added to the performance goal of 92 percent, perceivably reduces your margin of error to zero.

2176,,Management and corporate does NOT care about employees,2014-11-30,1.0,Emergency Roadside Representative,Don't think I can think of any,"I worked for Triple A East Central for about a week! Let me tell you one of the FIRST THINGS that was said was that it was a definite no no to post negative things about them on social media! WELL since I was treated with such disrespect, I think I am going to go ahead and ignore that little warning.

I applied for a position and interviewed and unfortunately shortly after began experiencing health problems which were getting increasingly worse which myself and my doctor believed to be gallbladder related. While going for tests and apts I was called to start my position on Nov. 11. On my first day I let them know what I was going through and despite my pain I came in every day trying to learn the vast amount of things they teach you to be a roadside assistant call taker. This calls for about 6 weeks of training, including classroom and on the job training, I was assured I was doing quite well despite my discomfort.

On friday I had a presched doctor apt regarding my situation, and she sent me for an ultrasound based on my symptoms. Instead of taking the entire day off, because I was asked too, I came in directly after and worked half a day after being poked and prodded. Upon returning on Monday I had gotten worse but I came in. Half way through the day I had become fevered and pale and the person training me expressed concerned about my well being. I left and went to the emergency room and blood was taken as well as urinalysis and I was diagnosed that night with at minimum pancreatitus. I was referred to a gastrointestinal doctor but this doctor was overbooked and was going to TRY to get me in ASAP. 

The following day (Tues) I was given a doc excuse from er to give me time to make arrangements with my family doc to sched more blood work and a HIDA scan. I kept in contact with Triple A the entire time. Wed I went in for a HIDA scan to check the function of my gallbladder. It was this day that I received a voice mail  (which I still have), to hang in there, and everything was going to be ok, to focus on taking care of my health, because I had expressed concern about my job. I knew I had just started, but I was doing my best to get to the bottom of the issue quickly and put it behind me so I could move forward with my training and this would no longer be an issue. That evening I contacted Triple A by phone. I was assured that they had actually called the main office in Pittsburgh and spoke to one of the bosses at corporate headquarters, who's husband had went through the same thing, so they understood. (Mind you, they were to hire THREE people yet I was the only one that had passed the testing so I was training alone) At one point they even offered for me to take off until my illness was resolved and come back in for training when the other two were hired and I said that was fine, BUT they pulled that offer back and wanted me to come back that week. I got a call wed night for the gastro doctor who had a cancellation for Thursday and I could not pass that up because he was booked up for months! I called in and let my trainer know.

I went in to see him, after my exam, he raised my ulcer meds, gastro pain medication and found that the er had found I had a pretty severe bladder infection that could have been causing the majority of my pain that somehow had not been diagnosed and treated that night at the ER. So I was put  on antibiotics and given an excuse to stay off on Friday to give me the weekend to stabilize and get my infection and pain under control and gave me a work release for Monday with some further testing (endoscope and CT scan for later dates just to be sure everything was ok that would be sched on my days off) I was finally to the bottom of my issues and seeing the light at the end of the tunnel and was relieved that the worst was over and I would be able to would be able to move forward.

That evening I got a call letting me know they were going to terminate me. SERIOUSLY! I was told I could reapply when I was well if I wanted to. WHAT? I just expressed that I had been given a RELEASE back to work for MONDAY! AND the three openings ARE STILL POSTED. I was advised to call the HR dept in PA and plead my case. I did, but I wasn't expecting anything to change, but I did want them to know I was told things were going to be fine and lead to believe everything would be ok and they understood my situation, just to get sucker punched when I got everything ironed out.

NOW don't get me wrong. I understand it wasn't their fault they hired me ill, no more than it was mine, but they could have opted out of bringing me in from the get go, or not promised me that all was well and they would work with me UNTIL the very moment I was released to come back to work to give me the ax.

IT GETS BETTER. Triple A pays two different ways, via direct deposit, or a pay card. I opted for the direct deposit. I received my pay the Friday after Thanksgiving, then received a paper check on Saturday. I knew this was an error. BUT since I had opted in for the direct deposit, I had every intention to call and speak to a human on Monday and return the paper check, as I also had some questions regarding the fact that neither pay had any info regarding hours or deductions and I would need that information to make sure I was properly compensated for the time I did put in. LOW and BEHOLD Sunday AFTER I had payed some bills with the deposit that was made, Triple A felt it necessary to RESEND the pay they direct deposited into my account WITHOUT NOTICE OR AUTHORIZATION making a huge mess of my bank account!

I signed up for the direct deposit, I gave them my information, signed all the paperwork, HOWEVER I did NOT give them permission to take money OUT OF MY BANK ACCOUNT! I think they just might have broken a law there! 
I did NOT cash the paper check that was sent to me USPS. That was not what I signed up for!

This is definitely a company who has become more concerned about the almighty dollar than the well being of their employees or their customers.

In addition while sitting with employees was informed by just about every one I sat with regarding the massive amount of backbiting and drama that goes on in the ranks, warned to just keep my head down and work. That sometimes the computers glitch out and wont allow you to clock back in in time and you will get written up for being a minute late logging in regardless if it is an equipment issue. I don't think I met anyone there that was genuinely happy. Despite having retail and customer service experience my starting wage was $9.50. I was told that standard is $9.00 SO unless you are looking for a job where people get along, are happy with pay that matches what you will experience including Mandatory Overtime, and holidays, no weekends off, management that could care less if your gallbladder could explode at any moment, they just want you to come in to work, and a company that feels they have the right to withdraw funds from your bank account without notice or authorization due to their own clerical error,  I suggest you keep searching."

The salaries paid to the support staff are extremely low, especially for the amount of work support staff takes on. The AOB building in Dearborn is itself ancient, with elevators that break down regularly and no easy access to an alternative method of going upstairs (I feel badly for those in wheelchairs/scooters or with foot/leg issues). This company is a classic example of the right hand not knowing what the left hand is doing. Interdepartmental communications are convoluted and sparse. And, there are those in upper management who do not respect their employees nor their employees' right to a life outside of work. And, the lack of refrigerators for employees to bring in their own lunches from home is atrocious. Yes, there are a lot of employees. But, if there were one refrigerator per department (actually placed in that department), it would be incredibly helpful.

Just laid off in April with 128 other people.  Taking road service calls. 5 page script - if you miss one item you fail the call. You are recorded. You are micromanaged to death. You cannot make any suggestions or comments. If you try to go any higher than your supervisor you are written up. There's no advancement.  Also calltakers were melding into dispatchers over the past few months. Drivers have quit because they no long pay them for gone on arrival calls. I think drivers have quit or been let go because the wait times have escalated. Used to be within 45 mins - now wait time in most places 1-2 hours. So called ""priority"" calls (like on the interstate) are no longer a priorty tho they tell you that. Recently had to experience that first hand when broke down in Lakeland (live in Pinellas a 40 min drive).  Broke down on interstate. 5 people - two elderly two diabetics. What water we had we put in car. It was rainy, getting dark, no bathroom, no food, no water. Called AAA - said it would be priority. Called an hour later to inquire where driver was and they said were having a hard time finding a driver that wanted to drive to Pinellas. Friend came and picked up the 3 ladies and the men stayed with the car. Ladies waited til driver called at 9:50 saying he would be there soon so we left. They said driver showed up at 10:10 - 3 hours after we called. (we stopped quick to go to use a restroom at a gas station) We got to our street and the tow truck was there. The guys said he drove 80 miles an hour the entire way. I wouldn't recommend anyone working here even if it was the only thing available. The stress is simply not worth it. The money is crap for what you have to go through and do. You have no say - it's just do your job and shut up. I see AAA going downhill- no one needs maps anymore with GPS and everyone can do their own travel arrangements online. Auto Vantage has a much better deal for less price and you get more (150 miles towing, home/car lockout and when you call them they can find you immediately - a technology AAA only has for 2 phone services.) Can't tell you how many calls I took where the member had no clue where they were at and expected us to find them!"

These credits are good for one time each up to three days in a row.

Due to risk of termination, coworkers will come in to work when they are ill instead of calling in, risking the health of other coworkers (desks are partially separated by walls that are roughly 3 feet tall).

Company has been around for approximately 100 years and they have extensive knowledge about how busy it gets in the winter and summer, yet they continue to hire employees only twice a year even with a high turnover rate (I believe it was 72% last I checked) and when we can take upwards of over a million calls in a year.

They reduce and/or remove lunches and breaks during busy times and when asked if they felt it was moral to do such a thing (asked due to having a required class on morality in the workplace) they answered with, “Moral or not, it’s legal”

While there is no set script, there is a list of over a dozen things we are required to say in order to “certify” calls, if a certain number of calls do not “certify” within the month we can be reprimanded and/or eventually terminated due to failure of certification.

As well as the certification of calls, we are required to have a certain percentage of “total customer satisfaction” they use a third party to send surveys through e-mail.  It is an all or none system, if the customer is not completely 100% satisfied; if they are even 99% satisfied it is considered a failure and can again be reprimanded up to termination.

Even though they are a 24 hour business, AAA hires part-time temporary positions and you can work up to being a full-time permanent employee.  It was not disclosed but I assume the reasoning behind that is to avoid paying for benefits and not have to pay holiday pay either.

They have regional managers, district managers, department managers, and supervisors, as well as a QA department, all in one office.  The only other company that I have worked for that micromanages at that level is Wal-Mart.

Due to the fact we handle personal information (addresses, credit card information) there are strict rules in place to not have your cell phone or any recording device out, as well as not leaving with papers, etc…  It is not enforced in the slightest and I have seen coworkers on their cell phone while speaking with a member."

- Refusal to offer full time to long-term employees who are forced to offer full-time availability (i.e. ability to be scheduled during any open office hour) without the benefit of seeing 40 hours on a paycheck, health benefits, sick time, proper vacation, etc.
- The company has their hand in too many aspects of service (road service, travel routing, travel agency, insurance, bail bonds, Visa cards, extended warranties, prescription plans, cell phone services, to name just a few), most of which are not handled whatsoever by the local branch offices or even the local corporate offices, but rather by some 866-number that leads to nobody knows where.  It is impossible to provide a coherent answer when a member comes in to ask about them because we are given no further information about the services to educate ourselves and in turn our members.
- Directly related to the point above is that there is absolutely zero training in place for any position beyond Auto Travel Counseling.  No manual outlining membership benefits and allowances besides the ones we give to clients themselves, no manual regarding use of the internal database, no nothing.  Even if you do call the local corporate office to secure an answer about a question for a client, you probably won't be told the same thing twice so writing it down yourself does not matter.  There is no ""above and beyond"" from local.  You're lucky if they'll reach beyond their keyboard and headset to help you (and subsequently the client).
- I cannot even begin to describe the lack of updated, functional technology throughout the company.  I want to, but I cannot even.
- Good luck counting more than a handful of clientele that come in a daily basis who are under the age of 65 (and all that this entails).  It's a good time trying to teach the Internet to someone over the phone or getting talked to like you're an idiot because you took the time to clarify the client's garbled request.  You really do begin to feel as though you should have been certified to work in geriatric social work.  
- Actual services provided have gone downhill or been eliminated and guess who gets to listen to the customer feedback?  The office worker!
- Much of the communication from local corporate is poorly written and nonsensical.  You can generally expect some sort of correction or retraction within five minutes of receiving an email regarding something someone did/wrote wrong in their first one.
- Absolutely zero heart, soul, or spirit in any corporate communication.  They're dead inside and hope that you become so as well."

Because of this, employees are forced to rely on incorrect information which often leads to mistakes being made. Management has been told about this many, many times and refuses to update any old information, for reasons unknown. Communication between the call centers is almost non-existent even though everyone is constantly forced to work on the same issues. There is zero accountability for our contracted road service providers, and at the same time, 100% accountability for the phone operators. I won't even get started on the way the salaried management speaks to the hourly workers. Needless to say, we are treated like ants who are monitored to make sure we try and sell as much product as possible."

2355,,Overworked and Underpaid; Culture/Policies Breed Mediocrity,2012-07-30,3.0,,"This AAA conglomerate of several clubs under the ACG name has its headquarters in Dearborn, MI with a variety of corporate depts, positions, and experiences, yet is small enough to be a manageable company to run.  If you like the corporate world but don't want to be completely lost in a sea of thousands of employees in a massive corporation, this is a good middle ground.

Most employees are good folks, intelligent, and tend to become like extended family over time.  Benefits are decent.  Vacation time allotment appears to be above-average (that's one major way they get people to stay--""where am I going to go and get 6 wks vacation time?"")  Pay can be reasonable but depends on how you play your cards when you join the company.  Once you're in, pay policies are rigid and you have to leave the company to make financial traction in your career (promotions do not equate to meaningful increases in pay.)","Morale is extremely poor and has worsened over the years since the last CEO came on board.  Old-timers will all say it used to be a fun, family company but it's not like that anymore.  There is little incentive to be a high performer because working your tail off for that ""exceeds expectations"" rating is only going to get you 1% more in terms of an annual raise (when they're giving them out) than the waste of space in the next cubicle who surfs the net and does personal business all day long.

There is a palpable negative energy in the work environment and it's become an ""every man for himself"" culture.  Very political esp. in higher ranks and survival depends on how well the game is played, not on how well the job is executed.  Middle-mgmt is not willing to go too far out on a limb for subordinates because they're always worried first about their own jobs (Massive JE's have occurred on an almost biannual basis since CEO arrived.)  Over the span of a dozen years since the CEO took over, there was this sense that dark clouds were moving in and they just settled over the company.  The CEO in one decade has changed his executive leadership team so many times, you can't keep it straight.  There appears to be no strategy or well-thought out plan.  It just changes with the wind.  (Thank goodness the CEO provided copies of ""Who Moved My Cheese"" to all management to prepare everyone for all these changes.)

HR Sr. VP was quoted in a town hall meeting as saying (in response to negative comments about pay/benefits issues): ""If you don't like it here, you can find another job elsewhere.""  It's easy to say that when the unemployment rate is high but what happens when it turns around and then your most talented people hightail it out of there for being undervalued and treated as dispensable?

Finally, ACG is OLD school, run by old (typically white) men.  Things like work/life balance, telecommuting, and flexible work schedules are virtually non-existent.  More progressive, forward-thinking companies recognize the numerous benefits of offering these programs: employee satisfaction, decreased real-estate expenses, increased productivity and employee loyalty.  Even our country's leaders have put legislation into place that encourages this because it just makes good sense (...""if all U.S. white-collar workers teleworked only two days a week, the country would conserve over 233 million gallons of fuel each week..."").  ACG is always 10 steps (or more) behind everyone else with policies, products, innovation, and just basic business practices."
