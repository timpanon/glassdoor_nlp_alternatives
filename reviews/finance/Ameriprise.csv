Pay is not adequate. Received $1k raise beginning of 2021 even though they go on and on about how well the business is doing. 

Benefits are mediocre for a large company like this. 

Micromanaging forced from the top. Tracking time in office of their best employees even though they are salary.

105,,Great Place to work,2022-01-27,5.0,Director,"People and culture are outstanding, Benefits are phenomenal.",Base Pay could be a little better
106,,Leadership doesn't listen,2022-01-27,2.0,Corporate Employee,"There's some flexibility, depending on the job itself.","Corporate leadership is not transparent and it feels there is a hidden agenda. There appears to not be an actual strategy as it's never been communicated. Leaders have lied to their teams, doing a complete 180, and then behaving as though it's not a big deal. 

Everything I'm seeing tells me leadership has an old world mentality. I see nothing that indicates they actually support ""innovation"" though they throw this word around a ton.

Pay is low if you've been with the company forever (as-is the situation with most companies), and they are incredibly resistant to review and adjust. The ""equity adjustment"" they claim can be done once a year is far below what would actually bring someone to where they need to be. 

Promotions happen subjectively and there's no hiding the discriminatory behavior. They just don't care, even when the entire team communicates their concerns in fairly strong terms. And yes, even up to the VP level - they just ignore everyone and act as though nothing needs to be addressed. There is no consideration for one's skills or contributions. 

They also lie, stating that a role can't be created without significant time needed to work with HR to ensure they create a job description, but then turn around and promote someone into a role that doesn't exist. And when asked about it, they pretend that it's not a big deal, nor provide further direction explaining how to achieve a promotion.

The corporate value of ""integrity always"" feels like empty words to many employees because leadership actions don't always reflect this.

The company has also battled tooth and nail against allowing employees to work remotely. Leadership is insanely resistant to change. Even at a meeting with executives, they misappropriated pictures of employees by using them in a ""return to office"" montage, showing these people in the office. It was implied these people endorsed coming back to the office - completely wrong. These people weren't told the pictures would be used in this way. Very shady which is aligned with a lot of what I've seen in leadership over the last couple of years.

The problem I'm seeing here is that all companies seem to keep the bar low so they can act like they're great when they are slightly better than most other companies. They need to hold themselves to a much better standard."

Cheerful Colleagues.","Quality of work not very helpful to grow and establish career in tech.

No work life balance due to odd shift timings.
Few senior members in the team expect flattery in order to even be considered an active team member. 

Onshore heads  persecute and force you to work on things (BPO kind of voice process work and excel) that are not necessary and trivial even at the cost of your time, experience and career. They  create work pressure for such things and won't assign projects as they prioritize this over what you have been actually hired for and the skills you have , thereby denying you  to learn and grow in the role that you desired to work on while getting hired.

Slow growth.  

Worked there for almost a year and was not even assigned  a project, wasted all my time in call support which took me no where, while I was supposed to work in development, left at the right time before becoming irrelevant to the tech industry.

Always reassure your work and responsibilities if joining AWM Tech team, never stay even for a month if you are not given the work that you are supposed to get as they will never care to even consider to make things better even if you spend years together there.

The above comments were for some particular projects  handled by some highly ignorant  people of AWM Tech India team,  but I suppose other teams and they company is much better than this."

197,,Some Cons Some Pros,2021-11-12,3.0,Senior Business Analyst,"- There is a proper process to do each and every thing. In case you stuck at a point then there is proper hierarchy to help you out.
- When you join the company, then they make you fully comfortable and help on each and every step.
- Best part about working here in Analytics department is US Business partners, they explain the work in detailed manner and set the realistic expectations
- This company takes there ratings seriously and whatever we right in our appraisal forms is evaluated and validated properly
- Good learning opportunities 
- Analytics and Technology are treated as elite here
- Resolving any tech issues or hr issues. Turn around time is very low","- Long Term deferred bonus is biggest deception, this bonus is only beneficial if you are retiring from this company only, as full benefit of this bonus can be redeemed from 3rd year onwards. So basically we get very low bonus in first year and then below average bonus in 2nd year and decent (not so high) on completing 3rd year in the firm. The bonus that we are going to get from third year on a default rating is similar to the bonus that we get first year onwards in many firms
- Micro management had increased a lot during lockdown, earlier it was good, now there is tracker for each and every thing
- There are lots of engagement activities and sometimes they push us to attend or participate in those, even if we have no capacity 
- Getting good rating in the organization, you have to participate/organize engagement activities, sometimes this also plays important role in getting promotions timely
- Promotions are not easy here, you have to do lot to get promoted apart from work, if you really want the promotion, then you have to say yes to every kind of work, either maintaining the excel tracker or organizing meetings, organizing events , participating in the events, being funny in the meetings, doing laundry work for your supervisor.
- No goodies on festivals, you can get that by participating in the activities
- As normal shift timing is from 2pm to 10:30pm, you will be super busy after 7 pm
- Punch In Punch out system of 8 hour while in the office, finger print basis.

- Taking leave is a long process in some projects: 
Six step process to take leave:
1) Take alignment from US business partners
2) Inform India leaders about leave, get a green light from them, if it is okay to take the leave or not according to team capacity
3) Drop a calendar invite to all
4) Apply leaves on the portal
5) Get approval on planned time off
6) Update the excel tracker"

A company whose business is to manage people's lifesavings tried to cheat their own employees on their life savings to marginally pad the pockets of the executive leadership team. They constantly look for ways to nickel and dime their employees so they can marginally increase executive compensation. 

Management at all levels boast that they pay less than all of their competitors. If you ask to be paid even close to what Ameriprise themselves say is the competitive pay for your position, they will not only decline, but will ridicule you for asking. The CEO was named the most overpaid CEO in the world by Business Journal, and had his compensation voted down by shareholders in non-binding votes. When Ameriprise received the largest corporate tax cut in US history, they froze their employee pension plan, added a surcharge to the health insurance plan for employees' family members, and then instituted $10 billion in share buybacks to enrich the executive leadership team. 

All of my accomplishments were kept secret from upper management. Upper management is completely unaware of the risks associated with certain lines of business and which employees are mitigating those risks. Lower management will not share that an employee saved the company from multiple billion dollar disasters because it would make them look bad that there is even that risk, which results in that employee never being rewarded or recognized for extraordinary company-saving accomplishments. Middle-management is lazy, and in many cases, completely useless. Most are Ameriprise lifers who have no idea how typical businesses are managed. Some managers don't have the basic knowledge of what their employees do to be able to give relevant performance reviews. Regardless of performance, talent, or skills, it's easy to get stuck in a job that Ameriprise will want to keep you trapped in the rest of your life.

Even on my way out, the company tried to short me on my accrued vacation payout, thinking I wouldn't notice."

Even though the headquarters employees are all based in Minneapolis. The CEO is out of touch with the rank and file employees. Compensation for positions is often lower than industry standards. The culture is fake, gossipy and is based on clicks. Because of rule by clicks, gossip and the NY leadership’s belief all employees work on a sales desk like Wolf of Wall Street, leadership resists WFH hybrids. Leadership seems to have an aphasia on how to actually show employee appreciation or provide positive reinforcement.

Nothing else is Pro here.","Ameriprise is one of the most slow moving company in twin cities. Frequent red tapes, process paralysis, slows down any attempted progress and technological enhancements. Senior leadership is most interested to keep the lights on, any architectural advancement is either shot down by other “high priority” items (read cost savings), or uncooperative delivery teams. Since architecture team depends on delivery team most, to keep the ball rolling, 99% of the time architecture teams don’t have any impact due to uncooperative, stubborn nature of delivery teams.

Then comes the politics. Ameriprise runs on chain of buttering of immediate leaders, instead of taking right decisions, junior leaders are most interested in making their superior happy. Unless the superior had directed, nothing (and I mean absolutely nothing) is heard from a junior employee. Here people don’t have respect for anyone who has more technical knowledge, rather people are busy in office politics. Mid level leaders don’t have any decency or respect for junior employees, they are often treated as second grade citizen. You will prosper, if you can play good politics, don’t need any technical knowledge. Junior employees are not recognized for their good work, or motivate them.

I don’t even want to mention the below par compensation, compared to other companies in twin cities. The environment in Ameriprise is so toxic and cut throat, only in few months, you will lose your appetite to enjoy your work and only be frustrated, unmotivated with the politics around you."

The benefits were decent, but year after year they were eroding away.","I could write pages about this place, but my headline says it all. Politics, nepotism, mediocrity and incompetence are self-explanatory. 

I have never worked at a place that tolerates and even serves the lowest common denominator on a team. Ameriprise brags about tenure, but that is nothing to be proud of when you employ staff that haven't learned anything new since the 90's. Middle management is full of people who have no clue what being a leader is, nor do they have a clue how to their job, their employees job, let alone innovate anything. Many of the managers I had to deal with seemed to be intimidated by those perceived to be below them if they had ideas and skillsets that far surpassed theirs. 

Other issues:

Salary was not comparable to the market
Pay raises were either non-existent or mediocre
No real training opportunities

394,,Perception more important than performance. Good company if you have no dreams and want to settle.,2021-04-28,3.0,Data Analyst,Analytics team. Great company if you want to settle. Peaceful. Great work life balance. No doubt. Generally the people are good.,"BEWARE OF THE LTDP (Long term deferred Bonus). It's a trick used at Ameriprise. Make sure you check what monthly income you will be getting. This LTDB is paid one-third every year. Whenever you leave, there will be a huge component you wont get. PEOPLE HAVE ALWASY BEEN DISSATISFIED AFTER JOINING THE COMPANY CZ THEY DIDN'T UNDERSTAND LTDB. BE cautious. My manager didn't believe in women, and made a perception which no way could be changed.
Apart from work life balance and transportation benefits, the company pays very low importance to employee satisfaction. The entire leadership is cheap, they wont let money out easily. They'll not spend on you easily, and whatever they'll do, they'll mention again and again in townhall. Half of you day would go in meetings (which might be marked optional but will be mandatory).
Data Science Analytics works on some pillars like statistics and visualisation tools. If stats is your thing, forget you'll be recognised at all, whatever impact you make, or whatever hard work you do. If you don't do anything, just make a visualisation tool and you'll be appreciated. Meaning, if your business partners wont let you do flashy stuff ( generally they wont), forget being thanked for your job even. Salary increment wont be good unless you resign. Ratings will be decided by just one person who leads Analytics, although he mostly doesn't know what is being done in the projects. Its all how well you look to him.
So, if you want to settle and can buttter up, go ahead. Learning would be almost flat."

407,,Work Life Balance is all Work no Life,2021-04-16,1.0,Internal Audit Manager,"Ameriprise is a good firm, and most groups treat their employees with respect and dignity (not RCS).","All Work - No Life Approach - Internal Audit (aka RCS / Risk Control Services) prides itself as an old fashion management style. You are lucky to have a job and there is no room for hurt feelings or people that don’t “want to work”. They are looking for “big 4 types”; people that “want to work” and will happily work long days and weekends (not to get ahead but to run with the pack, as everyone is required to put in long hours). If you want to work as if you are on the partner track, without any track or any example of anyone that advanced by following the program, this is the job for you. 
You are scheduled to work 42 hours a week, and if you need to get caught up or want to get ahead, you will do it after you have worked the scheduled 42 hours. Take a 2 week vacation and you will have to make up the 4 hours you missed when you return. The 42 hours is not usually an issue because most people are working well over 50 hours per week year-round (more during busy season). While there is paid sick time, if you are sick Wednesday, plan to work all day Saturday and Sunday to keep up on the time you missed while sick and the normal weekend time you would have to had to have worked. The audit plan is ridiculously aggressive. When assigned an audit, it is generally half the time you would reasonably assume it would take to complete. Through the planning process you can negotiate more time, but best-case scenario is generally 70% of what would be reasonable. You are left with a catch 22. You either report your hours that go over budget and “explain in detail why” or you underreport your hours and appear successful. 
If you have professional certifications plan on taking a lot of free CPE as the budget for paid CPE is small and spend is highly correlated to the people that charge the most hours to audits. 
Expect to get regular emails asking you why you charged 11 hours to do a task they believe should have taken 7. You will get these 6 weeks after you enter the time and be expected to provide details on why you took longer than the “expectation”. 
Three years is about the max you will see in tenure for people that are assigned audits (there are admins and special projects team members that have somewhat better success). There is no plan for career progression, no expects you will last more than a few years and you are treated like a contractor."

This company is a perfect example of what not to do in a company. You will not find more dysfunction and internal fighting/politics anywhere else. The only reason this company hasn't crashed is because they keep buying Advisors (EARs) and their book of business (BOB) and they pay more for them any other company. They have just as much money flowing out of the company (not just from current clients in outflows) as they are paying to bring in new clients. They have no retention program in place. They philosophy is that it's up to the Advisor, not the company. Whereas in the case of if you're trying to switch phone or cable providers they'll do almost anything in their power to keep you and throw all kinds of incentives at you to stay, this company simply helps you move your assets out the door. Not a great strategy in my opinion. The CFO, Walter, is a nutjob and you never know who you're going to get on any given day (depending on if he takes his meds or not). Unfortunately, he has no life or purpose outside of the company so he won't retire. He revels in creating chaos and internal drama/fighting. About 95% of the work I did was a pointless exercise and always a fire drill because some E-level Exec wanted to make a point so I had to make the numbers look however which way they wanted (lots of integrity in this place). It was not unusual for them to fire employees who had been loyal to the company their entire professional careers and replace them with someone younger and cheaper (even if it does end up costing more due to severance packages). They would constantly do cost-cutting exercises and outsource jobs to India (then move them back a few years later after it fails), but fail to invest in basic technology. For example, all of the financial reports were all created in Excel by combining a bunch of excel spreadsheets by someone in India who downloads the data from HFM, which would take days to do and obviously tons of room for human errors. Most companies would have these reports uploading to an online dashboard to have them available at a click of a button. Not here. They'd rather pay an employee $16K in India to do the report rather than invest in technology that could automate everything. I had worked in Finance for 10+ years at other companies and industries and couldn't believe how I had gone back in time when I joined this company. I seriously think I was getting dumber by staying there. My biggest dose of reality of this company culture was when I was doing a cost benefit analysis of a certain initiative. When I showed the results, my Leader (who is one position below the CFO), informed me the numbers weren't good enough to get approved and that I would have to go back and reconfigure them. In other words, throw out logic and just make the numbers support whatever this Management wanted to do. In its current trajectory, this company will be a fraction of what it is today in 10 years due to client outflows unless they merge with a different firm. They are only focused on the stock price (their bonuses) and not on their clients or employees, which is completely contradictory to the entire point of the industry - help people manage and increase their wealth."

Some advisors are demeaning and treat you like garbage, and then they turn around and come to you for advice because they have zero knowledge of anything outside of the starting point funds list; sometimes I wonder how they can give advice to their clients if they've never even looked at a chart or know anything about basic statistics. Favoritism and office politics rule; the guys walking around the office talking to their buddies and sneaking out early somehow get more praise than the guys at their desk working hard all day and doing their job. Made me sick to my stomach with how greed drives this place. Oh, and this company outsources most of the planning to India, so it seems misleading to the clients that think you're hard at work trying to customize their financial plan when in reality it's all being sent overseas and in return getting a prepackaged plan with a couple paragraphs switched around and their names inserted into it."

They say they are all about employee development yet do not follow up by letting employees do what they need to in order to further their development.

922,,Ameriprise Advisor Center (AAC) - Good luck!,2019-04-26,1.0,Client Relationship Manager,"Pay for licensing
5% 401k match (5 years until 100% vested)
9 managers in 6.5 years, majority of them were good people!
Benefits bench marked to be average / slightly below avg, but at least it's something!","Before you begin working in the Ameriprise Advisor Center (AAC), you have to ask yourself if you're comfortable working for a large and shrinking organization.
Over past 6.5yrs the number of people with ""VP"" in title has increased from 1 to 4. Number of ""Directors"" increased from 3 to 4. Number of financial advisors decreased from 350 down to around 50 today. Its approximately a 90% five year turnover rate. If you thrive under micro management, you'll do well here. 

Short term thinking is rampant. Decisions from VPs and Directors seem to be made with one of two things in mind: 1. This quarters bonus. 2. Getting quick results to pad their resume.

The AAC works primarily with C and D type clients that get turned in from the field practices. 95-98% of the time it's because: they are poor, they are old, all the money just got locked up in a REIT or annuity, they are difficult personalities to work with, they have a dying life insurance policy, or because they are already in the process of money assets away. So as an advisor in the AAC you operate on volume. Your job is to get blood from a stone. 8-15 appointments per day. 

AAC is unlike most financial service firms, in that they appear to be allergic to recurring revenue. Reality is that sales incentives over the past 5 yrs has lead to this.  Many advisors play 'hot patato' with the best clients (best in terms of revenue and NPS scores), this is because sales incentives only reward transaction business, not recurring revenue like financial plans or fee based asset management. So if all the money has been rolled over, they've already bought a plan and implemented, do your best to get that client OFF your calendar and onto some other person or you're not going have a good experience when it's bonus time.  

The AAC has never been more profitable, though you wouldn't know it talking to advisors since 95% of them see their income decrease around year three. This is because so much more of your time is spent working with clients you don't get any credit for helping. 

They enjoy a touch of nepotism. 2 out of the last 3 manager promotions went to people who are related to someone higher up in the department.  

Training has changed considerably over my time with the AAC. They used to train you to be an advisor in order to make recommendations to clients. Now they train you on how to read a script (aka call guide), and train you how to set an appointment for a specialist (who makes the actual recommendation on important decisions). 

Goals are set with no basis in reality. If your team loses half the advisors and support staff,\ they will tell you that you should feel lucky your targets are only going up 6% and not 15% the other teams. You can also count on annual changes to compensation, beginning every January. 

While they play plenty lip service to things improving and about caring about people, their actions have never supported this idea. You can no longer transfer the book you build to the field. Going to the field means starting all over. 

Worklife balance depends on your tenure. If you are their at 6:05 pm, you will likely just see tenured advisors trying to keep up with all their admin tasks. 45-55hrs per week is common, salaried of course. 
 
Culture in the AAC - most everyone that has been their longer than a year is jaded and cynical. At this point, you can only joke and laugh about how messed up things are. 

DO NOT FILL OUT THEIR EMPLOYEE SATISFACTION SURVEYS - the teams are small enough and they ask enough identifiable questions that they know who is who. They will try and coach you to take it and do the ""n/a"" for every question, so it doesn't hurt them and still they get their kudos for participation. If you take it and you answer truthfully, it will work against you.

Ameriprise is an okay company. Very conservative, they will never be innovators. Jimmy C as CEO is okay I guess,  but probably not worth 26mil per year."

Unfortunately, you won't realize how toxic it is until you get out and see what normal looks like. A boys-club mentality among VP's, SVP's & CIO with most having the emotional intelligence (EQ) of a wild goats. I've witnessed temper-tantrums, screaming, calling people out in meetings, finger pointing and demeaning behavior in public in my years there. The last 7 years more so than my experience before. Some VP's believe that to get ahead (in what is a  culture of VP's competing with each other) you have to do unethical things so much that it's become the norm. Most don't even realize they are doing it anymore.

New employees literally are told they are not making the company any money, so they should be grateful while they are still there. Harsh words. New group forced to use each other for support and for help learning software systems from each other post-licensing.

1356,,Solid Corporate Employer,2016-12-08,5.0,Paralegal,"Salary is very competitive in career filed as well as in a larger city like Minneapolis. Ameriprise offers one of the best retirement benefits in place. They offer a 5% match of 401(k)/Roth IRA AND they offer a separate employer PAID RETIREMENT account--after one year of full-time employment they start making payments from 2-20% into that account, this is in addition to the 5% matching program. So if you're younger and make it to working 20 years with the company you'll have 25% of your income being contributed to your retirement BEFORE adding 5 or more percent. This is a pretty big deal. So if you're a long-term planner consider retiring from Ameriprise. Ameriprise also offers basic-free financial planning to all their employees. Ameriprise's medical benefits are decent, nothing worse or crazy better than the competition. I pay about 60 bucks a pay period for a PPO with a deductible of about 1500 that then pays 80/20. Prescription drug benefits are through ExpressScripts which is difficult to deal with but you eventually get the hang of it and than most your scripts are pretty cheap. If you're working from Minneapolis, Ameriprise provides a FREE health clinic where you can do most of your medical appointments. They have a nurse practitioner who can write scripts and plenty of nurses to evaluate all your aches and pains. They also offer free lab work and inoculations. If you're on a high-deductible or HSA plan this would be a great way to get most of your medical appointments free of charge and the clinic staff is great. I have stopped seeing my primary care physician all together and only see specialists now. They also offer physical therapy at a great discount on campus. Minneapolis has a gym although it is at a cost to the employee but minimal like 15-25 bucks a month. In Minneapolis there are some treadmill working stations and some employee provided fitness classes. Some leadership is very open to non-traditional work lifestyle like frequent telecommuting or working from other offices. Ameriprise has a pretty good working from home setup and stipend if you work from home more than 80% of the time. The leave policy as a first year employee is not too attractive but you are allowed after your first year of employment to buy up to 40 hours of personal time off, so if you have a big vacation planned or the similar this is a nice benefit versus taking leave without pay in bulk or not having the option to take time off. Ameriprise also offers maternity leave (I believe it is 5 weeks at some percentage but I am not positive). Ameriprise offers 5 sick leave days, not a lot but better than rolling those days into PTO hours as lots of companies have moved towards. As a salary employee you also do not have to report your hours worked. Which means you could go weeks or even months without reporting your time. The only time you report is when you missed work. And as a salary employee you only need to report 4 or more missed hours. For example, if you miss work for 2 hours you do not have to report that leave. This is very useful for doctors appointments, arriving late, leaving early et cetera. I was able to negotiate my salary in 2014 so I do believe you should try and not accept their first offer. I was able to negotiate 8k. My current salary only has changed 2% each year of the two I have been employed which is better than nothing since some employers don't always give raises. Also there is an end of the year bonus that usually gets paid out after January evaluations in February. My first year bonus was 23% of my salary which I thought was fair. In my role I feel that there is a very good work/life balance. There are weeks that I work far more than 40 hours but then there are weeks where I could work 0-30 and be OK with my work load. Ameriprise supplements Minneapolis public transportation commuters. Ameriprise offers underground heated and secure parking for bicycles. Ameriprise offers lots of different cultural committees and events and also offers a lot of moral improving committees, even one call the Fun Committee. Ameriprise offers in building cafeterias that a slightly subsidized. Ameriprise offers employee-to-employee recognition awards where any employee can recognize another employee and some of these recognitions have monetary value. Ameriprise makes it very easy to recognize your coworkers and show your appreciation opposed to a simple thank you.","The mid-year and annual employee review/evaluation process/technology is awful. It is VERY time-consuming and repetitive. It takes most employees 8 hours to complete. It is high redundant and depending on your leadership likely not used. It by far is my least favorite thing about working at Ameriprise and many agree it is an awful system.

Some leadership or business sectors are very different than others, which causes a culture of ""the haves"" and ""have nots."" Ameriprise should work to make the whole company work similarly. I have heard from non-head quarter's employees that they feel like they don't get the same benefits as HQ employees get and even as an HQ employee I see that as a con.

I haven't tried but I have heard from some that it is hard to get promotions from with-in the company. Also there were layoffs in 2016 but not extensive but still worth mentioning.

There could be more internal and external trainings available."
1357,,The worst corporate experience in 20 years,2016-12-02,1.0,Senior Director,"Good benefits, great cafeteria, reasonable maturity in business processes, reasonable (but not great) money, open to some employee growth, good location.","Overall the management system is set up to compete with each other and leaders act like animals in a jungle.

Tenured employees are not valued; instead, they are often pushed out through passive aggressive tactics such as unjustified low review ratings, being put on performance improvement plans for menial items, slowly taking away value add work responsibilities and making the work environment uncomfortable.  Politics and knowing the right people is the way to get promoted.  Nice is frowned upon.  Aggressiveness is rewarded.

1421,,Associate Financial Advisor,2016-08-24,5.0,Associate Financial Advisor,"Working as an AFA means working for a franchisee so the experience will be different depending on the advisor you work for.  In my experience, the company has done an amazing job from the time it became an independent firm spun-off American Express.  The firm has been expanding the product options, improving technology and started to expand into higher net worth clients.  Since you work with a franchisee the atmosphere tends to be less company-like and more relaxed.  Teams tend to be smaller and you will get exposure to all facets of the business from operations, to financial planning and finally to investments.  Salaries are competitive but that depends on the franchisee since they are the ones that select the pay scales.","You are working for a small franchisee group so you don't have access to ""HR"", or a benefits department, or a structure that would make it easier to understand who is in charge of what.  You will wear many hats but as long as you like it it's a great place to work at."

Well kept office in downtown Minneapolis.,"The call center I was in completely lacked organizational direction. Upon calling my team clients usually waited at least five minutes to reach a rep to then be transferred to a service group. As a financial advisor my role was essentially an operator. 
There essentially was no licensing program. While all other firms I've worked with provided classes or mentor programs to succeed, Ameriprise only payed for the exam and books. Most all of my colleagues took the exams 2-3 times before passing.
Managers do not invest time in any of their employees but the ones who are leading in numbers. Many do not have even one on one checks ins because managers don't see value in investing that time."

-Some of the best people I've met work here.","-Not as diverse as it could be. 
-Career opportunities to move from one field to another is extremely difficult to come by (example: moving from sales to HR or from HR to marketing).

As an advisor you must constantly grow your practice or your payout decreases potentially significantly. Financial Planning is strongly encouraged, so if you prefer to be a broker only, you should join a team that will allow you to fill that need. As an employee/staff - again - it completely depends on the individual(s) you work for. The advisors have a lot to do and a lot of areas to be knowledgeable about, so a team practice is likely a better bet for staff."

Free coffee and ice/water machines in the break room.

Departments still have some discretionary $ for employee engagement and celebration/outings.

Dress code is allows blue jeans on Fridays.

People are friendly and make it a great place to work.","Employee development is highly regarded but can feel slow to translate into job transitions. Posted jobs can read extremely specific and targeted to either outside candidates or specific persons with unique combinations of skill set.  As a result, many of them stay on the posting boards for a long time or get re-posted and like a home on the market, there is caution before one thinks about applying.  

Training department and technology is slow to advance to modern methodologies.  Current flavor of the company is Lean.

This company takes multi-tasking to the H-N-L....Hole Nother Level! They came to Vegas for one reason...to take advantage of cheap labor. And they are masters at it. Expect to come home brain dead everyday.

Very little room for advancement. On the rare occasion a higher paying position does become available, expect to be competing against dozens of your co-workers all of whom applied for the same job regardless of their qualifications. The company then goes through the motions(dog and pony show) of interviewing everyone who applied. Again, regardless of their qualifications. 
When you inquire of management what it is you need to do in order to advance, they'll give you a list of things to do. After you do them they will give you a new list of things to do... and you still won't get the promotion! Management always smiling, telling you what a great job you're doing.

The disparity between low level worker pay and ""C""-level pay has to be one of the worst in corporate America!

Lousy free coffee."

1516,,Avoid if you can,2016-04-03,1.0,AAC Financial Advisor,"They pay for your initial licenses.  Sadly that is it.  They used to provide significant ongoing training but that has fallen by the wayside as a newer ""team"" model has been adopted.","I want to be clear that this is not a review of a branch office but rather a corporate department The Ameriprise Advisor Center or AAC as they refer to it.  
Pay:
When i started pay was a combination of base salary and comission.  By the time i left the pay structure had been altered to one of bonus and base.  Your bonus is determined by 2 factors your team hitting its target revenue and how well you get along with your manager.  Even meeting your number means you will see a comission payout of about 10 to 11%.  The number is adjusted quarterly and annually.  If you have experience in this industry you know how low of a grid payout that is.  A typical producet is going to be expected to generate 150k to 200k GDC per year.  They will alter pay plans annually, I watched people have issues purchasing homes due to the constant pay plan changes.

Clients:
At one point earlier in my tennure with the organization their were many clients worth working with.  The organization solely works with orphaned clients that come from Ameriprises field advisors.  These clients were typically cast off from the first advisor becuase the advisor could not generate any more revenue off of them.  Suffice to say many of these clients are more than a little disgrunteled with the firm.  You will be expected to sell each of them a financial plan when you initially meet with them.  Most of the clients do not have the assets to warrant purchasing a financial plan.  Thses clients have also been called to death at this point, sometimes several times in the same week.

Management:
The management of the AAC is broken down into 3 levels, the team manager, the directors (managers bosses) and the VP running the department.  Management definitely has a bro culture mentality about it.  Reminded me of highschool and college locker rooms.  

People and culture:
Sadly the quality of people to work with diminished greatly as i worked there.  Many would be amazed to know that people like this were allowed to handle other peoples money and advise them on what to do with it.  Many a high five did i witness after someone dropped a ""rava bomb"" ie convinced a client to purchase an annuity.  This type of mentality is rampant in the department.  Client suitablilty really is a secondary concern to meeting the teams revenue number.  As the training has fallen off dramatically new ""specialists"" have been brought in to sell for the sales people as the newer sales people have little to no experience selling the financial products they are recommending.  0 to 6 months experience is not uncommon.  It is not uncommon for an advisor to be drunk or high during the work day, probably to deal with the misery and stress of being there.

Roles and expectations:
Be prepared to work 55 to 70 hours per week.  If you are newer your job will consist of setting appoints for the sales roles or advisors or doing their paperwork.  If you are in a selling roles you will hold 8 to 12 client meeting per day with mostly unqualified clients who have had this exact same meeting with one of the previous advisors several times.  You will also be expected to sell a financial plan to eveyone you meet with.  Anyone with tenure in this industry knows this is unethical.  The place essentially functions as a boiler room and i feel sorry for clients who through no fault of their own have their money there.  

In summary this place is toxic.  Avoid it at all costs.  Waiting tables is a better job than this"

Management is hostile, employees have their jobs threatened daily. Plan on working 12 hour days and bonus and commissions messed with. The VP of department is trying to run the place like boot camp. They have turned over an enormous number of great employees only to be left with the one's that are willing to tolerate the treatment.

Flexible work arrangements are available if employees push aa a a a a,"Leadership is so disconnected from employees it's unreal.  I was in school getting an MBA while there and management did the exact opposite of what managers should do (zero transparency, executive decisions, favoritism, lack of employee input, little face time with managers).  Additionally, compensation is far below industry average, I make over 30% more in my new (very similar) role than I did at Ameriprise."

I've worked in several areas within the company for over 22 years and the reoccurring theme is that the senior leaders do not have the people skills necessary to relate to their teams or foster a positive work environment,"
1595,,Mediocre one size fits all,2016-01-05,3.0,Financial Advisor,fee based financial planning combined with asset management and insurance as opposed to wirehouse free plan to gather assets approach,"One size fits all with ""happy meal"" that consisted of a plan, a wrap account, a variable annuity and disability or life insurance. Not client centric, just sales driven. One regional coordinator suggested ""dropping RAVA bombs"" to increase monthly production, meaning sell some variable annuities and choose the biggest up front commission.  Ideas for growing book of business wearing thin.  Like seminars?  How are you going to fill them?  Management played games with things like which mutual funds were available for sale on fee based platforms (American Funds wouldn't pay so couldn't play), questionable management of direct offices with regional and above being disconnected from on the ground reality."

1608,,Not worth the stress or the good compensation,2015-12-04,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"Ameriprise has a really good compensation and benefit package, if title and salary is all you care about.","There is a reason this company is a constant revolving door, and unable to keep good employees for long periods. Poor culture, lack of senior leadership commitment (worst leadership I have ever worked with), minimum to no cross function collaboration (it is whoever screams the loudest or threatens more viciously that gets their way, at the expense of whoever is on their way). Leadership looks out for themselves, and not for the growth, integration, and edification of their employees or teams. Even within groups, there is competition, and there are leaders often meddling and trying to get into other group's scope to expand their territory. The impression given is that you constantly have to watch out and trust no one."

I've never seen so many people go on Fmla in ONE team only. the rest just quit due to frustration.  It's funny because they honestly think the pay is competitive among similar firms
1643,,Ameriprise Advisor Center,2015-10-14,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"1. Employee benefits (only because this is a corporation)
2. Its an ok place to start out if breaking into the industry ( to be fair i will give them that)
3. You get to at least share in the daily misery with some nice coworkers
4. If you're incapable of thinking for yourself or simply dont want to anymore, this is a great place to work!
5. If you have no morals or ethics and dont care about selling bad products to clients compared to the rest of the industry or having real advisor-client relationships with real people on the other side of the phone, this place is for you!
6. Makes you realize while working in the AAC (Ameriprise Advisor Center), the grass REALLY IS GREENER on the other side and things REALLY CAN GET WORSE.
7. If you argue/disagree with leadership/management, there is a good chance that you are smarter/more ethical/have higher sense of moral standards than you just might think.
8. Higher chances of receiving bigger bonuses if you can follow orders, and close your mouth regardless of what you are hearing is right or wrong.
9. Job security has increased since the AAC only gains 1 or 2 people for every 5-6 people that leave","1. AAC slogan is client first then team then individual; in reality, it is company first then team and individual then the client.
2.  ZERO TRANSPARENCY as sales metrics and goals are changed every quarter and probably 90% of the time, the metrics increase.  There is no direct formula to determine your overall quarterly bonus.  So an advisor could generate $50k of GDC (gross dealer concession) for the company and receive a $10k bonus (which is 20% and is already considered low in the industry) and the next quarter generate $60k of GDC and only receive a $8k bonus.
3. Based on the 2nd point just made, FC's and CRM's are ""capped"" at making a max of $80k-$90k per year (salary plus bonus) regardless of the GDC they generate.  As the sales director once said, ""we can't pay people hundreds of thousands of dollars.""
4. The ""subjective"" part of the quarterly bonus is determined by sales managers sitting behind a closed door and figuring out how to 1. keep bonus money in the ""kitty"" for themselves or the company at end of the year, and then 2. how much to compensate people they want to stay with the company and stay motivated, 3. how much to withhold from people they dont like regardless of how much revenue they've produced and how to go about communicating their reasoning for not giving out what that advisor rightfully deserves, or from people they think are planning on leaving anyways after they receive their bonus b/c theyve had enough of the high school bs so that, again, they can keep it in the ""kitty."" So instead of paying bonuses based on what you have actually done, bonuses are used as a tool, like dangling a carrot in front of a horse, as they are paid with what they expect from you the following quarter.
5. There is no way to build a book of business.  The Ameriprise AAC is only concerned with generating as much up-front revenue on the highest commissioned products possible.  It wouldnt be as bad if these products (annuities, mutual funds, life insurance) were the best or at least towards the top in the industry, but they are nowhere close.  The philosophy actually lived by is different than what is preached from upper management to sales management to advisors as once a client has generated all the revenue they possibly can in management's eyes, there is very little reason to continue speaking with the client on a regular basis and the calls and meetings with that client dwindle down to practically nothing.  If clients are called, it is only with the intent to sell something new or something else.  There is little to no intent to simply call a client to check in and see how they or their family is doing or work with them on financial aspects such as paying off their debts or establishing a budget.  This is viewed in the eyes of management as an inefficient use of time and a waste of money.
6. Management eavesdrops on phone calls and attempts to tell advisors what they should say to the client to eventually get them to buy or invest in what they want them to.
7. Very little product knowledge training
8. Very few career pathways; a CSC (dialer) can go to a CSA (service/paperwork), a CSA can go to an FC (financial consultant;focuses on selling financial plans to everyone on every call) or CRM (client relationship manager; focuses on selling whatever FC cant to client); CRM or FC to Sales Manager; that's about it
9. Reality is its a hybrid of a call center and a ""boiler room""
10. Advisors are inept at doing their job mostly because they havent been trained on how to actually do it.
11. Other than the once a week meetings with management behind closed doors, advisors are called in to abrupt and sudden meetings with managers as they berate them on things that in reality dont even matter or are minimal in the grand scheme of things as their focus is hardly ever on the actual important things of the job or why the advisor failed to sell or solicit a financial plan to a client who has no need for one, is 80 years old or is making $12k/ a year and is disabled.  If an advisor is 5 minutes late for an employee meeting, you can almost guarantee that the advisor will spend at least 30 mins of their day sitting down and being berated and yelled at for being 5 mins late....Hmmm...Sounds similar to an event that occurred about 80 years ago overseas...  If you say something publicly that management thinks could be confrontational or critical or damages someone or something's image...you figuratively speaking, will be ""taken behind the shed"".
12. Management spends most of its time behind closed doors in the meetings they've created making fun of people, indulging in gossip, and discussing hypothetically if they had the chance, who they would want to punch in the face.
13. Keep losing good people
14. At least 35% of your day is spent in useless meetings created by the bureaucracy which is the corporate world and management.
15. Management will say to you whatever they need to in order for you to produce and generate more money for themselves and the company.
16.  Obviously at this point, you can probably assume the truth that yes, you are treated as a child, not as an adult. Micromanagement at its finest."

Since you are essentially working in a small business, you get the flexibility that a small business can offer.

Most of the ratings will be wildly different from practice to practice.  I usually worked in friendly environments.","If you don't plan on being a financial advisor some day, there are very few opportunities for you within the franchisee world.  At the end of the day, financial advice is basically a sales job so if you don't have those skills, it will be tough to make a career doing office support.  

Pay and benefits will be based on how successful the practice is. They're not going to be as good as working for corporate.

I worked amongst 20-25 different practices.  Pretty high turnover rate in the low-level staff positions, usually due to people realizing they are pretty much maxed out after learning how to fill out the different new business forms and do the meeting prep.  If you aren't going to get licensed, you won't be doing a whole lot more than that.

Another thing I saw a lot of was a practice becoming comfortable with where they are at and not really growing much.  The advisor or their ""marketing"" staff need to be active in picking up new clients otherwise you end up with people who are fine with their incomes and work-life balance.  Once I started working full time out of school, I noticed that several of the advisors I worked for stopped coming to the office everyday as I was there to manage things.  ""Working from home"" and just showing up for client meetings doesn't really cut it.  Unfortunately, you have no way of knowing if you are going to be working in a practice that is going somewhere or one that is stagnant until you have put some time into it."

There is a great deal of mistrust and raillery between departments within IT that over the years has produced an environment more akin to a elementary class than a fortune 500 company.  Instead of working together as a whole for the good of the business each department see all others as rivals.  This leads to a daily infighting about problem ownership, project work, root cause analysis etc.  The problem is exacerbated by executive level micromanaging.  It’s standard practice that when an incident occurs leaders from the Sr. executive level down join bridge calls along with the engineers attempting to fix the issue.   These calls more often than not result in leaders literally screaming at each other and at the engineers attempting to fix the problem.   Almost all new employees have the same reaction “I can’t believe people treat each other that way”.   The company takes pride in completing annual employee engagement surveys which show these issues and technology also has the highest rate of turnover in the company.   To the credit of Ameriprise they have attempted to bring in consultants to help, and have sent leadership off to training to do trust falls and build relationships, but the efforts have not brought about any change.   While the pay and benefits are good I would not recommend any position within IT."

Advisor center is a mill and you don't get all that's available to clients for almost a year. Managers listen in on calls and can interject comments into your ear while speaking to clients. Clients can't hear manager but it can get distracting esp when the manager does not know anything about the client and makes recommendations that planner knows is not what the client wants or needs. If you don't make it to the client problems will arise and if you do you may lose the client.

1810,,Good Company - Lots of Change,2015-01-13,4.0,Anonymous Employee,"I was fortunate to work on several teams where collaboration was highly valued, autonomy was encouraged, and our team members were treated like adults instead of employees.

The environment was business casual, and my leaders generally had a good open-door policy.","Reorganizations were frequent (often internally referred to as Spring Cleaning and Fall Cleaning), so as changes would start there was always concern about whether 'your' job would be affected. Communications surrounding change was sometimes lacking, so there would be unanswered questions as to the thought process behind the changes.

The benefits package was fair, but the company requires employees to save and use their personal PTO for days when the corporate office is closed (market holidays). PTO does not carry over, but sick days do. That being said, sick days were reduced from six to four in 2008 or 2009. The stated reason was corporate research indicated people only used an average of four sick days per year - but they did not offer any balance to the removal of the two extra days (i.e. two extra PTO days), just took them away."

I was the only intern there and everyone else was either a financial advisor or an assistant, but I always felt like I was part of the team.  I used morning star on a regular basis and learned a lot about mutual funds.","My experience of the semester long internship at Ameriprise was that after the first two weeks work was very stagnant.  I was not able to contribute more to the organization nor was a I given a set of different tasks for me to take away from.  I felt as though I was more of an assistant position, which was frustrating because I was not getting paid."

You will gain a lot of skills. Everyone I spoke to seemed nice and a few wanted to help me advance if I planned on working there. The hours were relatively flexible, but if you are doing the internship for credit, be firm about your hours. I was able to attend many networking opportunities, which I did not have to pay for. Overall, if this is a company you wish to work for, work hard, and you will be noticed.","I did not receive any compensation, but did receive college credit. The internship was not enjoyable in the sense that I spent more time watching than doing. I was also told that learning experiences were not ok, which made me hesitant to make any errors. My hours, while flexible, were longer that my credit called for. I was fine with this, but towards the end of the day, the hours dragged as there was little to do. I was very proactive with taking on tasks, but the environment I worked for didn't require an enormous need for an extra hand."

If you land in one of the former, you can help each other to succeed and have your own practice, even as part of a team.  This allows for growth and flexibility.","There is really no supervision of franchises in terms of how they run their practice.

Good place to get experience, good place to be a lead/franchise advisor. High payouts","Health benefits are not mandatory with franchise owners, I currently pay for all my own health benefits. All franchise owners are different but they are essentially small business owners and can run their practice how ever they want.  Ameriprise, on the franchise and corporate side, as a whole pays their staff less than average compared to other firms. This came straight from one of the Ameriprise leaders at a top performers conference in La Quinta.

- Many opportunities to work in different parts of the company, if you choose to.","Want to state that this is not a Branch office.  This was an inside sales job in the corporate building.  Keep that in mind when reading about my experience:
- Too much turnover.  
- People were leaving or being let go, quicker than hiring allowed.  
- Quality of advice may have suffered because of that, which hurt brand's reputation.

I left a decent paying job for this job when the recruiter implied people  bonused much more than what they currently pay (which is a joke, considering how profitable they are). The training for some departments is absolutely horrible, with little to no support once you begin taking calls. Staffing levels were almost always low when I was there, forcing people to take more and more work.  The work itself sucks. A typical day involves listening to some idiot complain about back office screw ups (which happen quite often), paperwork not being processed on time, bad information provided by associates, etc. Speaking of screw ups, there is little to no accountability for mistakes made. You can provide bad information and chances are you will not hear about it. Advisors simply call in multiple times until they get the answer they want to hear. Some coaches and leaders are a joke, and take advantage of their positions, yet no one seems to care. I see plenty of chit chatting between some coaches and leaders when there are calls in queue waiting for 15 to 20 minutes on hold. The communication between departments is absolutely horrible. It is not uncommon to get some sarcastic response from a frustrated processor when you send an email asking for help. I've never seen such a high turn over rate until i started working here. I've sat next to people who show up to work in the morning, get their belongings and simply just walk out. 4 people remain out of the 12 that started in my department last year. Only one or two people actually put in their two week notice, the rest just walked out. Very little engagement, very little room for advancement. I could go on and on......"

Most of my direct leaders (over a dozen of them by now) have been very good, and all have been reasonable to work for.   My positions have afforded me good work/life balance and typically a 40-45 hour week, occasionally 50 hours. Corporate culture is excellent  I'd say, with a heavy focus on volunteering/contributing to charitable organizations.  Various employee groups/clubs feed employee interests and build a sense of community.  The best part is the excellent senior leaders (no this is not a paid review-really).  Since Ameriprise spun off from American Express 6 years ago, I have never had more confidence in the company, its direction, or its senior leadership. (I work a professional, but non-leadership job.)  The company continues to execute very well against its strategy and leaders are hard working, thoughtful and anxious to make Ameriprise successful and a great place to work.

Salary is average, but bonuses are good. 401k match at 5% is average, which is a little ironic for a financial advising firm. Other benefits are below average. The work environment is fine, typical for a Fortune 500.","There are a lot of politics here. There's less of a focus on technology. Most Ameriprise IT employees are not technical, resulting in those that are having inflated egos. Vendors tend to have their way.

Advancement based on ability to quote meaningless political-speak rather than results.  Technology leadership believes they can run the business better than the business units.  Technology department acts like they are a profit center - charging business units more than actual labor rate to build a slush fund to execute their own projects without business approval, often times to the detriment of the business.  Executive leadership blinded by small details and not seeing the big picture - i.e., offshore labor costs are 30% cheaper than onshore, but they don't want to hear that it take twice as many offshore resources and takes twice as long to complete a task.

1890,,Poor Management,2014-06-21,2.0,Internal Customer Service Representative,I was able to learn about the financial services industry without having had the experience in the past.  I enjoyed the opportunity to support financial advisors in complying with state and federal laws and regulations.  Ameriprise was doing a very good job of following these laws and regulations.  I felt good to be working with an institution that played by the rules in the financial sector.  My salary increased by at least 3% each year and each year I earned a bonus.  Benefits such as health insurance and the amount of personal day accrual were better than average.,Employees only receive 4 sick days a year and each separate absense was counted as an occurance.  Being over 12 minutes to 50 minutes late would result in a 1/2 occurance and over 50 minutes as a full occurance regardless of the reason.  Five occurances would result in a verbal warning and 6 would result in a written warning.  More than 6 would result I'm termination. This policy was for most of the employees but there were favorite employees in the same position I was in that got treated differently.  The way that the policy was implemented across the organization depended on which team leader you had.  My team leader used the policy to intimidate those people she did not like.  Upper management was given information from various employees but did nothing or told the team leader who was responsible leading to retaliation.  The management was weak and certain employees were able to dominate who didn't necessarily have the best imtereats of the company in mind.  These employees were allowed to intimidate the weaker employees and there were many cliques and in my experience one bully who was not a supervisor.  I loved my job but the environment was too toxic.

The reliability and consistency of technology is lacking compared to peers I know at other firms.

Luckily the P2 platform allows practitioners the ability to  “take it or leave it” with respect to the wishes of the Mothership.

In the group I am in, it is relaxed and fun, but we deliver high quality work.",If you are interested in moving up within the company you have to know which leaders to hitch your wagon to because that can mean the difference between staying in the same role and not advancing for 4 years or moving up 3 levels in 2 years.

I have never seen management as toxic as this place. Management recruited budding advisors nationwide to join the AAC in Minneapolis, only to find out that a week into the role, they had reorganized and cut pay over 50% without any prior notice from Ameriprise. The people running this place pride themselves on ""managing out"" solid employees as anyone who questions this foolish plan to destroy independent relationships with clients is deemed ""not on board"". Next, the employees who are left have turned to substance abuse during work hours as a means of self-medicating against this awful place. Management is a bunch of failed previous advisors who are all in their 20s and there is little to no respect given to them as they seem to use their title as a dating service and routinely are seen absolutely trashed at bars on the weekends by fellow employees. The AAC management pressures advisors to sell unsuitable products to clients on every call and only pushes their Prop. products= extreme conflict of interest. Hard work is not rewarded at all and there in ZERO training in this role. The ""training department"" feels that rounding up a room of new hires and talking sports for an hour has effectively trained these new employees on how to sell investments?"

For example, if a client with $1,000,000 walks in the door and agree to invest those assets at 1%, you've just given yourself an $8,000- $9,000 raise per year.  The benefit to being an entrepreneur is also the challenge; if you're not sure what I mean, this may not be the best place to start out as a Financial Advisor.  

There are a number of Team Practices on the independent platform that hire paraplanners, assistants, associate advisors... just remember, each one of these practices is it's own entity; it's own franchise.","Technology was terrible, it's gotten better in the last five years but is still spotty.

*Never ever pay for mutual fund A-shares, or a LOAD, EVER!
*You do not need DI if your employer provides it, most cases your private DI will reduce your work benefit resulting in no gain.  Don't waste your money!
*You don't need an annuity with living benefits, they are criminally expensive, and only benefit the sales organization, in many cases only 100k of your annuity is insured!

If someone is troublesome, difficult to work with, or even has complaints against them to HR, their job is safe as Ameriprise seems to be afraid of lawsuits of any kind. However, when senior leadership wants to cut costs, which seems to happen on an annual basis in November, loyal and hard-working employees are laid off in droves, primarily in the service organization. Layoffs can happen anywhere in the enterprise, except the finance department.

There are two distinct cultures: service and everyone else.

The most challenging aspect of working at Ameriprise , the #1 Con, is trying to motivate yourself to care about work that you feel your own leader/director/direct report doesn't really care about. There is simply no heart in the work. 

Maybe some of the negativity is because it's hard to relate to our very wealthy, affluent clients.   Unfortunately, what happens when you don't have  Heart, when you don't have anything Real to work with or for, when you don't have  a personal, relatable company mission and vision to love and believe in... then all that is left is "" Me, Me, Me, 'Get out of my way' I will do whatever I have to do to climb this ladder , and doing good, creative, intelligent work doesn't get rewarded here so I will do whatever I have to do to appear better than my coworkers."""

Many of your coworkers will be fun and interesting people.,"They work at bare bone staffing and expect maximum output at all times. Management isoblivious to the amount of time and effort put in by many and when they are made aware, they don't care - as long as the work is done. Marketing is the WORST. You will work long hard hours until you are burnt out. I worked there for 20 years and saw it over and over, until I was burnt out."
2075,,Great place to start a career,2012-10-28,4.0,Business Systems Analyst II,While this may change from department to department. I have found the organization to be supportive of career growth and committed to retaining high performers. The minneapolis campus has a wide array of support services on site.,Being a financial services firms there is layers upon layers of rules and regulations. More a reflection of the industry than the firm.
2076,,Project Coordinator,2012-10-28,1.0,Project Coordinator,"A few people have turned out to be solid good people, unfortunately because the culture is so bad, these positive people can not influence and impact the right kind of change.  The cafetiere is subsidized and offers healthy options.","Horrible culture; shame and blame game context, majority of management does not know how to hold people accountable, excuses and hiding issues are rewarded.  If you are a high performer with integrity this is not the company to work for.  Contractors are treated terrible, if issues come up the employees will blame the contractors, the contractors have no recourse are being treated with disrespect and abusive."
2077,,The worst company to work for in the industry,2012-10-18,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"Flexible work times

2079,,An assistant position at an Ameriprise franchise is a good way to get your foot in the door of financial services.,2012-10-06,5.0,Financial Advising Assistant,"Employees and advisers are friendly, honest, productive, helpful.  The adviser gives you a good sense of what being an adviser is actually all about. Once the adviser has confidence in your ability, he or she will generally allow you to take on all of the responsibilities of an adviser, aside from the ones precluded to you by law. The adviser helps you understand sales in a way that simultaneously retains clients as genuine friends.","There were not many cons. Depending on the number of accounts your adviser handles and client needs, you may need to stay past the usual eight hours, but this is rare. Currently, it is difficult if not impossible to be hired as an adviser with Ameriprise."

Many coworkers were very talented, highly motivated, and good to work with. The work was interesting and challenging.","They practice what I call ""surgical layoffs"", where they target specific individuals, many of whom are very long term and productive, and begin a long, and tortured process of systematiclly documenting their ""suddenly"" declining performance, to the point of terminations. Oddly enough, the sales and profit numbers are usually down, and the impacted employees are typically older workers. What a coincidence. Their management team spends unbelievable amounts of time documenting this alleged decline in performance, and of course they don't have to pay severance when they let someone go. This has gone on for years!"

Very cumbersome and inefficient! Definitely not the place for someone who does SMA business. 

If you want to morph into an insurance salesman this is the place for you…. you will be supported generously and you will love to say these two words…. River   Source.

They just let go two ~30 year veterans to Ameriprise today in the Finance dept.  Have to cut people who have been here too long and make too much and add more jobs in India.  All so the most senior leadership can continue to receive their multli million bonus.  Absolutely disgusting!  No opportunities to move around and they only promote their friends.

Home office VPs are typically company-loyal and have not  -- nor ever will be able to -- work anywhere else. The company reorganizes frequently, eliminating roles and then making employees apply for positions that are quite similar to the job that was eliminated (not a healthy way to develop or retain talent as everyone is at risk and then competes against others).  Vacation is sub-par unless you've spent your lie there or you're a VP."

There is also a lot of outsourcing.  Leadership within some groups is lacking, decisions are not always made without all accurate information being supplied, so the decisions are not always the best.

It was essentially a customer service representative position.  Unfortunately, they have severely handicapped their ability to validate the accuracy of their workforce adherence projections, as all the call center analysts do is answer phone calls from call center representatives who need their break and work segments adjusted, by as little as three minutes.  Call center adherence metrics should be built with a certain percentage of ""shrinkage"" built in, as we all know that, due to the nature of call volume, no one can adhere to their schedule 100%.  Forcing the representatives to have to have their segments adjusted places undue stress on them and is a waste of everyone's time.  There was no challenge in this position."
