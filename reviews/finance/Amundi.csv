If you are young and you have ambitions, this company is not for you, go to investment banks / hedge funds instead for a much better package

The so-called trainee program only offered 1 year contract role to graduates, with only 7 days of AL and significantly lower salary than other management trainee programs organised by banks. There is no future to be a trainee here, they don’t grow you and only use you for cheap labour only.

The management culture of the Hong Kong office is very local and it’s not a MNC. No work from home is allowed once the government resumed working from office , which is probably the only FI had such a practice. Besides, there was no allowance given to employees to wfh.

Benefits are good: Denplan, Bupa, 25 days holiday.","Don't accept a job here if you are ambitious and want to move up the career ladder quickly, as there are few positions that open up. Decisions are made in HQ in Paris, and you're essentially just expected to execute them -no matter your thoughts on the matter. They always throw more people at a problem, rather than solving the issue (which is often to do with their technology -which is notoriously a disgrace). A prime example is that they decided to build their own CRM system instead of paying for Salesforce, at the detriment to the Sales' productivity as it doesn't perform basic functions. I found out that my male colleague, who spent his day on Facebook, was paid at least 50% more than me."

- Nice co workers","Middle management strives for mediocrity. When middle management / people in Business Development screw up there is absolutely NO ACCOUNTABILITY to own or correct the problem. Working in sales is really hard when marketing and compliance aren't given the correct headcounts to actually get things done. Expect to not have proper marketing material for reps you're working with for 1-2 months into the following quarter, secondly don't expect to get an annual review because it take 4-5 months into the next year to get that done. HR tends to set the pay expectation fairly on target but management in sales will set a very different (higher) expectation. Frankly the overall feeling across the entire team is very low right now and needs some work. A lot of potential to be better but people need to not get sacrificed for being honest about how the environment actually feels. If you express dissatisfaction it will be swept under the rug and pretend it was never said. Secondly expect your quarterly ""manager discretion"" bonuses to drop because you were honest.

Lastly - Amundi is basically cutting funding to the Americas, although they need a certain headcount they're basically waiting for the bottom to fall out so they can justify not needing the distribution channel down the road because it isn't as profitable as it once was."

123,Amundi,OK,2014-09-25,3.0,IT Manager,biggest french AM/strong international exposure & development/wide product range,don't start your career here/ Lots of politics/ some dpt like administration/some units with too much middle managers (=no decisions)/If you have no internal relations you stay in your job until retirement/ Low pay in Paris vs. London
124,Amundi,Beware of leadership,2014-07-04,1.0,Anonymous Employee,A leader with scope and depth that can provide good short-term opportunities for some. A great place to work for french freemasons (but if you are one you do not need glassdoor).,"Amundi is run by a clan of ruthless ex-Calyon investment bankers. Unless you share this special culture and background you will never be part of decision-making (see other contributions about unstable organization, management, shifting directions). If you can, use your network to learn about middle and top-management many depression and yes suicide cases."
