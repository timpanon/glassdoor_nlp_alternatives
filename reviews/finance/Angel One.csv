Let's start with people managers - they run like headless chickens from one corner to other - no strategic objective, no long term vision, no compassion for colleagues and reportees. I've seen people being yelled at as if they are slaves of their managers.
When all these things happen, employees might think of turning to the HR department to sort things out, but HRs are the worst here. When people share their problems with HRs you never know from how many sides it will backfire. People are being mocked at when they try to suggest something out of the box. There is no regard to your roles and responsibilities, no freedom or personal space - someone might call you at 10pm or 7am anyday.
Let me tell you what will happen if you join this company: all this toxicity passed upon you by your superiors will eventually take a toll on your personal life and you'll start having health problems like short temper, High BP and your personal relations will take a toll. It is extremely important that you understand the importance of your personal life, relations and freedom and stay away from companies like this one.
I was part of the Research team, so if you plan to join that, then this review might help you take the right call."

The entire problem starts from the top management; it is run like a family business. Anything can change any day in your profile. The head of digital marketing & head of affiliate marketing was hand in glove with all the vendors for unethical business practices. Each time there was commercials discussion with the smallest of the vendors other team members were asked to leave the room. Non performing campaigns were pushed to be continued at negative ROI. Meetings held post working hours on Saturdays to show that he is really concerned about the business.
The CMO is a physcopath & extremely unprofessional. He treats his own team as if they are his slaves. His constant effort is to discredit, throw baseless allegations, insulting and demeaning his team members. Moreover, he goes to the extent of intimidating that he can spoil your career and you will not get any jobs in the future.
Before understanding the skills of the team members he tries to show them their flaws. He will continuously attack you so that you are completely demotivated and have no choice but to leave the company. If you are very desparate and want to ruin your career then join this company and especially the marketing team."
