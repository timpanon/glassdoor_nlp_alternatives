I was approached for a promotion after only a year within the company.  I have witnessed upper management go to bat to keep employees within the company, or to help them keep employment when moving out of state.  Lots of room for advancement.  Competitive salary.  Awesome benefits and great programs to help assess health and lower the cost of benefits even more.  Generous PTO and vacation purchase programs.","Branch assistance is minimal.  It is not for lack of trying; the company just doesn't have enough staff to support.  Often times, I have been left with one other person to run a branch for a week.  This, of course, creates client frustration, and the employees take the brunt of that.  Hold times on technology support phone lines are often times 5-6 hours.  This lack of support creates high turnover.  It is difficult to get new hires into the appropriate classes, (sometimes over a month-long wait, which means that it takes 2 months from hire to truly have the employee up and running), which further adds to the issue."

Good banking products and services","Anyone outside of the branch setting has little respect for branch associates.

Very little consistency - Operations team does not communicate with retail team, so the branches suffer from being told one thing today, the opposite tomorrow from different sections of ""bosses"" the branch reports to.

Only cares about ""big picture"" community, not really the small town, local impact.

Regional level management is rude and treats people poorly.

Higher management receives feedback from clients about consistent long wait times in branches and staffing issues, but this feedback is always turned back onto branch staff, rather than the root of the problem. Clients complain they wait in line for 10 minutes, and it is considered the teller lines fault because they didn't thank the client for their wait, didn't give the client the attention they needed once they get w/ an associate, wasn't empathetic enough, etc. 

Career Opportunities depend on your regional area - and often times depends on who you know. Yes, they'll post a job and technically follow the guidelines so i'm sure they're within their legal requirements, but usually someone is already in mind for the job and slides right in. 

I truly think the culture/values is intended well, but when it filters down the ladder, much of that is lost."

I had been told since I started that I would have endless opportunities to move up, but as they down sized/closed branches, I found myself stuck in the same position. I had also seen where upper management would hold back tellers from trying to be cross trained/move into a banker role just simply because they did not want to have to go through hiring a new employee, which is just wrong. I joined through a merger, and it was poorly executed. The employees sent to train us would argue/bicker about how they do things differently at their branch, and by the time we reopened no one knew what was going on.

Push for sales and make the partners work against each other. Hiring new people in at more than what they pay existing employees and existing employees will never get to those income levels at the tiny raises you get annually.

Spend all your time on this mandatory or you get yelled at conference call or webex or in person meeting yet run your team, meet with businesses, and hit your numbers.

Changing goals every month or don't tell you what you have to sell to keep your job until the new year is well under way and then change them again in a few months anyhow and then again after that. Technology is so far behind. Days to process mobile deposits. Still batch scanning teller work instead of live scanning it. Segmentation and lending limit changes up then down then back up again but you've already handed over a bulk of those higher accounts because your limits dropped sorry too late go create new opportunities that other banks selling all the same stuff already are hitting them up for at much lower rates or fees.

Log log log log log log log. Spend more time logging than you do anything else. If systems were more intuitive or not old DOS blue screens half the logs could auto generate and would not be necessary. Log it initial here, sign there, did you email this person to tell them you logged it? Micro manage you out the wazoo. Have the SSL covering so many branches that they can't even meet with and spend time coaching Market Leaders once a month because they have more direct reports than there are business days in the month. So that means the people who talk a good game can just talk talk talk but not do do do as long as they have a good producing location they have to do zero work. No upward mobility. They eliminate positions left and right so no confidence in stability or job security even if you do a good job and are a top producer. Annual vs. Quarterly or monthly incentives like most other banks. Cheap out and tell the branches not to even order lollipops for the kids or dog bones for the pups. Set timers on our lights and heat controls to be corporate managed that they can't trust us to have our own heat set for our own comforts or to turn off a light like we are two year olds. It's a game of how much can people take before they break but we'll talk a good game of culture and expect our employees to live it but what we throw at our employees we as a company don't drink our own mandated koolaid. Pretty sure they named their position Cluster Market Leader because it is a Cluster but different second word. Same salary to run two, three, four, or even FIVE branches with all different goals and just one you. Sure get a team lead that is a glorified platform and that's all the help you need right? You can hit all those goals and coach everyone and be everywhere right? Oh you can't, oh well, figure it out because you're really not branch managers but business relationship managers so that day to day of the branch you can forget time to do it and focus all on business sales sales sales. You still have to get that day to day stuff done but don't dare do it on their business calling time you'll have to figure that out on your own time."

Upper management is on retail managers back constantly and our area manager persistently berated my manager. Nothing was good enough. It is a high pressure sales environment even though we should have been focused on just helping customers. Every customer was supposed to be viewed as a potential sale. The environment/culture was terrible. Most of coworkers supported trump and they were vocal about it. Cursing at tv when Hilary gave concession speech calling her curse words.

Employees have low moral 

The company is shifting towards a universal banker strategy, which is great in theory but what upper management fails to realize is that when you have a limited staff doing a bunch of stuff running at 200% employees become counter productive.

I think the upper management staffing model consists of considering how many employees you actually  need to run a location and then dividing that number by 2 . Branches are always understaffed and employees are under-trained.

The technology is the branch is 10 years behind at a minimum 

Its very hard to move up."

If you are interested in being treated as a professional take a pass. They have done so many minor league things since I have left including cancelling the debit card to my flex spending account, downgrading my checking to some antiquated product that includes an annual fee (i didn't even know these still existed). They also have a time off accrual calendar where you don't accrue your last day until the last day of the year and it is use or lose. This results in always having a negative balance which doesn't seem like a big deal until they cut your final paycheck in half. The place is petty and it permeates the culture the successful managers are people who have learned to escape accountability and  stay quiet about the complete lack of a technology strategy."

Good health insurance after day 1.","Disorganized, outdated, sketchy, no work-life balance, dishonest, stressful, annoying, etc. 

I walked into a terrible mess of a branch and a company. There were four of us at the start and my first week was great. 

After my second week a coworker retired, my branch banker team leader was “no longer with the company”, my cluster branch manager “stepped down”.  

I was off in training at another branch for teller mentor training and came back to a hell hole. A branch with no leader and three new people. ( no manager, no team leader, supervisor ) it was horribly confusing and uncomfortable. 

ALL THE CLIENTS were very rude because we new people are required to ask for IDs obviously. I was out of balance and so were the other newbies.... ( we all had only three days of teller training ) No one was around to help and it was the worst experience. We had one violent “client” that we had to call the police on. THE POLICE NEVER SHOWED UP. 

I was also promised I would not have to work every weekend which turned out to be untrue. I was on the schedule 6 days a week every week. That really mad me angry. 

Besides all of that mess at my permanent branch : 

When I was in training at another branch, I saw how everyone hated their jobs and wanted to leave the company. In fact, one did leave that branch the week I was there. 

I was treated terrible by clients because of all the unfair fees BB&T charges. Clients were mean in general. 

I was shorted training days for teller mentor training so I had to put my foot down to get back into training bc I was not ready. They tried shortening up my banker mentor training so I could keep working every Saturday. I had to put my foot down again and say no “I DESERVE FULL TRAINING”!  It’s so important to train employees right especially in this field. I have worked for two other banks that have done such a better job at preparing you. I was set up for failure. Don’t work here."

Policy changes often to suit them so don't get used to anything.. Other  Co -workers try to be your boss when they know nothing. Too many clicks and behind the door talking regarding other employees confidential issues. Management violating employee privacy and other employees know your problems before they are addressed to you. Always vacation issues with co workers. When calling internal they give you the run around and still no answer.  Phones ring off the hook all day no call center available. Pressured from management to make calls for them while they do nothing.  Schedules are worked to their management advantage and to your worst. Have to push and pray to get through your days.

Not enough help so people are on hold for long periods of time just to talk to a rep. Never enough help to answer questions. Ridiculous ""wrap up"" time. Work life balance is a joke with this company, it's all about work.  If you are stuck on a call and can not take your break or lunch at the allotted time, that counts against you as well. So clicky it's nauseating .  Every call is recorded and then you are graded on three calls a month and can get ""written up"" if you didn't perform to their specifications.

I was a exemplary associate. I'm sadden by this. Feel like I'm getting a divorce after being dependable and loyal for many, many years. BB&T now expects nothing but perfection! 'non-negotiable' !!! The staff is expected to work with a very, very lean staff to reach unrealistic goals. Which creates disgruntled clients. Which means the tellers get the brunt of the client complaints of the long wait time.  BB&T is about the bottom line instead of how the client might perceive their banking experience.  Clients don't understand that with every banking transaction, the bank associate's job may be on the line. Something I took lightly which cost me my job.

Training for this job where you handled accounts and money only lasted 2 days.
Coworkers who were supposed to be supportive were rude and curt time (although they had plenty of time to chit chat with customers about their personal business).
I was hired right before the manager went on a 2 week leave, so I couldn't go to her for help
I was required to answer the phone while assisting customers standing right in front of me.
Customers were charged so many fees that they often asked me to do tasks that they'd normally have to pay BB&T for (such as rolling coins, printing account transactions & balances, etc.) I didn't mind helping the customers, but this made for long lines in the lobby.
Rules were applied inconsistently, which made it particularly hard for me as a new employee. One time a customer yelled at me, then filed a complaint because I would not allow her to withdraw $1300 from her account WITH NO ID WHATSOEVER. Instead of thanking me for helping to protect her account, I was punished for it. She said that the other tellers let her do it, so I should also. I had no idea if this woman was the actual account holder. (Who leaves the house w/o any form of ID?? Especially if you're visiting the bank!)
When I couldn't get anyone to help me if I had a transaction I couldn't figure out, I was reprimanded for attempting to resolve it myself."

Focus when interviewing new employees was not on talent, but instead individuals who were handcuffed to the area.  Lack in quantitative leadership at higher levels likely due to the political battles that were constantly being waged.  In my short time there two of my managers had been ostracized to be removed from the company or removed from positions of power.  Huge disconnect with banking needs of those currently entering the market.  Come on ""The best of the best"" as a motto?

Extremely low moral inside the branches due to the high goals, low pay and lack of meaningful training.  Investments are simply not a priority.

15-20 minute waits for client support.

Internal competition from private/wealth/Scott and Stringfellow, you are supposed to bring them referrals, but good luck getting any out of them.

No internal advancement opportunities whatsoever.

IC's are treated like throwaways, which is why the turnover has been extremely high.

This call center actually wants you to stay unlike other centers who just use and abuse you until they fire you or you quit.

Sales goals are determined by some abstract process performed outside of your market and goals are expected to be met, regardless of how many vacancies are at your branch.

I was scolded for scheduling a doctor appointment when I finally had an afternoon off; I was asked to stay late and when I said I couldn't because of my appointment I was told that I should know better than to make doctors appointments during banking hours.

Aside from that, the culture is becoming very cult-like.

The @Work leader hires managers who have little experience, no idea how to manage a team, and are overall pretty incompetent. It was a shame when I consistently asked my manager for feedback so I could become better and was only told ""you're doing great"" with no constructive criticism. My manager was an embarrassment to the region and I continually had to field calls from other internal partners complaining about their ""leadership"". When I was faced with obstacles or challenges, my manager kept telling me he'd get it figured out but would do absolutely nothing. I realized after a while, my manager was pushing his own agenda - and it wasn't in the best interest of the company. After just two years in the role, I began to hate it but stuck it out in hopes of things getting better. The program is a joke and the company preaches work life balance but then wants you to do 5am presentations, networking events at night, and work on the weekends. Take my advice - run and don't ever look back! I regret having wasted so many years in a dead end job.

It's very hard to have the time for those conversations when there are only two tellers on duty at a time.   Forget any kind of a bonus or raise because between the high goals and the fact that the audit reviews knock points off of your ""score"" for such important things like putting a check instead of an x in a box, or initialing a report instead of signing it, or forgetting to stamp it, one has as much chance of meeting the matrix as winning the ring road at a carnival.  The scheduling is horrible, one day off in 12, usually three 10 hour days a week, but there is no overtime, so you constantly have to enter less hours than you actually work to keep it under 39.5 per week.

I don't know if it's Bbt as a whole but definitely is the case in East TN. The managers keep their employees in the dark there is little to no training it's kind of a sink or swim kinda thing. The employees under management actually train management because of this. Bbt will hire outside of Bbt before they hire from within. Then other employees are stuck training their ""manager"". Bbt is very fickle one minute they want one thing the very next minute something completely different. This business is very unorganized and dishonest. Probably due to the lack of properly trained management. Clients get very frustrated with the  turn over. I have been with Bbt for 2 yrs and have had 4 management changes and are now looking for the 5. These people they hire have no previous management experience and some have little to no banking experience.  Furthermore all the branches are under staffed so if there is someone out on just vacation it's a scramble to get any coverage for a simple lunch let alone if someone calls out. The employees are overwhelmed and feel used. They ask you to work on things above your pay grade to be a ""team player"" yet when it comes down to it they're just using you until they can find some other tyrant that has no clue what they are doing. Sick time unless your foot down they will take advantage of your kindness. If you're sick or have someone die in your family might as well just stay home don't try and be sweet and torture yourself till they can find coverage because they will convientley not find coverage and make you feel even worse for leaving just to go to the doctor or a funeral.

It is important to understand that one of BB&T’s top priorities is to buy other banks and they can only do this by maintaining their clean, solid image and reputation. This makes it difficult to help some clients. Approvals are needed for many things. The banks values are amazing and encouraging however, there is almost a fear-based culture that could make you nervous that you may do something wrong.

BB&T does like a consistent feel throughout the Footprint so you can walk into a bank in Florida or one in Tennessee and feel like you got the same high quality service.

BB&T also requires there workers to take a 5 day vacation at some point throughout the year.

If you are caught saying anything against the company or the way upper management handles things you are sure to be terminated. Incentives are now being taken away from the branch bankers to ""decrease pressure of sales goals"" but it's really just a way to save the company some money.  The company does anything they can to save money really, including NEVER paying overtime to employees unless the situation is DIRE. I have known employees to straight up lie on their hours to not include any extra time just so they wouldn't get in trouble with management.  The branch manager I had was often very strict and somewhat emotionally abusive to a lot of his staff, particularly his female staff. I've witnessed him making at least 3 employees leave his office crying.  We worked on the retail side and the branch bankers are made to feel incredibly guilty if they don't reach their numbers. I myself was fired halfway through my pregnancy, a few short months before I could take maternity leave, because a corporate investigator dug up some old private conversations I had with another employee about our personal opinions and disagreements with the company. Very ""big-brother"" like. They also make you memorize a brain washing sales pitch called the BB&T ""value promise,"" which is an unnecessarily long speech about the history of the bank, our vision and mission, the products we offer and why we chose to work for this GREAT COMPANY! if we don't use this value promise to EVERY client that walks in then we obviously don't care about the bank or our clients. It's all big corporate brain washing, but I suppose many large financial institutions are the same."

You have to stay in your position for 18 months before you can apply for other internal jobs. The job training is also minimal, you will have to learn as you go."

1261,,Very unprofessional,2016-09-03,1.0,Collections Representative,The pay is nice. Most of the people seem to be very friendly.,"Training is very questionable. I went through a temp agency & was excited to get such a ""great opportunity"". I was put with a team leader who was, for the most part unhappy to have the responsibility of training me. That was nerve-wrecking for me! She would stop mid-training to go do other things. I spent about 6 days learning to navigate the system that took 4 days for me to gain complete individual access. Then, I spent half the day on the phone for the first time with my trainer on a splitter. By lunch 12pm, someone called her into a meeting. When I came back from lunch she came & sat with me again for less than than an hour & disappeared again. At this point I'm more nervous than when I began because my training wasn't at all consistent. Later she dumped me on someone else. The following day, this trainer gave me 5 worksheets to work on while she did work on her own system. By lunch, I got a call from the temp agency telling me they feel I'm ""not comfortable'! I've NEVER been in any company that decides to end a contract after 1 attempt at training with trainee taking calls. Then nobody Sheffield to inform why I was being sent home. 
Nobody actually even spoke to me to inform me what needed to be done to get better with my calls since I'm new. Lastly, as I'm getting my things together & saying bye to my cube neighbor who was very nice to me, a really mean lady comes up to me & says ""you have to leave!"" & even rode me down in the elevator to make sure. This lady is the work buddy of my trainer, they go on all they're breaks together & both seem like the meanest people in the building. This was a HORRIBLE experience! No money is worth being treated like this! I felt they just needed some ridiculous reason to get my trainer out of doing her job. Then I felt ganged up on & bullied!"

They provided a good severance package and outplacement assistance.,"BB&T is very functionally driven.  Often employees in different functions asked for the same data and in other cases they were not on the same page.  In addition, most of their staff was task focused and often didn't consider their impact beyond their line of sight.

You'll become more detail-oriented***
You'll realize that you probably want to work somewhere else :)","1. Politics. Too much politics. You will not be promoted unless you join the politics. I've witnessed too many people promoted on politics and not merit. Also, someone who has no idea what they are doing will be promoted ahead as your Team Lead beause their cousin works at the bank :)

2. Robotic. The more robotic you are, the better. This department expects you to not spend time networking around people who are 3+ years ahead of you, but rather, you should be at your desk 24/7 adding to the production line. 

3. sCraps. This division gives you no foods, drinks, or any HR-coordinated events. Instead, they will give you more work and expect you to smile and ask for you. If you ask why we don't network or have more than a half day for community service, the answer is production! Even if the que is at 0 for the department of 100+ people, they will make you stay at work and want you to ""act busy"" for no reason. Makes no sense to me.

4. Failed leadership. This company preaches about leadership but you'll notice there isn't a single leader here. You probably won't respect your team leads after several months because (1) you know more than they do and (2) you get tired of being treated as a child. Your team leads will also remind you that they are ""watching you"" constantly, like children. Leadership is not promoted on merit but promoted on politics. You'll notice that you have a better quality and production than your peers but one of them will be selected ahead of you, not because of your attitude, but because they spent more time brown-nosing around. You'll notice the average team lead doesn't meet the department's requirements of production and quality but you'll notice they are promoted because of family and friends. Promoted based off networks, which they make sure you do not have a chance to network around! 

5. Budget. The imaginary budget. Management will always talk about how we have no budget but you'll notice that they take weekly team-lead lunches that are all paid for, includes appetizers, main course and desert. No wonder we have no budget. Then when it comes to promotions in a department of 120+, we don't have enough budget to recognize our associates? And don't get caught replacing the printer paper, you may realize we don't have a budget!!!***

6. Lies. During the interview BB&T will say your here for 10-18 months, flat out LIE. Our top analysts are stuck here 2-3 years because the bank will not allow you to apply to more than 2 jobs at a time. Ridiculous, I know. And then you probably won't get these jobs because someone else who knew someone else got the job you were applying for. I've applied for 8 positions, declined on all because someone else knew somebody. And I thought attitude, production, and holding 100% Quality was important?  sCrap!

7. I could go on, and trust me, this list can drag, but I'd like you to join the team and add to my current list. I honestly need to find a new job lol. This year we've never had so many of our top analysts happily leave the department. One guy was promoted to CA II and he left the next week, which is the best note to leave on. We keep losing strong analysts and replacing them with weaker analysts. Wonder why you can't retain your talent??"

Appears BB&T is headed down the road where banks went in the great crash back in 2007 and 2008.  Managers push and push the employees, but do not jump in to help the employees out by helping to underwrite, clear loan conditions.

-Constantly having to deal with AOO's breathing down your neck giving you audit exceptions or giving you a hard time for not have part of a log or sheet of paper filled out with the right wording that they feel is fit. While knowing full well, that you're doing the job of 3 people, and don't have tons of time to sit out and fill out 4 different logs for one thing. 

-Total disconnect with upper management, they will require you to be on multiple conference calls every week that you really have no need to be on, while at the same time you have to leave you're staffing out to dry because you have to be stuck in a room on the call and can't help any clients. They will also change goals, strategy, and focus about every two weeks, which makes it nearly impossible to every see a strategy all the way through.

-They constantly preach doing what is best for the client, this is not true at all. They're a big bank folks, they're here to make money. Those who get promoted are the ones that sell the most products and bring in the most revenue, once I realized this it made my job a lot easier and allowed me to perform better. Get them to sign on the dotted line, then on to the next one, once you can no longer sell them products they are no longer of use to you. This is real churn and burn banking.

-They will not pay you a decent wage until you have really proven that you are worth losing, I was under paid the majority of the almost 3 years I was there.

The incentive program is a joke. If you don't meet a certain dollar amount then you don't get any of the money you worked for. Everyone is a number and this company is becoming greedy.

Insane levels of management.  Absolutely no consistency in operations. Everyone does it different.  AOo's do their best, but once they leave, seasoned employees go right back to the way they want to do it.  Or don't do it at all.  

The level of favoritism and nepotism is off the charts.  It's truly a good ole girls network.  When a problem appears it's always your fault never the manager.  Zero accountability.

- Your not stuck in the branch because you get to get out and develop business
- I left BB&T for a community bank and now regret it. Yes I was stressed but there was more opportunity at BB&T
- If you want a career as a branch manager then this is the place to be. Some branch managers make six figures. You will have to produce well though
- When I worked here I thought the branch support was horrible, now that I work at a smaller community bank I now know that BB&T has a great branch support system.","- If you work in the branch and plan to eventually go to the commercial side...Good Luck! I've seen it done but its very very hard to do if you have no commercial experience. 
- the annual bonus is not as good as other banks quarterly bonuses
- huge stress if you are underperforming. most of my branches were good but one of them I got had a lot of issues. It took me awhile to get it back in shape and the stress was crazy. The weekly conference calls were no fun because of the lack of sales.
- as with most banks and probably even most companies.....getting in good with the right people can get you promoted fast. It wasn't always about the sales.
- You can have a great year and think you will get your annual bonus and then BOOM!!! The bank decides to charge-off a bunch of your accounts before the new year and your matrix points fall below the minimum and you have NO bonus at all. We are talking about $5,000 or more dollars GONE in a snap!!"

Salaries tend to be slightly below market, but the benefit package will overcome some of that.","Tremendously different culture than that of 10-15 years ago.  The bank's growth to a top-10 institution has created a bit of an unwieldy animal.  Most roles now have multiple layers of middle management above them, which has started to dissolve what used to be one of the company's strengths - the transparency in decision-making, strategy, and outlook from senior leadership.  This is likely not a conscious decision of mgmt., but, rather, the unfortunate byproduct of a transition from a mid-size regional ""community"" bank to a top-10 SIFI firm.  However, as mgmt. continues to preach employee engagement, but, the further you get from Winston-Salem, the harder it is to see that engagement, it begins to sound disingenuous."

Certainly, don't believe the open door policy of management or that they will  help you resolve any issues. As a top-performing employee (the only one to get a bonus several years in a row) who brought an employee conflict to management's attention (the person had taken credit for my work, and also created a hostile environment), I was told that although I'd gone above and beyond, the fact that I would have asked for help resolving this situation (there were actually quite a few of them, it is a dog-eat-dog world there) meant that I got no salary increase whatsoever. I was flabbergasted, to say the least. Things went downhill from there. This company's horrible (and often uneducated) senior management caused several good usability engineers to flee as soon as the economy picked up. I tried to stick it out, but it was causing health issues including all-over body pain and migraines. I've worked in difficult environments before, but this one is particularly inhospitable.

All but one of the Executive Management team members have been with BB&T for at least 10 years, and most of them have been there for more than 20 years. I think promoting to this level from within keeps the company culture and direction consistent and avoids ""flavor of the week"" strategies.","Sometimes people in entry-level positions like Tellers don't get much recognition or many rewards, especially given the pressure they're under to make sales goals and given that they may be the only employees the general public sees. Also, when you move down the chain from Executive Management there are some unprofessional managers in the mix who will do or say anything to get ahead.

The average tenure here is over 15 years, and I can see why.  Good culture.","In an effort to hire more millenials, the company sometimes looks more at degree than skill.  Salaries lag the rest of the industry, but we're improving.  The aversion to telecommute is a little strange given that most of the industry offers some type of flexible schedule or location.

1680,,Great company working to respond to a changing regulatory and competitive environment,2015-03-16,5.0,Branch Banker III,"-BB&T has a great culture and history of taking care of its associates. Your benefits will be good, you will not be expected to work any hours unpaid(if not exempt), and you will be treated like an individual with the ability to make intelligent decisions. In retail banking, this is not necessarily true of many large financial institutions. 
-Ample training - I received five weeks training before beginning to see clients and ongoing training after that
- Values - BB&T is a company that actually cares about its clients. The first time I discussed a fee refund with my manager, he literally word for word asked me what I thought ""Was right for the client and right for the bank"". BB&T is a for profit business focused on shareholder returns, but from executive leadership on down BB&T believes that    its focus in the market is helping its clients to be successful. You won't have to deal with shady consumer finance practices like retroactive interest, hidden fees, or the other sort of crazy stuff some other financial institutions do. BB&T's product offerings, while not always the cheapest, are not meant to be abusive or deceptive.
- Room for growth - BB&T is large and diverse with many different areas(retail banking, commercial lending, insurance services, private banking, etc) to grow into. Starting your career at BB&T provides lots of opportunities to grow both upward and to transition laterally if you realize a better fit exists","- Market Environment - BB&T is working hard to cut costs to provide competitive returns to its shareholders. This means staffing is lighter than most associates are used to and the bank has been repeatedly reorganized to promote efficiency. This is hard on the associates, but hopefully will translate to shareholder value and a more relaxed expense focus longer term
- Large Institution - I still happy bank with BB&T after leaving, and am exceedingly happy. However, while a larger financial institution has more width and depth of services, it is still not a small bank. Even with a customer service focus, there is less local decision making than at a small local bank with only a few dozen branches. 
- Conservative - BB&T is conservative, and very risk averse. While BB&T is currently extremely well positioned in its retail lending from a competitive standpoint, there will be deals you run into where we cannot lend because BB&T is simply to risk averse. Similarly, we will not charge prices that are likely to create long term losses on other services/products to generate short term revenue. This is great for the overall company, but may make it hard to compete with other banks willing to be more risky and short sighted."
1681,,Corrupt politics at mid-level management lead company,2015-03-15,1.0,Anonymous,Good learning experience; compensated well for not doing that much; hours not bad; slow pace,failure-fearing culture; hard word is not recognized; decisions are made based on politics; employees try to point out others' mistakes

Numerous career paths for ambitious, hard-working, innovative people.","consensus driven organization, decisions can take more time.

1683,,High pay - highly demanding,2015-03-06,3.0,Branch Banker,"The pay was great  and the benefits were nice. The place had great culture, rotating around the perfect client experience.","old system, constant system errors, outdated technology, cheap, pushy in credit card sales, and way too much drama for a bank. It's not an ideal work environment, and the system is extremely sensitive and error prone. Plus, they cross train their employees and set quota's that are IMPOSSIBLE to reach. The company has a great culture and atmosphere, but without updating to the current era (their system is 30 years old), they will fail."
1684,,"Not like it used to be, not good place",2015-02-24,2.0,Teler Supervisor,"The pros include that part-time gets benefits if work at least 20 hours/week. The pay range is about the same as other banks. There are still employees there that care about their work, the clients, and the success of the bank.","The upper management don't care about the branch personnel. They say things like ""if you don't like your job, there are plenty of people that are waiting for it"". And ""it's not all about you, You should wake up in the mornings thinking about your clients not yourself"". There is no possibility for advancement unless upper management wants you to move, otherwise you are stuck. AND they now base salary increases on 'team production' not personal input... so whether you are a high achiever or a low do-nothing.... you depend on the branch success to get the same percent raise as the next guy (or not), so it doesn't pay off to work hard or care about your job."

Alabama does not have many opportunities to grow within the company. It is all about who you know and how bad you suck up to them. This company prides themselves on being ""empathic, reliable, responsive and competent."" In reality, the associates are unable to provide these attributes to clients because BB&T has cut the branch staff to the bare minimum. The ""upper management"" within the state is so far removed from the branch, they do not understand the daily demands. It is CLEAR that BB&T thinks ""everyone is replaceable"" and in that is simply not the case. I have seen some AMAZING, high-producing co-workers leave. The mistreatment of employees is so rough, that clients are starting to notice. They are leaving in droves. It is also not just the ""front-line"" associates who are unhappy. After calling the back office many, many times, you make friends. You hear about their stories and the misery they are soaking in. Observation proves most people are either: 1) close to retirement and trying to stay positive or 2) actively seeking a new job. BB&T has proven time-after-time to be a selfish bank. When you walk into YOUR personal bank, do you see 3 or fewer people (during your 5-8 minute wait) and they consider it ""fully-staffed?"""

The bank also pays reasonably well, and the sales incentives are attainable at the branch level.

The healthcare and retirement benefits are significantly better than those offered by competing institutions.

This bank is certainly making money and has an extremely loyal following among small businesses due to low employee turnover.  Since there is low turn-over, there is a sense of teamwork/camaraderie that is hard to create in banking.","While the sales incentives are pretty attainable, the sales pressure is significant, though you will get that in any banking role.  

My biggest pet peeve is the growing feeling that ""something is up"" with our branch model, and that information is being withheld from branch staff about upcoming changes.  It is difficult to be motivated when your personal trajectory is unclear.

1740,,You want the truth?  Here's the truth for the Retail Banking Division.,2014-11-13,3.0,Relationship Banker II,"BB&T takes pride in training.   I would say they have one of the BEST training programs in town.

Benefits/Compensation (Total Package) is on par with what you expect in the Washington DC Metropolitan area.","BB&T's Leadership is way out of touch with the current situation of retail banking. With the aid of technology (e.g., mobile banking), consumers do not have the need to come into the branches as much; however the goals remain extremely high - almost unachievable.  Tactics used to reach your individual goals is questionable at best.

The retail branch is run by Branch Bankers (formerly known as Relationship Bankers).  Your Market Leader (Branch Manager) is focused on loans and building the business pipeline.  However,  in most branches your Market Leader will say it's up to the Branch Banker to ensure they have Planed Purposeful Call (PPCs) on their calendar. So, in essence you have to build your individual pipeline as well as your Market Leader pipeline. 

BB&T provides wonderful sales tools (e.g., Hoovers), but in most cases it will not turn into sale opportunities.  They also provide you internal list, but nothing to promising comes from the leads.

Your best bet of survival at this bank is to go into an ideal branch where everyone works together (this includes Market Leaders), work at a busy branch, or adopt some questionable sales tactics. 

In sum, if you're seeking a Branch Banker position,  you have to have your sales game on par. They [BB&T] will tell you they are here for the consumer,  but really it what's in it for them.  If you are about building a meaningful relationship with your customer-THIS IS NOT THE PLACE FOR YOU!!

SPECIAL NOTE:  If you don't hit goals, be prepared for the boot.  This is the message that was delivered to employees a week ago by senior leadership:  ""We got help them to the door as fast as possible""

Pay for mid-to-high-level positions is somewhat competitive, though not enough to compensate for sub-par job location in many instances. Opportunities for growth abound, both within departments and inter-departmentally. Annual reviews are thorough (sometimes to a fault). Promotions are, for the most part, based on skills and performance. Training and experience gained at BB&T are easily transferable to other financial institutions.","Corporate headquarters are in Winston-Salem, so the company loses many qualified high performers due to desired relocation. There is obvious and pervasive promotional preference given to graduates of the highly-valued (internally, at least) Leadership Development Program. The Company constantly creates new positions based on particular projects, which are often ambiguous and poorly defined. Freedom of thought is stifled, and team members who question processes or management are often stifled in their career growth (rather than commended for thinking outside the ""BB&T Box"").

Meanwhile the busy bees have to handle the upset clients and then the guys upstairs wonder why we don't hit our numbers. Everyone has been frustrated and many people I've heard had given their notice when all this madness started. Each branch needs to bring in more with less. Also, their software needs a complete update! It takes so long to process a transaction and we waste so much paper. We don't even have pinpads to swipe a card. Also, I have not seen a large national bank who needed their customers to write a check in order to withdraw cash. I found that very backwards and outdated.

I struggled with the decision even though working for BB&T was so stressful, it was affecting my health, my sleep and quality of life. I am not one to give up easily because I put my heart and soul into my job. The beginning of the end for me was when I received an email from my Regional Manager regarding a ""call night"" that I volunteered for my branch because we were behind on our credit card goals. When I sent in the results of those calls to my Regional Manager, I received an email back in capital letters with many exclamation marks stating the results were completely unacceptable.  He stated that if I and my team and make ""x"" amount of calls we should have made ""X"" amount of contacts that should have resulted in ""X"" amount of sales.  So now I have to control  who answers the phone at night or is even home!  Unbelievable! He said nothing about appreciating our efforts and that we were doing all we could (and then some) to try to reach our goals.  This is the type of unappreciative management that BB&T has. In my area, employees are leaving in droves because of the direction BB&T is going with the bank.  What happened to this bank? What happened to Kelly King?  Over the years, one of the things that I heard over and over when something unethical would happen is ""that is not the BB&T way"".  Well, the BB&T way now is this - employees are just a number, they don't care about their employees at all and they don't care about their customers either.  Because if any of you reading this are customers of BB&T, the only thing they want from you is a ""sale"".  And if the employee waiting on you doesn't produce one, they will be looking for another job.  Leaving BBT was the best decision I ever made."

Changes at both branch and corporate levels, making it a bit more stressful, to a point of worry about job security. Past six months have lead to a few layoffs, short staffing which leads to longer wait times and more frustrated clients and no end on sight especially with hiring freeze. Other than that, usual cons especially being part time like having to float to other branches, a few monotonous moments, software and hardware seems a bit dated, but this comes with the territory and job title, if you couldn't handle those simple problems, I'm not sure you could do the job."

I became part of BB&T in a merger and was immediately pleased and loved the company I worked for. All associates and managers were nice and super supportive. The past year - year and a half... morale is TERRIBLE! This is probably due to enormous layoffs in 2013 and 2014. Unfortunately now if you are an employee or client of BB&T, you are only a number. No appreciation shown for consistently being a top performer. I don't know what went wrong other than maybe John Allison retiring. BB&T is banking BIG BUCKS- why jeopardize your reputation of ""PCE"" to your clients? I have never seen a bank with so little employees inside. Clients do not like it and frankly- it's NOT SAFE."

That can be a problem for new hires because they come in over joyed to be employed by BB&T and after 3-6 months of dealing with bitter employees they are on other websites clicking on ""careers"", poor morale, they don't understand that HAPPY employees play a HUGE part in ""THE PERFECT CLIENT EXPERIENCE"" 
There is an employee merit program called

Once my boss got promoted, that's it -- they would have to leave before another opp for advancement came open. (We were a pretty specialized team.) So, it was out-to-go-up for me. I think Senior Management (outside of our building), and some of the product managers as well, had no idea what we did on a day-to-day, or how specialized/difficult it was.

The good banks get lumped in with the bad. BB&T will often over-compensate to protect profitability and brand.

The company had so much potential back in 2005 when I first started.  They made you think your actions were for the client, for the established relationship, and for everyone's well being.  Over the past years, they have bought out other banks to keep pace with the bigger banks.  It is producing a negative effect.  We use to have stock options, appreciation weeks, and an overall feeling of gratitude from management.","BB&T is turning into the ""bigger, badder bank.""  Constant restructuring of employees, budget cuts, manic hiring sprees and then freezes, and pressure for high sales had made this place a dreadful place to work.  I use to love my job.  Now it's turning into a daily threat of job security, while the middle of the pack works to support management, and the workload is not returned.  They spend money on a worthless ""video game"" and then cut the budget so tight we can't even buy candy in the branch for the clients.  There is no room to advance except for branch management.  They hire IRM partners from external sources instead of training their own and then expect those same partners to have the values that get drilled into the existing staff day after day.  So the people that stay and want to move up in the company don't have anywhere to go.

1886,,Growing and enjoying it,2014-04-08,5.0,Portfolio Risk Officer,"Monthly coaching sessions, available middle management, ability to provide process improvement ideas. 
BB&T provides below average pay when looking at salary relative to the position that you have. However, the company compensates for this by readily offering leadership opportunities, training, promotions and challenging work opportunities if the employee is engaged. The company readily promotes talent from within. To me, this is far more valuable long term than an extra $10K a year. Besides the career potential, the leadership opportunities provide ways to grow and be challenged. In my 5 years at the bank, I've been promoted once and have had numerous leadership opportunities.  


Leadership training for managers makes it more likely that your manager/team leader will have a basic understanding of personality dynamics and basic level of empathy. Employees have agency and autonomy--the ability, skills and authority to make decisions about their work. In most situations, management and coworkers treat each other as adults and with respect. Taking sick time or going to a doctor appointment have never been an issue. Neither is asking for help when workloads are obscene (help might not be available, but there is no stigma around asking). The work week of 40-50 hrs creates good work/life balance. After 2 years, vacation days were 15+your birthday off + 10 bank holidays.The company is transparent in its values and policies. Generally, co-workers are nice and competent. Most people are engaged in their work and many are loyalty. The bank has never performed mass layoffs when the stock is under-performing. It has laid off chunks of employees if their jobs become obsolete and they don't have the skills to move into another role. All of this together creates an almost work-family like feel.

6% 401k match with really low Vanguard expense fund options. BB&T tiers employee's health insurance costs by health level and the health insurance is generous for coverage. 

HR department: competent from my limited experience.","There are major process inefficiencies, which many find frustrating. Way below market pay--pay for tenure vs. top performance. The company is really cheap when it comes to little things that make the work day pleasant and would show care, like providing coffee or water. 

The co-workers that are not competent (below average, always having a bit of trouble, not able to complete tasks on time and by others standards) are not fired. One would have to seriously underperform or be downright disruptive to be fired.

Over the past 2 years, the bank has attempted to flatten the management system, consolidating senior executive positions and regions. There is less room to grow in seniority later in one's career, making the proverbial corner office not likely to be attained."

The only reason I left is that I relocated to another state and was denied a transfer because the work that I do in higher tier IT prevented me from transferring with the company due to the data center locations. This of course was very shady because 100% of my job was done remotely from my desk and I did not need to visit any data centers since we had a team that worked at all data center locations. I was actually actively looking before I moved to another state beacuse of a POOR manager that slipped through the cracks of the hiring process. This manager was not liked across the board by many long tenured employees and it bothered me that so many of us found his blatantly obvious lack of management skills lacking while upper management was either blind to it or did not care. Some poor ""mangers"" somehow are hired for very high profile positions and are able to find a way to avoid upper management from noticing their lack of management skills. My first 6yrs there I had an amazing boss and would NEVER had considered leaving if he did not transfer to another department.

There's a tendency to denigrate the competition without studying them for best practices.  Facilities project a poor image to clients and associates.

I always felt respected and supported from within the organization.","The pressure of the banking industry affects all banks, especially large banks like BB&T. There are expected layoffs looming and some departments including commercial banking are feeling the squeeze. Work life balance in commercial and private banking can be very difficult, especially if you are seen as a top performer. Outside pressure causes the bank to be extremely cautious, which makes change slow and work hours inflexible."

The benefits are very good.  The hours are great, and the working environment is very good.","The lower level management structure is not good.  Retail managers act in a manner consistent with call center managers.  Rewards are ""dangled"" to motivate staff with not much hope of achieving goals.  Coaching sessions are more like inquiry or interrogations.   The title of manager should lend to the assumption that the individual holding the title has the ability to effectively manage a staff.  Unfortunately that is not the case.  The branch manager, or FCL, (in my experience) does not typically have the ability to handle pressure or stress appropriately.  Thusly, the staff bears the weight.  Not good at all."

2012,,Used to be a good culture that changed,2013-04-30,3.0,Investment Counselor,BB&T is one of the few financial institutions that has weathered the financial crisis relatively unscathed.  They have great stability and leadership at the top who understand the banking industry.  A pension as well as generous 401-k are great perks of working there.  I believe they are fair to the customers in most situations.  You can feel good about your job knowing that you have helped someone in some aspect of their financial life.  Most major initiatives I can see the logic in from a competitive standpoint.,Over an eleven year tenure I could see that BBT always followed the footsteps of its rivals.  Wells (formerly Wachovia) and B of A would implement a major initiative BBT would evaluate and typically follow suit.  This is necessary from a competitive standpoint but doesn't make for the best work environment due to increased emphasis on the bottom-line with a decreased emphasis on quality of life.  Branch staff is usually overworked and underpaid.  It used to be banking was a relationship oriented business.  Not anymore.  Transactional in nature.  My particular experience is that after an 9 years as a top performer in various positions I was let go after I took a territory that was new and had no potential.  My manager didn't spend much time helping me and I would almost say didn't give a rip.  I was hired by his predecessor and I think he wanted to fill the position with someone more like him.  I expressed an interest in a transfer within the company but he wasn't willing to sign off.  If you are an investment counselor they treat you as a contract employee.  In retail positions they will typically work with you to help you out.  Graduates of their management program are almost untouchable as far as reductions.  I've seen many less than stellar talent get promoted over other more qualified individuals.  Most non-branch/non-production positions are in Winston with some in Wilson.  In addition banking isn't really a growth area now and probably won't be for quite some time.  If you're in a branch you better be comfortable on the phone.  People just don't come in to do banking anymore but you still have to drive revenue.

If one manager does something unethical their management backs them 100%.  Leaving the little guys to fend for themselves.  Human Resources is a joke.  You report something being done to you and they help cover the unethical manager and come up with a plan to get you fired for reporting the incident.  Rarely have coverage when an employee is out sick you can count  on not having a lunch if you have overtime they will find a way to send you home or make you take a 2 hour lunch some other day.

Most people do what they need to do, and still embody the fact that the client is number one.  Senior management from NC is very committed to Texas. Lots of growth opportunities, and additionally people who are client facing still ""own"" the relationship and it garners a lot of respect from clients.  Also, for the commercial side, the segment ranges of deal size are very wide and thus you are not limited to certain sized deals.

Retail side has lots of fantastic people throughout the branches, and are second to none.","Middle management doesn't actively keep in tune with what their reports are doing, experiencing, or hold people accountable.  Justice is one of the key values of BB&T, and it seems as though often the wrong people get promotions because of political pulls in certain regions and top producers are do not receive incentives commensurate with their production.  It seems there is a large degree of cronyism in parts of the commercial bank because of tenure or relationship, and promotions are not always justified by actual production or behaviors congrument with long-term focused efforts.

Senior regional management seems to think that coaching to cross-selling report cards is an acceptable form of management, and has generally triumphed successful cross-selling more than closed aspects of revenue. Additionally, management does not hold under-performers accountable relative to their job grade, and inversely does not give enough appreciation to employees who go above and beyond the expectations. 

Leadership Development Program graduates seem to be getting most of the opportunities in taking management or commercial entry level jobs.

As long as you are close to hitting your goals your superiors will leave you alone. They have decent training for lenders on how credit works. Still one of the last big banks to give lenders loan authority.,Way behind the curve in technology which is very frustrating. Communication between leadership and the branches is nonexistent. The leadership has closed ears and do not listen to anyone that questions the why or how things are done.  Everyone is made to give  the same canned speech to clients and prospects...its embarrassing and clients will call you out on it.

2068,,Avoid this Dead End Job at all costs.,2012-09-26,1.0,Sales Finance Collections,Steady paycheck. Free Parking and close to a intersection to avoid rush hour traffic.,"The department is run under a dictatorship by a snotty nose dictator at which all management is overstaffed while the rest of the department is understaffed. The ole saying ""to many Chiefs and not enough Indians"" applies directly to this department. The Management is in a clique at which they do as much as they can to demote and kill morale in the department so they can to avoid promotions or raises for any of the employees in the department. The department is highly Micro Managed which is the big downfall of the job. It has caused a HIGH turnover rate which seems to make management very happy. In the past few years they have not replaced any of the many that have left and just added extra overtime and more work to save the department money which many feel that the site may eventually be closed due to many departments in the building being shut down. Morale is very low and every employee does minimal to get by. In this position a employee can NOT work independently without a supervisor breathing down their backs which has caused a large portion of the department to go on FMLA for bogus medical excuses to get through the agony of the job at which they can show up to work whenever they want. When hired in the position I was told that 6 months are evening shifts and 6 months are day shifts. Which was a complete LIE. Overtime is mandatory each week so when working the so called day shift it then becomes evening shift as well. And mandatory to stay late each evening. Many employees complain that they are being worked to death and yet management could care less. In this department if you give advice on how to improve the job or help productivity you are shunned upon as for they are always right and you are wrong. There is also no room for advancement in the department and when applying for a another department all requests are always denied. I personally have worked here for a few years and am considered a top performer and only receive a 1% raise each year with no promotions or any hope for advancement and always being shot down for any advancement in the company. It appears BB&t prefers to promote from outside the company than inside. To sum it up avoid this job at all costs unless you are totally desperate for work and have no where else to work."

You can't really win....if you disagree with an idea you are branded as difficult, if you agree out of fear and it goes wrong, like you know it will, then you are at fault. The manager is never at fault. Promotions are based on the good old boy program. If you aren't part of the right crowd your career is doomed. Performance is not important, you can do really great things, but if you don't go fishing and golfing with management you will get no recognition....that is where most decisions are made. Massive amounts of micro-management by staff that do not even grasp the technical aspects of the staff they manage. The obvious talent is leaving the company in droves and staff is being replaced by contractors from India. HR protects management but will not offer any support to staff while harrassment and intimidation is rampant.

During my training a woman from HR came and spoke with us, stating that our location has had problems with that kind of thing before and it would not be tolerated. BB&T also claims to have whistleblower protection but that means nothing! I was treated very badly by management after reporting hugely offensive comments that were allowed to be made and joked about. This is a competitive, female-dominated workplace and its extremely hostile -- not worth the salary whatsoever!

Very slim on staff. They will work you to the bone...with NO overtime. Instead of one day off a week when working 6 days a week, you might come in at 9 and leave at 11...complete waste of time!"
2096,,Run the other way,2012-05-30,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"Decent benefits, good health Insurance",Good Ol Boy network.....enough said.
2097,,Great Company to work for,2012-05-20,5.0,,"Very good benefit package, thorough training, lots of incentives, great enviornment. Very comfortable workplace, value oriented company make sure employees convey the values the company is based on.","Supervisors and Team Leads show favortism, this is not reflective of the company but rather the people that the company promote to these positions."
2098,,BB&T has great values and an awesome mission... but they don't live by it... actions speak louder than words,2012-05-16,2.0,,"- Benefits (pension and 401k)
- Great HR department","- Annual Performance plans 2% raise if a Very Good Performer?  PATHETIC
- Very low pay compared to other places
- Terrible management
- Managers are worked to death- averaged 12 hour days and worked Saturdays
- Conference calls- how about work smarter, not harder?  If you want sales performance, dont tie your employees up on a conference call that is pointless
- No recognition
- Managers who get recognized work in branches where everything gets handed to them
- Dont work for the retail side
- Senior management is selfish and wont promote you to a job you want if they want you to stay where you are.
- Some how confidential conversations go public and all of the employees find out
- managements lack of professionalism is hidden in the professional dress they want their employees to wear (panty hose?  Seriously?... its 90 degrees outside)... 
- Overall..... they need new management- its important for employees to see that you care about your family as much as you care about your job...."
2099,,"Great benefit, great dream of bonus, but horrible at recognizing issues",2012-04-11,2.0,FCL III,The benefits are expensive but expansive.  Many different options when it comes to retirement planning and insurance. Also competitive business products.,"If you don't mind working 6 days a week and 13 hour work days, please apply to this company. I used to work for this company and it was difficult to even have a home life outside of BB&T. They were not concerned about anything but the bottom line, with unattainable goals and ridiculous incentive plan. When I started I was intrigued by the rigorous training program and the opportunity to earn half my salary in bonuses. Well that was all I got, training and a dream. Brainwashed to learn the culture and expected to live it in my everyday life. Basically live for BB&T. So if you choose them, don't fall for the dreams they sell."
2100,,OK,2012-04-11,4.0,Relationship Banker,"The benefits are wonderful, and of course working 8:30-5:15 was amazing.  BB&T really is a great company, and they promote women really well on the retail side.  If you are a great performer you will make great incentives and they definitely notice.","VERY male dominated.  Anyone with a salary about 50000 is a male.  Also BB&T pays horribly, I recently started with another bank making 10k more.  Also being a RB doesn't provide much opportunity for advancement in other banks because you won't have any credit experience."
2101,,"Good place to work, low recognition from management",2012-04-04,4.0,Mortgage Loan Officer,"Good company to work for
Good benefits for a bank
Good co workers
Work / Life balance
Product base is competitive","Company always expects more, never satisfied with your hard work.  
Management does not recognize accomplishments.
Corporate training is ineffective"
2102,,not a fit if that is what you are 'seeking',2012-04-04,1.0,Engineer,"perhaps their overall compensation benefits...but it's a lie and joke to say the pay is 'competitive', if you negotiate a 'good' salary, you 'may' be fine, but trying to really go up professionally, or 'relying' on those 'annual raises' ...you will be waiting 10-20 years before you see that 'bump' in compensation","you never 'catch up' with pay, when problems arise, it's more of a 'who to blame, what to blame, rather than what was the problem, or really finding out the root cause of the problem, it's a major - COVER YOUR OWN @$$ environment, see and hear backtracking, saying one thing one moment and something else the next minute..."
2103,,Not the great place it use to be to work,2012-04-03,3.0,,BB&T provides excellent benefits.  The company is in a relatively strong financial position and growing.,"With the growth that has occurred lately, the client center focus that BB&T has been known for is now second to earnings and goals.  It is starting to feel very similar to many of the big banks.  The culture is changing from the top down."
2104,,Challening,2012-03-31,4.0,Relationship Banker,BB&T offers great benefits. We still have a penison and 401k match.,Sometimes the goals seem a little too difficult.
2105,,"OK pay, good management, decent products",2012-03-26,4.0,Mortgage Loan Officer,"Competent management
Consistent product offerings, never to conservative or crazy
Good environment","Pay structure
Amount of paperwork required for producing loan officers"
2106,,If you are looking into retail banking turn the other direction and run.,2012-03-23,2.0,Financial Center Leader I,"Good public perception, strong capital levels, 6% 401k match, pension.","POOR technology base.
Relatively low salary and 2% or less annual increases (if you get one at all).
Branch managers and their employees are brainwashed and cannot successfully complete work load.
Service mentality has become overrun with sales first, sales second, service third.
Unrealistic goals.
Incredibly confusing goal structure, even the creators do not know what's going on most of the time.
Upper-level management suffers from a huge disconnect.
With record profits, many of us wonder where all the profits go to, it sure doesn't to go salaries of the front line employees.
Retail managers are annually reviewed/promoted by regional managers that visit branches maybe 8 times or less a year.
I work 50++ hours a week for a salary that is at least 20k lower than the average competitor."
2107,,Good company to work for bad managers,2012-03-23,3.0,AML Analyst,A few reasons are good benefits and stability.,No advancement opportunities.  Managers have no interest in improving overall efficiency because they fear loosing their jobs! They have been there for 20+ years and are very resistant to innovation.
2108,,"If you're looking for growth, look elsewhere...",2012-03-08,3.0,,Insurance and 401k benefits are great.,"No one on one coaching, reviews not received timely.  Growth opportunity is stunted and based on current pay.  Regardless if you further your education, growth will not happen unless you change companies.  Job duties do not translate to usable career skills."
2109,,A great opportunity for anyone who is looking for job security and to work in a place with enjoyable people.,2012-03-06,4.0,Business Loan Administration Credit Analyst I,Laid back working enviroment. Everyone is working together to achieve the same goal. Good benefits that go along with industry. Strong senior management.,"Pay is below the industry average. Employees that have the ""LDP"" crediential are treated at a higher level than ones that don't."
2110,,very sales oriented,2012-03-05,3.0,Senior Teller,great benefits and health driven company,"pushes sales 
no employee promoting with in"
2111,,"BB&T is a strong company, but a bit behind the times.",2012-02-29,3.0,Business Loan Administration Credit Analyst I,It is a strong and stable company which takes care of the health of its employees.,"BB&T believes in ""total compensation"" meaning your salary will not be as great as rival companies but your health and life benefits are stronger than many others.

Technology lags behind some competitors, many of our systems are unable to communicate effectively."
2112,,"Great place to work, but pay is not entirely competitive",2012-02-24,4.0,Private Financial Advisor,"Team environment has to be the best part of working at BB&T, main reason I have stayed as long as I have.
Pension is something few companies now participate in.","Lack of communication in regards to goal.  We did not find out our Sales goals for 2011 until June of that year, and were unaware of how we finished the year until late January of 2012"
2113,,"Fast paced, friendly environment.",2012-02-21,4.0,,"Benefits, beliefs, independent thinking, team work.","Salary, compensation, time to attend school to further educate self, no where to go till someone retires."
2114,,extremely closed with poor communication,2012-02-18,2.0,,"there are some tremendous people employed here, and a strong internal sense of accomplishment. The mid level management team is committed to success and there is a strong training program.",EXTREMELY siloed and very poor communication. John Allison leaving was a severe lost. The  different channels do not function well together and senior management is a good old boys clib
2115,,No regrets with plenty of opportunity to move up in your career.,2012-02-16,4.0,Portfolio Manager,"Work-life balance, good management, values employees.",Systems and processes are slow.
2116,,"I was satisifed, it gave me some beginning experience in my career field.",2012-01-22,4.0,Teller,"Friendly environment, good pay, good experience",Wasn't full time so I didn't have benefits (this should be expected)
2117,,Stable secure job with minimal opportunities,2012-01-13,3.0,,"Secure career with very little layoffs
Comprehensive Benefits Plan, especially medical
Low Pressure environment 
Stability
Consistency
Good work life balance","Base Compensation is low relative to peers
 Outdated Technology especially systems
Too Complacent and satisfied with status quo
Not a visionary company"
2118,,"I love the company and it's mission, but am very frustrated with the compensation.",2012-01-08,3.0,,"Great values with a focus on client service 
Strive for good work/life balance
Stable employment
Excellent Sr Management
Very attainable production goals
Benefits","Fairness of compensation
Taking length of employment under consideration more than production when reviewing candidates for promotion
They don't reward highly productive staff more than average performers when it is time for a raise"
2119,,"It's a learning experience, take the time to get to know your IRM partners and you'll do great",2011-12-29,4.0,Relationship Banker,"They spend a lot of time in helping you develop, if your not comfortable calling clients, they will help you. Incentive for products sold is also nice. You also get recognized when you do something they feel will help other RB's","It's hard to move up if you don't have a degree. Also if you're at a slow branch, you will be making lots of calls to get your sales up. If you have a bad manager, then Godspeed"
