Guess that could be a pro. All their trainings and info sessions were heavily scripted and BBVA employees were always muted on calls.

They expect you to do 5 jobs with the pay of half of 1 job. The CEMs are head tellers, vault managers, sales people, and assistant managers all at the same time. You are expected to work behind the teller line 100% while running the branch operationally and opening loans and checking accounts all at the same time. They push sales worse than any other bank.

104,,This employer won't compensate you for what you're worth.,2021-08-19,1.0,Personal Banker I,"Bankers hours are set and great if you have a family or commitments outside of work.

Holiday's off.

Flexible sick time.","BBVA only ever added things to my plate and list of responsibilities, and I always delivered. I was never adequately compensated for the role I was placed in. I was a go-to employee for many customers. 

Little room for upward mobility, BBVA will always hire from outside, even if it means hiring unqualified staff, usually because they are so poorly staffed they can't spare your leaving your current position for training. Employees often were unprofessional, rude and uncaring and would leave soon after onboarding. 

Pay, BBVA's merit increase did little for me, and didn't even match inflation, even marginally. If you work at the top, you'll be compensate well. They do not compensate their bankers even a living wage. My final paycheck was docked in late August for vacation time used not yet accrued and with 80 hours work, added up to less than $8.00 an hour. My bonus was also withheld. 

Onboarding experience was awful. You were expected to constantly do training on an understaffed bank.

Constant turnover.

No top-cover from COVID policies, if other employees weren't approved to work on site, and at home collecting a check for two weeks... at times there were literally two of us running the entire branch, with not so much as a ""thank you"" from upper management. We were barely able to maintain our own customers, let alone bring in new business for bonus'.

There was no reward for getting to know BBVA's clients and you weren't incentivized to stay. After 3 years of employment I could go make more money wrapping burritos that I was at BBVA."
105,,Great company Sad they got bought out,2021-08-19,3.0,Personal Banker II,"I loved working at BBVA, I was super disappointed that they got bought out by PNC",No work-life balance. Had to put in overtime a lot.

108,,Salary,2021-08-16,5.0,Senior Financial Analyst,good job to work at but move up to management quick,had to be persistent to move up
109,,Bbva,2021-08-14,3.0,Client Experience Manager,When I worked at BBVA we worked as a team even though we were short staffed.,Even if you got promoted at BBVA you still had to deal with the fact that you were going to be short staffed most of the time.

118,,Pros and Cons,2021-07-30,3.0,Client Experience and Operations Manager,"Sufficient vacation time, great compensation with opportunity to make incentive pay, and excellent health insurance, great coworkers. Thorough training. Good opportunities and diversity.","I will start by saying I worked at one branch only. This may not be true for every branch, but it was for mine . You will be a work horse. I had to go through physical therapy for my back because of this job. I also developed plantar's fascitis while working here.. I literally hobbled around and could not walk normally after months and months of being overworked. I left this job due to these health reasons. Prepare to be on your feet all day everyday, running back and forth, and lifting heavy boxes and bags of coin. You will have zero desk time to complete necessary reports for compliance. When there is mandatory training or meetings for this position, you will be denied access to one of many private offices because other people need the offices to make sales calls. Your management and compliance meeting and training is less important. You will have to stay on the teller line and work while attempting to listen to the call. There is too much emphasis on sales goals. From what I understand, this position changed to also include higher sales goals. Your health and well being isn't worth the money. The manager at my branch was a type A tyrant. Many customers were great and understanding, but many more in this particular area would verbally abuse the tellers and myself anytime we wouldn't break policy, lines were too long, etc. Work/life balance was awful because after a day at the branch you don't have the energy to spend time doing anything but resting."

But most of all it was a decently diverse company in Birmingham being that HQ is in Madrid. Their DEI efforts were noticed, so if it’s that’s something that matters to you then this is a great company to work for. With the recent merger I am sure those same efforts will trickle into PNC.

421,,Better opportunity elsewhere,2020-03-11,1.0,Financial Advisor,Great people. Draw is fair regarding pay.,BBVA = Better Buy a Variable Annuity.  Bring advisors on under the false pretenses of a book of business to work and client referrals. The book of business is dead with the money locked up in mostly annuities under surrender. The client referrals only happen sparingly. Problem is competing for the same dollars as bank deposits. Bank managers would rather put the client in a CD.
422,,Run.... don't look back !! Run.....,2020-02-23,1.0,Anonymous Employee,Good Pay.  Good Benefit,"No one team approach.
Manager's miss use their power's. Play FAVORITE.  Sad work environment. Job profile  and Score cards can change anytime and multiple times during a year. If they don't  like you Manager will comb thru thing to get you out. HR is a joke sitting somewhere with no understanding of the department and it's workflow. 
Hostile and unprofessional... no one will listen to you."
423,,"Great Company, systems need work",2020-02-21,4.0,Relationship Manager,"Good base pay plus the opportunity to earn quarterly commissions off of products, mortgages, and investments (if you're licensed).

 The benefit package is great, with 401k match and maternity leave is 12 weeks fully paid. The men also get a paternity leave at 6 weeks fully paid. 

Depending on your grade level, you could start out with 3 weeks vacation, on top of sick time and 10 federal holidays. 

Ability to move up- in 4 years I have doubled my base salary and tripled my commission opportunity.","The systems need some work.  There are so many bugs and tech issues that not one day goes by with everything working seamlessly. For being so ""tech"" forward, that is not a priority at the branch levels."
424,,Ok place to work,2020-02-11,3.0,Consumer Asset Specialist,Paid decent and was able to work independently,Hard to advance even when you have experience
425,,"Great company in some divisions, others have more to be desired.",2020-02-03,5.0,Mortgage Banking Officer,"BBVA is great on the mortgage side.

I honestly wouldn't mind the pressure if they paid better, but when your getting paid so low, but you are expected to bring in business, cross sell, look for new money for deposits, call leads, etc...  It just doesn't make sense.  They really need to re-evaluate and adjust employee salary, for this reason employee turn around is high."
429,,Depends what location,2020-01-18,3.0,Retail Relationship Banker,Nice base salary. BBVA has very competitive products,"Like a lot of other banks, it depends on what location you're located if you can do well. They changed how the portfolio works to the detriment of the position.

431,,Horrible bank,2019-11-26,1.0,Financial Services Representative,"None at all, run from this bank","This bank hates its employees and views it’s customers as cash cows. If you work here you will be expected to sell, sell, sell no matter the cost. The whole culture is about what they can get out of the clients.  HR is out to get any employees who can’t meet the unrealistic sales goals. This bank is becoming the next Wells Fargo sales scandal, watch and see.  It’s just a matter of time before they get sued for deceptive sales practices."

It is a bigger bank that keeps small town values and charm.  Our team is like family! Lots of room to grow and move up in the bank.,"The computer system could use some updating, some of the equipment is a little old, our countertops are old formica,  granite countertops would be nice."

There is allot of favoritism. HR doesn't have your back niether does upper management. They over work you, under pay, and treat you badly. There is no true team work in my department. They are lazy and kiss alot of butt. If you speak your mind, make any suggestions on how things can be improved they do not take it into consideration. The answer is ""this is the way we've always done it"" they do not communicate AT ALL."

449,,Wonderful place to work,2019-08-07,5.0,Branch Retail Executive,My co-workers are like family. I love the customers. My favorite part of the job is when I make a difference in a customers life by helping them plan their finances instead of just being a salesman. My job is so rewarding! There is constant training available to help me improve in my job. There is so much room for growth.    The pay is very competitive.,The systems could be updated a bit more. It's slow at times which makes it difficult to do our job.
450,,Unethical and Evil Company.,2019-07-20,1.0,Mortgage Loan Officer,Nothing works in that company.  It is so disorganized and so evil.,Terrible support and training.  Awful systems.  The majority of Loan processors are rude don’t care about their clients or co-workers. Won’t pay your commissions.  They care more about diversity than professionalism.
451,,Recognizable name and career advancement,2019-07-16,4.0,Real Estate Underwriter,"Good training

Pay is adequate","Red tape
Lack of urgency at times"
452,,Great international company. Poor management.,2019-07-12,3.0,Senior Vice President,"Global organization with opportunity to grow your skill sets. Great people (non exec management). Culturally diverse. Above avg pay and benefits. Depending on your role, cross training among the countries. Challenging work environment.",Foreign executive management that is only focused on a 2-3 year tenure then back to Spain with a promotion...doesn’t know or understand the US culture. Micromanagement. Priorities change daily resulting in constant chaos and low productivity. Condescending management (woman berated and crying in meetings). Higher than normal executive and senior managers leaving due to “health reasons” with no job to replace.
453,,Good place to work,2019-07-10,4.0,Business Process Analyst II,"relaxed atmosphere, work/life balance, benefits","difficulty changing positions, some managers can be rigid"
454,,Pros and Cons,2019-07-09,4.0,Financial Sales Advisor,The bank offers great benefits such as 401k matches along with health benefits that a reasonable. The ability to move up within the company is definitely present. Recognition is given by upper management.,Micro management and aggressive sales goals that increase year over year. At first the goals are attainable then gradually increase making it challenging unless your skill and work ethic increases by over 20% yearly
455,,Horrible,2019-07-08,1.0,Sales and Service Advisor,A lot of paid time off,Horrible management all the way up to regional level. Nothing but grown adults who act like children. They hire just about anyone so if your career orientated you get stuck with the slack from others not doing their job. That’s why they’re always hiring. People never stay here even customers acknowledge it.
456,,Good Company,2019-07-08,4.0,Branch Retail Executive,"Recognition of employees, upper management actually listens","Sell, sell, sell, that is all you are going to hear."

462,,Good role for managers,2019-05-24,3.0,Branch Retail Executive,"Managers are given the autonomy to develop the branch’s book of business either through internal leads and/or outside business development.  The product offerings, specifically in the money market, CD, and home equity line if credit space are outstanding.  Rates for these programs are far superior to what you will find at larger banks and even most credit unions.",Lack of market presence and advertising within the San Francisco Bay Area makes selling their products extremely challenging.  The aggressive sales culture and relatively low pay makes employee retention difficult.
463,,Love this company!!,2019-05-23,5.0,Mortgage Banking Officer Vice President,Great pay! Not just a number or disposable! They care about their employees,Smaller brand so limited audience

469,,Enjoyed,2019-04-23,4.0,CEM,It is a competitive workplace room for learning and improvement,Regular time off  need to be senior associate for more time off
470,,Meh,2019-04-17,3.0,Analyst,Lots to do. Feel like you're having an impact on the organization.,Too much dead weight. High work demands. High levels of stress. Low promotion rate. Some employees are toxic. Hiring practices are inconsistent and a crapshoot as to whether they hire talent or not.
471,,Underwhelming Experience,2019-04-10,3.0,Senior Financial Advisor,"1. The employees/managers were great people.  
2. Company offers matching 401k plan, Health/Dental insurance, PTO & Vacation time

I worked for the company for 4  years left and went to work for Verizon Wireless for a year and a half then returned, The management team is amazing and I am very happy to be apart of it. Everyone of my superiors are very personable and down to earth so I have no issuing going to management if i have a problem.",My only con is with the pay scale. I had to leave to leave the company and return to actually get the pay I knew i deserved. One of my associates has not had a raise in three years.
475,,Entirely depends on department,2019-03-06,2.0,IT Operations,"Benefits are good, and culture is progressive","Underpaid, understaffed, unrespected.  Some areas are well respected and get a lot of attention, and others are understaffed, overworked, used as a scapegoat when things don't work right, get no recognition when things do work right, and bear the entire workload of multiple departments."

Not a company anyone wants to work with. WOULD NOT RECOMMEND TO ANYONE.
481,,Did not see my paycheck for over 6 weeks,2019-02-21,1.0,Financial Sales Advisor,"Growing company, if you know the right people in the company you may be able to get promoted.","They cannot get their systems up to date. The customers have access to a great app, but that leaves no money for the company to improve operations for employees. One example was a payroll check that was messed up that I didn’t see in my account for OVER 6 WEEKS. Those were hours I had already worked for but didn’t get paid for over a month and a half. Their response was “that is just how our system is. We don’t escalate until it’s been over 4 weeks of not getting your payroll”."

486,,Bad Management,2019-02-03,1.0,Operations Associate,"You get really good medical, dental, and vision.",No consistency in the work flow. Constant change in employees makes it hard on the people who do want to stay there. No experience required to get a job here!

490,,No Job Security,2019-01-25,1.0,Mortgage Banking Officer,The office is located near a good taco place.,"My entire department was shut down, even though we had active job postings open at the time. Even the longest-tenured employees were given very little severance. This company values scores from customer satisfaction surveys even more than it does production, and that's no exaggeration. You're held responsible for customer dissatisfaction even the issues stemmed from another group. All calls are recorded and subject to very strict standards."
491,,Its okay,2019-01-24,3.0,Senior Financial Sales Advisor,"Good bank, okay pay and okay culture","Bad systems, lack of knowledge from support teams"

496,,"Great company, benefits, coworkers, and leadership",2019-01-07,5.0,Process Engineer,"As I've shown aptitude and skills in certain areas I have been given additional responsibilities and opportunities to advance and hone my skills. The salary and benefits are great, I genuinely like my coworkers, and I have had the two best managers of my career while working here. We are a team and each jump in to help whenever needed. Sometimes I put in extra hours but I'm rewarded by flexibility of schedule when needed and the ability to work from home at night rather than stay late in the office. The decision to come to BBVA Compass is one of the best decisions of my life.","There could be better communication about company-wide prioritization of projects. There are lots of projects, both big and small, going on at the same time and when needing work or assistance from other groups it's difficult to determine which project is the higher priority."
497,,QA Analyst  IV,2018-12-21,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Generous compensation,  employee appreciation",Laid off with very little notice and meager compensation package
498,,Lots of Responsibility. Little Pay.,2018-12-18,2.0,Branch Associate,Working with money and helping people. Referral quotas aren't ridiculously high.,Lots of responsibility and risk. Major staffing cutbacks have happened over the last few years leaving many branches very short staffed. Pay is very low for all of the things you have to deal with and raises are practically nonexistent.
499,,Love This Company!,2018-12-13,5.0,Report Wrtier,"Been working for BBVA for almost a year,  Was a contractor before that and I was thrilled when I was offered a full time position.

501,,Good company to work for overall,2018-11-30,4.0,Applications Developer,I have heard other complain about work life balance but in my department that is taken seriously.  I have volunteered to handle things on my vacation and my manager has been adamant that unless it is a special case that vacations are days off and she makes me find someone else to handle the task.,"I think that most departments are not flexible to handle other development tasks although I hear that may change.  The result is there are times where one department may be overwhelmed and has to work extreme schedules while another department is scrambling to find stuff to do. 
Another complaint is poor planning. I was trained to be a scrum master but there are no currently no open scrum master positions. Also there is a talent development plan but is less interactive than in the past to the point that I don't see any value in it at all."
502,,Director,2018-11-29,5.0,Telephone Sales Director,"You won't feel like a number as can happen with big employers.  BBVA Compass really listens to their employees and more importantly, works proactively to continually make it better.

BBVA Compass excels at identifying individual strengths and providing opportunities to shine and further refine them.

503,,Not What I Expected,2018-11-29,3.0,Anonymous Employee,"Since I’ve only been with the bank a short time, I’m still observing.  So far, the people are ok and some are friendlier than others. Having the option to work remotely is a huge plus although it’s only day a week and I hope that changes to give employees who want to permanently work from home that option.",Open concept floor plan. There is absolutely no privacy since there are no partitions or cubicles  to drown out any noise.  No formal training for new employees in specific departments. It’s almost similar to a “sink or swim” situation. You are not gained system access in a timely manner and they have antiquated ways to process their closing documents that is not streamlined and very time consuming.  And the  TL’s & managers micromanage depending on what department you’re in.
504,,Good Company If you Know the Right People,2018-11-22,2.0,Analyst,Assignments are challenging and rewarding.,"Easy to get pigeonholed into a project, with no opportunities to learn anything new or move up the corporate ladder.  Rampant cronyism and nepotism which is the only way to advance.  A lot of catty behavior from all levels of employment at the bank from directors all the way down to contractors.    This makes coming to work unbearable."

-Better than average benefits, particularly regarding paid time off for middle to upper level employees
-Flexible work environment and hours
-Broad access to education materials
-Relatively clear pay grade system
-Bonus plan can pay out pretty well","-YoY raises can be stingy, particularly for high performers 
-Your initial salary when coming onboard sets the pace for your future salary, and that is when you have the most power to negotiate normally. All future increases are percentages based off of your starting salary and tied to your grade. Current system doesn't take into account market value very well.
-How you are treated by management can vary greatly from department to department. Often depends on what C-level or EVP/SVP you roll up under.
-Technology in general is rough. It is getting better, but there are some pretty ridiculous technology issues.
-Doesn't always do a good job of testing out newly implemented ideas. New initiatives will get implemented often without proper analysis and vetting."

There's truly nowhere else in Birmingham that you can find such a diverse group of employees, likely because of BBVA's ties to Spain. 

Wonderful people - Our culture is tied to values and behaviors that encourage employees to work as one team for the good of our customers. These values are reinforced and support by management, and therefore, are core who we are as an organization. 

Endless opportunities - BBVA Compass encourages internal mobility, and I've been fortunate to take advantage of this benefit myself.

Fintech is at its core. It explores all avenues of technology to attract businesses. It has the resources to make it big in US market. Salary is competitive but bonuses are poor.,"As the title says 'Startup' it is struggling with 'management of the management'. 
1.     Right now since Dallas Creation centre is handling international projects there are multiple managers (for different country) managing the same resource. This adds redundancy to an employee reporting the same thing to multiple managers which leads to overhead and frustration.
2.     Work culture is bureaucratic. Directors only speak to managers for feedback, managers only speak to Team leads and teams leads .... If the company doesn't recognize each employee as a partner and treats equally then a 'Master-Butler' relationship originates. 
3.     Attrition rate had increased since last year. This had created a sense of insecurity amongst the employees. Nobody can openly express their views in front of their managers. 
4.   Employee appreciation is non-existent. All that matters is work-result logistics."

534,,Great place to work!,2018-08-01,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"My review is based on my experience working for the Group BBVA. Since BBVA Compass is part of it, my appreciation applies to BBVA Compass as well. 

One big family: I have been working for BBVA  Group here in USA and in Peru and can speak by facts that we all are a big family that walk together  under the same culture, ethical values, and goals. 

Direction: We know where we want to be, and we are working together, as a  group, to be there.  Senior Manager is very engaged in accomplish it. 

Opportunities: BBVA group is focus in bringing opportunities not only for our Customers, but also for us, employees. The ""People Management"" model, which is aligned  to the strategies  of BBVA group, opens  doors of opportunities to grow withing the organization in USA and in other countries. The employee just need to be prepared to take the next step, and the group provides the venues to do it. 

Benefits: BBVA group encourages employees to find that balance between work and family. The employees are seen not only as Human Resources, but also as persons that have a life outside of the company. Therefore, in addition to the benefits that most of large companies offer in USA, BBVA Compass offers paid time off for events in the employee's life such as: new married, paternity leave, employee appraisal. The benefits are better compared to other companies.","In BBVA Compass, some middle managers need to understand and make theirs what BBVA Group and BBVA Compass stand for."

I'm most grateful to work here.","Benefits - please consider offering multiple benefit options which can lower the annual out of pocket max.  I almost didn't join BBVA because of the high out of pocket max.   Also, please consider providing large screens for MBO's.  The strain on our eyes, and necks are excessive trying to see the screen.  Also, the base salary should not be inclusive of outside commissions, per the market.  Both Wells Fargo and Chase offer a $30,000 salary with commission above that.   With our first dollars coming out of the base salary makes us one of the lowest paid MBO's who work in a bank."

Additionally, the Bank is owned by BBVA in Spain.

They set company and department goals and change goals midstream all the time.  I have never seen strategic objectives completed in my 6 years with the company.

Also, their main concern is with the Texas market. If you are looking for a Bank that is concerned with your state/city, look elsewhere if you are not located in Texas.

Sales goals are fairly impossible because  they change them constantly, hard to get any bonuses if your annual numbers have changed 3 + times.  Also you are not given the tools or resources to meet them....you are just expected to figure it out.

Company policy and management enforcement is highly discriminatory and favoritism is celebrated, creating constant disparate treatment of team members.  HR exists only when a people manager needs an excuse to fire an employee they  dont like.  selective enforcement of  policy is the definition of disparate treatment . someone will end up suing them eventually  and will bring the company millions in losses.  have an exit strategy or start one now if you are currently  working at BBVA Compass, i am working on mine for sure."

Yet if you aren’t working in Texas… beware! Month to month it’s been one surprise after another from reorganizations, layoffs and sudden retirements. Last month I went to my office to find a empty building our entire commercial and wealth management team were let go. Didn't they just hire them 1 years ago? They did this in multiple regions no warning. BBVA Compass hires whole units with big plans then 1 year later the strategy has changed and everyone’s laid off. We make major investments in something a couple months later we decide to change it. This company reacts constantly and has no direction. I wouldn't accepts a job because you have no stability in not being laid off 3 months after accepting. I got out just in time and accepted a offer.

Alot of times your experience can be influenced by your manager but what I have found over the many years of being with the company is that it also depends on how hard your willing to work. The sales goals are pretty reasonable and as long as your meeting your goals there is not that extreme sales pressure you get from big banks. If you are licensed you have the potential to make alot more money as the bank pays one of the highest commissions. However the location of your branch can make a significance in that. The great thing is that you can move from one branch to the other pretty easy IF you are proactive.,"When you are hired into the company at a low grade you have the opportunity to move up in positions and roles. However moving within the company grants you minimal promotional raises. There may be times you are with the company for years and have all your licenses. All of a sudden, a random employee enters in form the outside and they can be paid 10k more than you a year. This has to be their biggest downfall."

705,,Not the best bank I've worked for but not the worst,2016-02-04,2.0,Financial Sales Advisor,"They really do try to be a good bank to work for.  They offer bonuses based on performance, bonuses for staying healthy, and bonuses for selling certain products and services.  Benefits for my pay grade are reasonable and include 401K matching, two healthcare options and two weeks vacation.","The current focus for Retail staff is on production -- sales, sales, sales.  If you do not have a passion and aptitude for sales it is a difficult environment to work in and is getting worse.  Incentive plans and goals change on a regular basis -- both in what is required to meet and the amount of pay given.  If you do not make goal in every single category (accounts, loans, mortgages, credit cards, investments, business relationships, and referrals to Commercial and Wealth) you will not be able to receive your bonus.

Many HR functions (like payroll and leave) are outsourced making it difficult to get help when needed.

The pay for retail in my area is awful -- I made more as a part-time person at another bank than I do full-time now.

Sick time is accrued instead of given in one lump sum at the beginning of the year like vacation -- I wind up using vacation days for sick time.

Work/Life Balance is awful in Retail -- you have vacation and sick days but it is difficult to use them all -- I've rolled over vacation hours the past two years (at least we're allowed to!).  We're given two days paid time off to volunteer -- I've never been allowed to use mine.

Employee retention is pathetic and we are always understaffed (even when fully staffed!).  Fully staffed is truly bare bones.

The computers regularly do not work -- I have to restarting mine 3x/day on average.  BBVA Compass says it wants to be technologically pioneering but ignore their infrastructure.

Upper & Middle management changes positions on a regular basis -- lower-level Retail employees can't get promoted if they try.  If you start in Retail and want to be anything other than a Branch Manager you are out of luck.

CALL NGIHTS -- you stay until 7:00 pm cold calling customers for appointments two nights a month.  Two nights a month you have to work until 6:00 on Friday and two times a month you have to work on Saturday.  You're not allowed to have overtime but you're also not allowed to cut it all on one day -- instead you wind up coming in late four days and taking hour and 15 minute lunches because ""that's what's best for the company."""

The employees really gave their all to keep the branch going.,"I spent two days in training on the teller line and was placed on the teller line along with a new employee who had no banking experience and was unable to use the system. All seasoned employees by this time were on vacation or maternity leave. The new hire quit the job six week in. The manager was not supportive as he himself was new and had no clue on what was happening and could not help either.

The building I was stationed at was over ran by rats. That specific location was close to the highway so you had undesirables that stroll by every now and again. customers complained about the crack heads shooting up behind the branch and continuously warned us about our safety."
710,,Great Company but indecisive,2016-01-13,5.0,Senior Financial Sales Advisor,"The very best products in the industry, hands down!  The pay is competitive with other banks, benefits are very good, and they have a matching program for their 401k.  Employees start out with 2-3 weeks vacation, depending on your position.  They like to promote from within and invest quite a bit of training into their employees, if you are willing to learn and expand yourself.","This is a very large company, based in Spain, which leads to semi-frequent changes to how goals are structured, senior leadership roles. and some general inflexibility.  Their mortgage products are great but that department is terrible and has very high turnover."

They also are very stable unlike other lenders that layoff or close their offices.,The new system implemented is very difficult to work in. Executive management is not big on working with operations and sales on a more efficient strategy to increase business and create a more efficient work flow.

723,,Wonderful until management changes in mid 2015.,2015-12-04,2.0,Mortgage Loan Processor,"Up until management changes in mid 2015 my experience was good. Had a great Regional Operations Manager who motivated us.  He treated us like family and if you were having personal issues he always tried to help and accommodate to the best of his ability, not so much on the other region. 

Initial pay was good but the yearly increases were minimal.","Upper Management is not in touch with day to day operations. Arizona conducts business and has different clientele than Alabama. 

Bonus structure is not defined in a timely manner. Too many variables and in 2015 the bonus structure wasn't approved and staff notified until the 3rd quarter. If the company makes a profit then the employees should make a profit. A bonus in Alabama of X dollars may seem like a great bonus but in Arizona that same bonus wouldn't even pay rent or a mortgage payment. A per file bonus should be looked at. 

Communication between departments is basically non existent. Guidelines are updated but not to everyone at the same time. Underwriting gets told one thing, processing another and closing yet another. 

There are too many QA stops/reviews and the QA checklist has numerous items that are not salability issues, but if you get a fail then chances are you won't get a bonus unless your manager fights for you to get one. 

When overtime was allowed, a team lead had to be present otherwise you were not allowed to stay and work. Regardless if there was a manager from another department still in the office. Felt like I was back in elementary school and had to have a babysitter."

729,,Good Place to Work,2015-10-27,3.0,,The hours are consistent and reasonable. The pay is market based and my team was a pleasure to work with.,The environment is heavily regulated which gives the company little lee-way to make changes.  This heavy regulation made the company bureaucratic.

With great supervisors who actually cared and supported you against horrible customers would definitely make your job a lot easier.,Corporate is horrible they never look into paying the tellers at least 14.00 an hour.

731,,Associate Manager,2015-10-22,2.0,Associate Manager,The staff is wonderful and they work together as a team with a genuine care for the customers and employees.,"The pay does not measure up to the stress level the AM position puts you under.

Trust me, you can be the top performer for years and have a ""down"" six months on goals, you're looking at the front door to exist stage right.","High turnover in all positions, especially management.  When I left, there were three managers that contacted me and said if ""they're pressuring you to get it on track in 30 days or look elsewhere"" they put out their resumes and took management positions with other banks within 60 days.

Bad news frequently resulted in punishment of the messenger.  Absolutely no adherence to their published methodologies, and projects consequently suffer.  Perhaps the most toxic environment with which I've been associated, including overt racism.  I saw a half dozen team members get sick from over work and unreasonable demands.  Extreme lack of accountability from top to bottom."
737,,Bad pay!,2015-09-30,2.0,Teller,You're off all federal holidays!  You get a free vacation day every year.  That's it.,They don't pay well. I'm a female teller with no banking  experience.

739,,Could be great,2015-09-25,3.0,Associate Manager,"Gracious PTO and sick time, however good luck using it if your branch doesn't have appropriate staff; 

Management is either great and supportive or despondent and micromanage. The sales goals for the teller line are modest and could be easily achieved if they had proper, ongoing sales training and an incentive plan that will actually be noticed after taxes.","Staffing. Nearly all the branches in the Denver area are severely understaffed. They will pull from one branch to cover another so now two branches are functioning with too little staffing. When I first started my position, I was the only person on the teller line. For months it was 6 days a week, with no lunch breaks. 

 They keep trying to keep up with new technology, but the main systems to preform the simplest of tasks are consistently crashing. One would think you'd fix foundation issues before trying to create new platforms that will ultimately fail..

The on-boarding and training process needs a dramatic overhaul. 

Career advancement is difficult here. If your goal is advancement and you don't want to be a BRE (branch manager), you have hit a wall."
740,,Great Place for a College Student Working Part-Time,2015-09-16,4.0,Branch Associate,Working at BBVA Compass was a great experience. I established many professional and personal friendships. It is a challenging but rewarding job and a great place to become introduced to the business world.,When you work with other people's money there is always stress involved. Angry customers are a guarantee when working in a bank.
741,,Do not work here,2015-09-10,1.0,Financial Sales Advisor,The employees are pretty nice and the free account is a great product.,"Branch management is a joke, they are lazy and offer no help. Employees go through ""training"" which is sitting in front of a computer and once that's done, they are told to help customers with no guidance which creates a horrible customer experience. They keep saying how important customer service is, but they do nothing to male it better. If your unfortunate enough to work for a BRE who is well liked but upper management, chances are they will do nothing but sit in their office all day on the phone and internet."

Learned a lot about the banking business encouraged growth and deployed incentives.,"I was a teller and while they weren't super high pressure to sell new products to customers, they did push it a little and require a small but reasonable quota each quarter, I believe. I feel that the pay was well under what it should have been for tellers, based on the amount of liability they have to lose their jobs by making mistakes. This happened to me after 13 months."

762,,A very positive experience,2015-06-13,4.0,Branch Associate,"This was my first job as a bank teller and I was very pleased with how thorough and well done the training material was. I was very fortunate to work with a great, helpful, fun group of people. I also really appreciated having insurance and paid sick leave/vacation even as a part-time employee.","I said that the training material was good, but what wasn't good was how disorganized my training was setup. I feel this directly reflects on the manager who, although was a very nice, knowledgeable person,they were not organized or as much of a leader as I feel a manager should be. I was not given an official trainer (my trainer had had years of banking experience and did know what they were doing in that reguard, but knew nothing about what being a training mentor entailed. I felt like I was leading my own training).  Once I was finally trained and back at my own banking center, I quickly realized how lacks and preoccupied my manager really was. These qualities were positive in some ways (they certainly were not micromanaging) but it would have been nice to feel like we could count on the manager on a more consistent, day-to-day basis (they were out of the bank more often than not, or sitting behind a closed office door--even customers were upset with the manager's lack of availability. )"
763,,Vice President,2015-06-13,1.0,Banking Center Manager,"Great benefits, vacation, 401k.","Anything for a buck, prone to decision making based solely on P&L without regard to human compassion and responsibility.  Upper management can be untrustworthy and disconnected to front line job families.  Poor leadership on this regional level.  On a customer level, widespread bureauracracy and difficult to resolve serious problems.  A lack of responsibility for problem ownership.  Always a meeting or conference call or training and then they wonder why the manager isn't in the banking center-disconnected sometimes to logic.  Never put a customer first and miss a training or conference call that will impact an impression on your DM!  Clients are not priority."

It wasn't unusual to see less than 20 people a day walk through the front door. People constantly get reprimanded for not meeting goals. Managers wants us on the phone all day and consistently assign leads through our Customer Relationship Manager software that have big bold red words saying ""Do Not Solicit"" and tell us to call anyway. Usually those really are the only ones worth calling because they have money, but I've gotten yelled at more than once by clients and received a written complaint from one as well for calling. My district manager had nothing to say about it. In fact, he seemed happy I was making the effort.""Customers first"" is the last thing on BBVA Compass' mind, unlike what they claim. ""I'm gonna get something out of that guy"" ""I'm getting this guy to bite on a market link CD because I need the investment revenue"" or ""I need his money at my branch not at XXX branch"" is not an uncommon phrase to hear a branch manager say (and I've had multiple ones at different locations) after an affluent client walks out the door."

He takes 2 hour lunch breaks then disappears through out the day. Also, during the interview before you accept the job, he tells you that all employees rotate working on saturdays--including him. That is not true and don't believe it. Manager has never worked a saturday during my tenure. Worse, rather than accepting responsibility for their own errors, manager tells district that the employees are responsible which in turn ruins employees chances of promotions and growth within the company. Lastly, do not believe that you will ever receive an incentive...it is not true. I have surpassed all my quarterly goals by reaching at least double (in some cases quadruple) of what was expected of me only to find out that because of some ""new technicality"" I would not be receiving any incentive or bonus pay for my hard work. Additionally, manager CANCELLED christmas dinner because district allegedly cut the xmas budget by $50. Point is, your manager and district do not care about promoting a corporate culture that fosters group bonding in the work place. You will not receive any bonus or incentives so don't bank on it. Also, be prepared to work every other Saturday. Don't plan on using your vacation during the holidays to visit your family; thats when the manager uses his ""official"" vacation days (mind you, they're technically on vacation every week but rig their mytime so no one knows). And Last but certainly not least, no one in this company has a clue what they are doing. You cannot ask your manager a question because they will tell you to ""look it up"" and when you look it up, the information is usually incomplete in some way."

It has a great working relationship with contractors, but NOT for full time employees.","""USA BBVA Compass"" (not BBVA parent company) is not the ""best place to work"" for full time employees, for the following reasons:
-Full time employees are being stretched too thin, micromanaged, exploited, and overworked for a salary that is less than their ""green"" competitor (Regions) and contractors counterparts pay.
-Can never establish a trust working relationship with leadership because most managers are looking out for their own interests and the interests of their circle of buddies such: close family friends, uncles, nephews, husbands, wife, who they always lookout while in the job. How can you compete with that?
-Working with family members conflict of interest and playing favorites is so high .
-Contractors have more perks than full-time employees. Contractors have work flex-times, not pushed to work more than 40 hours, working from home, take extended vacations by mixing working from home and vacation. When full time employees ask managers for similar perks they are told to to abide by the HR policies.
-Some managers found so many loopholes hiring contractors. You can even work with your spouse in the same group, and full time employees can't do that.
-When full time employees request some or part of the perks that contractors enjoy then HR rules state is left up to the ""manager's discretion"" decide. If you are not part of your manager's buddy circle than you WILL definitely have a hard time requesting anything that is left at your your manager's discretion. Leadership bureaucracy is so high."

I'm sure some branches are not like this.,"If you're new to banking the training here is pretty bad. I basically had to learn everything as it happened to me. After 6 months or so I was comfortable. Retail Banking is very much a commodity. You're basically waiting for people to walk thought the door. There is not a lot of opportunity to sell besides visiting surrounding businesses and they do not care nor should they because everyone is pretty much the same. The Financial Advisor is a sellers role but you are not going to talk people into buying a house or getting a loan, so the ""sales"" part of this job is very limited, which I don't like because I want to make money and win business. THE GOALS ARE SO HIGH it is basically impossible to meet them to get paid a commission, plus they make it so you have to make every category in order to get paid anything."

If you get a promotion to a new job you have to start at the bottom of the pay scale.  if someone is hired from the outside they are usually put in the middle.

The DSOM is a micromanager.  And there appears little opportunity for advancement.  Numerous application internally do not even lead to job interviews after over 10 years of consistent production.  

Abolition of anyone managing operations has added increased responsibility to sales staff which detracts time from ever growing unobtainable sales goals.  

The vision of the company has not been shared with employees.

The sales driven culture of BBVA Compass has decreased customer service level.  If its not revenue generating why should employee be compelled or excited about servicing clients.  

All and all this job could easily drive a banker to the bottle."
843,,Not Bad,2014-07-04,4.0,Sales and Service Advisor,Excellent work hours and plenty of days off/vacation time.,Sales goals are not difficult. There is not much support from management or any type of training.
844,,Bad place to work,2014-07-02,1.0,Senior Network Engineer,"They were good about allowing us to work from home when family problems arose, but once they were bought ou by BBVA, family did't seem to matter anymore","Starting pay was realy good, but don't expect a meaningful raise while there. If you wanted to move up in that organization, you had to quit, come back as a contractor, then they would bring you on as a manager for the department you were contracted to. BIG time good ol' boy politics in play there. If you are hired to perform a job, but can't do it, you will be promoted so that you as the new supervisor can hire somebody to do the job you were hired to do. RUN, don't walk away from any offers they make for employment."
845,,Bank does not care about employees,2014-07-01,2.0,Assistant Sales Manager,Nothing that I can think of,"Bank does not care about employees at all.  Way to many layoffs.  This is the way that the bank makes goals, by laying off employees."
846,,Great place to work,2014-07-01,4.0,Financial Sales Advisor II,Benefits are great.  People are great.  Managment cares.  Opportunity to recieve all Investment and Insurance licenses.  Tuition Reimbursment.  HR department is VERY good. 2 weeks paid vacation and 11 paid holidays.  Flexible work schedule and great hours of operation.  Work stays at the office.  Family life is important to BBVA Compass values.  2% raise every year.  401k match up to 4%.,Overwhelming goals.  Training is sub-par.  Mundane job tasks.  Low starting salary.  Inefficient and unreliable software system.  Tough to advance within the company.  No motivation to advance in company because you are entered into the new position at the lowest pay range and outside recruits are brought in much higher.
847,,Stupid vacation colony for expats from Spain. Blatantly discriminates locals. Horrible management.,2014-06-22,1.0,Assistant Vice President,"Not much really. Perhaps some ""stability"" but that is an illusion. Layoffs are common indeed. Colleagues tend to be nice, normal hardworking people. Some people are confrontational but most of the troops are quite relaxed. If you are a locally hired, non-""strategic""  employee, best compensation is when you get hired because it rides a descending curve. Training is a joke, they give you the cheapest they can find. When there are ""important"" soccer games, it's ok to watch on the company's tv's (best pro of the company)..","Only those in the inner circle from their home country, enjoy benefits, generous company perks. All others can expect to get the bare minimum standard treatment. Most of us never get ahead. There are old timers with 20, 30 years in the same position they were initially hired. Salary increases barely keep up with inflation. Very commonly your manager will surprise you on bonus day that your performance was subpar so NO bonus for you that year. This is so because bonus announcement is on the same day you get your evaluation, so you have no opportunity to defend your point of view. Since promotion criteria is based solely on your origin and being inside the circle, management is incompetent, unprepared, untrained, egoistical, simply horrible. Even externally hired managers tend to be incompetent. Company is pretty cheap. If you are a ""commoner"", don't  spend a dime more than the bare minimum when they send you on business travel. You won't get reimbursed. Walk or take a bus if you can, don't take a cab. Top management from hq is also horrible. Spain is broke."
848,,BBVA Compass is good but could be better,2014-06-19,4.0,Senior Financial Analyst,Compensation is competitive. Benefits is great.,Leadership is lacking.  Lay-offs in the bank.
849,,Lots of politics,2014-06-16,4.0,Anonymous Employee,"good pay and benefits
flexible work time","no new employee orientation to speak of, not like other companies I've worked at anyway
too many chiefs, not enough Indians
very, very political"
850,,Could be a lot better,2014-06-15,2.0,Assistant Branch Manager,None that come to mind,"Micro managing, upper management is hard to deal with unless you are one of their favorites."
851,,I was promised a lot of things that were always delayed and never delivered.,2014-06-12,2.0,Sales & Service Advisor,"There is opportunity for career advancement, you will learn a lot about banking and investing.","Branches are always understaffed due to high turnover, training is a joke, computer systems need to be updated, Management does not care about day to day operations... only sales are important."
852,,I was a happy 16 year employee but I was laid off...,2014-06-11,4.0,Assistant Sales Manager,"Great benefits, good work environment, upward movement for some.",In Austin there is no consideration of anything but sales numbers.  That is the only way to be promoted now.  The pressure is far too strong to make work enjoyable now and there is nothing personal about it.  They are definitely becoming a Chase kind of place where you are a number and not a person.
853,,I have never been treated so poorly by management.,2014-06-10,1.0,Anonymous,I have more vacation time and paid holidays than I have had with other jobs. The insurance is great. There are little perks such as discounted cell phone contracts and ways to earn money for insurance copays.,"Our management are literally bullies. They pick one person and run them off. The turnover is ridiculous. The workload is ridiculous. The ""pay increases"" and ""bonuses"" are insulting. There is zero training. Salary means working so much you can not support a personal life. Management is rude and unsupportive. They openly berrate employees and are generally tasteless - often overheard gossiping about employees. Management all the way up to the international level is detached from the day to day work and from employees. Departments are not supportive of one another making what could be smooth teamwork become a stop and start operation that feels like a game of strategy and coaxing rather than just work tasks.The environment is very hostile. Hours are long. No one knows if they are going to be in trouble for something and tension is high all day every day. The job itself probably wouldn't be too bad if there were enough employees to handle the workload and there was actual training and management was completely replaced by people who don't thrive on drama and who are willing to communicate with one another about the job so that there is one answer to a question. Frustration is created by management's personal interpretations of each process- the ""rules"" and ""policies"" vary depending on who you have to work with."
854,,Terrible Insurance Department,2014-06-04,1.0,Personal Lines Insurance Agent,There is nothing good about this job. There is no growth opportunities. My top sales earned me a $510 annual raise.,"As an agent, you do all the work for the client, file everything and even follow up work months later (even though you are not paid for renewals). Leads aren't great since tellers try and refer everyone. Commission is impossible to hit and very low if you do hit it. There are no tiers like at AAA or Wells Fargo. From January 2014 to May 2014, only 2 agents hit commission, and only one month each. I wouldn't recommend moving if you like making high bonuses. Over the last year, there is only one agent who has worked at this company for more than one year."
855,,Management was fantastic!,2014-05-29,3.0,Assistant Branch Manager,"hours were pretty good even for a salaried employee, had a great manager and staff was very open to coaching.","The systems were not up to date, it  took you a few tasks to do just  for one inquiry, and when my position was eliminated they only told us two weeks in advance! That made me see the true character of the company and spoke volume on how little we meant to them."
856,,8 years,2014-05-28,3.0,Assistant Sales Manager,Good incentive pay quarterly for hitting goals,"Don't promote from within, and don't pay their loyal employees as well as new employees"

858,,unorganized at least from my experience,2014-05-20,1.0,Branch Associate,health plan was decent but not great.,This bank is very unorganized and a bit behind with the times.
859,,"Stagnant, Complacent, Lack of Leadership, Poor Customer Service",2014-05-17,2.0,Sales and Service Advisor,Get holidays and Sundays off. Products are competitive.,"Promotions are rare and only for the men. Some of the branches have good management but most lack employee support from management to grow professsionally and drive business to the bank.
Total lack of leadership. I meet customers who are my neighbors because I bank in the community I live and I am concerned about their opinions of  my branch's management. When these concerns come from the customer, there is a problem."
860,,"Used to be Great, now it is getting Bad fast",2014-05-13,2.0,Senior Financial Sales Advisor,The job used to be great with a Small bank feel and a huge focus on customer service.  We used to have good insurance too.,"Layoffs every November for past two years.  For new people there is no proper training.  The computer systems are not equal to Chase's in 2009 yet.  There is No way to pull sales list, but there are huge sales goals ex. 3.5 mil in loans per year for 1 banker."
861,,Branch Associate,2014-05-07,4.0,Branch Associate,"Great work environment, and great communication with coworkers and managers.",Dealing with rude customers. Software is too old for today's technology.
862,,Commercial Loan Department needs help!,2014-05-05,1.0,Commercial Loan Speciailist,Reasonable pay compared to other local banks.,"Lack of quality management. Employee moral is extremely low. You are constantly belittled by upper management and are encouraged to NOT engage in a team like atmosphere. You can hear a pin drop in the office because everyone is told not to talk or laugh (even if you are on a legit business call with another business partner). 
There is absolutely no structure and no official training. You are told to do things one way and then you get reprimanded by management when things do not work out. 

Sadly everyone is throwing each other under the bus and there is no loyalty whatsoever."
863,,Retail Banking,2014-04-24,2.0,RRM,I really like the challenge of everyday in a bank meeting people and providing them assistance.,Management has turned into selfish non supportive non helpful non responsible and disrespectful. i have been here a long time and management has cheated and even stole from me and my sales. I also have not been given any opportunty to grow although I am the best at what I do.
864,,Still ways to go,2014-04-24,2.0,Senior Vice President,"Innovative bank, some smart folks, most buildings have a cafeteria, and some markets offer health clinic.","Too many non performing employees, like Scar from the Lion King ""I am surrounded by idiots."" Little training, typical HR issues (""you matter, but not really""), Non accountable management, more managers than true leaders, very inefficient process & procedures. Hiring like minded folks (i.e. I was raised in a branch and now I lead a strategic unit, but still manage like I work in a 1980's branch... I will hiring folks just like me.), in my opinion, not a good move."
865,,"Just ok, good for experience",2014-04-23,3.0,Branch Associate,"Full time, not a lot of pressure from the head of the company","Manager, the company does not care how employees feel"
866,,I loved Compass Bank. Not so much when BBVA took over.,2014-04-06,2.0,Business Relationship Manager II,"Great managers, competitive salary, benefits were good.  The leadership does not care about the staff. They care about $$$",BBVA uses a model used in Spain. They will cut back on staff just to save money and re hire at lower salaries. They have no real direction. Glad I left.
867,,"A good place to work, though not without problems",2014-04-06,4.0,Anonymous Employee,"I am a contractor and have been at BBVA for 3 /12 years. Overall, it is has been a great experience. My boss is the best I have ever worked with, and I have had good working relationships with many others. The upper management seems really driven to transform the company and turn it into one of the major banks in the US (The parent company is based in Spain and very successful there and throughout Latin America).","BBVA has some of the classic problems that beset large companies - many inefficiencies, some managers resistant to change, lack of good communication. One of the hardest things at the job is trying to find the person who has the knowledge I need in order to do my job. They also have a mindset of working with contractors rather than hiring full time employees. While there are advantages to being a contractor, I have long ago proved my value and have been frustrated that I can't secure an FTE position."
868,,"Worst Job ever!terrible hours, micromanagers, never let us use vacation time, mandatory overtime..like a sweat shop",2014-04-04,1.0,Mortgage Banking Officer,"decent pay, I don't have anything positive to add really, life experience taught me to never refer anyone to that company","dirty building in Homewood off of West Valley Avenue that was infested with cockroaches and in the ghetto. It was not safe. No covered parking. When it rained puddles all over. The managers micromanaged and the cubicles were so low there was no privacy, they had mandatory overtime and mandated when it was taken..mandatory work on Saturdays 8-12. Felt like a number on a report. Mangers didn't get to know the employees, only looked at a report"

People learn ""policies"" from different sources and no one is on the same page. The technology is extrememly bad in the mortgage division. Very inefficient and very poorly ran. Things do not get done correctly and customers continue to be upset because of problems caused by the poor communication."
871,,A decent place to work,2014-03-15,4.0,Bank Teller,The pay is nice and most coworkers are friendly and always willing to lend a helping hand when necessary. There are many opportunities for advancement if you are willing to put in the work.,"Customers can be incredibly rude, especially when they are having financial issues. Also, management at times asks you at the drop of a hat to go sub in for employees that couldn't make it to work at other branches. When you are going to school while working, this can be very troublesome"
872,,Little work life balance,2014-03-14,5.0,Vice President,The company is a good company overall and is far beyond its peers in technology and methodologies.,The company still has work to do in improving work life balance.
873,,Not a good place to work for at all!!!!,2014-03-11,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"I can't speak for BBVA Compass as a whole, but I can speak for the department that I worked in. They fed us very often and I met a handful of good people. They were understanding when it came to family issues. Bank hoilday's are always a plus!","They are good at showing favoritism. If you are looking to work for a company(department) where you have to kiss ass to get recognized, then here is where you need to be. The more work you do, the less they respect and notice you. But kiss their asses and do one thing that they deem ""great"" and you're good to go. There is very little room for growth here. The pay is horrible. If the rest of the company is anything like the department I worked, I would never go back to this company. When I first started, we were told that we were not able to wear denim or ""denim-like"" clothing. Well, one day, I saw one of the ladies in upper management with a full ""denim-like"" skirt suit on. So I went to my manager and said something. She told me that I should ""do as they say and not as they do."" Ha, I knew this was not a company that I wanted to work for."

The products, however, are difficult to sell because they are of such low quality in comparison to other competing products in the market. 

Our credit card offers 6 months 0% with Good credit, I just got a ""beginner"" card for poor to fair credit, 9 months 0% on balance transfers and purchases from a competing institution. 

The only thing we do half right is mortgages, when the back office doesn't botch the underwriting and lose deals. 

The new system implemented a year ago is riddled with bugs, issues, and downtime. Our online doesn't work half the time, and we are constantly playing ""catch up"" with our technology. Phone deposits took too long to implement, with bugs, only on iOS, not android nor windows phone.

We rarely ever refund fees, this bank charges 10.95/mo for our basic checking account, which is ludicrous in today's market, especially when management is harping on opening deposit accounts. 

And to top it all off, you HAVE to open a checking account just to look at your CD/Investment/IRA/Savings/etc online, which is also ludicrous.

As an employee, they do not like to hire from within. They would rather bring someone in from the outside to be your superior when they have no familiarity with BBVA's systems or operations."

919,,Most unethical company I've ever worked for and management is awful!,2013-05-10,1.0,Financial Sales Advisor II,I started at an OK salary because of my experience. No Saturdays.,"This is going to be a long one but I'll start in chronological order:

When I was offered the job, I was told I would be licensed right away and would get paid an even higher salary upon licensing. I left my manager position at another bank to take a banker job because they made it sound like it would be totally worth it and I would get paid more. Once I started, the district manager said, ""let's see how you do for 6 mos - 1 year and we will re-visit the licensing."" So basically the recruiter told me whatever I wanted to hear so she could make her quick buck.

The next issue I had was training. The company was in the process of merging one system to another. Not only did I have to train on the old system, but I had to do another training at the same time for the new system. (which are both equally unreliable, slow and crash all the time!) Throughout both trainings, I learned how to open an account. That's it. And even the knowledge I did gain from the training, my manager would tell me I was doing it wrong. I basically had to teach myself how to do EVERYTHING with little to no support. Anytime I would ask for help, I would be treated like I was wasting my manager's time, that I was stupid, or ""how dare you!!""

The internet was slower than molasses, and I swear it was Windows '98! The systems would crash on a weekly basis, including the phones. Since this job was 90% outbound cold calling, when the phones wouldn't work, my manager would try to force me to use my PERSONAL cell phone to make sales calls. I refused because I wasn't comfortable using my personal number to handle business and my boss would roll her eyes and tell me I'm not a team player and I OBVIOUSLY don't care about the banks success.

Last, but most certainly not least, their oh-so ethical attendance policy. Sure, it may seem very reasonable and ideal but it's not. Don't let it fool you. My manager insisted I go home because I was too sick to be at work on 3 different occasions and I got written up EACH TIME!! When I tried to fight it, the response I got was ""technically, it's unscheduled....."" and HR confirmed that my manager could potentially send me home enough times to terminate my employment for excessive absence. Seems fair, right?!?! WRONG!!! If you decide to work for this company, lawyer up first because if you aren't one of the favorites, you are doomed!

Dallas area DSOM seems to think she is the end-all, be-all.  Refuses to admit mistakes, disrespectful, dismissive, inconsiderate of employees.  Gossips about managers to other managers and is deeply embroiled in office politics.  She rules by fear and intimidation rather than gaining support and cooperation by being respectable.

Also, understaffed branches which make it impossible to accommodate customers and employees needs in a competent and balanced manner.  Running a branch with a skeleton crew as a daily standard is just bad."

They micromanage to a fault. Do not give people the ability to think on their own or outside of the box. They punish rather than reward or push for new ideas. Management leads with a very heavy hammer. I worked for Compass for over 15 years and have seen extreme decline in how employees are treated since BBVA  purchased them in 2007 and re-branded in 2009. The upper/senior management states they want to be family friendly and push work life balance but they rarely if ever visit branches to see what is really going on. There are daily threats in reference to work performance. You are punished by taking away family time if you do not have the results they are looking for making you stay at work late into the evening hours or work more on the weekends. This change in how they treat employees led me to leave and after so many happy years there, the last few months were miserable. I haven't looked back with regret even once. They were once an amazing employer with happy staff. The morale is so bad it is thick with stress."

Good effort on behalf of management to cultivate a good work atmosphere (specific focus on becoming a ""100 Best places to Work"" company).  Specific to the market in which I work (Southeast Texas) I have experienced a very high caliber of employee.  Company vision to become the ""Best Universal Bank in the U.S"" is appealing.","Technology is terrible which was not  initially viewed as a difficult barrier to overcome, however a minimum level of system functionality and reliability is required to be productive.  Job specific training leaves alot to be desired.  FAR too many initiatives to manage and implement properly.  The void between the policies, procedures, products, and services offered by the three primary lines of business (retail, commercial, and wealth management) is appalling since the bank considers itself a relationship bank... read this comment as the right hand doesn't even know the left hand exists.  No community banking model (all holes at BBVA Compass are round which leaves lots of perfectly good square pegs laying around without a home).

And now for a strictly personal issue that I was never able to overcome:  I came up through the retail side of banking, having done literally every job in a branch from working the teller line to managing a branch to covering a region as a business banker.  Upon my most recent transition to commercial banking I was very disappointed to learn how most of the commercial bank views its retail brethren.  If I heard the comment ""retail idiot"" once I heard it a hundred times and it became harder and harder for me to resist the urge to comment to the contrary."

In addition, Executive Level Management does an excellent job of communicating the Company's vision and the goals that need to be met to achieve that vision.  They also do a phenomenal job of communicating how an employee will be measured against those goals.","BBVA Compass corporate is a very fast paced environment that is constantly in the state of change.  The company is full of opportunity, but you have to be a person that likes constant change, can be ok with a lot of ""no""s before getting that ""yes"" , have to have serious stamina and tough skin.  

While the company does support work/life balance, there will be challenges with balancing the two if you want to be successful and advance.

Let’s make project plans and the dates therein more important than functional applications.

Let’s apply blanket security policies to lock the developers out of all servers including the dev and test environments.

Let’s require multiple pages of documentation for even the most minor software change and require announcing said change at a mind-numbing meeting only held once a week.
