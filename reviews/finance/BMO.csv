-if you are fortunate to work with a good manager, s/he can be supportive of your career development and help you to enroll in IFL programs to learn skills to further your career
-a corporate trend towards listening to employees' voice more","-depending on ppl you work with, you could find some ppl in service and administrative roles not driven to learn and change.
-just like any other workplaces, there's power struggle between different department management team.
-sometimes, you can see it is about WHO you know, instead of WHAT you know, esp in promotions.
-most managers don't have work experience in roles their team members are in, hence their working knowledge and understanding is limited. You need to be self-sufficient and build a good network within the company to find ways to solve problems for your clients. This could work for you as you will develop strong survival skills and grow your knowledge, but can be frustrating at times."

461,,Run the other way... Do not work here as a Software Developer...,2021-12-12,1.0,Software Developer,"- Having a job, literally.
- Met great people!
- OK benefits","1) Lowest team morale I have ever seen and also in other teams that I worked with.
2) High turnover (1-2 people quitting every month for the past 2+ years - yes do that math how many people has that been in total!)
3) Prepare to be minimal trained and be thrown into the ""deep end"" right away to get up to speed. If you are lucky and have a mentor, there's a good chance that mentor won't be working with your team anymore which will be explained in the next few points.
4) Expect to have have workspace issues on your laptop (takes 1-2 months to get setup, you won't even have a laptop for the first few weeks since your start date)
5) Working nights and weekends (you will see contractors and full-timers put in 10-16 hours of work on the weekdays and even be working over the weekend. You will hear people brag they slept at ""2am"", etc.)
6) Increased responsibility, wearing multiple hats, and being subjected to responsibilities OUT OF MY JOB SCOPE without an increase in pay or promotion while still needing to meet their delusional deadlines because of the crazy turnover in the team. The increase came in 2+ years later and was only a few thousand dollars... it's not about the money at this point.
7) High developer and senior developer turnover only to be replaced by new grad developers who then have no mentors and are expected to be a senior level and represent the team in business project meetings.
8) Absentee leadership... absent manager. 1:1s once or twice a year that are ""obligated"", good luck trying to talk to this manager or getting an email response which comes to my next point.
9) Absent manager results in losing our contractors for a few weeks to a month or so because their user credentials expired... they can't get any work done.
10) High pressure donation drives for United Way every year - they want to see direct reports reach 100% donation rate. Donating should be optional. You are a bank why don't you donate and not take from employees?"
462,,Generally positive depending on the manager one gets to work with!,2021-12-12,4.0,Personal Banker,"Well designed policies and procedures, lots of support and guidance when needed, opportunity to network with professionals, competitive pay, variable pay depending on performance, strong prospects for career growth, large organization hence very little direct impact by factors such as Covid-19, 4 weeks of paid vacation depending on job grade, on the job training is truly exceptional","Work culture really depends on the business vertical, customer contact center rather poorly managed and unnecessarily stressful due to style of management, the manager you get to work can greatly change the way you perceive BMO"

2. They were very nice and polite when I was in training but as soon as I was on the phone everyone provided me different answers
3. Training taugh me nothing if anything I was set up to fail. Rarely saw my manager and when I did nothing he said made sense. He provided me with wrong information and the way management speaks to you which is thru text(which is off because we aren’t supposed to have phone on the floor) or teams is very condescending.
4. The systems needed to work fail on a daily basis more than once a day
5. IT department is incompetent 
6. The turn around for new hires is crazy my class has 15-18 people and there is 4 of us left.
7. Insurance is expensive 
8. I don’t know how branch employees are trained but they are very rude

833,,Excellent team,2021-08-04,5.0,Digital Advisor,Excellent team to work with. Very accommodative and welcoming. Good training and very supportive during Covid,Customer interaction is must so client facing role is not for you then it might not interest you.
834,,Helpful environment,2021-08-03,5.0,Customer Contact Associate,You are very well trained to do the job and colleagues are always willing to help.,Pay isn't fantastic and you have to keep going to the next level. You can't just jump to another level
835,,Good place to work,2021-08-03,4.0,Personal Banking Associate,"Good culture, benefits and share program.",Pay is a little less than what the effort you put in
836,,Great role,2021-08-03,5.0,Investment Specialist,"Great support from superiors
Nice way to get your foot through the door

Have to stay for 1.5 years before applying in other roles"
837,,Credit Strategy,2021-08-03,4.0,Manager,Good work / life balance and benefits. Company offers multiple avenues for career growth and opportunities. Senior management are continuously trying to improve processes and grow the business.,"Lack of ownership and direction at times which leads to delayed deliverables.

838,,Worst “mean girl” management,2021-08-02,1.0,Support Worker,Flexibility with schedule start times and at one time there was an amazing culture but it was years ago,Childish cliques within management and staff very boorish behaviour by some management. Literally watched a manager walk over a staff member who had passed out and they just walk over the person and kept right on walking away without a word.
839,,Disappointing,2021-08-02,2.0,Fraud Analyst,"BMO gives you a decent amount of vacation days starting out, most of your co-workers are nice people who are willing to help you out. Working from home is a nice bonus.","Management is clearly there to benefit themselves; their job is to maximize their perception to other higher managers, not to help you. Often times managers do not have the knowledge of what their team actually does. 

Clear favoritism when hiring. Opportunities to grow and actually receive raises is hard. You'll often start receiving tasks and an increased workload from your initial hiring without any increase in pay or compensation. The bank will just give everyone a ""wage adjustment"" and you won't receive a raise that year. You'll essentially be making the same amount after inflation. Business systems are archaic, and definitely behind."

I feel other consulting firm give you way better rates. Salary is up to market rate but only if you are new joinee  however if u get promoted the salary hike is significantly low.","You are lucky if your boss is good but if u r stuck with a bad boss you are on your own, lots of politics and applying for internal position doesn't keep you on top of the priority unlike other banks (cibc).

1101,,Mediocre Bank,2021-05-17,2.0,Private Wealth Advisor,Most of the people are nice to work with and the bank has a good work life balance.,"Way too many people have been there for decades and are coasting, especially in the support roles. The bank's technology is so old and inefficient that the bank's efficiency ratio is in the 70's. Peer banks are in the 50's. There are major problems getting their act together on numerous fronts which include; competitive credit card products, retail banking client experiences, mortgages, wealth management, and in private banking. In fact if you look at BMO's wealth management clients most are between the ages of 70 to 90 years old. These are clients from Harris Bank days. It shows the lack of success BMO Wealth Management has had in acquiring new clients. This once again translates back to average products and services being delivered by average employees with seriously dated back room technology. 

Another big problem in BMO wealth management is TURNOVER. In my first year with the bank 12 people left my department out of 20 some employees...almost 50%. turnover. When calling on existing clients, many say ""Oh you be gone in two years so why should I get to know you"". Some clients have had 5 advisors in the 7 to 10 years. The bank has little patience to develop new business hence the turnover. The advisors that stay are ones that have good books inherited from others. This has led to a huge problem of favoritism within the wealth management business units. This favoritism borders on outright discrimination where in one wealth management office discrimination was seen based on gender and on age. Discrimination came in the form of who got what accounts, branch banks, leads, offices, etc. I witnessed retaliation by a manager and by the regional manager against to those who spoke up against these actions. Retaliation included termination.

All in all, BMO could be a great bank. Their commercial bank is much better and stronger than the retail and private bank. Many of the good people serving in the retail and private banking groups are frustrated. They see what I just described. They feel their hands are tied. Why is this happening? It is because the people in the managing director and regional president roles are very weak. BMO is a big believer in promoting within. Just because someone is a good portfolio manager or a good PWA does not make them a good managing director or regional president. Weak management leads to high turnover, mismanaged policies, inefficiencies, favoritism, discrimination, frustration and lack of real progress."

Also, promotion was extremely rare in the department due to sheer number of people that have been working in the same team for over a decade at analyst/senior analyst level just waiting for retirement. Even if you got promoted, I'm pretty sure the raise is only 5% of your current salary.

If you're looking to be part of the learning & development group don't expect much. This department is run by higher level management and is an ""order-takers"" group. There's no analysis, development, or evaluation--only design and visual work to go around. Mostly formatting PPT decks. They love their decks and stock photos! BMO is also undergoing major restructuring. After a year into my role they decided to dissolve my team and change my job description and title with no warning.

Beware of roles related to new initiatives and employee experience. I was hired into a new role that didn't exist previously (which sounded amazing including end to end development and program management) only to discover that the job they hired me for was someone's pipe dream. When that person retired two weeks into my role they decided to treat me like a graphic designer.

Constantly re-org: the reporting structure changes every few month would make you wonder about the future. career advancement is not as good as the old days due to the upper management weights more on offshore workforces (Global Collaboration for the cost benefits?). it'll be harder and harder for the local talents to move up internally. no good for mid level to rank up to senior level.

There is growth, but the compensation structure keeps your salary low even if you are more experienced than your peers. Bonuses are tied to performance, which they have automated so managers don't have to do their job. The scorecard itself is rigged by upper management, to keep bonuses low. Benefits are mediocre. Other companies offer better. Branches all over the country are incompetent, so they tell the customer to call the contact center.

Yet they completely ignore these behaviours themselves. Employees are not empowered to act and every decision is made by committee. Leaders that are ineffective keep getting promoted and their mandates expanded, meanwhile there is an exodus of incredible talent because they are fed up with mediocrity.  These horrible leaders then hire their clones, so it feels like you are being outnumbered.  The only way to get ahead here is to kiss up and pander to the egos.

I think that's all you need to know about how much they care about their employees. There is a massive issue with their IT department in solving problems quickly and efficiently  and embracing new technology.  Security is great but not when it costs efficiency.  There is a bottleneck when it comes to efficiency (see the pattern here?) and getting things done/bureaucracy and an overall lack of communication and connectedness here.

2476,,Most Unprofessional Workplace & Shady Culture,2019-10-21,1.0,Senior Customer Service Representative,"-Health/Dental Plan options. Easy to use and convenient online access. 
-Employee banking = no monthly fees, 50% off your annual Mastercard fee. 
-If you don't like your branch, there is often opportunity to help out at other locations and possibly transfer. However, managers can be possessive sometimes and refuse to let you go even if you and the other branch have consented. I suggest asking for it and taking action. Waiting won't do you any good. 
-Same thing goes for switching departments. E.g. Retail banking to Private Banking or Nesbitt Burns
-You meet a lot of people and work with different clientele when you help out at different branches. Expands your customer service experience.","I’m sorry, this will be a long one. 

-Hiring managers were dishonest about job expectations during interview. 

-Overtime is never paid but always expected. Even for hourly employees. 

-Tellers & Advisors are frequently shamed (directly or indirectly) for taking their full entitled breaks. 

-Preach about service but extremely sales oriented. 

-Advancement is often based on nepotism, especially for management positions. 

-The work schedule is supposed to be out 2-4 weeks in advance but that is usually not the case. There were a few times when the manager posted the schedule on the Wednesday so nobody knew what time or if they were even working on Monday and Tuesday! Average in my experience with all branches I worked/helped out at was 0-2 weeks in advance. Sometimes they change it last min too. 

-Managers will insult, accuse, shame and berate their staff to please customers. Safe to say they never stand up for their own and use that opportunity to lower employees' performance record. I have never witnessed so many employees crying on the job in any of my past workplaces. 

-Only expect a raise when you are switching roles/getting promoted. Even then, don't expect much. 

-In-branch awards such as Brilliant at the Basics means nothing. Doesn't even count as anything in your performance review. When you're no longer new you realize there is nothing exciting about it lol. I lost count of how many I've been awarded and quickly stopped feeling proud. 

-BMO never pays for company or staff events. Management and staff are constantly pushed to attend events and often “teased” for not attending. (Staff events may be covered by Wealth Management department)

-Management, regardless of which branch, are extremely unprofessional and two-faced. There is a trend of incompetent branch and assistant branch managers. Any time they mess up an advisor's deal, they blame others and don't take ownership. 
Super sweet and accommodating to clients, awful to staff, expect ""their employees"" to ""take ownership"" of unrealistic situations/promises management created. 
They half-ass the training, assuming they do any, and want current staff to mentor the newbies even if they are also new. 
Some BMs are exceptionally lazy and don't even now basic information and/or procedures. One of many reasons why majority of branches fail audit every year. 
Some BMs have no clue what goes on in their branch. Even turned a blind eye to workplace bullying. 

-Tellers can be heavily expected to perform ""lobby leadership"" duties, which is basically greeting people in a very scripted manner. Duties are dependent on branch. Script is heavily enforced. 
Saying your own genuine greeting can be considered unacceptable and ineffective. Must say ""Welcome to BMO!"" in an appropriate upbeat manner at all times. 

-BMO servers crash quite often. I've lost count of how many times we had to turn customers away or tell them to come back when everything is up and running again. 

-Lots of negative gossip between staff members, branches, and markets. Branch Managers are always talking smack about each other but super fake and friendly in person. There is only ONE branch manager I've met in the Vancouver market who is genuine and respectable. 

-HR department is not helpful at all. 

-Vacation approval is not based on seniority or how much time in advance you request time off. Christmas is the hardest. I formally (written and verbally) requested half a year in advance and was rejected on the second week of December. 

-Management give you tasks/news very last minute. You are the unprofessional one if you don't accommodate promptly. 

-There is no trust at BMO. Some of my former coworkers were scared to even answer the annual ""confidential"" workplace survey honestly because they didn't want to get in trouble. Managers always seem wary of their staff and often accuse them of lying if they call out.
A coworker was in a car accident and management expected that person to come back to work a 9-hr shift within 2 days despite back and neck injuries. 
All of my direct coworkers and I were accused of lying when calling out sick. There was no history of staff lying about such things. No compassion was shown when a family member of an employee died. 

Note: I’m not saying I didn’t gain any skills/knowledge while working here. Unfortunately, BMO is not a healthy work environment. Find something different to place your loyalty. Also, keep track of your own stuff! Management will try to turn things against you/blatantly lie so I encourage you to keep everything in writing (email). 

Or, final suggestion: Don’t work at BMO. 

I sincerely hope this helped."

Mainly they hire at a monthly basis because they know the turnover rate for these type of positions is high. Be prepared to work hard in order to achieve targets. Training period itself is 2 months with 1 month in class and 1 month on floor taking calls. I felt that the amount of work you were doing did not equal to pay. They put this euphoria in your head that this job is great and you can expect to move up (when its really not like that). Career growth in these positions is lateral with around a $1000 increase in pay. Be prepared to take a lot of constructive criticism from your managers because especially if it does take you longer to get the hang of the job.  My final point is expectation. They base your performance too heavily on your scorecard which consists of customer reviews and average handle time (the amount of time it takes for you speak to customers on the phone).

I know that this has now changed but it had taken its toll on me and I could not handle the stress of being rated satisfactory rather than exceeding expectations because I did not meet my mastercard quota for the year.  Nothing mattered to BMO except for added sales. Now I am retired and miss the profession I so loved.  the BMO pension is not the greatest and certainly should be improved or at least increase with the cost of living."

He had us delivering a thing of elegant but straightforward design, utility and effectiveness.  

A change in senior management led to his departure.  He was replaced by a pair of ego-driven newbies with little no financial industry experience, who have no concept of the controls and regulations required to keep the banks reputation and customer assets safe.   

Instead, their lack of vision and a lack of a well-thought-out cohesive road-map for the way forward has left in its wake a road littered with abandoned technology, broken infrastructure, and highly dis-satisfied internal customers, as leadership constantly chases and attempts to implement the next Bright Shiny (technological) Object.   

For a brief moment in time - about 5 months - we had someone appointed who looked like he was going to help us move away from the chaos of the Keystone Cops, or at least put some rigour in place.  Unfortunately,  5 months was all it took for him to realize that it was a lost cause, as more seasoned technology pros surround us like vultures looking to pick apart what's left, as the Newbies are losing their credibility."

People are rewarding for being a good corporate citizen, as long as your manager and leadership is also on board.

Expanding rapidly in the cyber security and IT field.","Transitional period means there is also a good portion of the bank that are old, traditional desk job mindset. There are teams that still operate under the old banker office environment attitude. These teams don't reward employees that think outside of the box, just follow orders  without question. If you do questions, be mindful of their ego. You are there to perform tasks in an efficient manner, end of story. 
There managers also try to play the modern work culture game and are very bad at it. Just do as they say until you can find something else.

2858,,"Terrible at entry level, probably decent higher up",2019-02-16,2.0,Customer Service Representative,Managers generally supportive of team as people. Team members are almost all friendly and easy to get along with. Good ESOP program is one of only saving graces.,"Pay is terrible at the lower levels. I was making what worked out to $12.60/hr as a full-time employee in May of 2017 in Vancouver, one of the most expensive cities in the world. To give you an idea, the minimum wage in BC just recently (2018) went up to $12.65/hr, so I was almost (if you don't count the benefits, which aren't as significant as they pump them up to be) being paid less than minimum wage. It's no wonder that people in the city stay servers and bartenders into their late twenties with wages like that it would probably take you 4 or 5 years at the Bank before your hourly rate matched that of a Cactus Club server. The CSR position, and even FSM position, are pretty much positions that would be suitable for finance/commerce undergrads to cut their teeth (just a bit) in finance. They are not suitable for adults who have to buy things and live. Finally, if you are going to work in sales here, if your numbers aren't really good - just quit, because your career is over and you mean nothing. Save yourself the polite conversations about ""building your pipeline"" and ""following up"". While numbers are important in sales, nominally bank staff are there to serve clients. Would only go back at a much much higher level, and 100% not in a sales role."

Turnover is quite high and they struggle to hire customer reps. Let's be honest 35K is not worth the nonsense you have to put up with.  Only good thing is benefits start right away and that's only because no one wants this job.

 - very political culture and nepotism;
 - some groups have zero diversity, just men of one ethnicity. 
- all the employee networks are jokes, any projects for young professional advancements are dying. 
- the proverb for the bank: HR Is here not to protect you or solve your problems, it's to protect the interests of upper management and the bank.

The experience I had at the bank was rather dream crushing, since it was my first job. I expected some growth, put a lot of work into projects and took on additional responsibilities outside of my role. In reality, I had to face deteriorating culture, every year was becoming worse and worse. Due to the constant management changes, the morale and culture is become second or third priority, if a priority at all. In case you need some answers from other departments, you might give yourself a month of constant follow up and calls. Time management does not apply to BMO, people just wait for the retirement while cashing bonuses. Less you do, more you get. The most agreeable employees tend to be more favoured. 

Management are rather indifferent and disconnected, many prefer the dynamics of a slavedriver - slave/ teacher - pre-schooler.  Many new immigrants are taking the jobs to get their PR's and then leave. 

Old fashion attitude towards female employees is more apparent in some sections of the bank, not that many female executives I know of... 

There are legends that some departments are better than the others, do your research before joining the bank.  

BMO has no interest in talent retention or advancing someone internally."

- Micro-manage their team. 
- Play favorites.  
- Have unclear (or changing) expectations.  
- Use fear as motivation.

- Lack vision. Seriously.  No vision, no timeline, no direction. 
- Don’t mean what they say.  
- Tolerate mediocrity. Nearly as bad as expecting the impossible is the manager who tolerates mediocrity or worse. 
- Manipulate. Managers who play one person off another, or dangle carrots and threaten sticks all the time aren’t leading, they’re manipulating.  
- Have a vindictive streak. If you disagree with the managers even when others agree with you , they gets pissed off, and they will make your job more difficult on purpose afterwards."

The pay is decent if asked for it at the time of hiring. They hardly ever give raises and their goals are nearly impossible to reach. They will work you until you cannot take it anymore. There is so much stress in this company that you will start talking those problems home/personal life. 

I read bad reviews when I got my interviews for BMO but I still gave it a try.. Big mistake.. NOT worth it, not worth it at all!!! Please take the time to educate yourself about this company before you make the commitment to work for them. Go to their branches and look at how their employees and how unhappy and stressed they are. They will offer products down people's throats to be able to make their numbers and not be yelled at by management and being forced to do outbound calls to make more sales, sales, sales. 

Management ALWAYS has something to point out that your doing wrong and no matter how hard you work, it will NEVER be good enough.

There are a few good people in this company who will give you great advice and give you opportunities. You just need to come across the right person.


Not much else to say here.","BMO is probably the most corrupt company I have ever worked for. You literally have to kiss behinds most of the time to get places at BMO. 

Those commercials you see on TV - 'We're here to help' is all a front to make them more socially responsible and likable. They are cutting down hours to part time CSRs and giving them 3 hour shifts, yes that's right... I don't know who in their right mind would go to work for only 3 hours. Then there are the full time CSRs who are being switched around from branch to branch sometimes mid shift.

If you think CSR is bad don't even get me started on the Financial Service Representative position, they were trying to get me to become one and I declined, I wouldn't want to be in that position.

Sometimes I had to recite a script when people came in to the branch which goes totally against their most recent commercial if you've seen it. To move up you really need to know somebody internally otherwise no matter how much you want to move up they will just keep disregarding you.

Pay is pretty poor considering the amount of heckling you get from management to reach your targets, it gets annoying really quickly.

Since they are cutting down hours they are often faced with short staffing, I actually had a colleague who was called in from vacation to cover a shift, that should be illegal if it's already not.

There are people in management roles who don't even know what they're doing, they are only there because they know somebody in the organization.

BMO doesn't care about you, they aren't here to help and they won't be. If you want to work for this company be prepared to pucker up or know somebody to move you up."

Uneven handling of risky, noncompliant or even unethical behavior if they are friends with the right person. Too much staff turn over. Too little staffing. A suffocating amount of micromanagement to three point that there is no room left for employees to have ownership off their jobs. Focused only on numbers and reports and not people, counter to their brand's goals. If senior leadership is aware of what middle management is doing they aren't fixing it. If they aren't aware they should make it their job to be.  The vision of the bank is great, but the disconnect between what the top says they want to be and what the middle forces the bottom to do is unnerving.  Little promoting from within. Too much hiring of staff from certain banks knows for unethical behavior."

Benefits were decent, Goals/bonuses were challenging but fair.","There was a very poorly managed merger in 2012 - 2013. While change is always difficult, so many poor business decisions were made by choosing inferior technology systems, not providing training on the new technology, not establishing proper & legal procedures, etc. By not providing training to M&I employees, it really tied everyone's hands & made being efficient totally impossible. Also by not providing or keeping the more efficient technology tools that M&I had in place, & not transferring account information from the old system to the new system, letting experienced employees go while bringing in new employees with no training/experience also made handling the work loads impossible. Lack of coordination between BMO Harris departments & M&I departments created numerous issues. For example: A certain procedure was being done incorrectly (actually illegally) by a department, & I worked for 4 months prior to leaving to try to get that department to change the process. After I left, my boss continued to work toward getting the process into legal compliance for another 2 years (until he left) to no avail.

What was more disconcerting was the person that was hired had no experience in that position whatsoever and simply had a degree. Mind you, I personally had 20+ years experience in the industry.

4359,,Customer Contact Agent / Call Centre Associate (Montreal),2015-08-20,2.0,Customer Contact Agent,A decent starting salary and some good benefits. Building facilities were great and the teaching was excellent. The building itself it located in a gorgeous neighbourhood which is more than I can say for most other bank call centres.,"This is going to be a little long, but this feel this is necessary for anyone interested in this role (given how they hire people for this at a near monthly basis) and for new hires alike. Keep in mind, this is my experience at the Montreal call centre. 

(On a side note here, please know that management demands perfect spoken French, even if they might downplay it during the interview process. It's heartbreaking to see people caught off guard when their accent gets them fired.) 

As soon as training ends, the honeymoon is over. This job is sales oriented and as such, you have to be ready to work hard to achieve targets. This wouldn't be a problem if the call centre managers didn't constantly harass you over why you didn't push something the client *obviously* didn't need and have the gall to claim that the job exists purely to help the customer. 

Secondly, the management here is a huge hit or miss and I had the opportunity to experience a bit of both. Most managers are obsessed with numbers and will harass you every so often to ""motivate"" you. There's a sickening amount of office politics and a good number of team leaders blatantly play favorites. Be sure to kiss up to your team leader because there's an insane amount of metrics seemingly used to just terminate people that rub the managers the wrong way. However some managers, though a bit few in numbers, can actually motivate you and push you to go into whatever role you're interested -  even if that means leaving the call centre. 

Which brings me to my final point - career opportunity. While I've heard that it's much, much easier for someone at the branch side to grow professionally, it's the opposite at the call centre. Yes, after a few months, chances are that your team leader will ask you on what you want to do and schedule some job shadowing (a term that means that you'll observe someone's work and see yourself if you're a good fit) but chances are that your team leader (despite your wishes) will push you to take another role at the call centre. This wouldn't be that much of an issue, if this didn't mean that you had to do your previous job duties (as a contact agent / Call centre associate) during busy hours (which is all the time) as well as your new job duties for a measly 1000$ increase in pay per year. 

If you're reading this and feel discouraged, don't be! Although personally I would play it safe and look for another job while you work here, there's still some chance that you might end up where you want to be. Just don't be fooled by all the promises and sugar coated stories the people at training might tell you - it'll leave you completely unprepared. 

When the turnover rate is as crazy as it is here, you know that something is wrong."

4507,,"Cause I'm all about that sale, bout that sale, bout that sale",2015-02-14,2.0,Assistant Branch Manager,"Point of view of a bank branch employee in Canada

1. In comparison to the general market of employers, there is a well structured benefits package such as determined pension plan, complete health benefits including eye, dental, medical care and others such as physiotherapy up to a certain amount per year, as well as life and disability insurances. 
2. General work environment is well structured and organized compared to say some other businesses where job description are blurry or business is to small and everyone has to do everything. (This is not necessarily bad but not for everyone.) 
3. Company is catching up with the industry in providing 21st century company wide tools such as Lync.
4. People who stay there for 2-3 years or more have passed the test of being extremely dedicated to their work and customers, and being able to put up with a tremendous amount of stress. So you can count on a usually strong team spirit, and reliability amongst colleagues. Truly dedicated and hardworking people. 
5. Recognition for achievement is encouraged between employees and managers.
6. There is a well organized coaching structure in place, but quality depends much on who the coach is.
7. In 10 years, I've never seen a case of harassment, sexual or other. Colleagues and managers are respectful of individuals and personnal differences in general. 
8. Great banking advantages like lowest rates available for loans, no fees on everyday banking and great financial advice, of course.","1. Uneven work environment quality. As in other workplaces, the branch manager and his boss, will make or break the quality of the work environment. So even if you shop for a great employer, you might be disapointed if you later realize this is a bad branch or area. 
2. Year 2014 has been typical of a time when the organization is seeking to rid itself of a category of employees that are not highly sales oriented. This has been observed company wide. Techniques like having the employees commit in front of the team to a certain number of credit cards sold for the coming day and having the employees state the number of credit cards actually sold to the same team the next morning, therefore making the employee administer himself both a positive punishment by being somewhat shamed of not having been able to reach the goal and negative punishment by the impact of the employees credibility or reputation lessened. 
3. The middle management pressures lower mangement and employees to contribute to the yearly charity campaign (in collaboration with a reliable organization which I will not name here to save their reputation). Gifts are made anonymously but teams are so small that everyone knows who gave and didn't, and sometimes, those may be pointed at. This happens in all small teams across Canada.
4. As stated in previous reviews, lower management is bullied into getting their team to reach sales goals, which then creates a negative atmosphere down the hierarchy. Some managers are wise enough not to transfer that to their employees because they can think on the long term. 
5. Company policies are such that vacations and long term leave employees are not replaced so you can end up with 50% to 25% of your team and still be required to reach your sales goals while keeping excellent customer service, even if you're already doing 3 peoples' job at the same time during this period. 
6. Those promoted to management roles are either those who perform in what they do in their current role (which doesn't imply or guarantee they will be competent in their new role) or, because they don't care selling anything to anyone, whatever the cost. So HR management is not necessarily one of their strength.
7. Exchange of opinions and ideas is encouraged as long as it reinforces the already stated lines of thinking promoted by the company. Critical thinkers are immediately labeled as troublemakers or a menace to unity (unless the manager in place is exceptionnal which is what it means, exception- nal). Those critical thinkers also immediately fall out of the group of favorite employees and can expect not to be promoted however compentent.

4509,,Making the most of IT investment and expenditures,2015-02-07,3.0,Preferred Client Consultant,"Banks and financial institutions in general are considered one of the single-largest investors in IT hardware and software solutions. This means that employees are likely to benefit from innovations sooner than most industries, and remain on the cutting edge of the technological divide.","Yet many banks and their subsidiaries continue to to struggle with legacy systems going back as far as the 1980s. The smorgasbord of incompatible systems and platforms make for complex and inefficient IT platform. This means more frustration, greater likelihood of error and less-than-perfectly satisfied clients."

4511,,"Good, not great.",2015-02-03,3.0,Commercial Account Manager,Flexibility in the markets we choose to enter locally. They took a risk in hiring a younger worker.,Training is not the greatest for newer employees. New employees held to same standards as veteran employees with little assistance from managers (who are too busy) and coworkers (it's not their job.
4512,,Credit Risk Methodology,2015-02-03,2.0,,"1) higher salary thanks to the quantitative premium, good for fresh graduates, or people with a passion in statistics/math/programming. Do note that credit risk in general still is less paid that market risk, since the latter enjoys another ""capital markets premium"".

2) This field recently has a high Asian concentration, as most staff speak Chinese to work. Maybe this is your cup of tea.

3) exit strategies i have observed include downstream of models: economic capital, stress testing, model vetting, provision, risk strategies.","1) long hours. our record in 2014: you walk in at 9 am and walk out at 6:30 am, because your senior management want to discuss your results at 7:30am. this may sound like extreme for a mid-office function, but working till past midnight is commonplace here. Personally I think part of it is regulatory pressure, part of it is the management within the bank.

2) barrier to enter. a typical analyst in modelling/model vetting has a Ph.D degree in a quantitative field, and masters degree is a minimum. But if you have done it already, this may be the right job for you.

3) often management will offer a contract for new hires first. I have seen 6-month contracts for new PhD graduates (as a more enforced probation), and some 1-year contracts. Some do stay on to be permanent though."

- I had asked my manager a month ahead if i could get a specific work day off because I had a midterm scheduled for that evening. She asked if i could move my midterm. I was surprised. And then she told me she couldn't guarantee me a day off because there is nobody closing
- employees get sick. We're human beings. If one employee calls in sick, we are short staffed. Everybody panics. 
- Not enough FSMs that work. Some days there are NO FSM's working
(2) Pressure out weighs the benefits
- Sales, sales, sales! They are really serious about sales, yet their products don't even compare to some other banking products out there. And at every coaching session so far, I have been put down over and over again. The sales targets don't make sense. We only get recognized if a customer has cues (pop up messages) on their screen. But referrals (without cues) aren't recognized. We are then forced to only care about those who have cues.
(3) Centralized banking operating system is not user friendly
- To all of those who have worked at other banks, be prepared to be confused. Their operating system is not straight forward, nor is it centralized. 
(4) Scare tactics
- I think your boss has every right to tell you that you are not performing, and if you are not performing, there is a chance that you may be let go. But for god sakes, do it nicely? I was behind in my target, I am catching up. More than most CSR's working. I have been told 3 times now that if i don't meet by targets in x amount of weeks, I will be fired. I then got suspended pay, and was told to come back the next day with a plan on how I may succeed, or get fired. Choice is up to me."

Management does not care about developing their employees into a better team only that they get their management tasks done.  Too many people rooted in their ways and not up for different approaches to solve problems.  A very stagnant work environment.  Always talks about BMO values but no manager really follows them.

The pay scale is a joke, for what they expect you to do and what you get is ridiculous.
They moved away from customer interact; they want you to just sell and leave the chit-chats.
They actually put the questions and phrases on the computer screen and if you do not action them they penalize you on your performance for that year.
They insult their employees on the so called ""3 meetings per day"" they would ask everyone in front of everyone in the meetings, how much referrals they got during that day or the previous day, and also they would let you pledge on how many you will get the next day or current day.
They do not reimburse you for tuition related to the Bank, although they say so. 
They would make any excuses NOT to pay out a performance bonus.
Management- it’s their way or NO way.

You don’t get 2 consecutive days off in a week, they choose when you work and when you off. It can be a Sunday and a Thursday, it depends on how the branch do business, normally the one’s with the most seniority gets the 2 consecutive days off, or the Management’s “favourites”."

It used to be great, but the last 18 months, everything has changed.",2014-02-06,2.0,Someone In Technology and Operations,"Very collegial group that I am in, with great co-workers who really do want the bank to be a better place.  Opportunities to work throughout the organization.  Company genuinely wants to be the best bank from a customer experience point-of-view, if only because their old-guard cohort of customers are dying off at a massive rate.  There is no shortgage of opportunity, but it can come at a personal cost.","We've developed a bit of a seige complex in our group, because of dealings with some very dysfunctional parts of the organization due to some bad actors.  Management and business partners have unclear expectations, with great difficulty explaining what they want, resulting in painful, time-consuming ""guess the number in my head"" approach to requirements gathering.  

Many of the managers have 20-30 years of experience, and there is llittle time or knowledge transfer offered to gain detailed expertise required about internal (unique-to-BMO) systems and processes.  As a result, there is a lot of tension and frustration on both sides, as fingers are constantly pointed at each other.

Constant flip-flopping and contradictory messages from managers and project managers on approach.  A person with 20 years experience in the real world would easily decide this is not the place for them, as this place exists in a time-warped bubble, before the days when things were actually written down, methodologies were developed, and managers received training on people and motivational skills.  In addition to the constant negative reinforcement, there is the ongoing feeling of having one or both hands tied behind your back.

Typical of banks, the pay is not great, and a LOT of unpaid overtime is expected, though not expressly requested.  But there is no other way to complete the tasks, and allocations across several projects of 55% and 60% and 30% do not add up to 100%.  No matter what is said about getting paid OT, there are always reasons given why you cannot claim it.  You have to sign off on it or face he!!."

Stressful work environment:
- Long lineups month-end and before/after holidays
- Customer's fraudulent cheques, outages on cash could land you in hot water any-day
- Potential bank robberies (had 2 at my branch when I was working there)

Career growth is heavy based on personal sales. If your branch location is not ideal, i.e. located in a poor area, then chances are you will be stuck in the same position / branch for a while, or even let go for lack of sales performance. 
My tips:
- Make sure you land your CSR position at a branch with lots of new traffic. (Not the same customers day in/day out). 
- Part time CSR position beats full time any-day. Full time CSRs have disproportionately higher sales targets than part time. Full timers also have to take care of start of day/ end of day treasury duties.

On the other hand, customer satisfaction score (NPS) is calculated as a team score for the branch. In other words, if your branch coworker pissed off a customer really bad, you will share that bad customer review on your scorecard even if it has nothing to do with your own service. 
Be aware low NPS is always used as an excuse by upper/middle management to cut back on year-end bonuses!

Side notes: 
Before the year 2012, CSRs only had 2 weeks of annual vacation.
As of summer 2013, CSRs not only have to sell credit cards, but also travel insurance!"

Benefit is really very basic, you have to pay around $600/yearly of your medical insurance even you choose the basic plan.  But, you have no choice not to take any insurance.

- No sponsorship for continuous education.  They sponsored you only on those ""a must"" license that you need at work.  

- You will got bug by your manager at least 3 times a day like taking medicine.  That's the management requirement to bug all sales related position including, Customer Service Representative (Tellers), Financial Services Manager, Financial Services Coordinator, etc... no matter you help them earn a lot or not.  I understand that many sales overcome this problem, bug by their manager when you don't meet your target.  However, not than often ""3 times a day""!

- Internal system is sucks, always hang...always hang 5-10 minutes is very common when assisting customer in some transactions.  So embarrassing and frustrated.

4816,,"Poor Pay, Too much Stress, Limited Growth",2013-07-09,1.0,Customer Service Representative,"- Your work stays at work,","The amount of stress BMO puts on their employees to meet sale targets is unreal. I have seen tellers push people to open extra accounts that would never be used just to meet their referral targets. 

I've seen tellers push people to get master cards even when it was crystal clear that customer were barely managing their current debt level.  

I have also seen tellers smooth talking 80+ year old customers to open additional  Master Cards even thought their current Master Card were not being used at all. 

 Don't get me wrong those tellers are not bad people, but because of the in-ordinary amount of stress they were being put under forced them to make ethically questionable sales so that they could meet sales targets and keep their jobs.  

Most tellers do not last longer then 6 to 9 months.  Most of them leave to jobs outside of BMO.


Overall  Summary


-Poor Pay, earning a living as a CSR (teller)  and living alone is just about impossible.  I would love to see our CEO Bill Downe try to live 6 months on the pay he pays his full time customer facing staff.

- Extreme amount of pressure put on staff to meet sales. My manager comes around every 2 to 3 hours asking for sales numbers.
- You have to push Master Cards on people
- You have to push people to open accounts and do investments with BMO.

- Poor future opportunity prospects.  

Your careers options are very limited only real place to go from CSR is into the FSM role (loan officer) that role pays a bit better but those guys are even more stressed about sells then tellers. 


-If you exceed sale targets its very rare you are acknowledge for it
-If you miss targets, management  politely hints that you are replaceable.     

-Dispirited work force, everyone from CSRs up to loan officers FSMs wants to leave the place.

In short too much stress for not enough money.  

Still the CSR role would be worth it if you could parley that role into a foot in the door with BMO into a professional job at HQ, but you really can't.  The CSR role is simply too far down and too removed from the type of experience that any professional job at BMO HQ requires and you do not get bonus points for already being a BMO employee.

  I would not recommend this job to anyone."

4844,,Customer Service Representative,2013-03-21,4.0,Customer Service Representative,"Retail banking is a great starting point to get into the financial services industry without a undergrad degree. Those who do well and have ambition can move up fairly quicky. Most branches will usually have a warm welcome and encourage socializing outside of work. As well, even if you aren't looking to continue your career in the financial services, working at a bank is a great stepping stone and is usually looked favourably on resumes.

Some specific pros would be the employee perks, such as preferred rates and a great Employee Stock Option Plan (ESOP). Honestly, I do not have many specific pros to BMO. I have worked at other Financial Institutions and they are all fairly similar.","Retail banking in general has a variety of experiences. It depends much on the branch you work at and your co-workers. Often ""cliques"" can arise, and personal relationships with your co-workers (positive and negative) will often affect how you are treated (especially by management). While you can rise through the positions quickly, the starting pay in the industry is nothing special ($12-$15/hour). As with all banks, sometimes overtime is not recognized (the 15 mins here and there that is, which adds up). 

Specific to BMO, I detest their use of a third party company to do the screening for jobs. From my personal experience and my experience training past hires, the other company could definitely do more. Some people I knew who applied were not passed on to the second rounds, where some people I have trained were terrible. There is a lack of structure in the criteria of who gets promoted. Often, some good quality applicants get passed over promotions while less qualified candidates get promoted."
