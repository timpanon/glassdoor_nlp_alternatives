Very little esprit and little desire amongst employees to extend contact outside of work. Little direction from upper management; a sink or swim atmosphere. Lack of workplace discipline and open architecture is terrible for focused work and needed confidentiality.  As a very high placed senior manager (partner) said, ""welcome to the pirate ship""."

130,BTG Pactual,Don't believe the promises,2015-05-27,1.0,Anonymous Employee,There are no Pros to working IT in New York.,"They do a good job at lying to you during the interview and making the position seem appealing.  It is not.  US IT is treated very poorly by managers.  Promises of training are just words in the wind.  Company has no titles so you are expected to do and to know everything despite your resume saying otherwise.  You are expected to put work ahead of anything else in your life.  Blatant favoritism creates a ghastly gap in pay between two people doing the same exact job (one employee gets the salary of another just as a bonus).  Incompetent leadership.  Burnt out and disgruntled employees who quite openly criticize the company and their management.  Not their fault.  Promises, if made, are never kept.  Zero leadership or accountability by managers.  Brown-nosing management uses employees as scapegoats while they do zero work themselves.  Zero growth potential.  If you are working in New York, you will not touch infrastructure other than creation of an occasional VM.  Everything is managed by London or Brazil.  Shadowing is impossible because no one has time for you."
