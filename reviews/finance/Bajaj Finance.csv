These people cut salary of every employee during covid.
Most of the people are leaving this organisation.
My suggestion is do not join this company if you believe in wellbeing. Officially it is holiday on Sunday but if you take a leave even on Sunday then they threaten to send warning letter via HR. HR in this company is of no use","Every year they change the Promotion rule and it becomes tough to get promoted every year. 
The HR will send the termination letter if you take leave on Sunday.

Do not put your mind, soul and health at risk.",2021-11-11,1.0,Senior Unit Manager,Financial compensation is competitive but it comes at the cost of your mental and physical health. I did not get it anyway but I have seen my colleagues from other teams earn it well. Just spare yourself a horror and DO NOT JOIN THIS COMPANY!,"Your immediate boss can bash your image on smallest mistakes at work upto the level that you won't get paid your quarterly incentives (everybody in Bajaj gets paid this component, except my team) and when you decide to move to another team they won't absorb you with that broken image. I have gone through it all. In my initial months of joining I was loaded with 3 people worth of work which made me do mistakes at work sometimes (even an expert would fall sometimes). With no clear instructions and understanding of work expectations from the boss you tend to commit small mistakes which doesn't go well with him followed by slur of abuses and me being tagged as non competitive.
You report to your skip manager about this after repeated tiring episodes and your immediate boss, engulfed in his anger goes after your career from that day on.
After working my mind off for 14-15 hours daily including weekends I was offered PIP.
No matter however you fare in your work if your boss wants to revenge you, it will be served cold.

After that no senior leadership listens to you and you are stuck wherever you are with no promotions, accelerations, incentives in sight for good.

 Have given my 3 years to this company and they have smothered it well and strangled my advancement. I would have earned a lot, grew well but a single guy with unquestionable authority and power restricted my growth illegally

Had my family to feed, take care of my old parents, my loans but it all got tossed away in the drains. The single biggest mistake I did was to stick to this team and company and did not fight it back aggressively.

HR is virtually non-existent and mere threads of senior leadership.

I have left the company on a very bad note. A lot of people could have assisted me, guided me but they did not as they were good friends with the boss and the empolyee policies are not employee friendly but only on papers. Hence I just did not leave the bad boss but also the bad company which could have used me in so many ways as an asset but failed badly in doing so. I blame everybody for wasting my 3 precious years, restricted my growth, broken me financially, and damaged my self esteem and morale which will take time to heal. Waiting for a good company to join now and will slap all the awards I shall earn in Bajaj's face one day.

Non competitive and callous people run this bad show who micromanages your life and not just work.

You imagine when employees were called to the office during the COVID peak, and we used to get daily mails of employee's demise after contracting Corona since the leaders think an employee is just napping at his home and business is getting hampered as you ofcourse don't trust them anyway. This is pure heartless."

703,Bajaj Finance,Company demands that you sacrifice every other part of your life in exchange for salary,2021-03-12,1.0,Team Lead,None whatsoever. Salary is competitive but not worth all the cons.,"1. ZERO work-life balance. Examples:
- You are expected to remain available 24x7, which means you will get calls at 5 pm on Sunday or at 11:30 pm on a weekday and you are expected to answer and do what you are asked. If you dont, your appraisal will be dinged.
- If someone calls you and you are unable to answer for 10-15 minutes for whatever, reason, that is enough time for someone to 'escalate' your 'unavailability' to your manager.
- By policy they 'allocate' you 36 leaves for the year. In reality you will be lucky to get 6. That too has to be earned though continuous overwork throughout the year.
- If you leave office before 7:30, you will eventually be scolded for leaving early very frequently.
- All saturdays are working. Not just that, you will be expected to work on a lot of sundays. You will be specifically assigned work on Saturday evening which is to be submitted Monday morning, to ensure that you work on sunday.

2. Toxic and abusive culture. Examples:
- Verbal abuse, bad language, expletives thrown about casually (and loudly) are very commonplace. HR is fully aware and powerless to change anything.
- Some of the seasoned bosses even make personal insults and vague threats.
- Get ready for either bad language or sarcasm for the smallest mistake.
- Most bosses / middle managers are either unwilling and unable to help you through tough situations.
- Getting work done from other departments is next to impossible and there are frequent arguments and blame games played over email. Expecting a reasonable amount of co-operation from co-workers is a bad idea.

3. Culture of overworking as a norm:
- You are always expected to be stretching. Your appraisal goals are set in such a way that you cannot achieve them by only working 9-10 hours a day for 6 days a week. You HAVE to stretch to achieve even your minimum passing metrics.
- If your superiors find out you are managing your given workload without too much stress or overworking, you will be rewarded with more work in the next quarter.
- If you are not visibly showing stress on your face, the default assumption becomes you do not have enough workload.

4. NO positive feedback whatsoever.....unless you resign and they realise it would be more difficult to train a replacement."

Nothing else I know","1. No work life balance: Every day you have to stretch for minimum 13-14 hours
2. Whenever you will get any national holiday like Diwali or Holi, you are asked by top management to come on Sundays
3. You have to give money from your pocket to customers so that they could take loans from your company with such a high processing fees. RSM and ZSM's also promote this indirectly
4. Very bad culture: Every body in the company could be heard saying bad words to subordinates for making them get the business
5. HR department is not good for anything. Once you are selected, they will call you every day but once you are onboard, they will forget you and will not even pick your call. They will take side of management
6. Once a customer takes Personal loan from Bajaj Finserv, he will never take it again. 5% on loan amount, insurance is charged. Means, if a customer has taken loan of 10 lakhs, he has to pay insurance of Rs.50000
7. They hire management Trainees from various institutes of repute and give them very tough assignments and put them in very difficult tasks/Responsibilities. And if they don't perform, they put them in Performance improvement plan and ask them to leave
8. Below E3 Level, they hire contractual  employees. They are hired with salary of Rs 16000 per month and are in contract basis. If they dont achieve their targets within 3 months, they are considered as dead log and asked to leave. So, a manager is only recruiting, training, motivating and again recruiting for whole year. And mark it, this hiring work is done by manager, no support is provided by HR department. I had personally spent thousand of rupees to give ads in Deccan Chronicle and Times of India to hire candidates
9. Manager has to achieve 1.5 crores of target per month. If he does not achieve this target within 6 months, he is put in Performance improvement plan and asked to resign"
