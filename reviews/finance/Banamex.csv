It used to be a place with proud professionals and the best place to develop ones career and learn from the best.  Now it has changed quite a bit. 
Many of its business areas are very profitable and have longstanding relationships with the most important clients all over the region.","Very long hours and lots of pressure to reach business targets but with diminishing resources (financial, technological and human capital). 
Too much control, oversight and scrutiny to all processes and even individual lives, making people feel uncomfortable and under pressure all the time. 
Silos and continuous power struggles at top management and middle management positions that damages collaboration between teams.  
Very poor investment in in decent physical working spaces, everything very dated, cramped and uncomfortable.  
Constant reshuffling of team members and even whole business areas. Matrix reports to different bosses with different agendas, diferent locations and management styles makes it difficult to ""please"" everybody and achieve the best results. 
Once it was a great place to develop your career. The fashion has changed drastically. They now prefer attracting people with specific skill-sets and pay big numbers to these people instead of allowing internal candidates to grow and develop within the Bank.  There are many internal thresholds, rules and limits to moving up and getting paid better.  This has resulted in many experienced people leaving the bank (searching for better opportunities) while at the same time many newcomers being paid lots of money but with some zero knowledge of the Banks processes, teams,  culture, etc.  This is quite inefficient because it takes a lot of time for the newcomers to adapt and start making a difference, while experienced internals are being pushed out."

61,Banamex,Great until the consent order. Mayhem began along with harassment.,2014-01-24,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"When originally hired on, the environment was interesting; meaning, their was a chance to vibe and tensions were not so high. I was able to interview, and once hired on, I took the initiative to learn everything i could about the financial industry. Reading, asking and involving myself with other departments. Inquiring about databases used, thus giving me the advantage of working efficiently granting me the time to continue my personal education. 
The banks clientele base is from Mexico for the vast part of it, therefore there was that phenomenal hispanic cultural ambience (which nevertheless sometimes had its drawbacks) but overall gave some flavor to the environment, not too bland, at least in most of the banks departments.","Before the consent order

Times were still hard. Problems with other coworkers would not get addressed properly, regardless of how much you would make a complaint. Some managers lacked the ""cajones"" to want to address such situations, or even sometimes work. Dominos took up a great part of those individuals agendas, therefore i could see why important matters could be forgotten.

The departments were atrociously set up, all different types of people did roles that did not pertain to them, nor should it due to conflict of interest in a compliance manner. 

I was fortunate to get promoted throughout my time there, but that is simply because i worked extra extra hard, and somehow made sure they had no reason to deny me a position that i could attain. However, others were not so fortunate. Their was definite favoritism amongst colleagues in other departments, and people who had zero brains, were randomly getting promoted to a managerial role. People who didn't know what their role entailed, and would call other departments and ask them how to do their job. Never understood this, but c'est la vie.



After the Consent order

Bank overtaken by an army of Citigroup VPs needing to clean up shop, and rebuild damaged goods. These people were a different beast of ugly. 

Short and sweet: definitely a new air was breathed, at first it seemed safe, then as more and more came, lets just say HR turned the cheek, and others brushed their harassing ways under the rug, and nothing was done. Thought it was a great chance for the bank to get back on its feet, soon after i regretted even saying that aloud."
