Applying for jobs is painful if not in a “core” location, even as a tenured employee, to advance your career. “If the location isn’t listed, too bad” kind of mentality.

The benefits such as vacation and sick time is generous.,"The company uses a top down control method to the extreme. The c-suite level managers are interested in micromanaging lower level employees. This is due to every line of business I’m currently aware of not having the option of working from home. The company also punishes the employee for not having certain vaccines. Sadly, they make healthcare more expensive. Why not add additional incentives for these procedures instead of making something like our healthcare costs more expensive? Also, at my office, the bank does not help with employee parking charges. This is around $180 a month.

Sadly, once you are salary, you are typically asked to work 50 hours week. I have seen cases upwards of 70 hours for 4 months straight, working 6-7 days a week depending on the season. Although you have great vacation benefits, the bank makes it difficult to use it all due to the workload they give you. If you leave on vacation, you will typically fall behind with only slight assistance from others to catch up."

I had a lunch appointment with a prospect opened 300k account and got chewed out because I wasn’t making calls. Priorities are wrong and market leaders don’t have a clue what to do.

Most employees are spending 50% of their paycheck on housing, if not more.

Removing work-from-home options after 2 years for ""company culture"" is heartbreaking for employees and their families. Especially with gas prices the way they are, this commute plus all the in-office expenses of having to buy work clothes, hand sanitizer, masks that actually work, extra car maintenance, etc. is creating a scenario where most employees are taking a sizeable pay cut.

Not to mention how bad commuting is for the mental health and environment of your employees. 

Other banks are offering more work from home/hybrid options and better pay--and many employees here are actively weighing their options to leave for elsewhere or retire. People are already on-edge and moods are notably down because of this change. Offering extra counseling sessions isn't enough."

They want you to say exactly what they want on the phone, no room for any modifications to make it personal. By the time you get done saying the script the customer is about over it, because they had to wait so long to get to a specialist. Also, saying Thank you So Much at least 5 times on every call is so ridiculous. It sounds so fake and phony. They are all about numbers and stats don’t really care about anything else. Management is terrible they are all very fake and phony. Worst line of business to ever work in.


Unrealistic metrics and low increase for promotions
The available shifts times, call handle time
Micro management can be annoying and overbearing
You have to tell management when your going on a restroom break
Management is okay but sometimes it is hard to find someone to help you."

674,Bank of America,There is now better out there,2022-03-02,3.0,Compliance & Operational Risk Specialist,"BOA at this time/in this job market is best suited for - 
1. Entry-Level / First job 
2. An External candidate looking to make a move from a competing company due to stagnant career growth
3. Internal employee whom is close to Retirement

* This is not the company you stay with as a B4-B5 level in the the middle of your career - companies will pay you significantly more to join them. You can always return (or not) in a few years, be in a higher pay range and gain great experience.
Pros:
1. Great benefits for employees who make under 100k a year.
2. Loved the employees I worked with.
3. Great work/life balance (LOB dependent).
4. Great PTO/Sick Time.","1. Expensive Benefits if over $100k salary - in comparison to competitors.
2. Lack of transparency/ease of mobility for internal applicants: 
A. Internal job postings do not provide any pay details/ranges. 
B. Band System (Role hierarchy) provides little value. 
3. Bonus is a joke. No start or target amount/%, it is a complete surprise. Bonuses were handed out to brand new employees (under 90 days) for same $ as existing/established employees. Bonuses average for B5 employees at 3-4% of salary. HR tells you 10-15% and this has not been the case amongst co-workers. (This of course is LOB dependent - other LOBs may operate differently)
4. Remote options and hybrid work schedules are not encouraged or promoted (don’t ask/don’t tell). Bank monitors and reports how long you utilize VPN. Return to Office has been in existence since Summer of 2021.
5. Parking is an added expense in CLT."

777,Bank of America,"Outdated, Mismanaged, and Hopeless",2022-02-24,2.0,Client Onboarding Manager,Insurance and flexible WFH Schedule,"Onboarding team was generally mismanaged and neglected to the point of stagnation. High turnover rate, extremely low morale, old/outdated systems, poor communication, unnecessarily elongated onboarding processes. 

Repeatedly told process improvements are in the pipes and told to wait while the only process improvements implemented are for higher ups to pad metrics that are useless. 

 You will be heavily reliant on other teams/co-workers to move things forward, and will always be at your expense if you’re not hounding teammates to complete the work. 

Career opportunities are essentially “work until you drop out and go to a different team. “

Insurance benefits are nice, but HR is generally useless and is not responsive to inquiries.

Your role will have you being 7 teams at once, when drowning with work management “listens” and forgets as soon as the call is over.

Work/Life balance is frowned upon, working OT/ past 7-8pm was the norm to STAY ON TRACK with the work."

782,Bank of America,"Big/bureaucratic, old school bank with less competitive pay but good work/life balance (at least in Charlotte)",2022-02-23,3.0,Vice President,"-Most roles outside investment and corporate banking are pretty much 9-5
-Corporate culture is very rah-rah, meaning a desire to win in the market and be loyal to BofA. Many folks have worked here most of their lives so you can build a strong personal brand and network
-Very risk-management focused (the Bank learned lessons from the Great Recession) so you don't really have to worry about seeing the company in the news for compliance issues or other shady things
-The bank is huge and loves to hire from within. Practically, this means if you network well you can have different jobs (or careers, really) in different lines of business without leaving the bank.
-Technological capabilities are pretty good; you feel like you have the tools you need to do your job
-Generally very good health insurance (pretty much free meds from pharmacy, good co-pay rates for doctors and reasonable deductibles)
-Pretty lax with tracking vacation time; as long as you get your work done, take time off when you need to","-Human Resources (HR) and their recruiting and on-boarding processes are embarrassingly horrendous. HR can be brusque, lazy, and completely unaware of how to place people in the right roles. Be VERY careful with whomever your HR rep is, and push back if you're getting a bad feeling about them. Once they place you somewhere and you've signed your contract you will be screwed if you didn't make sure to look out for yourself very diligently. HR is an incompetent gatekeeper with too much power on its hands.
-Stingy when it comes to base salary and bonuses, especially in comparison to its peers in the industry. In addition, BofA seems to pinch pennies on business expenses (e.g. watches price tags very closely for business travel, vendor costs, ""extras"", such as employee blackberries, etc.). Also has a policy of maintaining/not altering employee salaries if you happen to move to a more expensive city. As such, be VERY sure about what city you choose to be placed in, as whatever salary you get there, that's what it will be. Meaning, if you get a role in Charlotte and later decide you want to transfer to New York City, Chicago, LA, etc. the Bank will NOT pay for a cost of living adjustment. You'll take your same Charlotte salary with you.
-Very bureaucratic and tons of red tape. It can sometimes feel like you are actually working for the government vs. the private sector. This has its pluses in that you can have a good work/life balance without intense stress all the time because you can fly under the radar or at least not be scrutinized daily (at least outside investment and corporate banking, i.e. consumer and everywhere else), but it also means you have to be VERY proactive about building your career or you can fall through the cracks, be bored to death, and have your skills atrophy. This is more for Charlotte; it seems the New York City offices are higher intensity and more efficient, which of course makes sense culturally."

Operations/Compliance motivated by risk mitigation, taking time to perform reviewed (adding to lead times), back and forth on documentation and procedures.
- Positions do not list salary pay range. You have to do your due diligence to research and ask people willing to share their salary. And you have to negotiate with HR during hiring process. Annual pay increases are determined based on performance rating given by management during annual review and compensation increases decided by management. Limited room for any negotiation.

Worrying about having a banker at all in your branch was constant. Often branches are left with new management and a new team leaving little experience available to customers.

You can work for the company for almost a decade and they dispose of you like trash. You can ask managers and employee relations and HR for help and they don’t care. When you call voicing frustrations that the place you have been transferred to, unwillingly, is 2 hours round trip from home & the commute is causing unnecessary stress on you & your family, they tell you to see a therapist or a doctor to find out how to deal with it. Branch can have no toilet & they tell you you will have to drive across the street to go at the grocery store. Told management there was a strong smell of propane/gas in a back closed door room (that we used all day and had to keep the door closed while we were using it and the bank is open for business ), for a year and a half, only to find out later after something else needed fixing that there were not 1 but 2 gas leaks. Asked a manager one time if I could go pump as a nursing mother with a newborn at home & was told I had to wait quite some time (Even though there was plenty of staff coverage for me to use my required lunch break to do this), while I was in pain and about to leak through my shirt. Employees that were a known close contact & in the presence of another positive employee, are not required to submit a negative test upon return to the branch and only needed to take 2 -3 days off. At the beginning of the pandemic the bank allowed people who were “high risk” or had “high risk” family to stay at home getting paid for doing nothing, then were trained to work in the call center department from home, while the rest of us (including people with high risk family who didn’t know they could call and work from home), were torn from our home branches and forced to drive all over the place so far from home in branches so crowded with angry customers there was no way to socially distance anywhere. This was under the guise that we would be going back to our branch however now they’ve started closing them permanently and not working with the employees to find them a place closer to home or they shuffle people even further away without asking. We are forced to wear bank provided masks (that are not KN95 which are supposed to be the most effective). The bank slogan of “we’re better when we’re connected” is a sham. There has never been more disconnect between employees and management and employee relations than there is now. Given the current worldly events, this is extremely disheartening. This bank does not care about employees even the employees who have put in so many years of their life, dedication and talents and spent so many hours away from their families commuting to and fro.

I really believe that they have the best and brightest in retail branch banking working for them in the financial centers and throughout the leadership team they have in Philadelphia. If you end up in that market be sure to find a market leader to connect with and mentor you. You'll learn and grow a lot. 

-Their training is top notch. They really focus on providing great learning resources. They make it really easy to navigate the workplace and serve bank clients their.

-The benefits are the best I've ever seen at a bank

-After working for 3 different retail banks in the Philadelphia area, it's clear that Bank of America is way ahead of the game with technology.

-If you are serious and all in on building a career in banking, I think Bank of America is great place to be. I've seen my co workers take on plenty of responsibilities outside of the RM role that provided career growing experiences and exposure leading to promotions.","Some of your success depends on the branch you're located. I was moved around a couple of times. At one branch I was at over 150% to goal for the quarter and got a big quarterly bonus. At other branches I'd be under 30% to goal, prepping my ""the reason they let me go speech"" for my co-workers and back here on Glassdoor comparing salaries for the next job.

The weekly outbound calling target for each RM was too much. The script to do it was very weak. Without an effective script and/or the flexibility for an RM to have a real conversation with someone outside of it (due to bank policies on outbound calls), making calls everyday was almost a complete waste of time.

-You will be micromanaged. There is a metric and target for every activity in the branch. The pressure to hit every single behavioral target is intense and can be off putting at times."

The work environment is so bad that the single resource has the ability to bad mouth /yelling the new comers and can do whatever he can.

Also there is lot of support and appreciation given to vendor resources in the project. All I can observe is Manager and the single resource had placed lot of pressure on me so that I would be leaving the project and they want to replace my place with some new vendor resource.Finally I have resigned and then I got in touch with HR during exit interview and explained the situations which made me to do so.

1829,Bank of America,Only 3 stars because of the pay and benefits…,2021-12-16,3.0,Software Engineer II,"1. Very competitive for the location
2. Great benefits package!
3. Decent work/life balance
4. The bank is starting to modernize their tech stack by introducing a version of Vue that sits on their internal framework. It is slowly starting to transform from their more internal framework to more “plain old” Vue than the internal framework, which is good thing to IMO since Vue offers a far superior developer experience.
5. Programmers start to get yearly bonuses in 2022 along with restricted stock units as well or so I’ve been told.

To be frank, of my job didn’t pay what it pays and didn’t make use of a modern UI framework like React or Vue then I would not be working here. I suspect the same from a lot of others!","1. Many areas of bank are still using the banks’ internal framework. IMO, It’s not very intuitive, is very clunky and slow, and thus difficult to develop on. Anti patterns are found everywhere and it all stems from their internal framework. More than that, it’s not really like anything else that is that a modern UI developer would already be familiar with, so those skills won’t be transferable to other jobs. Therefore, your skills will not translate to BofA’s internal stack either. I HIGHLY recommend making sure that you are working on a job that uses Vue or React so you don’t have to worry about your skills becoming useless to the market at large should you ever choose to leave.

2. They are not 100% work from home even though there is no good reason for devs to work in the office. They are somewhat flexible though, but most days you’ll need to be in the office. However, if you need a day here or there per month to work at home then you typically can.

3. They banks security software is insanely strict. They have even blocked stack overflow for god’s sake! I mean WTF, right? If you are in the states then you can still get access but if you are not then you absolutely not get access to SO whatsoever on the banks proxy server which is very stupid IMO. I wish they’d get called out publicly over this and change this god awful rule.

4. Documentation of internal tooling is very scarce. Even the docs to get your environment setup was “half-assed”. Probably by some employees who got tired of helping everyone but didn’t have time to make proper documentation. In other areas in the back, it only gets worse… much, much worse. This needs a drastic overhaul because it’s a freakishly easy fix.

5. For the reasons above, I definitely get the feeling that the software engineers are still second class citizens at the bank despite the fact that more and more people now days set up bank accounts entirely online. The feeling I get is that they aren’t interested in making top quality products, but that they are more like “hey let’s get us some of those software people to make some stuff we need to stay competitive in the digital age”, only they do slightly more than the bare minimum. That said, it’s still definitely better than most other SWE jobs simply because of the massive resources that they have. I wouldn’t worry too much about this for more than 10 years or so because Ally Financial is completely online and is now BofAs main competitor in Charlotte, and they actually do treat their software engineers like first class citizens despite the fact they have far less resources than BofA at this time. Like I said, that will even out in the near future though. Especially if BofA doesn’t get on the ball and start making everything with updated UI technology.

6. The developer onboarding experience is terrible. Please fix it. You should have new hires monitored very closely for the first three months regardless of their skill level with coding. There needs to be some sort of mentoring program started too!!"

You can get involved in a lot of extracurriculars supported by the bank which is nice.","Like any big company- your management team can make your life great or miserable. Unfortunately, my experience was the latter:

-despite exceptional (exceeds/exceeds) peformance, minimal pay raises (1.8-2.1%) with no transparency on the compensation formula. 

-watching 50-year old managers have panic attacks over a slide deck about some non critical topic.

-always being promised a promotion to the next band level due to exceptional performance, but never following through despite being persistent 

- below average stock bonus and no ESPP

I’m sure there are plenty of managers who create a positive environment but after 5 years several of my peers have similar feelings.

There is always (always) a very urgent /emergency push to produce any deliverables , despite how menial the task. Everything is an emergency."

2271,Bank of America,Relationship Banker = Teller,2021-11-10,1.0,Relationship Banker,Good benefits. Seems like higher pay than other banks but relationship bankers are the lowest paid employees at the banks.,"I was hired for the relationship banker position and they leave out a huge part of the role in the job description and interview process. You’re a teller most of the time (possibly all of the time). This is because they are no longer hiring tellers. Relationship bankers are the lowest paid position at the banks. You get paid BofA’s minimum wage. There is nothing wrong with being a teller but that is simply not the experience and customer interaction that I was looking for. As a relationship banker working as a teller they expect you to ask probing questions and set up appointments. When you’re at the teller line and there is a line of people waiting that is unrealistic. I think that the title of the role and the description is a bait and switch tactic. They use the possibility of promotion to keep employees motivated but I saw very little signs of promotions at the two financial centers I worked at. Also, they hired me and trained me at one location but wouldn’t tell me what bank I would end up working at after training. They’re very inflexible about switching roles. You must be in your role for at least a year before they consider even transferring you to a different location. They promise that they try to place you near your house but they really don’t care. I also heard from others that they were moved to a new bank with no notice- just an email to show up at a different bank the next day. Everyone seemed unhappy."

Most of the people managers there need upskilling, and they lake minimum qualification to manage teams.

Management never seek employee input and ignore any suggestions or advice.

It can be frustrating for her hires and many leave after six months in some cases. Other banks offer 6% 401k this bank only 5%. There is no clear direction in some areas which leads to little work getting done. They segregated Project Managers from Agile Teams so morale takes a huge hit. This is not the bank Hugh McColl ran.

2348,Bank of America,Terrible experience in the Credit Center as a Lending Officer,2021-11-05,1.0,Commercial Lending Officer,Learning how to look up information in a policy that is 700 (seriously) pages,"I was a Commercial Credit Lending Officer in the “CreditCenter” department for 3 years and had a horrendous experience.

The department has a lot of talented and hard working people but most LO’s in this department are overworked and miserable, mainly due to high turnover which strains the work capacity of all the remaining LOs. The department is a sweatshop, as everyone has to take on way too much work and struggles to keep up with their portfolios. Working efficiently in this department is very difficult as employees have to deal with convoluted procedures and primitive / glitchy computer systems. At my prior employer I won awards and was recognized as being in the top 5 producers out of 50 in my department but in this department I am continually being told I am not doing a good enough job on my unreasonable workload. 

Upper management, sitting in Chicago, should be ashamed and embarrassed by the horrible situation this department is in. Management tries to make improvements and changes, but the changes they make are just band aids. The department has been in such bad shape for so long that I don’t think management realizes how bad the situation actually is...

There are three kinds of people in the creditcenter department: New employees, those who are looking for a new job and those who have given their two week notice. Bank of America pays decently but they could have doubled my salary and I would not have stayed in the department. 
In the past three years during my employment at Bank of America I have developed a sleeping disorder, started therapy sessions, and have seen significant weight gain...I am now happy to have Bank of America in my rear view mirror."

2379,Bank of America,"A good retirement home, but definitely a trap for any ambitious person",2021-11-03,2.0,Institutional Equity Sales,"- Impossible to get fired - if you're junior, just come to work & you will likely be employed the next year. Biggest risk is breaching compliance e.g. not completing your training on time (that is VERY serious). Managers just need to clap like seals when senior managers talk & they are set. If they can write fancy emails and cc mgmt that is even better. 

-Pay is good relative to the amount of effort you put in (close to zero)

-Good entertainment perks e.g. Dinner budgets","- Most managers won't teach you anything. Mgmt's KPI is how well they can delegate work to subordinates. Most have 0 idea about the business they are running, but rely on competent subordinates to do the job. Most subordinates will eventually leave, except those who are trapped on 500K salaries but contribute very little. 

-Bonus is one of the lowest on the street. Unless you're the CEO making 23 million dollars & taking a private jet from Charlotte to Boston every week. Don't expect to be paid well (esp in Equities) & your bonus is not very well correlated to your output (which is intentionally kept very vague). 

-Feels more like a charity than a bank that cares about profits. I understand the importance of diversity/inclusion, but it is done a bit excessively here. E.g. Internal seminars that teach you how to interact with LGBT.....

- The bank actively disencourages innovation. Obviously, they don't put it like this, but try to suggest new ideas & it will likely die in layers of bureaucracy after your request is forwarded through three different continents. Most technology applications & popular websites are blocked, and most tech teams will either not respond or come back to you weeks later. It helps to have a boss who has sway in the bank & can help you get resources, so if you don't.... then too bad. 

-Onboarding clients is a pain. The amount of documents required by the team is often painful for clients, and clients who want to do business with us are often turned away for random reasons such as 'Lacking potential'. These decisions are often made by people in the team who can't tell the difference between alpha & beta.

-Everyone good is gone. There was once a time when there were still good people in the division. I define good as people who know clients well & have a good sense of the market. Those have mostly gone either to the buyside or moved to other houses. This means that the people you are left with cannot teach you anything that will make you useful to clients. 

There are so many more but these are specific to this bank and specific to a division and specific to a region."

I was forcefully placed on disability leave while incapacitated due to prolonged complications from COVID -19. It was very obvious that my termination was expedited due an unauthorized leave of absence that i wasn't aware was placed on. By the time i had recovered enough to try to understand the reality of the devi stating consequences it caused for my family, I called and was told no information could be given because i was no longer an employee and the three sentence termination letter stating that I took an unauthorized leave of absence that I never requested or initiated, and that i will also be considered not re-hire able should answer any questions I have. As soon as I can get back on my feet and somehow get a job in the industry i have been in for over 18 years, and fix my rent history and pay down my utility bills, I will be perusing legal counsel to have my termination investigated as a wrongful termination."

They attempt to motivate you through fear by docking pay of yourself and your team and do not reward going above the standard minimum.
Other than losing the authentic client interaction through the numerous repetitive disclosures and scripts you have to read, you're also encouraged to set bogus future appointments for customers and lie about how many client interactions you sit with in a day. Every year your bonus pay will be deducted and our team calculated individually we'd lose between a range of 19-21% of our annual pay for 2021. 2020 we lost 8%. 2019 we lost 5%.

The small team I get to work with are sincerely wonderful and passionate people who work extremely hard every single day despite the lack of support from up top.","COVID has had a crippling impact on the company's culture, or at least in my center it has. They pander to the public in the media about how socially conscious they are now, but their lack of involvement in poor disenfranchised communities like mine make it clear that this is all a thinly veiled PR stunt with no substance to speak of. Upper management continues to move the goalposts with regards to their expectations for financial center employees, and they consistently fail to follow through on their word.

They routinely neglect the emotional well-being of their associates. Turnover and staff shortages are rampant with no end in sight. There is always a long hold to submit HR complaints because they are also understaffed and inundated with frustrated employees. 

Upper management seems to be willingly exploiting the dysfunction. They are completely unable and or unwilling to grasp the severity of the problems financial center staff face on a daily basis. Yet they attempt to micromanage every asinine detail of their associates' workday despite the fact they are essentially never physicslly present, opting instead to cower at home remotely while their most vulnerable staff are left to scramble together answers for leadership that refuses to accept critcism of any kind.

They want to wring their hands and deflect accountability because of the pandemic, but only in ways that suit them at the top. For regular employees who aren't given remote work options, too bad. This is why people have always felt since the beginning that ""essential"" is actually just code for ""disposable."""

* The business basically collects rent in the worlds largest economy , so regardless of what state your projects are delivered in .. if they are at all ... it doesnt matter. The goal is to take as much money as possible from the annual technology budget. Whee..

* If you come from a rich London family you get promoted even if all your deliverables fail.

* You get to see what one extreme of ""interesting"" culture looks like !","* If you are one of the people doing the work, sucks for you. Expect zero bonus. They will take your project, throw you under a bus and give you no bonus. This is of course a small price to pay for an up front seat to see how these people work.

Your gut is not wrong, you are capable and should move on fast before you get stuck at the Applebee’s of financial firms. The amount of internal company/division specific programs they continuously create for you to “achieve accolades” are only so great within the firm. Just like being the best waiter at Applebee’s – memorizing that menu like the back of your hand and getting pins for your achievement -- that translates to nothing in the real world for you to build your career on.

If micromanagement isn't a good fit for you steer away from this job.
Job promotion is contingent upon which employee the manager and regional manager favor the most.
Unclear on what the requirements are to become branch manager, many that are in these positions aren't the most people friendly and don't have the best interpersonal skills needed to be a respected branch manager.
The tellers are being pressured into becoming a relationship banker to coincide with the new direction the company is headed potentially forcing many qualified employees to seek new employment or early retirement.
The work life balance leaves you tired, stressed and working 6 days out of the week which makes it hard to plan for any family events or personal time. 
Schedule requests are required for the year in advance (may be branch manager preference) which is the most unrealistic request.

If you do what you're told, don't try to stand out, you can coast and get a steady paycheck. This is the job you hold if you're fine doing the same thing every day and a 3% pay rise is fine for you.","1) Ambition is not rewarded. 2) If you take a day off everything goes wrong because no one else will know how to do what you do. Your work life balance will be ruined. 3) If you go back to school expect management to assume you want to quit. The company boasts they want to change things and improve processes. What they really mean is make easier to use spreadsheets that almost automate what you do, or can automate you out. I ""upskilled"" myself while there and never got any offers to move up despite the company forcing us to attend meetings that explain how upskilling will help us move up in the company. They have training modules that give you worthless certifications at the end. The certifications have fancy titles. No one ever noticed or cared. The only person who did seem to notice was my immediate manager who felt if I had so much time to complete training modules then it means I don't have enough work to do. Also, you're told to do upskilling training modules in your free time but discouraged from doing it during work hours. But you're not allowed to do the modules from home. The company says one thing but does the other. And expect to be lied to by managers if you ask for a raise or want to apply to a different team. I was always able to hear my manager through the door and I know how they speak to each other. There's still some systemic racism. I didn't want to believe it at first but its there. Sexism is very obvious."

Diversity in hiring people from many ethnicities.","99% of all loan officers quit the firm over the last 10 months when they took away our monthly commissions and replaced it with quarterly bonuses. They fired most of the support team which the responsibility of those roles fell upon the loan officer. They retooled the position and now loan officers are now loan officers and relation managers opening checking accounts, credit cards,and auto loans. The bonuses for this type of work reduces the pay of the loan officer by 90%. This is why they quit. I'm in temporary disabilty however I will be fine soon. The most senior level loan officers who've worked there for years have all quit. Now the underwriters are quitting and its incredible that loans are even closing. My guess is they will be permanently shutting down the division or making the position centralized. Oh and they overwork everyone and trim their pay every year. This business model of screwing their faithful employees will catch up to them one day."

Stable company will probably be around a long while.","Office politics are very heavy here.
The money to be made is at the top echelons--most of the top execs are raking in large annual increases while most workers are getting a tiny percent (if anything). Even strong-performers get only small annual increases which are nearly the same as under-performers. Increases are usually less than inflation.
The work is less satisfying here because much time is spent on meeting the requirements of regulators and auditors rather than actually doing IT work.
Once in a position, if you do a good job in that position, it is virtually impossible to move to another position. Moving to a new position is very much top-down in this organization--the management decides what you should be doing and they will move you into that role with little or no input from you.

To the 5 days you would get elsewhere. Vacation package is standard but maternity/paternity leave is excellent. Childcare reimbursement is great and so we’re my coworkers. Most of them I’m still friends with. Immediate managers mostly do the best they can and are amazing people.","Building was old and in need of updates. Call center environment was extremely micro managed and metrics were unrealistic. It requires you to be on one hundred all day long with a 30 minute lunch break. Working at that frantic level with back to calls is unsustainable mentally and takes a toll. I developed high blood pressure, I gained weight from stress eating , it exasperated my PTSD by constantly triggering adrenaline responses. As a result it was difficult to sleep and created a feeling of dread every morning before work and every Sunday thinking about the week ahead. I’m a single mom so when I got home I didn't have the energy I needed to take care of home. You can’t schedule vacation when you want. It’s often denied. If you are new and want your kid’s birthday off and a senior person wants the same day, they would get it. All of that adds to the stress level. Plus, I was struggling financially off of 55k as a single parent with 2 kids. I worked hard and sacrificed to get my s7, and s66 licensing.

It. is very hard to move out of the call center as every one wants to leave so there may be 5 openings with 100 applicants. So it’s extremely easy to get hired but very difficult to get promoted. The pay is sub standard. Upper management (2-3 levels up) can be prejudiced and resentful. Location does matter. At my site, there were very little opportunities to move up and those who did move up were often the ones drinking and partying with Managemet on Friday nights. I’ve seen my black high performing colleagues (top 3) get passed over for promotions for very trivial reasons. I wasn’t using my talents. I left for a competitor and was hired on the spot for 40k more plus bonus and for a higher position in the company. They were able to see my worth and I’m happy now and thriving. Thirty pounds came right off within 6 months. As far as Diversity and inclusion: lots of people of color at the bottom and gets pale as you move up the pyramid."

I believe Brian Moyihan continues to think of his people and his company and chooses to make the right decisions.","Most of the Bank mgmt still believes in working from the office instead of remotely. It was proven with Covid that people could be very efficient and productive working remotely if they choose too. Management mentality is ""butts in seats"" which is not logical. Obviously certain roles require being in an office (ie branch, people in data centers etc) - but the vast majority should be ABLE to work from home if they choose and not be chastised for it. Eliminated pension plan contributions (much like other companies) - but grandfathered in those who had them earlier. Dental and vision plans need to be enhanced -- they are pretty much the same of what's been offered for over 20 years. Especially with Covid -most people are working longer and more stressful work (and home) lives - but there is always some sense of urgency by mgmt which demands impact on personal life."

If you like constant sales goals and helping clients who may not understand the financial world it might work for you. You can move up in the industry but the sales goals increase with every promotion.","Stress-
Everyone I knew who worked here was constantly stressed out. You have to do more than your share of work most of the time. Long lines, out the door during peak days. Very little help, especially during the pandemic. I would do anywhere from 100-250 transactions per day. Had to verify every single transaction at the end of the day, count my teller box and that of the vault. Do all the reports and most of the closing and opening procedures. If we were short staffed I had to count other tellers boxes as well. The center I worked at had very challenging clients. We would receive threats and complaints on a semi daily basis. They installed over head cameras to look at everything you do. Which is fine, but it piles on the stress knowing they're watching every mistake you make from a remote location. On top of stress from the clients, the low staffing, you have to promote sales goals for the personal bankers. It pays well but it is very demanding."

- Good health benefits for low wage employees
- Great support and benefits for employees with families.
- A company that is truly making changes to ensure every employee is treated equally.
- A culture of doing the right thing that ties into reducing regulatory, financial and reputational risk.","- Risk and control culture makes getting things done a hard endeavor.
- Emphasis on cost cutting due to the reasons mentioned below.
- Disconnect between the taking points from senior management and the ground realities in terms of compensation and ratings.

Bank of America is a very very very large bank with more employees than its competitors with larger market value and balance sheets. The companies culture has gone through a drastic change with emphasis on simplification, reducing risks, adding more controls and as a result a shrinking company. This is probably good news for many of its core customers and its shareholders but as an employee its a mixed bag given many of its competitors and Fintech can offer very exciting opportunities rewarding higher risk taking in terms of innovation in terms o technology. The control and risk averse culture means that BOA would shy away from pioneering any drastic change or a new venture looking at its competitors to take the pioneering risk in terms of new products, technology etc."

Considering the minimum wage here in Delaware, Bank of America pays pretty well.","The work load is terrible. There is always something new being added on to your already long list of task. Management pushes out a few slides for you to read, then wants to label you an expert. The lack of support from management is terrible. Management brushes you off when you have questions, they try to avoid you during crucial times. If you like feeling alone, and not supported BOA is for you !
The work load, and work environment may cause a huge strain on your health, physically , and mentally. I would not recommend BOA to anyone.
During these tough times of a pandemic , incentives were cut. As we were advised we were ""abusing"" incentives (although we work extremely hard for them) , also yearly bonuses were cut. When we asked management , we were advised there would be no bonus "" Considering all that was done for us this year"" As if us being allowed to work from home was some sort of privilege. 
Everyday you are shown management does not care about you, only what you can do for them ( Take calls), and that customers are way more important to them than their own employees. Management can be extremely condescending, and flat out disrespectful, not only to you , but to customers at times, as well . 
Truly I would not recommend BOA to anyone, since working here I have experienced several health issues that are work related, and have not been supported at all. 
I suppose there is room to move around within the Bank, and traveling to several different departments. However that is assuming you will be supported. I told my manager that I wanted to branch off to a different department, and was told"" she doesn't like to see good employees leave, she'll look into trying to give me a good review"" essentially trying to sabotage my career within the bank."

So no matter how hard we worked to help a client when they received a survey, they would give us a bad rating.
