0,Bank of Baroda,Not a company for hardworking and motivated individuals,2022-04-05,1.0,Assistant Manager,I had diverse responsibilities and I really liked the fact that we could help poor people in some way or the other.,"There are many cons about Bank of Baroda:
1. I faced discrimination based on gender. 
2. I was mentally harassed. 
3. I was never appreciated for my hard work. 
4. There is no work-life balance (going to work on Sundays, staying until 10-11 pm)
5. Male employees given preference over female employees in everything.
6. The management only supports the branch head. 
7. Their only response to a crisis is to transfer the employee to a different branch rather than get to the root of the complaint and giving a fair judgement. 
8. The infrastructure is abysmal. 
9. Many employees get away with not doing any work because they are branch head's gossip partners.
10. It is a very toxic place to work at."

118,Bank of Baroda,My experience of 7 years with Bank of Baroda,2021-06-21,3.0,Senior Manager,"1.Its PSB so you have job security.
2.You get to work in various profiles.
3.Opportunity to work at foreign locations.","1.Transferable job, transfers can happen at very remote locations all over India .
2.Future promotions will get slow now onwards due to lac of vacancies at higher scales and also due to mass recruitments and promotions happened in last 5 to 7 years. It will be a bottleneck kind of situation.
3.Nepotism is rampant at all levels and specially at corporate offices.
4.Talent is not always valued by higher ups. Your bosses are also public sector employees then don't care if talented people are under-utilised or not utilised at all.
5.Salary will increase once every 5 years by process of Bipartite settlement. The process which starts in every 5 years takes at least 3 years to complete, so you get new salary after 8 years.In between these 8 years if you are not promoted , then only rise you get is by way of dearness allowance which is like increase of around 2 or 3 k in salary after every quarter.Sometimes Bank also reduces DA so instead of rise your salary gets reduced for no fault of yours.
6.Salary of all employees in same scale will remain same irrespective of job they are doing, Eg.If you are a dealer in treasury and earning crores of rupees of profit for bank you will still get salary as that of person working in rural branch whose work is to only pass the daily transactions if that person's and your scale is same."

9) Overseas postings are very biased.
10) No laws against protection from unruly customers. The staff is suspended till that unruly customer gives a satisfaction letter in writing. Hence public thrashing staff by misusing the freedom Bank has given to public.
11) Staff forced to enter into weird absurd campaigns where higher management wants staff to do some QR code transaction forcibly from their smartphones, even if customer is not interested.
12) No such employee harassment protection cell, as HR is also the one who is there to harass you to an extent you have never even imagined.
13) Higher management wants officers at branch to beg to the public so that the bank can meet PM Modi's expectations, just to show in paper and real development is zero. Thats how IMF showcases high GDP for India by seeing just papers."

414,Bank of Baroda,JOB CHANGE,2017-07-03,5.0,Marketing,"1. Interacting with people:

It is the biggest and the best job for a person who likes to work and deal with people. In human resources, you get an opportunity to manage people working in the organisation. This work can either be in terms of social work or it can be more clinical in nature. Depending upon your degree and experience you may get to work in a social welfare or may be in tackling psychological problems.

2. Diversity in workforce:

No other work in a company provides you with as much scope to interact with so many diverse people as a post in human resource department provides you with. As your job mainly concerns with social welfare and human emotions, it gives you an ample amount of opportunity to explore variety in workforce to get to know about different culture and religion at one place. This can be an exciting offer for someone who is somewhat into anthropology.
3. Helping people to find their aim:
As a part of the job in human resources, you get to interact with a person who gets frustrated with their repetitive task and gets distracted in their career path. So as a part of this team you get a chance to provide direction to such lost entities and provide them with a sense of duty and responsibility. Also, you help these people in achieving and aiming for higher goals that will help them in developing their personality and working skills.
4. Helping people to remain productive:

For proper functioning of a company, it is very important that the employees work at their utmost productivity. But every day doesn’t go the same way and every employee need not have the same productivity level on each working day. So human resources people need to motivate those people to achieve great and to keep the productivity of the workers at best.

5. Having direct impact on the organisation’s output:

The best thing about being a worker in human resources is that you may not be having the technical knowledge on which the company is based but you still get to handle the most important resource of a company – humans. Getting to know talented personnel and ensuring their well-being in the company will aid in advancing a company’s motto and vision. You will not only be making a company better but also achieve higher.

6. Influencing various policies of the organisation:

You are not only in the account of handling humans but also in the task of ensuring smooth functionality of the company. So it becomes obvious that you get to influence the company in many decision-making processes. You need to assist your company in right path so that the company can take decisions that are in the interest of the company’s benefit and profitability.

7. Ensuring the top performance of the company:

As an human resource employee, you get to look into lots of matter that has a direct impact on the output of an organisation. Hence, it becomes necessary for you to handle various variables that are operational in making a company work out and be at its top-notch performance which includes ensuring the productivity of the staffs, motivating people, ensuring that company uses the best policy to attract and maintain a pool of talented people as well as doing own task with utmost dedication.

8. Chance to mold the future of an organisation:

You get to recruit the future employees of the company if you get a higher post in the company. So it is very important that you get to know the needs of the company and at the same time balancing the pools of talented candidates getting recruited in the company.","1. Work load is huge:

The working demand of the job is huge. Working with equipment or machine is completely different from working with people. There is no simple set of equations or list of instruction that can help you in dealing with problems related with humans. So human resource managers and workers have to learn on their own way to manage and adjust with the difficult situation of this career.

2. Handling the problems of various people:

This job requires you to listen to the problems of a variety of people. Each person comes with its own unique problem ranging from administrative problems like not getting salary on time to emotional problems like depression or stress. This makes it very difficult for the human resource worker to adjust with a changing scenario very rapidly. Thus, it can get you into the state of frustration and low productivity.

3. Acting as a mediator:

Handling factory matters is a bit of risk as you not only need to fulfill the needs of any lower employee but you also need to make sure that the higher executives and management need not have to face any trouble. Thus, it makes it a very daunting career to pursue since you can get stressed out getting in between the two, acting as a medium to satisfy the needs of both the parties as well as deal with clients welfare as well.

4. Stressful job:

This ever demanding job makes it very stressful for most of the human resource department to fulfill the post requirement every day. In some places where there is a high chance of a turnover or constant conflict of employees the job becomes even more stressful and at the same time asking for great input as you will be in charge of finding a solution to the problems.

5. Learning about company and its various departments:

Though you may be dealing with people but in order to make sure that you are able to comfort people it is essential to learn about the company and its departments. This makes sure that you are able to understand the actual problem and give solution accordingly. But many times you hardly get to learn about different department affair and as a result it becomes a daunting task to learn about other department problems.

6. Boring cubicle works for new candidates:

For an entry level job in human resources department, most of the work is related in handling paper works which mostly consists of sorting the resumes of candidates, ensuring proper time schedule of higher managers, regular paperwork tasks, and performing various everyday office works. In an entry level job, a person rarely gets the opportunity to work with people or directly impact the output of the company which can make it frustrating for the candidate to continue at the job.

7. Politics:

Politics is present everywhere and human resources sector is no exception. The path to be in an effective human resource post, which is at a higher demand, is not easy as it is covered up with lots of office politics and messy rumor. This makes it difficult for the new employees to go up into the rank of higher position just only through sheer job and performance. No doubt it is the quality of one’s working capital that matters but these things make it difficult for the people to achieve success in future life.

8. Need of experience:

Though the field is very lucrative but in the real market most companies seek only those professional who possess certain experience in the field. So it makes it very competitive for a person to get a good career in the human resource department in big corporations.

9. Keeping up with growing competition in the market:

One of the most important functions as a human resource employee is to impart training to the other junior employees. Imparting training is not a difficult task but if you are in a sector that demands constantly updating the people then it may be a difficult task to make sure that every staff is capable of absorbing the knowledge, be comfortable in a new setting and also be at the top of their productivity.

Therefore, we can see that human resources as a career is very compelling for those who love to do social work and working with different types of people. So according to your ability and the pros and cons presented here, you should decide whether it is in your best interest to work in the world of human resources or not. If you are one of those people who wants to impact the performance of a company and who likes or is better in handling human related problems then a career in human resources is the best for you. Not only will you be working with lots of people, but you will also be in charge of different jobs that will have a direct impact on the performance of the company, helping an organization to shape its future and earn profits in the future."
