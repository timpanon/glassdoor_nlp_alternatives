But the issue here is Senior Management in Branch banking who ‘micro manage’ staff, don’t listen to or support their Team. They intimidate them, (and give negative feedback weekly which only affects your self esteem)and create a culture of shame and fear which is completely unacceptable and something that no employee should ever have to tolerate in their workplace.

4. Good I&D aspects but heavily politicised 

5. Work/Life balance is great cos there’s no reward for extra effort so with permanent WFH, get your work done then log off

1. No culture at all - Claims the best feature is the people you work with, but with permanent WFH you never meet them 

2. Has drank far too much of its own kook-aid - really thinks it’s something special when it was only set up to exploit the UK Banking Prudential regulations post-crash.

3. Pay too low

4.Obsessed with acting like a big bank with none of the talent, ideas or rewards to genuine talent

5. Executive committee is made up of mediocre managers who couldn’t achieve anything in their previous employers who have joined BOI UK 3 grades higher than they should have to get a big payday until they retire in 5-10 years time.

69,Bank of Ireland,Toxic Environment,2022-01-31,1.0,Mobile Mortgage Manager,Pension benefits Sick pay benefits,"Most appalling Role ive ever had within a financial institution, the management team regularly engage in bullying and coercive behaviour to prevent speaking up or out against the countless examples of mistreatment of staff.

Staff are given forced sales targets, which are more of a wish list than anything based on reality. If they aren’t achieved bad reviews are Applied by the management team slandering Staffs professional records and withholding measly pay increases, politics is rife and the atmosphere toxic. 

The core managers look after each other by applying high review ratings to themselves and then apply bell curve ratings to the rest of the team.

As such motivation is based on fear rather than job satisfaction with staff terrified of receiving a bad review. Staff turnover is high and bank staff satisfaction reviews always scathing. Staff are all forced to work weekends nights and constantly while on their annual leave.

Systems are non existent with no access to a workflow and resources a scarcity.

Atmosphere of the sales team
Is that of a boiler room mentality with staff hounded for individual sales figures, this is in spite of the banks official line of personal targets being forbidden and also
contrary to the central banks target culture concerns. 

Pressure is so intense staff engage in predatory lending practices to try to generate numbers. Mortgages
Are split, fake applications for friends and family submitted are submitted. Strikingly similar to the Wells Fargo scandal! 

I would seriously consider you're mental health before accepting this role."

509,Bank of Ireland,Customer service advisor,2019-10-16,2.0,,Lovely people who worked in the call center. A good institution to have on your cv.,Where to start...I struggled a lot with this job due to the abuse and aggressiveness that the customer showed employees over the phone. It would not be uncommon for employees to leave the office in floods of tears. Tedious tiring work with strict adherence. Everything you do is monitored including your bathroom breaks. There is a negative attitude in the air of “us against the customers” which makes it hard to stay positive in an environment like that. The abuse and really difficult conversations I was expected to have with such a lack of support was one of many reasons as to why I left. You’re expected to deal with irate customers day in day out and at the end of it all you’re really just a strange form of counselor for the customer. There is also a lack of promotion and unless you’re in the popular clique they won’t look at you twice.

- Where as before at  an entry level there was a path to progress, now you have to grease the right palms and hope that you get a chance at advancement after you have stepped over all of your ""colleagues"" in the process. 
- Where as previously everyone in the building helped out in all aspects of running the business, management have instituted a sales vs service mentality, us vs them. It hurts staff and customer alike and in some places is utterly toxic.
- The exodus of staff from branches to rivals, myself included, has only worsened the previous two points and has left those still there, be it because they are holding on to a cushy pension or because someone else hasn't hired them yet, are stretched far beyond capacity and frequently work through breaks and are forced to do daily overtime. A day off is something you have to beg and plead for, often to no avail, to the point that a half day to attend a funeral, true story, is a none runner.
- Behind it all, management are willfully ignorant of the issues facing staff. Having daily conference calls, patting each other on the back at the ""great job"" they are doing while all around them their staff are overworked and on the cusp of breakdown."

Holidays - I've seen scenarios where people had to beg to get a day off. Most staff carried over 7+ days last year due to this. 

A branch isn't a branch any more. It is segregated into sales vs. service causing a divide amongst responsibilities. In the past, it was a all hands on deck approach.

Stress levels in branches is at an all time high and extremely unhealthy level due to lack of staffing and the general daily workload.

- managers are given allocated parking and offices. A nice perk, but symbolic of its culture and modern companies arent like this. Its 2017 and most places are open plan and value equality.

- often called to meetings over human traits. Its overbearing. 
- poor pay for the job it is. 
- judged and assessed on personalities rather than performance and capability. Sadly, they think they are being 'tactical' but the result is to lose the wrong people.
