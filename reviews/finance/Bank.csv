I love having a CEO that represents diversity run this Bank.,Schedules are not flexible. There should be a core work time and as long as an employee is there during that time they should be able to work either early in the morning or later in the evening. When converting to new apps or versions of new system the people that make the decisions need to get the input from the people that use the system.

Tightening of expenses and lack of resources to perform your job effectively.

176,,"Rude & Condescending Management, Worst IT Ever Experienced, Poor Department Structuring & Expectations.",2021-09-15,1.0,AML Investigator,Remote work available for role at hand.,"Rude & Condescending Management, Worst IT Ever Experienced, Poor Dept. Structuring & Expectations.

Rude & Condescending Management: Multiple Managers are blatantly rude and irresponsive. As well as constantly condescending.  Approach to on-the-job training consisted of; incomplete transmittance of information, shutting down in providing any follow up information upon case needs (after a request to have feedback be submitted via email for tracking purposes, rather than over the phone - as some information may be missed/forgotten etc), as well as constant passive aggressive questioning in regards to unrealistic (and seemingly unique) quota & case management “requirements”.

Worst IT Ever: Over the course of 8+ months, system accesses needed for Day 1 everyday work, were still unavailable / not provided. IT ticketing system would constantly need follow up, or new ticket creation for any action to be taken (mind you this teeth-pulling process took place over the course of months at a time for the majority of requests). 

Poor Dept. Structuring & Expectations: High turnover lead to constant management switches. Managers had too many Investigators on their teams & therefore did not have the adequate time to sit with each team member, until  weeks or even months past case submittal, for each case.  Expectations are exceedingly high given the clunky and analog nature of their VDI, IT and systems management. Not to mention inner-case needs and departmental (Branch) response time lag.

Managers sit in their offices week after week on never ending conference calls on useless ideas of how to increase productivity and it’s always a number game. Management then has to force these boring sales tactics onto sales team and expects them to have more and more responsibility each year with title changes and no salary increases. The annual salary increases are the biggest joke I’ve ever seen in my entire 28 years of life which is usually about .15 cent raise per year. The environment is hectic and very draining

Currently when you are promoted internally, they don't right size you. Instead they try to only give you a 5-10% raise to save the company money which is a terrible practice and will cause us to continue losing top talent to outside organizations.

Every one is working 60+ hours per work and being told it’s never enough. People are praised when they are online made into the night or weekends. Absolutely no work/life balance. It’s discouraged that you even take time to focus on yourself or family. Every person at this company is doing the job of 2-4 people and burning out quickly. It’s unmanageable and the expectations are unrealistic. The leads and senior management spread gossip and lies about you to make themselves look better. They don’t care about anyone but their own self. Good luck making it. If lucky enough to make it through the annual layoffs (they say they never do it then do it every year) that is.

I have not seen tools to address this like we have for other issues so those folks get left behind the training and improvement curve have also seen our recruiters not forward qualified applicants because there resumes, letters or social media do not meet the expected formats or footprint. they should think outside the box and take the time to find or ask for the information instead of determining it is to much effort and just dropping them from the recruitment pool. we lose quite of few internal promotion opportunities with that."

I am proud to represent BOTW, I have access to insights that would only be provided to upper management at other banks. I appreciate that.","I wish we had better technology for some of our products, I know we are working on that currently.

They make diversification and environmental improvement a priority. I am proud to work for a company that actually puts their money where their mouth is. This may not be true for every segment of the bank, but my whole chain of command are amazing individuals. My Market Leader encourages both myself and our entire team to look for ways in which we can improve processes, and then share our findings with him. He then takes the recommendations and actually does his best to make the suggestions happen. I can not say enough about what an excellent experience I have had.","While improvements are being made, the technology we utilize has some room for growth."

Overworked with poor pay"
366,,Company goals and values don’t align with management action,2021-03-09,2.0,Service Banker,Bank of The West does offer great benefits for part time and full time workers. Your co-workers are supportive. Team collaboration is emphasized in the branch to achieve quarterly sales goals.,Region management does not support the branch work. While sales goals are an important part to the company the branch is also required to achieve operational excellence. Region management pushes the branches to only focus on sales and is not concerned with the operational goals. While the company says they support work life balance there is very little concern for personal time from the region manager. When you are promoted to a new position the raise is minimal (cents) while the responsibility and work load doubles.
367,,Nice place to work,2021-03-06,4.0,Teller,Flexible with my college schedule,"Very corporate, rather than personable"
368,,Being cheap is not a competitive advantage.,2021-03-04,2.0,Associate,"Exceptional International, specifically European presence. Risk adverse bank that performs well in times of crisis. Lots of nice, laid back employees with pockets of talented individuals. 

Loads of potential to be a true banking force in the US, but management has fumbled the opportunity thus far.","With this US based bank’s shareholders being a larger French bank, there is almost no reinvestment into the business. It is quite apparent that that this arm of the group is only useful to drive profits. 

Expect to be paid far bellow market value. You can make 60% more at a similar regional bank, and 2-5X more at a similar sized international bank. Do not expect your hard work and talent to be recognised in terms of compensation. The bank did exceptional well last year but will not pay its employees accordingly. 

Rigid bureaucratic structure that limits productivity on a day to day basis, but also hinders top performers from quickly climbing the ladder. A higher focus is placed on years with the company, rather than productivity and effectiveness. 

No youth. Lack of any junior positions or any sort of rotational program for graduates. This is particularly alarming for the future of the bank, and adds to the ongoing issue of no company culture. 

Very poor response to COVID. No assistance with WFH shift. This includes financially (expect to fully equip your office yourself), personally (no chances to build relationships with your team members), or emotionally (expected to work longer hours and keep the same level of output with constrained resources and no mental health program). 

Do not expect to be treated properly unless you are from France."

Senior managers have no idea how to run this side of this business. Goals are impossible and you can’t work late because they will call you out on overtime. Employees have addressed concerns and they keep on getting ignored so will take to social media platforms now. A response here won’t be enough. Fix the problem. I advise nobody to apply for the sales part of Home Equity. You will regret it. This is a serious problem.

I hear from other people within different departments that every time they lose an team member, additional work would be put on them and just overwork them. I heard from Sales people that their goals were high compare to other banks. One last thing, technology.

Bank of the West also has a large focus on mobility, ensuring every employee is either in or searching for that position or department that may be the best fit. Including cross-training and tremendous opportunity for lateral and vertical movement.","The only downside to working at Bank of the West has nothing to do with the employer, but is due to being a customer-focused or retail-based company. As with any customer-facing company, the customer is sometimes a problem. Though many positions here at Bank of the West are not direct or consistent customer-facing, and with the mobility options available if customer-facing isn't the best fit there are other places within the company to move to."

Good work/life balance.,Run by indecisive megalomaniacs with no concept of how to lead constructively. Greenwashing to the nth degree with little to show as proof of making an impact.

Promotions are not based on merit or skill if they happen at all. Anyone who is highly qualified doesn't stick around. No mobility although they talk about internal mobility all the time but it isn't true. Managers who do not know how to lead and will throw all their staff under the bus to save themselves. Managers are absent all the time and there is no room for innovation or new ideas. It is always of the mindset of we have always done it this way so this is the way it will be done.
Don't bother with submitting any complaints to HR or to have any shady behavior investigated. It will get pushed under the rug and it will all get turned back around on you and you will either get let go or written up."

Systems are terrible. Account management is a revolving door with a new person every 3mo. With the exception of very few, underwriters could be the most inexperienced and unknowledgeable people around (very bad). Hiring credit managers from Wells Fargo hasnt turned out well either. No marketing of value where they harp on defunding tobacco (most banks have policies that prohibited them from financing tobacco for decades) and oil exploration which made the entire state of North Dakota mad. Other marketing is taking advantage of the LGBTQ communities where they say they are the best company to work for if part of the LGBTQ community. However, its a ploy and marketing to get the support of that community without contributing anything. if you want to actually get something done, be prepared not to have a work life balance.

Front line supervisors are stretched beyond their capabilities with little support.","Senior management does not seem to care about the constant attrition, sad and depressing state of morale, or the never ending technology problems. You cannot run an efficient department when employees are frustrated and leaving and forcing others to work mandatory overtime to pick up the slack.

The bank is very green (eco conscious) and community oriented and cares about the environment and protecting it through paid green buildings, policies, initiatives, volunteer hours, credit lending policies, etc. Willing to change and enhance processes and technologies to improve work and conditions. Good handling of COVID-19 work conditions and support. Good 401K and match,.","Starting pay and bonuses can be very good, but merit increases are lower than many of our competitors. Good benefits, but the employee cost is much higher than at most large banks. Technology also appears to be behind the industry norm, although it is improving and the senior management appears committed to additional enhancements. Compliance training is frequent and is often tailored for a global workforce, so the translation, examples and training can be awkward and confusing. Slow to embrace a work from home culture where possible-- although that may change after the COVID-19 pandemic ends. Mandatory time away policy ( every employee must take at least 7 consecutive calendar days away from work every year, including weekends, holidays, etc.) is not much of an issue if you get 3 or more weeks of vacation a year, but for those with less vacation, it can be an hindrance."

We aren't able to finish one thing and move to the other because we keep getting interrupted and asked to re-prioritize and focus on something else.  This is very frustrating.  Also, we are supposed to be transitioning to Agile however management is still not in the Agile mindset and wants status reports all the time, in multiple forms.  Very time consuming and not valuable."

New ideas are welcomed and shared. The work I do feels meaningful and allows for personal growth and learning along the way. My leadership makes me feel valued and consistently provides opportunity for two-way dialogue that allows me to share my perceived strengths and opportunities as well as allows my manager to do the same. The company's focus on the health and wellness of our planet as well as the financial health of our customers makes me feel proud of where I work.,Obvious challenges with the current environment makes the human connection element difficult. We continue to look for ways to engage in meaningful and safe ways as we work through the ever-changing climate our industries are facing.

483,,Great Place to Work,2020-11-20,5.0,Senior Cyber Security Manager,"BOW strives to have an inclusive positive work culture.  In my experience Management at all levels and especially senior management has an open-door policy for staff to reach out.  Pro work from home culture made the switch to 100% remote simplified.  As the culture was already in place to have a remote workforce staff and management alike were at ease with the new norm.  There are several initiatives currently in-flight so there is plenty of work to do.   All in all, this is the best place I have worked throughout my career.  I advanced in my career and exponentially gained knowledge through my roles at BOW/BNPP.",As the institution is currently in a changing environment sometimes work-life balance can be disrupted.  There is a lot of change and the institution is in a continuous state of flux.
484,,Not Just Another Bank,2020-11-16,4.0,Customer Service Representative,"If you are concerned with Ethics this is the place to work.

486,,In Transition,2020-11-04,2.0,Marketing Manager,"Not much to talk about. The people you work with are great, the benefits are OK.","This is not a company to build a career at as the new management slowly got rid of the older management and replaced them with friends. Eventually the same might happen to them if the current CEO is replaced. In the 5 years I have been there Assets have grown, employees were reduced from 12,000 to 10,000 and yet profits are stagnant.
1) Layoffs are business as usual, even though Layoffs never happen at the Parent Company (BNPP)
2) Not growing where it matters. For Banks to grow, they need to grow customers without losing existing ones. As a regional Bank competing with global Banks in it's key markets Bank of the West is always out gunned.
3) Few growth opportunities within. They have programs to identify and promote future leaders, but after a few years there is only so much you can advance to.
4) Even fewer opportunities to move to BNPP. It seems there are so many French who have opportunities at the Bank, but there is a less of a career path to HQ. They don't even offer French classes to make the probability higher."
487,,Still Under Construction with major changes constantly,2020-11-03,2.0,Senior Vice President,Great benefits and pay. Wonderfully diverse culture. Empowers women and equality.,The culture is still under construction. They don't know who they want to be when they grow up. The Executive staff lacks the commitment to drive real lasting change and they are very short-sighted. They make decisions based on gut rather than metrics and a measured approach. When they do decide on a direction they lack the commitment to follow through with it. The company is lead very much by the EMC (Executive Management Committee) level. everyone else really doesn't have a say. If Nandita just mentions she wants to do something everyone scrambles and will do it without stopping to think if it is best for the company or aligns with the current committed plan. This sets up an ever-changing environment that is unstable and doesn't produce results. They have had several layoffs recently and will most likely continue into the future.

We updated our systems to try and make things more efficient and I’m counting down how long it will take before it actually is. I know they have a team working on trying to make it better but there are days you just want to quit because of the systems. We have goals to meet and rely a lot on our partners when are partners are “too busy” or can’t handle the load then our clients are left uncalled or there is no follow up which I think is not going to help anyone or the bank.

I have been working with people from different departments - treasury, finance, compliance, legal, marketing, sales strategy, operation etc. Over 98% of the people I have been working with are professional, enthusiastic, loving to help others etc. They are just GOOD people. However, most of them only have AVP, Officer or even Non-Officer title forever. Getting little paid and doing the most work.","1. Systems are outdated, not user friendly, chaotic and confused. You have to submit different requests/forms from different systems/sites for different software/access. EDW, Hyperion, UltraQuest, HOST, Front Door, Sharepoint site..... Some needs SR request, some needs EAM request, some just needs you knowing someone working in the IT group. And after you submit the request/ticket, you may wait forever to hear something. Response frequency is long.

2. Some senior management are harsh, arrogant, unamiable, cold and impatient. And these people have SVP titles. Especially some SVPs under the CESS team. Some of them don't have any idea of what they are doing everyday. They are lack of prospect of how to make the Bank better.

3. Communication is disconnected between teams and people. My last day working in the bank was a Friday. The admin in our team submitted a request to deactivate my badge on the Saturday after my last day. This makes sense. Due to COVID, my entire team is WFH. So I planned to go back to the office to return my laptop and grab my own belongings on my last day. I went back at around 3:45PM that day. However, front desk told me my badge had been deactivated 3 days ago. Therefore, I was unable to go into the building. Front desk said they would need their manager’s approval to get me in. But their manager was offline at the time. I had to connect whoever I thought could help - by calling, Emailing and texting. Waiting until the following Thursday I finally could go into the building to return the laptop and grab my own stuff. Not a good last day experience at all."

First Mortgage and Home Equity are one the same deadlines, but Home Equity brings double the volume. It’s been addressed plenty of times but it gets brushed off which led to my leaving the department. No work life balance and you’re expected to cram impossible deadlines in an 8 hour shift and when you work late to finish your days work, you get called out on overtime. Senior management does not know the daily routine of Home Equity Mortgage Banker at Bank of the West. The only reason the top sales people are on top is because they just take the application and make the branch bankers do all the work. This has been a very bad experience and my suggestion is to stay away from Home Equity Sales with Bank of the West"

564,,Don’t Believe Their Marketing,2020-06-18,1.0,Business Analyst,"Free coffee, tea, and water.","I worked for Bank of the West for three years and left due to racist management and discrimination. The bank promotes itself as having an inclusive and diverse culture and making the top 100 lists for diversity and inclusion. This includes the bank promoting itself as being one of the best places to work for LGBTQ equality and diversity. I reported comments a colleague made in the lunchroom about another employee, ”looking too manly and not sounding like a real woman” to my manager. My manager never reported this to human resources or addressed the issue with an excuse of making things too complicated. The actual culture experienced by me, and many others is not representative of how the bank advertises itself. The bank’s main objective is to be recognized as a top employer for diversity and inclusion to make themselves look better to the public. What the bank should be doing instead is stop looking for recognition and start earning respect from their employees and allow them to have more influence in the growth of the company. Bank of the West’s senior leadership, middle management, and human resources do not listen to, recognize, support, or respect minority groups. Instead of respecting employees, management and human resources act in the best interest of themselves by keeping issues silenced, so their teams and the bank overall appear to be inclusive. The bank needs to allow and support employees to challenge the problems like racism and discrimination; then, the culture can improve and align with the company’s bare minimum diversity and inclusion policy. An inclusive workplace is one that treats all individuals fairly and respectfully. Individuals need to have equal access to opportunities and resources, and where each person can be a contributor to the bank’s success. Unfortunately, with the persistent racism, harassment, and discrimination, it doesn't allow employees to feel safe at work or feel comfortable being themselves. The bank excuses the high turnover of employees due to those who have left not aligning with the non-existent diverse and inclusive culture. Diversity needs to be respected and experienced between colleagues and teams rather than senior leadership, briefly speaking of it. During my time with Bank of the West working in consumer banking and commercial banking, I never felt safe with having racist managers for each position I held who silenced employees if disagreements arose. It’s a shame that Bank of the West advertises itself as inclusive when it’s clear they are purely using it as a marketing scheme to increase business and their bottom line."

The bank is on the cusp of a big change in technology and capability

The people really make the job fun","Where we may have the backbone of BNPP support, it is disorganized. There are no standards, little processes and the ability to work with BNP is often challenged with little to no resources understanding the processes. 

Executive Management has continuously made questionable strategic choices from a HQ relocation that left us lacking institutional knowledge due to our inability to retain Veteran employees. All the way to continuously allowing product teams to sloppily release new half baked products with no sales support, implementation or customer service support. 

If you put in 180% effort and exceed goal m, you will be treated the same as your coworker who puts in 20% you will be treated as equals."

Had multiple regulars say they would only work with me because they didn't want to be sold to all the time. Escalated this issue to a pretty high level and was given a BS overly-corporate answer in return. I was also routinely required to due cold calls. I was hired to be a banker not a telemarketer. Company says they only want you to sell products to a customer if they actually need it but the reality is that they want you to sell every single product to every single customer and if you don't it won't end well."

644,,A miserable place to work.,2019-10-19,2.0,Senior Instructional Designer,"There are some pros to working here:
•	The 401K vests immediately and the bank matches up to 6% per year, which is very good for the banking industry. 
•	Good vacation time accrual (2-3 weeks a year or more).
•	PTO (Sick time) hours allowed is very good. 
•	Flexible with unpaid days off if you have a family emergency and are out of PTO hours. 
•	Most of my coworkers are friendly, smart and hardworking. 
•	Depending on job/department and manager, it may by Independent work with minimal supervision. 
•	Some jobs can be remote up to 100% of the time. 
•	My job can be fun and rewarding at times.
•	There was a recent re-org in my department in an attempt to make everyone ‘more efficient’. 
•	My former boss was amazing and was great at appreciating us as individuals, and as workers. 
•	My new boss is very nice and wants you to make remote work and work/life balance a priority.
•	The bank is trying to be more efficient with people, money and physical assets. With mixed results.
•	A lot of different benefits are available to most employees. (Legal/Life ins./credit monitoring/tuition reimbursement).
•	There are a lot of choices of medical/dental/vision plans with varying costs. 
•	Lots of ‘new blood’ are hired often who bring in new ideas and new ways to do things.
•	Most employees get a raise yearly. 
•	The bank has finally decided to focus on its home state, California, to drive business growth.
•	Bank of the West ‘cares’ about its employees.
•	Bank of the West tries to invest in earth friendly projects and companies.","There are a lot of CONS to working here: (Long post, but worth reading)
•	The 401K MIGHT be the best incentive to work here. Honestly.
•	Employees have to take at least 1 week off consecutively, which may not work out if you have a family. Some positions must take off for TWO STRAIGHT WEEKS, which is just crazy. 
•	Some of my coworkers are lazy, rude, idiots. I’m not sure how some of these people have worked here for 5+ years, much less hold down a job, at all.
•	Having too many employees working independently can bring DOWN productivity and create ‘silos’, even unintentionally. 
•	Some employees in my own department have no idea what jobs other people, sitting 5 feet away, are doing. 
•	Many of the middle managers at the bank are like petty teenagers. They gossip and talk about the others behind their backs and will throw anyone under the bus to save themselves. Luckily for many of them, no one notices, because there is SO MUCH incompetence in the V.P. levels and up (in almost every department)
•	My job can be stressful, unnecessarily, when incompetent and lazy business partners try to blame you for their many failures.
•	The re-org caused the bank to lose so many talented people, many who had been with the bank for years.
•	My former boss seems miserable in their new role.
•	My new boss works hard but seems ‘out of their element’ often. They are not very inspiring as a leader. 
•	The bank HAS NOT become more efficient with people, money and physical assets. Bank of the West make HUGE plans, and then rarely follows through, or gives up on those plans, often without notice.
•	Most of the benefits are pretty expensive, and the bank has made it much harder to qualify for some of them, (like tuition reimbursement).
•	All of the Health insurance options are very expensive, Bank of the West has never offered very good benefits, in my opinion. 
•	This year the bank decided to shift much of the cost of their health care costs onto their OWN EMPLOYEES. Shameful!
•	They have a new tier based system to offset premium costs on lower salaried employees. 
•	Do your research before you do you annual benefits enrollment this year you’ll see they are actually just passing more cost on to everyone. A few in the ‘low pay’ bracket will save some % annually, but the Bank is actually saving themselves millions by charging their own employees a large % more. This is the Bank basically cutting the salary of half their employees! 
•	Most of ‘new blood’ hired realize after a year that they made a mistake. They rarely stay for 18 months or more and then they find another place to work where they will get paid a FAIR salary.
•	Most employees get a raise yearly….. Of 1%. 2% if you FAR EXCEED expectations. They make you feel bad for even ASKING for more.. ‘the bank is having a hard time financially right now…’ What? Bank of the West made $540 Million in 2018 and also got a huge tax cut. Being cheap with employee compensation is one of the main factors as to why they will never be an elite bank.
•	I've worked here over 5 years and some new hires make more than me. 
•	The bank could pay employees for the skills they have to offer. Yet, the only way to get paid fairly is to leave the bank, and come back as a NEW EMPLOYEE. 
•	Now they implemented a new 6 point ratings system (for the annual review) which is designed to keep 85% of all employees in the Meets Expectations range (or lower). This will lower the average ratings overall and most employees rating, so they can pay out EVEN LOWER raises and bonuses (if you one of the lucky ones to get those at all). 
•	The employee Individual Development Plans (IDP’s) are a way to make you feel like you have to defend your job every year. You will need to track every document, email, project, training class, phone call, IM, etc. to ensure that you can prove you worked since your last review. If you don’t your job may ‘go away’.
•	The banks ‘Take California’ initiative took off like a lead balloon. I hardly hear about it anymore. California, has a massive economy, but the bank has failed to make it an asset. 
•	Bank of the West (claims that it) ‘cares’ about its employees. They do not, it is a lie. Don’t believe them. You are an easily replaceable cog in the machine… that’s all. They will underpay and overwork you and make you feel bad, if you complain. 
•	
•	Instead of paying the employees and making them feel valued, employees are getting transferred, outsourced or having their jobs eliminated. 
•	A very smart, talented and hardworking Instructional Designer was just eliminated last week, strictly to save money.
•	The bank continues to relocate staff to Tempe, AZ the last two to three years. This has led to losing many good workers. Will continue to have smaller scale layoffs in the future, which is further hurting morale and makes workers afraid to make a mistake, or even call in sick. 
•	The people aren't moving to AZ (as management had planned), they're taking the severance pay. So now they have cut that back by a lot as well.  
•	Expenses have been cut back so much that we have to wait months for software or even weeks for office supplies. Sometimes invoices come back unpaid and you have to PROVE why it was necessary to buy that office supply 2 months ago. 
•	Bank of the West is SO SLOW to change. They waste millions of dollars on software (Appian) but never spend the money to make sure it ever works or is implemented correctly. Every system launch/rollout in the last 2 years has been a massive failure with huge down times and sky high promises, yet with miniscule results. Often the IT and Tech fixes for the systems take months to implement and are usually just Band-Aids. 
•	Also, adding new systems and processes, while moving most of the IT jobs to India will never work.
•	No promotion opportunities. They hire managers from outside and don’t promote from within, so hopefully you like your role, because you will be in it forever.
•	More former managers are not there now than those who have been promoted. 
•	Management is becoming more heavy-handed and micro-managing employees, which is not how it was before. 
•	Turnover rate is high in most departments and abysmal for the bank, overall.
•	The people in HR do not care about the employees. They are only there to defend the bank. If you get harassed by your boss or have a disagreement with a coworker, they will do everything they can to blame it on you completely. 
•	Everything is dictated by BNP Paribas (the French parent company) they have noticeably taken over the bank and brought on many of their employees into the company. They hold most of the Sr. Management positions and have a blind loyalty to BNPP and expect all employees to also. They always say YES to BNPP and employees MUST work around the clock to catch up to unrealistic promises. They've brought on the ‘French way’, which is ‘not caring about your employees’. The French did not understand the American market as well as they thought they did, yet they override the local decision making.
•	There is a complete lack of direction, with a new initiative rolled out seemingly every week.
•	Leadership (including the CEO) don’t care about their customers or employees (who do the actual work). 
•	If the bank truly cares about the employees, management should address why many of the same issues, consistently brought, up are never corrected. 
•	Bank of The West is an awful, crooked, lying, greedy, cheap bank with no vision and no future."

You can get away with doing hardly nothing at this place. If that’s what you are looking for: great. There is no accountability and no one cares from the bottom to the top.","Oh boy. Where to even begin? People are completely disengaged (it’s not rare not to have your emails answered when they require extra work) as a result of terrible HR policies and a complete lack of care for employees’ careers and compensation as well as for the business and their customers. People are disengaged and demotivated and the customers are frustrated and unhappy.

There is 0 investment in talent. If you are young and work hard, you will not be rewarded, they have sub-par compensation, and their raises and incentives are pathetic (prepare yourself to get 0.5%-2% raise every year you work there) and can’t even keep up with inflation in an expensive location like California. This is a high turnover place, no one in his right mind can stay here for more than 2 or 3 years. They have lost a ton of young talent to the competition. The only people left are overpaid senior managers congratulating themselves on getting nothing done and waiting for their next hefty paycheck to fall while they pretend to care about those below them. Don’t even bother complaining to HR, they outsourced the function to an other call center in a low-cost state or country. 


There is 0 investment in technology. You will work with outdated systems that are going to drive you and your customers crazy. Everybody is complaining about them every year and yet nothing gets done because no one really cares. IT support is a joke and nowhere to be seen. 

On the business side, they can’t stick to a plan that works (good luck with “Taking California”) as they are in no place to compete. The only strategy in the C-suite is to cut cost by outsourcing cheap labor to Tempe or India, and pride themselves on another diversity initiative or being a “green” bank (just because they never had any important client in the oil space) in the the workplace award because they are in fact losing on all other measurable metrics... Oh and as an FYI, on the retail side, most of their customers are 55+ which is not reassuring for the future..."

Commercial businesses doesn’t do anything through the branch. They either contact you or they contact their relationship manager and their relationship manager contacts you. The relationship managers don’t know anything and most (if not all) are completely uneducated on how any product, service, and procedure works. They will go to you for everything and expect you to know everything.  They bully you and consistently belittle you and when you try to escalate it to management they find reasons to make it your fault. You will often find employees crying at their desk or in the halls and storming away in frustration. Most of the sales consultants are no help either. They just sell the product and then pass everything off to you. Some relationship managers and sales consulates are nice but most of them are vile and they get away with treating you terribly. Anything the client needs you take care of. From lockbox, remote deposit, positive pay, essentially you service everything. 
You also service their regular deposit products like open and close accounts. 

The direct manager has no clue about anything. He doesn’t respond to any email asking for help. He also won’t help you with anything urgent or have your back with escalations and at this bank there are tons of escalations because everything takes so long. When you really need help from your manager, you can expect to find him in his office with door closed while he plays with his toys (actual Tonka trucks). 
There is a team lead is never helpful and her spends much of the day in alleged “meetings” so it is difficult to get the help you need. 

Bank of the West basically works for the relationship managers. Anything they say goes. You will be required to do everything they ask and you better do it quick. What few polices they do have really don’t matter because they will tell you it is one way but as soon as the relationship manager gets upset they will have you break policy to accommodate them. The other manager (based out of Newport) let’s the other managers, leads, and relationship managers get away with everything, despite several complaints. He is also close friends with set of these people outside of work so he will under no circumstance have your back. 

You will get zero training and you will be expected to bend over backwards for the clients. 

With very few  policy’s and procedures in place and no formal training program (like every other bank) everything you do is a guessing game. The systems are so outdated. It’s like working in The Stone Age. When making suggestions you will be accused of “badmouthing” the company and condescendingly be told “sorry the systems aren’t good enough for you.” 

Everything the client needs takes days, weeks, and months. For example for a client to open an account the have to go through the KYC department for CDD approval. Then it gets sent to commercial client services and you submit the documents. Then that gets sent to depository support and they take days to even look at what you submitted. If you have an error they’ll send it back to you with no action taken and you have to correct it. Then you might submit it again and they’ll come back and tell you there’s another error. They never tell you everything that’s wrong at once. The whole process to open an account takes at least a month. To close an account is even worse.

At every other bank when you close an account it automatically terminates the services, but not at Bank of the West. You have to manually terminate the services by filling out tons of forms and sending them to the correct department. It is very easy to accidentally put incorrect count information because everything is manual and no one verifies the information and if you make a mistake there is a good chance you’ll be terminated. They have “officers” who reallly should be taking on the risk but they don’t do anything for you. They just get a higher pay and an extra week of vacation, for essentially no reason. Then you have to manually figure out how much in fees needs to be collected. A lot of these clients have hundreds or thousands of dollars in monthly fees. 

If you miss a service after closing the account then the client still gets billed and it creates a bigger problem. 
You have to do this all while still helping your clients with other requests and being logged into the the phone to take calls from clients that aren’t yours. 

Everything takes so long and clients and relationship managers will escalate things to you’re managers if it’s not complete within hours. 

Another problem is you’re not the one who completes a lot of the requests. You are mostly just the middle man so it’s out of your hands but you still get put on blast when it is t completed in a timely manner. Some requesting there for a month and still don’t get complete. 

You can expect to be put on blast but don’t expect recognition from management for a job well done. Clients and (rarely) relationship managers will email your managers to let them know you’re doing g a good job but they completely ignore it. The only reason you know about it is because sometimes you get “CC’d” in the emails. 

It can take months to have time off approved. Even after several emails and instant messages asking for the time off. But at the same time you are required to take five consecutive days off in a row which is fine but you are expected to request it off a year in advance. 

Most of the departments you need to work with have been off-shored to India so it’s extremely hard to communicate with them. If you call them (assuming that department had a number to call) it’s almost impossible to understand them. But if you send them an email they won’t respond. 

There are about 20 different systems you use a day to do your job. Each system does only one thing and they are all archaic. For example, if you need to see who is a signer for a business and you don’t have the account number. You will need to look up the name in one system called CIF to find the account numbers. Hopefully CIF is updated and the profile actually exists in the system. You also have to have it spelled out exactly correct or it won’t work. Once you get the account number you have to look it up in EStorage to find the signature cards. If the signature card isn’t uploaded into EStorage (which happens all the time) you will need to look up the profile I’m Touchpoint to get their EIN. Once you get their EIN you can look them up in Phoenix Onboarding. Hopefully the signature card is there but there is a good chance it won’t be. You would think that you would be able to just look up their profile in Touchpoint to see the signers for each account but you can’t. The only way to see who the signers are is to go through every single signature card and compare signatures. There may be dozens to compare. If there’s no signature card uploaded you literally can’t tell who the signer is and it makes any client request almost impossible. 

You can expect to make anywhere in the 40’s to 50’s for this job which isn’t terrible expect for the fact that you do all the work but the relationship managers and sales consultants make six figures. 

Don’t expect to move up. Hard work isn’t how you move up at Bank of the West. You have to be a brown noser and snitch on your team members. 

The whole company is a mess. Other departments are notorious for layoffs. The turnover is ridiculously high and if you work at Bank of the West you will see why."

BOTW rarely invests in technology.  The back-end systems are on life support and barely running.

They advertise to the bankers that through the new incentive plan this year they can earn thousands of dollars  a quarter on top of the ridiculous, insufficient for cost of living, hourly wage they offer. A Banker must hit 4 different sales metrics at 400-500% of their goal to get any pay out worth the effort, which includes the effort of the entire branch including the tellers who aren't paid enough to care about anything.  The sales incentive plan is convoluted, untruthful, complex, not  lucrative, and forces employees to persuade customers to acquire products and services that they don't need in order to hit their branch goals.

They've brought on French culture of not caring about their employees. These expats have blind loyalty to BNPP and expect every employee to do the same.

He says, “figure it out because that’s why your getting paid.” After being a strong performer year over year, I decided to leave this company due to this weak and moronic leader.

Annual Sales Conference is fun","BancWest Investment Services is the Wealth Management arm of the bank and is painfully behind the times. The platforms they expect advisors to use are straight out of the late 1990's. There are continual issues with the book of business , and once you do get a book assigned, its sure to be filled with dead end client. These are clients who were sold unsuitable investments (over priced annuities, annuities in side of IRAs, an overwhelming number of market linked CDs, the list goes on...) and haven't been touched ever since, which if they by some miracle have contact information, are unwilling to do business. The bank refuses to allow the sale of ETF's, which would probably would be the best bet for clients in the <$250k segment because they aren't profitable to the bank. Meanwhile they push the Investment Advisory Service (managed money) like it is the best thing since sliced bread, however the fees are astronomical usually north of 1.5%. Pay is severely low  and the comp plan has more holes in it than a sinking ship. Rumor has it that the new ""Investment Center"" in AZ is going  to be taking over all relationships under 250K and they're just waiting for normal attrition  to get rid of all us branch advisors. Meanwhile, those folks have over a 1000 clients in their books and don't seem to be making much headway with the clients either by means of production value. Good luck getting any new business to drum through as the ""referrals"" from the branches are almost always a dead end, and if you do try getting new business it'll be a nightmare trying to push it through compliance. This is a dead end job and a company that will seriously put your license at risk."

This used to be a much better bank before Nandita Bakhshi came on board (the current CEO as of June 2019). Her lack of vision and the fact that she is only making changes just to protect herself has truly caused this bank to take a turn for the worse.  It is obvious that she is only in it for the short haul and it is no surprise that her approval rating is below 40%. 

People here are more concerned about pointing the finger at someone than they are about teamwork and getting the job done. Unsurprisingly, the turnover in this bank is very high because of the toxic environment and they are one of the lowest paying banks in the industry because they constantly look for cheap, tacky ways just to save a few bucks."

- Ability to grow within the bank and establish yourself.
- Decent benefits (good 401K plan, healthcare not so much)
- Honest bank. Doing anything shady was frowned upon and selling products or services to customers that didn't need it was frowned upon.","These cons are mostly from my experience for the departments I worked in (Branch and then auto finance).

- Management is a toss-up. The branch manager was great and professional. Management in auto finance was a mess. Extremely unprofessional, lots of yelling, guilt-tripping and mental games. Management plays favorites and looks out for themselves. Upper management ignores any sort of bad behavior by managers beneath them and chalks it up to friendly banter between co-workers.
- Stressful work environment. Working in a branch can get stressful due to customers, which is out of anybodys control and is part of the job. Good management will make this easier. Auto finance had so much work to do that it was overwhelming. Multiple deadlines every day/week/month that you are expected to meet. Instead of hiring more people they continue to push work.

Systems are outdated and don't talk to each other, thus it takes a lot of time and effort for the Rep to locate information to assist the customer, yet Reps are expected to meet an Average Handle Time goal, which is antiquated and not in the best interest of the customer.  Focus should be on First Call Resolution.  Pay is ok for Reps, but could be better.  Health Insurance prices are way too high and a joke. Company should change their model to allow every other weekend off, especially in the FM area where lake country is life in the summer, and unemployment is low with a very competitive job market.

Regional Contact Center Manager sometimes discourages the termination of a Rep simply because of high attrition rate, a common problem in Call Centers.  Management actively denies and discourages work from home, even from high performing Managers and Reps.

785,,An Embarassment to my Resume and LinkedIn Profile,2018-11-28,1.0,Financial Advisor,salary + benefits. Matched 401k. Getting paid for doing nothing all day. Nice coworkers at branch. Bank holidays off.,"My worst job as a financial advisor. Bancwest Investment Services, ""BWIS"", probably most poorly run division in the bank. We were told by our manager we were profitable for the 1st time in 2017. What had been going on here previously for years?? Read on..

Outdated technology, systems, and business models - decades behind competitors in tech, online trading platform, competitive pricing of AUM, and not adapting quickly enough to changing consumer habits and increasing migrations to online and app-based wealth management tools. Not to mention all the startups, fintech, robo-advisors, and non-banking entities also creating additional competition that didn't exist several years ago. People don't bank like they did 10 or 20 yrs ago yet ""BOTW"" and ""BWIS"" both operate as if the internet and smartphones are still new and unproven ways to do business, and that you can't do any transaction unless you come to the bank in person. 

The initiatives that were finally taken this year to adapt to 21st century methods of banking and wealth management our competitors did years ago. Example - the ""investor center"" opened in AZ for accounts <$250K to work with an advisor by web/chat/phone. Every other firm opened centers like this, also in Phoenix, more than 10 years ago already.

The book of business is a complete joke with nothing but old annuities and small accounts of clients not contacted in years with bad contact info, riddled with compliance errors, inappropriate products, and zero oversight back when FA's were all still 100% commission and had to sell nothing but variable annuities to earn a living. Yet the FA is supposed to ""work"" this book and build relationships?

With the exception of a few good locations, branch traffic is slow and referrals are a joke. Tired, old branches, old technology and systems, little money to replace them, and bad wealth management/bank platforms all make for a poor career choice for a financial advisor. 

The partnerships were nonexistent for me and just one of several broken expectations made, along with the book of business that supposedly had tremendous opportunity but in reality failed to deliver. I was told I would be working with partners and senior FA's for opportunities over $250K and I hadn't had partners all year due to constant resignations and transfers, leaving me to fend for myself. When I interviewed I made it clear I didn't have a book of business to bring and I was told that wouldn't be a problem. Yet the unofficial, implied expectation is that you needed to work outside relationships if bank referrals were slow, which is what many of the senior wealth fa's and pca's end up doing anyway. 

Onboarding as a new employee was a joke as I spent 2 months doing nothing while BOTW figured out when the best time for me to start would be while refusing to let me start even as I asked.  Sloppy transfer of book of business meant I had a double digit # of clients with ZERO ASSETS at the time of transfer yet still an open account. Only 20% in the book even had the minimum required for the platform...what about the other 80%? 

Unkept and misleading promises about not only the opportunity, but also what is really needed to even survive in this role. If you are desperate enough to take this job, make sure you have an old book of business, despite being told otherwise, b/c you'll need to move these clients over since you won't get referrals from the bank. 

Unprofessional management - I met with my manager one time the entire time I worked there, with no other intervention when it was clear I was in a situation setup for failure. My monthly reviews were done with his admin. assistant, new to the industry, much younger than me, and flunking the 7 twice, and trying to coach me on investment sales - which, btw, is a huge FINRA and possible labor law violation."

It’s the lack of processes plus a very real lack of diversity up top. There tends to be a ‘too busy to be proactive’ tone in the LOBs. What I mean by diversity it’s not necessarily just about race but also about class, ideas, approaches. McKinsey has come in and essentially done it’s ‘work’ on how to improve productivity but the real solution is how managers treat their direct reports from the top down. There are lifers in senior management here that seem to be more concerned about keeping their high salaries and their politics in order than the actual long term success of the organization.

I came in as an experienced financial advisor and worked my tail off for a year and a half, and realized I had waisted my time.  60% -70% of my time was wasted on administrative tasks not related to driving revenue, support  staff was reduced because ""there wasn't the money"".  there was little to no corroboration between bank silos, so bank branch staff were constantly distracted with the most recent campaign to open up accounts rather than refer clients to you.  Sales management seemed clueless about the reasons behind certain advisor's successes (often having a pipeline filled with HNW prospects by the high end bankers) and generally talked down to the rest of the advisory staff that was scrounging for insufficient opportunities.   At multiple times, as an advisor with 10 year's experience, I had my ability to sell financial plans and insurance called into question.  I deeply regret wasting my time as a skilled professional to be talked down to by management despite my routine 50+ hour weeks....this place sucked and basically everyone who was relatively young, intelligent, and level headed either spoke down about the firm or they were planning their exit strategy.  
       The icing on the cake for me was a wholesomely bogus anonymous complaint by an employee that I had ""looked at her breasts and made her feel uncomfortable"".  As a feminist myself I have never felt so deeply insulted professionally and personally, and was basically told that if there was another complaint regardless of any shred of validity, I would be let go.   It was clear that I was considered to be wholly expendable....there are many expletives that come to mind given a how little care this company shows towards dedicated and motivated employees.

A culture is emerging of  collaboration, taking risks, not fearing failure, and empowering employees to speak up, be creative and try new things. The bank would be appealing for someone with a start-up mentality, but also patience to hold on while the old ways get swept away. Finally, lots of really smart people who genuinely care about helping the bank's customers improve their financial lives.","It's a lot of work (not necessarily a con): There is an enormous amount of change and that can put a lot of pressure on people to do more work in the near-term while new processes are developed and implemented; the ""old guard"" is still in place in many parts of the bank and, unfortunately, it may take time to change their mindset, or move them out; cost cutting is part of the transformation -- but this is happening at practically every large US bank; the transformation will likely take time, so people anxious for a radical change will need to wait to feel a difference until probably early 2018 (six months feels like a long time)."

There are people who don't even know who their managers are because so much internal shuffling has happened without sufficient planning.

Even basic professionalism isn't guaranteed here. Send an email to someone? It's a coin-flip whether you'll ever hear back. Assign clear deadlines weeks in advance?

1118,,"If I could rate less than a 1, I would!",2016-12-28,1.0,Anonymous Employee,There is literally not one pro that I can think of.,"This is by far the worst company I have EVER worked for! I previously lived in Arizona and worked for a large financial institution in their corporate office, so when I moved to a new smaller state I looked for anything banking related, but I came up pretty short. I did however, come across a Customer Service Manager position with Bank of the West and because I had worked in banking and was a former retail Store Manager, I thought it would be a good fit for me. I started work at BOW in October of 2015, two months later I found out I was pregnant. I had an awful pregnancy. I was always sick; it wasn't just in the morning, but literally all day every day. Most of the people I worked with were compassionate and understood how sick I was, except the Branch Manager. As a former manager, I understand that as a Branch Manager you need your staff to be available and do a great job, and the higher managers put so much pressure on you, but this gentleman was nothing but inappropriate and unprofessional! He said very derogatory comments to me, yelled in my face in front of my employees because I was two minutes late (because I had to pull over and throw up on my way to work, which I let my employees know I was going to be a few minutes late). I mean, it was worse than what I can even put into words. With this, I started an HR investigation, because I felt like I was being discriminated. The HR woman literally had MULTIPLE witnesses to these occurrences and still did NOTHING about it. They determined I was not being discriminated against, but he was being inappropriate so they had a 'talk' with him. He did end up leaving the company when I was about 6 months pregnant, which was nice, but that didn’t last. After he left, other people realized how AWFUL Bank of the West was (mostly because of their INSANE referral goals for not only tellers but every other position in the branch), so I was left 6 1/2 months pregnant, been at the job less than a year, with myself and one new teller to run THE ENTIRE BRANCH. They kept putting me in the position to be the Branch Manager. Expecting me to come in super early and leave very late and know how to do and run everything in the branch. They also changed my entire job title around this time, I was now a Senior Service Officer which required me to open checking accounts and have more sales based goals! Then we got a new Area Manager who wouldn’t let me take any time off (like for my baby shower, which I had requested to have off MONTHS in advance), she came in acting like she knew how to do everyone's job better than them and had extremely high expectations of everyone which put a lot of pressure on tellers who are getting paid $10-$12 bucks an hour! I told some of them to get the hell out of this place and go work somewhere with less stress! I couldn't leave because I was pregnant and needed the insurance. I had a serious health issue when I was 34 weeks pregnant (both of my adrenal glands hemorrhaged), the doctors don't know the exact reason as to why this happened, but one of the specialist did say it could be stress related. Keep in mind, although I was sick often from my pregnancy, I still came to work, I also got the highest customer service score in the Midwest region, which allowed everyone in the branch to get a bonus of $750. NEVER IN MY LIFE have I been so disrespected, so unappreciated and so UN-CARED FOR as a human being. DO NOT EVER WORK HERE NO MATTER HOW DESPERATE YOU ARE!"

Plus many more came and went in that same period. Over 100 percent turn over.

It was bad before now it's sell anything you can to whoever you can. Management above Branch Managers are completely out of touch with reality of sales goals. With the changes the only people in the branch that are salary are branch managers so their workload and hours just went up from already being badly overworked. They will not allow hourly staff to take overtime so it's very hard to reach goals. And now, unless everybody in the branch makes goals nobody gets paid their bonus/incentive. Management just doesn't seem to care about the branch staff. They tell you ""We appreciate all you do"" but they sure don't follow it up with actions or attitudes. The level of micromanagement is extreme. Honestly would not work there again knowing what I know now."

Many of the internal systems are antiquated and disconnected from each other. We are the center of a tech boom and there are no investments in improving these systems, in order to improve the efficiency of the organization. The organization still requires wet signatures on many internal forms and approvals, that could have been done using an accredited e-signature process. Decentralization is a huge issue and individual business units are forced to write their own procedures, instead of there being an enterprise policy. Groups like HR, AP, Access Management pass the buck onto the individual units to complete their work (like completing new hire packets and orientation, invoicing).  I can't imagine the number of human hours wasted on being reduced to manually reconciling system access via spreadsheets and other processes, because of the inability to invest in a API to automatically do this. Increasingly unreasonable workloads being put on people, and there is already high pressure to be productive with the poor tools in place. There is also a lack of transparency,almost secretive approach to the avoidance of getting direct answers on basic items to get tasks accomplished.

The company needs to decide where they are going and if they plan to sell themselves off piecemeal, allow their competition to run them out of business, or actually try to grow.

They continue to hire more and more people in corporate offices to grow the corporate teams that each only do one thing then continue to squeeze the branches to reduce staff. In management's eyes you're not a person, you're a number.  Company has no real focus on anything other than what sounds good today.  Great companies don;t need to talk constantly about employee engagement because it is demonstrated consistently in the way employees are treated.

Infrastructure/systems/automation are grossly inadequate for the size of the bank. The organization relies far too much on manual and semi-manual workarounds and spreadsheets behind-the-scenes to get things done. For every high priority ""fire""/critical deliverable that the staff are able to complete, there are 10, 20 or more that are not getting done for lack of resources. Pay is sub-par in many positions.

Loyal employees get capped on raises even when being promoted to higher positions. They blame it on a pay grid that prevents upward movement. Absolute minimum insurance coverage offered.

I enjoyed helping people and small businesses with their financial needs.","The last year has seen a dramatic shift from a focus on customer and employee satisfaction to a focus on sales at all cost.  CEO Michael Shepherd rolled out Vision 2020, his vision for the bank of the future. Apparently that means that employees sell, sell, sell for every breath they are at work.  Suddenly, the goals are unattainable and underperformers (even those with a decade or more of excellent performance) are being pushed towards the door in favor of hard-charging, telemarketing sales types who can cross-sell a checking account but can't remember a customer's name.  This single-minded focus on profit will work in the short term for growth, just like it did for Bank of America, but the long-term cost will be significant, just like it was for Bank of America."

I only recalled my manager telling us ""good work"" when my manager is praised by the upper management. But I can certainly count on chaos happening whenever there is a deadline (most of the times a fake one). Very little respect is shown to the team members.

Furthermore, the whole group is run in a ""cowboy"" kind of approach. There is little guidance from the upper management. Everybody is always wondering what the next person is working on because there is absolutely no inter-team communication. The boss simply does not care, period.

The benefits are great and they have a really awesome tuition reimbursement plan for continuing education. My management team has been more than fair and willing to help me advance (until recently- read in the cons). This bank is also one of the best customer-oriented banks that I have ever been to. We really care about our customers and our community, they're not just a number.","I've been with the bank for seven years, worked all throughout college and was finally promoted to my current position (which is hardly an achievement for someone with two BA degrees). I've recently been given notice that my position is being eliminated and I've applied for a new position with more responsibility but the first thing that I heard was that they are worried about the ""grade jump"". I would be be moved up six grades in pay and they think the jump is too high.. It's unforunately because I've worked at the lowest position possible for over six years, worked my way up in the company & now it runs into pay again and not wanting to pay me more even though I've clearly proven myself worthy, never been written up or put on a warning, etc.."

This may make for efficiencies, but the bank is losing some of the personal touch that had made it attractive to clients.  Employees used to be able to be  complete, all-around bankers, but jobs are becoming more and more specialized - i.e. sales only, underwriting only, etc.   Also, if you are not in one of the division offices or corporate campus, hard to find opportunities for advancement without relocating."
1460,,Overall Good Experience,2014-05-03,4.0,Cannot Say,"Good benefits, flexible hours, friendly coworkers.  Nice back office building in Bishop Ranch Business Park in San Ramon with lots of parking and good cafeteria.  Lots of employee diversity. Employees in financial areas have lots of opportunities for internal mobility.  Lots of training classes offered, good training facility. Secure, stable company.",Too few employees in many areas so people are over worked.  Senior management not paying attention that lower levels cannot do the main business of the bank effectively without adequate resources. Some division and department heads lack management skills and micromanage instead of delegating to the good people on their staff.

On the branch level, all the employees work together as a team should. Training sometimes lacked over the years, however it improved in the late 2000's toward 2010.","Again, training was often lax until more recently. Commission ONLY positions had their sales goals revised upwards often, (2 - 3 times a year in some years) a tool ""weed out"" the less productive employees. This left many branches and customers to be served by a skeleton crew of professionals or to look to websites for their needs. This was not the original policy or commitment of the bank in the 90's. Mass layoffs after acquisitions of banks in the Midwest prompted reevaluation of pay in the California region especially."
1466,,Conservative Bank That's Slow to Change,2014-04-02,3.0,Analyst,"Compensation is slowly becoming competitive with larger banks. Time off is on par with other banking institutions. Original team members of the bank, both Bank of the West and those from acquired banks, are great to work with as the bank has not reached the level of politics like bigger banks such as Wells, BofA or Citi.","The bank is very conservative. It is slow to change and is more of a follower of banking trends rather than an innovator of new banking products and services. Internally, the bank's technology is deficient and is still reliant on many manual processes rather than automated ones. Customer facing technology (e.g. ATM, Remote Capture, Online Banking) have just been updated in the last 5 years."

This can be validated by a debate between the customer/teammate centric Supervisors in a conference call with an Executive on attempts to persuade them to buy shirts for all employees and not only our full time employees for ""Spirit Week"". Ironic eh? I worked as a Supervisor for 5 months in Consumer Protection Services and coming from a well-defined atmosphere with tiered goals and cascaded directives from Executives it was difficult for me to learn that the annual reviews were 100% discretion based.

Everybody is willing and ready to assist everybody in all the different departments bank-wide.","I started my career as a part-time teller and was quickly promoted to a multiple site customer service manager of two branches, leading two teams of 4-6 employees.  Both of my teams were consistently in the top three leading branches in Arizona in customer service, sales, net advocacy rating, etc.  Solely because I was promoted from a Grade 1 to a Grade 6 overnight, I was put on a 6 month performance evaluation program because, as HR explained, ""the employment handbook says"" I could advance an unlimited number of pay grades, however, I could not advance over a certain percentage in compensation overnight.  I was even advised that if I quit my job, and am rehired, I would have a better chance of receiving the compensation that I deserve for my job performance.  I had several consultations with my Branch Manager, Human Resources and even as far as two face-to-face meetings with the Arizona Regional Manager with no resolution or plan.  Fact is, I was exceeding my expected performance at two branches and was receiving half of the compensation of an average, single site customer service manager."

Every branch I have worked at is at ""full staff"" with two tellers, one full time and one part time.  This means that a manager is always on the line while also being expected to get everything they need to get done in between helping customers, coaching, doing observations, completing Certifications, scheduling, looking over new accounts, and keeping updated on the ever changing regulations and policies of the bank.  It, of course, depends on the branch you work at, but every branch I have seen the managers are very overworked, stressed, and under-appreciated. One more note, the technology at Bank of the West is behind a lot of other banks.  It gets frustrating to have such slow, old systems."

There is a strong emphasis on customer experience however, this is changing and at quite a rapid pace.","The bank is always willing to hire from within for positions but they do it strictly in the self interest of paying much less than they would for an outside hire.  Unless your objective is to move into a purely commissioned position there is no point in working from the ground up.  The training is quite pitiful, you learn on the fly. The emphasis is changing from customer service to sales; this is surely tied to the hiring of a lot of ex-Wells Fargo employees.  No mobility between BOTW and BNP and its affiliates.

If you meet sales goals quarterly bonuses can reach up to $1500 a qtr as a Customer Service Manager,"Very pushy sales structure. Way to many hoops to jump through to make a sale and to have it count as your sale. Touchpoint (a system used to track everything) completely sucks. The company expects you to log EVERYTHING in TP for sale, however, if you truly did that you could spend your entire day doing just that. But not only are you expected to do that but also be a glorified teller, handle customer issues, coach and develop your staff, monitor compliance and audit risk for the branch, makes sales, meet goals, maintain branch budgets, control losses on negative accounts, mandatory call nights twice a week because you didn't hit a sales goal etc, etc, etc..."
1536,,Great on the job experiences,2012-12-10,4.0,Business Analyst,Bank of the West values their customers and instill in its employees the importance of great customer service.  The skills that are gained by working for this company are easily transferable within and outside of the organization.,The organization is very siloed.  The HR screening process and salary increase limitations make it difficult to advance within the organization.
1537,,Uncertain Vision,2012-11-07,3.0,Vice President,"Great benefits, especially health coverage","Either management lacks a vision for the bank or they have failed to share it with employees.

1545,,Former CSR & ACSM - A Nightmarish Work Environment,2012-08-29,1.0,ACSM,"It all depends upon who you work with, and lucky for BOW quite a few branches have some outstanding people working for the company ( the trouble is keeping them, but I'll mention that further down below). Also, the paid holidays are frequent, but that should be fairly typically as being associated with FDIC all banks follow the same schedule for federally recognized holidays.","Where to begin....

1. Pay is very low, below what is standard in the industry. Working as an Assistant Customer Service Manager, I was making a whole $1.25 per hour more than I was as a teller! Abysmally low pay, quite insulting really.
2. I transferred to another branch for the ACSM position without checking the branch for turnover rate. It is extremely high in Morgan Hill, which leads to item 3...
3. Very poor office environment. The branch manager at the time was incredibly under-qualified and poorly skilled at leading a team. This individual would micro manage others' work (including mine) yet paid no attention to her own. There were days where she would literally sit next to me and watch everything I did, though I didn't do anything to warrant this! Imagine trying to work in that kind of uncomfortable position, you simply can't!!!!! 
4. The regional manager who hired this branch manager has been with BOW for many years, and yet I couldn't believe how or why he would have approved this person as a BOW employee. He also forced a hire of his son's girlfriend as a teller, very poor business practice as she was unqualified. At times the RM was rude and obnoxious making for a very unpleasant exchange during conversations. Luckily interaction with him was limited
5. Very archaic and poor IT system, I think we were still running Windows ME while XP was the standard and had been for many years. Hell, I didn't even have my own computer! Can you imagine trying to be in a leadership position without having the proper tools to do so?  Ridiculously, I was later told that the bank couldn't find the resources to implement another desktop. This was in reference to a very underpowered Dell with matching CRT, a dinosaur back then!
6. I was with the company for more than 5 years, and as a seasoned employee the company would offer free gifts as a sign of appreciation for every 5 years of employment. For my 5th year anniversary, I was offered a sleeping bag or a water bottle....  
Bonuses were also few and far between, and the most I could expect was a $10 money order for ""a job well done"". Adding insult to injury when the pay is already low
7. High expectations to provide excellent customer service with a skeleton crew. Nearly impossible with so much work and such a high turnover.

I can go on for days about how much I hated, absolutely hated my job at Bank of the West. As a CSR, I felt very under appreciated by my manager, leading me to jump from the pan into the fire as an ACSM at Morgan Hill. I could never in my wildest dreams imagine such a poor working environment as I experienced. I did make some very good friends along the way which I will always value, but overall, this company and a good majority of the upper management are horrendous at keeping and nurturing talented people. Too bad, because in the end it's the relationships that fosters loyalty."

If you meet goals the set them to impossible standards. Very little recognition for a job well done.

You are constantly being threatened with your job if you don't reach these goals and expectations.

*HR is only there to see who they can blame for something, anything they don't care.
*senior management micro manages the branch managers to the nth degree, to the point that nothing can get done in a timely manner
*Executive management has no clue what happens in the trenches, they are totally disconnected.
*Loan fulfillment has no idea what ""fulfill"" actually means, nor commercial or residential mortgage, any reason to turn someone down or to drag their heels is used."

I've seen more whistleblowers forced out of the job once HR came in to investigate their complaint.
You're not rewarded for not using sick leave if you're lucky enough to be full time and get it. They also cap the hours you accumulate for sick leave even though they have many constraints for the use. 
Training doesn't exist for products they expect you to sell.
Goals aren't attainable and instead of gearing the workers to wok together for mutual goals you're expected to compete. This lead to many duplicitous tactics."

* Comparable employee programs to larger banks","*  Human Resources department is totally ""pro-management"" and is non-responsive to employee feedback or concerns; most employees don't even bothercontacting them anymore because they know they won't be taken seriously or acted upon
* It is nearly impossible to advance within this company because external hires at the senior and executive levels continually bring in their friends and former colleagues from other institutions to fill desirable positions, making it a very ""incestuous"" environment
* Slow to replace open positions, causing remaining employees to pick up the slack and work ridiculously long hours
* Ineffective managers with poor people management skills are allowed to remain in their positions (sometimes even promoted) in spite of high employee turnover and complaints
* Favoritism is rampant--promotions and titles are given under the table to favored individuals while employees with far more experience or longevity remain at lower grades and titles.  People are given positions because of who they know, not because they are skilled for the position they are promoted to.
*  Executives (like President and CEO) are generally invisible to the overall employee base; they operate in the shadows;  there are no town halls, no recurring or standard communications from these individuals on a regular basis
*  Company has grown very fast within the last 5 years but is struggling to move from small bank practices to effectively deal with the growth"

- Forced to allow many errors to slip through the cracks in order to increase production. 
- I don't think anyone has heard of an ""Open Door Policy "".
- Did I mention pay?!!?? Yes, Pay is extremely low.
- If you have a work related issue, just deal with it because you are limited to just your supervisor and typically results in zero change.
