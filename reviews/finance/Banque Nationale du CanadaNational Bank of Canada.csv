57,Banque Nationale du Canada/National Bank of Canada,A bank looking to play in the big leagues but just not quite there yet.,2022-01-17,2.0,Financial Planner,"As with all Canadian banks, great employee benefits (rates, insurances) as well as great vacation packages. If you are in the Montreal area and speak French, lots of opportunities for various careers VS other large banks with head offices in Toronto. The senior bank management (SVP and above) are client oriented, and results driven.","There are some irritating factors: 
1) Systems are very outdated. It is very apparent National Bank cannot support the same level of investments on its internal systems and applications VS. other large Canadian banks. A lot of tasks are done manually in Excel, pre-populated PDFs and emails, instead of web-based applications, field autofill options, etc. For retail branch banking employees, they are often left to deal with system and operation centers errors, incorrect information entered into client's profiles as a result of manual processes, heavy time-consuming processes to update/subscribe to a product makes it hard for branch people to offer a red-carpet service to their clients. This combined with an unusual number of errors affecting clients, it's very frustrating for branch staff who are client facing and the managers solutions are often to keep the status quo. There is not a lot of focus on first time right and when there is, it almost always rests on the advisor’s shoulders to do or explain the impossible and this affects customer's relationships. 

2) Performance management and compensation are based too much on the manager's opinion of your work instead of your performance figures. Your manager can directly affect your bonus, performance rating and base salary. This shouldn’t feel like a popularity contest but sometimes it feels like you have to please you manager rather than doing what's right or what would be more efficient. Employees, at least in branch banking, are not encouraged to express their ideas to improve processes, nor managers are really opened to hear what you have to say or what kind of experience you can bring to the team. 

3) Diversity - It is a regional bank, in respect to its retail branch banking network, that aims to service clients that are based throughout Quebec mostly. Unfortunately, outside of major city centres (Montreal and Laval), cultural diversity in retail banking is shockingly lacking and this shows in the employee's sentiments towards colleagues coming from other cultural backgrounds and shockingly, clients as well. French is de facto language to use and employees who are bilingual are often reminded that this is a very mostly French-speaking bank and anglophones who don't speak French fluently are not welcomed (be it colleagues or clients). Although corporate is marketing its efforts to cater to a more diverse client profile, branch staff and managers are not making any effort to make it a welcoming environment for these clients and hearing racist comments from colleagues is not acceptable in 2022."

Business commits to projects without consulting IT - which causes impossible deadlines.

Management is very approachable.","National is the biggest in Quebec and has all the biggest clients in that market. Although super successful on Bay street, sometimes it feels like the Quebec success stories overshadow all the huge wins in Toronto. Toronto could use more recognition from senior management.

- CEO is forward thinking and there is a solid plan for growth
- defined benefit pension plan","- career opportunities are very limited outside of Quebec
- behind in technology - making some improvements but still has a long way to go
- poor translations of documentation and presentations from French to English and there is often several days delay in getting communications in English - even after changes have taken effect which makes change management for English managers difficult.
- Decisions impacting nation wide policies/changes are made in Quebec and often do not include information or expertise from outside of Quebec and do not take into consideration the differences in business practices between Quebec and the rest of Canada - example the mortgage documentation is complex and convoluted compared to other banks outside of QC."

I was hired as a bank employee in a department that was entirely consultants -- including the team lead.  I was left alone for the first month -- people were too busy to spend time with me.  When there was a crisis, I was not invited to sit in on discussions to begin to absorb the business.  By the end of the second month, I had received a total of 10 hours of knowledge-transfer, training, and general time spent with colleagues.  10 hours over 8 weeks.  I was not involved in any projects.  I was assigned a few tasks after asking for something to do.    

I can understand the consultants reticence in on-boarding a new bank-employee.  It seems like something that should be done by bank employees.  If there are no other bank employees in a department then some other method should be put in place to ensure proper new-hire  integration.

It was clear within two months that I was not welcome nor was I ever going to play a meaningful role in the department.

I could have continued ""working"" there -- doing nothing for probably months before anyone would have noticed.  That's not a good feeling."

Opportunity to work more hours and make more money.
Not far from home.
Clients often friendly.","Closed minds environment.Poor training.No coaching.No guidance.No teamwork.Rude collegues.No patience and professionalism to teach trainees.
High turnover of talent and chronically short staffed due to incompetence of micro management.
If you're not part of their circle you will not be able to integrate yourself in the branch as new employee.
Instead to improve their bad customer service(clients are very dissatisfied,there are everyday complaints due to services,procedures and advisors lack of flexibility and availability).The thing of the red carpet customer service it is only a stupid utopy.
More sales than customer service oriented.
Received hundreds daily pushing sales email or email like ""You have failed your commitment today..results reflect you efforts"" since my 2nd week....that is ridiculus!
Certainly THREATS NOT ENCOURAGES  EMPLOYEES to  sell more""If you fail you won't pass the probation"" (Wow what a fabulous stimulation and motivation!!)

Very old slow fashioned systems and procedures...worst compared to the other banks.You must use 2 system at the same time while doing a  transaction then write it down and report everything manually( too much paper)all these things impede your performance,your development and your growth.

Felt pressured,demotivated..no work-life balance 
You will breathe a very heavy air when you work..I was scared to ask for help.

At the end this bank is really poor in terms of cultural integration..the majority of the times clients and employees have the same origins and they get along and do business only among them. At National Bank it's very hard to meet and do business with clients who are not provenient from Europe or North America or rarely Asia.
That seems very discriminating...
Again..very closed minds company culture.

You will hear also a branch manager call ""miserables"" clients without a K in their account while walking around the branch without doing anything outside planning her next vacation and putting pressure on the whole staff.

But it is not necessary a bad thing, because each business unit has room to cater to the need and client demographic. If the branch is entrepreneurial, it s can be quite fun and easy to succeed. 
Another thing I like about this bank is the target (objectives) compare to other banks, are significantly smaller, and more achievable.  Overall I find the stress level is not high, and generally speaking the culture is warm and supportive. 
Base salary may look slightly lower than other FIs, but once you get in you will notice the employee benefits are more than generous. Significant low mortgage rate, excellent pension plan etc....","The operating software and system are very confusing and difficult to learn even for a seasoned banker like me. Sometimes it takes a long time to get one client's request done, or take many steps to finish the administration work. 
Though overall I must say the staff benefits are great, but one thing I am not crazy about is that  new employee need to earn their vacation days for a year before full entitlement kick in. Why not pro-rate the vacation days from the very first year for new employees?
The bank also has several silos, in combination with technology challenge, that can create client experience barrier.  For example, many legacy accounts from the acquisition of Altamira few years ago, or broker referred mortgages, can create more work to the branch than the actual benefit of growing the market via proprietary channel."
