- Great variety of financial and IT-related skills to pick up on the fly, depending on the team you joined
- You will gain insight to one of the biggest investment banks in the world, a brand recognized in the UK and US mostly
- Good salary, and other benefits, sick days, vacation (in Europe at least).
- HR (and generally everyone, with some exceptions) is helpful if you need assistance
- most people, including managers, are nice to work with, especially within IT
- varies by the team and month, but generally speaking, IT jobs can be pretty relaxed, Barclays has quality pressure on you, not time pressure. (quality over quantity)
- as an IB, the company is performing well, their quarterly results are public, and you can expect this to be long-term employment. It's not unusual to see people working there for 3+ years. There are regular promotion evaluations, although it's difficult to get promoted, it does happen if you perform well above the expected","- with big multinational company comes big multinational issues, policies, mandatory training (potentially) completely unrelated to your job, slow and painful procedures (just to ensure everything is fine, so it has some quality assurance benefits, I know)

2. They call it that they treat all fairly but how come some people get cab and some people not ( non hiring zones). There should be non hiring zones but not no transport zones as all employee cannot afford to live in hiring zone with the package they provide. Least you could do is to provide cab.
3. Manager decides who gets o/s rating and not the person numbers.
4. They can make you work for two process at times when your process work load is little less.
5. Colleague engagement are always attended by same people ( not in calling process ). Calling people are continuously on calls no colleague engagement for them.
6. Here 'your view' surveys are filled by TSS taking remote control ( how come that is my view ). They always have surveys like either you agree or disagree but no feedback of free will writing.
7. Not even single penny being paid for wfh expenses and on podcast they say they'll ensure salaries in line with that ( got appraisal at strong rating which I don't call being appraised ).
8. They never retain people. A lot of people have left who wanted to work still with company but poor salary appraisal strategy. They are ok in hiring new ones. 
9. Only your first year appraisal will be good after that don't expect any good news whether bank profit soars high or not. They only retain people in UK and USA but not in India.
10. When you work here then forget to celebrate any festivals. Don't expect any extra payout or less work also. Last diwali they did not give anything (No respect for employee festivals). But if there is any festivals in UK then we will be working as a back up for them (not fair practice)."

607,,Salaries inconsistent,2022-02-10,2.0,Tech PM,"Good benefits, good pension scheme. Nice offices.","Salary: different people, same grade, same team are all on different salaries. Salaries are different for the same role. Had numerous conversations with HR about the gender pay gap and got no where. HR don’t allow salary negotiation for promotions. My salary was lower than the persons I took over, and is lower than the person who is now doing my role. Both are men, 

Slow: to get anything done is painful, lots of hoops to jump through. But this is the be expected as bank and legacy. 

Management: l had numerous managers during my time at the bank, most managers were awful: didn’t care about development, didn’t prioritise work, played politics, couldn’t get hold of them ect. 

Politics:  little collaboration. dog eat dog environment 

Pressure: the amount of pressure put on you to deliver is sickening. 

Overall: it’s not a *bad* place to work. Slowness is to be expected and bad managers are everywhere.  but salary inconsistencies, the pressure and the politics is a reflection of the banks culture. Leaving was the best decision I’ve made."

Barclays has invested heavily in creating a great workplace at the Pune location.
The higher management, especially the UK counterparts are very open and supportive.","I felt the HR system/team is not strong. I did not see a great annual review system. They have only 3 ratings, and If you are given the lowest rating by your line manager, there is no way you can question it or raise concerns. Even if concerns are raised, there is no one to review them further. Even if you don't accept the ratings, the system will just auto approve and move forward.

They did not even conduct an exit interview to understand why the employee wants to exit the company. Not sure if they have any exit interviews.

They need to have more structured team management and line manager assignment. In a few teams have observed, just because a person is in the team for a little longer time than others, they make him a line manager with just 2 or 3 colleagues under him, even though the line manager and other 2 colleagues are doing the exact same work. 
Just creating more roles that tend to add or bring very little or NO value to the team as a whole. This also creates too much dependency on the line manager who may tend to misuse their power."

Too many Black staff have been mistreated and end up leaving, then management 'wonder why'. They know exactly why.

Some Directors are trying to 'have it all' in life, and in turn put unnecessary pressure on their staff, then try and penalise them.
Competitive, non-team players are promoted and rewarded.

825,,Avoid at all costs,2022-01-20,1.0,Anonymous Employee,The only Pro was my manager but it was extremely lucky to get a good manager.,"- 	As a call center job you expect to encounter customers that will be abusive to you but in this role you are abused on a daily basis by customers, brokers and solicitors.The amount of verbal and mental abuse that is received on the job is disgusting both from your customers and lack of support from the company. Throughout the peak of Covid 19 the company made lots of changes which meant that it was harder for the customers in our department to get the support they needed, this lead to high amounts of abuse, racism and threats at time (one customer even joked about a doing a bomb threat if we did not give them what they needed) Barclays refused to send out letters to the brokers and solicitors to state that they have a zero tolerance policy on this behavior as it would ""have to go through to many channels"". One specific broker has been reported numerous times by different colleagues for sexist, racist and abusive behavior and Barclays apologized for their staff's behavior and did not bother to even listen to the calls that were provided to the team.
- 	The sickness process/line was changed at least 6 times in the last year meaning that if you were ill (even due to covid) the procedures were unclear and it was difficult to know who to contact. Due to the way the department was ran and the abuse we received at one point up to 40% of the department was on sick at the same time. 
- 	 One team is a new path that Barclays is implementing so that the departments all work together more efficiently and merging numerous departments into one. The formation of this has been an utter shambles and information that the staff needed to know about their hours, pay, how the role would work. The only details that were provided was how it benefited Barclays. Staff were also rushed through training and did not receive the full support that was needed. There was a marginal pay rise for some staff members earning below a set amount (those already above this did not get any pay rise for doing two departments work) there was no backdated pay for the staff that had been doing the extra work for months. 
- 	The department held a trip down to York in the middle of one of the lock-downs, which lead to numerous team members catching and spreading Covid. This was whistle blown by a colleague in the department. 
- 	The former CEO sent out regular emails that seemed to be bragging about his trips around the world paid for by Barclays, this was at a time where we were told that ""one team was implemented to prevent redundancies""
- 	With the changes to Covid 19 regulations staff were required to start returning to the office, staff were not briefed correctly. We were told we would be given 6 weeks notice in writing (letter) before we would be expected to return. No letters were ever sent and a vague email was sent instead and we were never updated about the changes. 
- 	In the department I worked in, we were closed on bank holidays and the holidays were automatically entered onto the system and removed from our allowance, with the changes and mergers that took place due to ""One team"" upper management decided to change this process and did not notify the staff. This has led to people now owing holidays and having reduced holidays for 2022. 
- 	Through my time at Barclays they worked with the mindset of if it ain't broke, break it. Feedback was consistently given by staff, customers and brokers about the systems and Barclays refused to update these. Instead any systems that worked smoothly (not many) they changed them completely and provided no training to staff on how to use these. System issues were consistent.
- 	In relation to systems in my role we were not provided access to the systems that our customers and brokers used, instead we were given outdated and vague screenshots that were extremely unhelpful. This led to regular difficult conversations with customers and brokers on how to use the system. This was raised numerous times and Barclays' response was ""we did have a few dummy accounts that you used to be able to use but they are now locked"", no effort was ever made to provide additional training or access to these systems. 
- 	 Staff members would regularly breach processes that were set by Barclays, which lead to abusive calls when you would not breach the process. Whenever feedback was provided to team leaders to investigate this would just fall on deaf ears and the same staff members would consistently get away with breaking the process.

Majority of the above has taken place throughout the last year and the way staff are treated is becoming worse by the day. There is a high turnover for staff and you are just a number. There are many more examples I can provide but the list would be endless.
If you are considering applying for Barclays my advice would be don't, avoid this company at all costs."

I love working remotely because it gives me the flexibility to travel and do day to day activities. Working in the call center can be interesting at times it just depends on the day.,"I work at the Wilmington location and it is VERY DISORGANIZED! From Day 1, I was given the incorrect equipment and training was terrible because we were given outdated information during training plus new policies were being inforced everyday which made the job even harder. I'm overworked and underpaid Barclays pay is very low for the amount of work we have to do. I'm basically working multiple roles with my customer service position in the Care department. Barclays is desperate for employees so that's why there constantly hiring I regret working for this company because its truly been a nightmare. Management is rude and trash. Very clueless individuals who don't know anything about the job. I swear I would NEVER recommend anybody working at Barclays because they don't care about their employees."

1015,,Losing sheen and a sinking ship (US region),2021-12-27,2.0,AVP-Analyst,"Good pay, good benefits and good diversity inclusion programs. Can be a great place only if you fall into the right team and manager. You will get rewarded for good work in the global recognition tool. Internal job opportunities/transfers are a plus and can help career growth for lucky folks.","1. The US arm of this bank is gradually losing sheen and is no longer an important decision making unit as it used to be until few years ago. With most decision management happening in the UK and most execution out of India, the US region hardly has any say. You can see reduced employee strength in the US and most folks in whippany are entry level or mid experience ones.

2. The bank is now controlled by bunch of bureaucrats sitting in the UK who have no idea in what direction to head. All good folks have almost left and the ones left behind are there to stay forever and hence not the best of the lot. Decision making is random and poorly channelized. There is lack of seriousness in execution in certain areas.

3. People can make huge blunders and yet get away easily in the name of senior management and experience. If the guy at the top says 2+2 equals 5 then entire hierarchy has to stick to 5 regardless of what the correct approach is. This whole culture of covering each other and allowing blunders to slip through will ruin the bank in the long run.

4.  Immigration arm of the company is totally misleading. If you are an international candidate then you better be prepared for a horrible H1B/GC experience path. Total disregard for international employees who need sponsorship."

After few months I was moved as well, I was treated like a parcel. 
No one took the time to ask me how it would have impacted my life moving to another branch and they did not ask me if I was happy about it. One month before they just told me, from that date you will be in that branch. Zero conversation. 

Moving to a much smaller branch I was stuck on a till for the whole time, all my previous learning was wasted and my career progression was stopped without any care. I started having as well physical issues which took me to have multiple sick days not being able to move my wrists and shoulders from the pain. I told them was the same movement over and over on the till was the one causing the issue because before I never had problems. They did not care and kept me on the same position, talking about wellbeing but not practicing at all.

I resigned for the first job I found and since it was one month's notice during that time they started sending me around covering other branches, even 1h travel, it was a nightmare, I had to take sick days for the stress they put me through. 

I don't recommend it at all, there are better companies to work for, where they really care about you as a person."

1692,,BBFA,2021-09-22,1.0,Financial Advisor,None. No pros at all.,"Poor pay. Bad hours. Zero support. 

Job role was wildly different to the job advert. Barclays said it ""wasn't a call centre job"" and ""outbound calls will be at a minimum"". ""No scripts!"".

The first 5 months were all outbound calls. It very much is a call centre. You absolutely have to use a script.

We were promised monitors and keyboards for working from home. 7 months later and we are still waiting for them.

Constant oversight. Can't even go to the toilet without someone ringing you to find out where you are.

The team leaders have as much experience in the role as you do (none). The procedure guide is 4-5 years out of date, and cannot be used anymore. You couldn't practice on the systems at all. So the first time you ever set any plan will be live with a customer. 

You're only allowed to put a customer on hold for 2 minutes, but it can take 15 minutes for you to get a team leaders attention.

They operate like a dodgy call centre out the back of a business park. It beggars belief how a multi-billion pound business can be this poorly organised.

At least 65% of the staff that joined when I did have left within 6 months. Barclays answer is to hammer the employees that remain even harder. I started in a team of 15 that is now just 6 people remaining."

- bad IT support. If you have some issue with VS or your laptop it can take days to get some response from some outsourced guy from support (you don't have admin permissions, remember? So you cannot fix it by yourself)
- at least in Prague there is no enough place to work together with your team - terrible openspace environment (they call it ""dynamic working"") . No walls - you have to listen all 20-40 people sitting close to you. Very noisy and always someone walking around all the time. You don't have your own desk and you have only one curved display (you cannot choose peripheral). If you want to meet with all your team members, you need to ask another team not to come to work that day, so you have some places to seat and work - in the company there are 2 people for one desk.

There is a good chance to work with other departments but only for odd queries and subject to approval from your manager.,"The role is good; however after 9 months there is no further progression from the training provided. As this was a call centre role, micromanagement is a severe issue, where managers are not trained in the role but focus on soft skills and not the technical issues against regulation. 

Also, there are several cases of discrimination for development of those in the in certain ethnic groups; where inappropriate questions are asked by managers and only the medical room can be provided for prayer grudgingly by management. Staff retention is a major issue as a result even for hard workers; and insufficient support for those with mental health.

Recruitment required to meet the demand and support staff.

1950,,Good but also very bad,2021-08-18,2.0,Director,"If you can work at Barclays you can work anywhere, the saying goes, and its true. On a positive side the training is first class, and depending which division you work in you should get a very broad range of experience. The bank is very focused on charitable work (see cons too). There is a very clear career progression until you get to a more senior level.","Toxic working environment. The companies public vision of diversity and inclusion isn't what you experience in the workplace. Senior management in the majority do not follow the (very well written) culture code at all, and there is a fear culture such that much goes unreported, and what does get reported is investigated thoroughly but seldom found against the leader in question. Expect to be spoken to like garbage one day, and like you are best friends the next. Fire drills are daily (hourly!) and that's where a lot of the poor behaviors come from. The amazing focus on charity hides a large number of people using the time to avoid work. Very few senior leaders are female, they also try to hit the numbers by focusing on promoting females for that purpose rather than through worth/skill/experience. That said, you can work in a different division at the bank and have a polar opposite view to these, and that's also why it's toxic - you can have horrendous managers or really good ones, its the luck of the draw where you work, if those leaders move, and whatever fire drill is happening that day. Once you get to a more senior level (VP) the career path stops and its dead mans shoes for the promotion."

Your complaints about bullying culture in Barclays is ignored.

They in fact encourage bullying because once you report a manager for bullying and unfair treatment, they make you tell this manager and this manager then moves you to another branch. 
The issue does not get dealt. Managers who have had grievances against them by an entire branch are just moved around to terrorise another branch. It is really horrible. 

There are a few gems in there from colleagues but barclays management is awful! 

Favouritism and Bully culture.

Speak up and they get rid of you. Passed around London as if you were the problem. 

I left in the end because i was getting bullied for trying to be save in covid19. Forced to come to work to do telephony when you can do this at home?
Telling you its just what it is however on BarclaysNow it says work from home if need be.

2961,,Great environment,2021-04-26,4.0,Business Analyst,Nice and friendly colleagues to work with,Long hours in the finance function.
2962,,False sense of care for employee wellbeing,2021-04-26,2.0,Vice President,Good PTO for US standards,"- Overly matrixed org design- slow on decisions, competing priorities from the top create unmanageable workload. Org design at lower team levels feel arbitrary. One team I was on was filled with directors and BA4s but few VP/AVP leading to too much strategy and not enough delivery. Current team filled with VPs who overlap and need more processors.

- Very limited growth & advancement opportunities in the US - the firm recently underwent a seismic org redesign, resulting in scores of Directors and above being laid off with the same jobs relocated to the UK. Very unlikely to be promoted beyond VP in the US

- In the US in order to receive recognition, increase remit/responsibility, you have to sacrifice worklife balance - aka meetings on UK hours before work and work all day. Better than the past, but still little timezone respect. Have to choose between a 5 AM meeting (advancing career by gaining exposure, knowledge, getting the information to just do your job) and wellbeing.

- Pay is subpar for the industry in NYC. Losing talent in the US to other firms who will pay normal salary and promote. 

- Pre COVID comments but still valid- no budget for anything. Systems only replaced when the third party is about to decommission support (= fire drill). Holiday party (pre-cv) no budget in NYC- could afford a drink a person (not all even got one) and a couple apps. Seems like they had a lot of fun in the UK though.

- 'Committed' to reducing gender pay gap, but not very transparent. Would like to to see honest reports by business area/function/location. My male peer on my team, performing a similar job function (but who I sit above in the team/management hierarchy and who has not been at the firm as long as me) makes $50,000 more in base pay. 

- Sense of care for wellbeing is well intentioned and widely broadcasted, however, it feels like a farce. Managers seldom adjust themselves as to embody the desired behaviors and effect change. 

(1) multiple initiatives/townhalls from senior leadership about taking work breaks -> manager works 10-12 hours a day and is emailing/skyping/texting before/after working hours 
(2) multiple initiatives/townhalls from senior leadership to reduce meetings > no meetings dropped from calendars."

- Nice office space with communal areas","There are so many. As a top level review this is one of the worst places I have worked at - which actually really badly affected my mental health.

My manager who was male was awful - definitely played favorites, made a lot of back handed comments and because he had been there for years nothing was ever done about it (despite other people also complaining about him).

There is such a lack of gender diversity within senior members of staff and because it is such an old company, there is no room for progression as those who stay the longest tend to move up when someone leaves . Some of the managers there (including my own) have clearly had no people training and just been promoted to managing positions due to their length of time at the company.

Being that it is financially regulated, there is so much red tape which makes getting anything done/ signed off really hard.

Overall, I wouldn't recommend. It's very political and even flexible working is not encouraged."

Unequal distribution of budget and status. The Cost Management team did not have a Christmas Party one year whilst Business Managers where always travelling to India etc. 
Coldest company I have worked for. Off shore support are treated as drones. My managers in Radbroke had no interest in my welfare or development. In 2 years, there was no budget to travel up to Cheshire. The first time I met my manager's boss, face to face was when he came down to London to start the redundancy consultation. This was after my manager (who I never met) sent me a cryptic email to be in the office that day. It was disappointing as my manager (despite over 20 years experience at Barclays) ever spoke to me immediately after or during my 3 month notice period.

4550,,Great work/life balance but lots of politics and limited resources,2020-11-20,4.0,Business Analyst,"- Barclays offer exceptional work/life balance via the ""Dynamic working"" scheme, which was well established before 2020 & Covid-19. You are able to adjust your working hours or/and work from home, as long as you manage to manage your workload. Just great service.
- Barclays is a huge organization with millions of customers. Any project that you are involved might result in millions of additional revenue or reduced costs, which is always nice both for personal satisfaction but also to include in your CV.
- Barclays supports heavily volunteering. There is a pound-for-pound match for any donations made by employees to most global non-profit organizations and initiatives and you are able to participate in Barclays' Lifeskills program, which is a great program with mane opportunities to get involved in volunteering around your area.
- The benefits package is quite generous. The pension scheme must be one of the best in the UK market, private healthcare, annual bonus, buying stocks at preferential rates, income protection, etc.
- Redundancy rounds. Barclays during the past couple years was under an enormous restructuring. So lots of people was offered to leave the bank and get significant redundancy packages. If you want to change a job anyway, then this might be a nice way to get a great bonus on your way out.","- Lots of politics
- Lots of scrutiny, bureaucracy (I guess like everywhere in financial services)
- Limited resources - You will never be able to hire the number of people that you need. It is very rare to have them pay for any professional certification/training. When I joined in the first 2 weeks I didn't have a laptop, and then they gave me an old/used one from someone who left! It wasn't even cleaned properly and it was disgusting. I finally got a new laptop after 12 months!
- As mentioned it's a great company to work and has great benefits. So you will meet many people who are working in Barclays for more than 10-15 years (and some even stay for their whole career!). This means that eventually, you might have a manager who joined Barclays right after school and managed to get promoted after so many years. Hence, you should expect that you might have to work along people who are not the brightest or/and have limited skills when compared with other companies at that level.
- Redundancy rounds. I mentioned earlier this as a pro. But it's a con as well, especially for people who were close to retiring and it's almost impossible for them to find another job at an advanced age. Also, quite tricky to become redundant during a pandemic (COVID-19)."

A toxic environment and a CFO not capable of holding his word. Disrespectful and unethical behavior.  After eight interviews I decided to join Barclaycard to lead a team of four finance analysts. This is what I was promised and what I agreed to. 
The first day I joined and without any previous notice I was informed that my role changed and I had to co-lead the team with a colleague that was already in the team in the same role the last 15 years. It was the first time in my life I heard the term ""Dual-leadership"". 
When I asked why this change happened and what was the plan moving forward, I got from the CFO a high level response that growth opportunities might exist in the future. 
On top, the colleague who was officially the leader of the team, was refusing to handover to me any element of the work, downplaying me constantly by taking advantage of his powerful position in the organization and pushing me to the limits. 
After two months I decided to quit. I paid a huge personal and professional cost to join them because I simply believed that they would have offered me the role we agreed to. However, the CFO was not capable of holding on his word. An unbelievable behavior. Of course, I did not even hear an apology from him for the inconvenience his decision caused to me."

Nepotism is rife here. It's really who you know and how much you suck up.

If you love homophobia, then this is the place for you too! Ignore the fancy IDAHOBIT days, a lot of people working here hate equality and make it verbally obvious. Also hearing racist and ableist remarks was an almost daily occurance.

So this make the life of his subordinates living hell. So much work pressure, daily on the receiving end of yelling. Certain days I feels like if I'm really good at anything or not.

People are not good or bad, but they are not experienced enough to handle the situation. So try to train them well before loading them with so much work load so that they take out their fear of disappointing their seniors on their teams.
All power lies with AVP+ level. Don't think that HR is of any help. 

If you have any concerns then talk to your manager or his manager but No HR.  So I'm just absorbing all their negative energy currently in hope of a better team in my next project."

5547,,Bad Pay; Lack of Growth;,2020-04-03,1.0,Trader,not bad for 1st year out of college; good vision benefits,"I started off in the internship program. That itself is mayhem, with the process designed for interns to just schmooze as many people as they can without really learning too much in the process (albeit its a 10 week program so only so much you can learn about trading). I ended up accepting the offer to join full time and it has been an overall average experience. The analyst to AVP program underpays you considerably. So kudos to those that take the offer and leave within 1 yr to get a higher salary elsewhere (where it is really possibly in trading). Overall the bank has no regard for juniors, which is why there is so much turnover. You will not find many from the internship program at Barclays, but they do stay in trading, which shows the bank is unable to retain talent. There is no feedback process for your boss. They have the ability to say whatever they want, without you contesting it. The main reason why I left is because I felt significantly undervalued. I was doing work and making the kind of money my AVP wasn't and he was paid double what I was. Thats just not the right way to treat people, especially a woman trader. So I would say this bank does not particularly support women in trading. I would say this to those interested: join, use the bank for as much as it can give you (1 yr pay), and leverage to do something better. DO NOT stick around. It is not worth it. I had several MDs of different desks that supported me and my work, but were unable to help me get the pay I deserved. So mentorship can only go so far when your immediate director is unfavorable. 

Also I worked 12+ hour work days all the time; it went completely unnoticed despite my book absolutely killing it. 

Below was my comp. Evidently it is SIGNIFICANTLY below market rate. 
1st yr: 85k/yr base with 15k sign on bonus; 10k stub bonus

The effort to centralise 'centres of excellence' has unfortunately made it really difficult to deliver change as orchestration across business and tech areas is really difficult. Each area is only focussed on their goals. Not enough focus on shared objectives and truly serving the customer, not just shareholders. 
Additionally there is a bit of a glass ceiling when you get to VP level. Not many senior roles available at Director or MD level. Lot of shifting of deck chairs at those levels and now focus is on promoting women (noble intent but not great message to hear if you are a man with ambitions). 
There is also a lot of theatre and showcasing of achievements that are just not value adding. The internal PR is more important than actual delivery and customer value, driven mainly by senior leaders competing with each other and creating a façade."

Safe position.
Great flexibility if you have family: flexible hours, occasional home office possibility, option for part time.
Diversity in every sense.","As for feedback and improvement ideas: full force against such from management. First nobody wants to improve things. Then, if somebody wants so, nobody listens. Then if somebody listens, nothing happens. What finally may happen is that they tell you to shut up and work; unless there is scandal. When scandal comes, managers start to push responsibility downwards. 
Technology: there are new technologies but since nobody has the view on those, they work worse than old ones.
Bureaucracy: impossible to achieve any goal in the time frame it would make sense. Not complaining about 3 days instead of 2... but more than a year instead of less than a month?!
Internal tooling unusable.
Talent retention: it's considered something that HR must solve alone, quickly and possibly without expense. What we get is an insult from employee perspective.
Environment: the office is _dirty._"

VP culture/ army style hierarchy in some teams who don't mingle if you don't hold the same level or acceptance.
Culture of Bank for location strategy, permanent staff vs contractors changes every one to two years with change in management perception or the management itself
Bonuses are peanuts or just ok as HR adopted a new strategy with ratings as follows
> Needs Improvement
> Strong
> Exceptional

Earlier there was something like Very Strong in it. This new criterion makes it difficult to haggle as everyone can't say they are Exceptional. So you end up losing your bonus.
London has become non strategic for many businesses so if they are hiring for a position think as you maybe asked to move to Radbroke or Glasgow or other areas where they are opening 3000 seater own office spaces."

* Some very smart people to work with","* Not up to date with tech. Even though there are talks to upgrade things this is just talk. Nothing ever comes out of it. My skills are actually worse since i joined
* Ambitious projects which will never work out because of the lack of tech. All they will ever become is a slide in a presentation somewhere. No niche solution will be used in production or anything.
* Abusive managers. I cannot stress this one enough. It depends on the team but in every team i have been there was always one manager who thought abuse, yelling and belittling his subordinates was a good idea
* Constant reorgs and hiring freezes. In the time i have been there there were 2 reorgs and a constant hiring freeze.
* Massive attrition which also means that given the hiring freeze the people staying have to do everything. People leaving constantly doesn't raise any HR flags. No one cares if a team of 20 suddenly becomes a team of 8. It is BAU.
* Below market salary
* A lot of people who have been there for more than a decade and cannot understand that things have to change at some point. Banking is still viewed as a job for life for some generations and that leaves no space for younger people
* Promotion is hard. If you dare to question anything you go directly in a blacklist. You just have to nod and smile constantly for about 10 years if you want to get promoted. Young people with great end of year reviews do not manage to get anywhere most of the time and they end up leaving. 
* You get sucked in a world of bureaucracy which i can only describe as kafkaesque. While I understand this is a massive organisation and certain things have to be regulated this is on a whole new different level. I have worked in big organisations before but they were lightyears more efficient than Barclays"

I have seen customers with their lives destroyed by the bank's actions and have been asked to lie to them, withhold information they are legally entitled too, all in the knowledge that if they take a complaint to the ombudsman they will side with the bank.

Aware that it needs to tick the relevant social boxes, the bank has promoted female promotion and diversity (LGBT) across the bank - you will certainly get preference above other candidates.","The business systems go back as far as the 1970s and some of the processes are still manual so you might spend a lot of time performing mundane tasks that should be automated.  In the past, the work was very exciting when the bank was innovating and pushing its technology capabilities but now the lack of skilled technologists, who were made redundant or have simply left due to the boring work, have left a large intelligence gap that simply means that most projects or programmes fail or lack sufficient funding.  I have been at the bank for a number of years and it used to be an exciting and challenging place to work.  It is now mundane, boring and mind numbing.  Corporate systems, such as personal laptops and the software upon them, are so brittle that if the laptop doesn't fail the software will."

6294,,Overall a good company just not the department I was in,2019-09-16,4.0,Direct Premier Relationship Manager,"I loved the job, the customers were so interesting to talk to and hear about their lives and professions. Most customers were high earners so a lot of them worked in very specific niche areas of their professions and it was interesting to hear about their specialities. Before working in my last department I had always praise Barclays as an employer, their benefits package is second to none and the wages are really good.","I was in a department called premier direct when I left, I originally started that department as a team leader, when I was interviewed for the job, my understanding of the job role was that I would have a portfolio of high value clients and that my team would manage the clients due to the size of the portfolio, I couldn’t have been more wrong! When I began they put me in new to bank training even though I had been a part of Barclays for 5 years already, it had been a while since my last management position and some management training would have been a lot more beneficial. They also gave me a team that they had taken on as a risk due to the majority of them coming into work from long term unemployment and as such a lot of them were difficult to manage! The job role they were doing was not any kind of relationship building or management. They were on an outbound dialler making sales calls, all the calls were loaded into the dialler based on prompts about lending, mortgages and sometimes savings (although the focused heavily on lending mainly). The people I was managing had no idea what they were targeted against Yet I was expected to put action plans in place when they didn’t get things like mortgages or loans within a 2 week period. In the end I had to take time off and decided this wasn’t the job for me. When I returned I was made a direct premier relationship manager where i would contact the customers to build relationships myself, while this was using the same outbound dialler there was more of a relationship building style to it and not just completely sales. However, on returning I was clear my card was marked and I wasn’t wanted there, I would imagine it was due to having knowledge of the underhand techniques and sales they were driving when as a bank Barclays do not set targets for sales. I soon found myself going through a disciplinary process and when speaking to other people within the department and the union the “offence” I had committed should have been dealt with by no more than a file note. Soon after this was resolved I found myself to be the main suspect of another investigation for a laptop which was stolen 12 months earlier from my car, at the time this was reported to the police and they had seen the damage done to my car from the break in. I was told it was someone within the department who had contacted their special investigations team to raise this with them requesting it was looked into. This I also believe to have been done maliciously and in an attempt to make me feel like i was no longer welcome there, I’ve since decided to leave Barclays as they made it difficult for me to move to another business area."

Barclays in Whippany had a great culture that many companies strive for, but is hard to truly create. Leaders are humble. Employees work hard, but that is a lot of emphasis on work life balance. I’ve never been at a company that is so supportive of employees engaging in employee-driven events and community service. Most teams, at least at this site, have flexible work schedules. Benefits are great, a clinic, backup daycare and awesome gym onsite. This is a solid company for veterans with a long history of supporting them globally. 

The reason I think the cultural tone is so strong is because the senior leaders I have met are humble and accessible.","It’s a big company and sometimes because of that and because it is not HQ’d in the US, it can take a lot of time and effort to move change. That said, people are supportive in working to find a way. Overall, I am thrilled with my experience. The onboarding process could be improved to make getting initial accessed easier and faster but I felt supported and was always able to find someone to help me when needed."

6402,,Personal Assistant,2019-08-22,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Barclays’ esteemed reputation and the role initially attracted me. I was blown away by the stunning Whippany NJ campus: fresh air walking paths, weekly vendor sales, barber/manicurist/masseuse, on-your-honor convenience store, hot and cold brew coffee bar, arcade game room, pool and ping-pong tables and an employee cafe down the hill replete with healthful food choices including an Argentinian grill. I’m awed by just how much effort the management has expended in making this such a delightful workplace.  That the Barclays’ values mirror my own makes this company a keeper. Management hires you to tell them how things should be done, not vice versa. So refreshing. You get a lot of flexibility with work-at-home arrangements. There’s two-way trust here. Bring your strong sense of integrity, desire for excellence, as well as communication, teamwork, negotiation, and collaboration skills. You’ll need them to navigate the behemoth company and get things done. You’ll meet lots of great people, and make some good friends. Barclays likes to help people rise, to get us to the best place for us all. That includes not just customers and clients, but employees as well. I love working in a professional atmosphere, with brilliant minds. I’m really glad I accepted the offer.","If you’re not familiar with navigating a large company,  you’ll need to start smiling and reach out to your colleagues to get things done.

Reasonable work life balance. 
On managers discretion some teams have flexible working.","Apart from breathing every thing else requires you to fill forms on umpteen request systems for which you have to then send multiple manual chasers to multiple approvers. Utterly chaotic atmosphere in the tech/dev area. Devs are basically treated like low skilled manual labour with minimal rights, while non-technical incompetent but very political middle management takes all the rewards. 
Everyone receives hundreds of completely irrelevant pointless emails every day.  Some times entire days are spent on phone calls trying to explain technical stuff to non technical mgmt who still dont get it. I have actually seen people with tens of thousands of unread emails in their inboxes. 
The Core values(RISES) only apply to low level technical staff. Mgmt is beyond it. 
In normal companies the process that takes 30 minutes can some times take 30 days to do in barclays. Other times people just give up. 
Technical staff have to do mandatory irrelevant trainings every quarter because mgmt cant be arsed to filter the trainings.

The actual people that do the work are great, a lot of nice and talented people there.","The management don’t care at all about their employees, as long as the work gets done. All they do is talk about 360 feedback, yet when presented with feedback themselves, they are only willing to take on positive feedback rather than constructive as well. I even had an exit interview with a director where I gave mix of feedback, and as soon as I mentioned the management he didn’t want to hear it, it’s a disgrace. They don’t care about people and they’re obsessed with control, they literally prevent their team members from making internal job moves as well, like go and speak to the hiring managers to ensure they don’t give people in their team the job. They make fun of the people in their teams, laughing at them and bullying people. One of the managers was even clearly sleeping with the head of department. 

I personally was heavily involved in one of the networks that got a lot of shoutouts from senior management, and as soon as those shoutouts started happening, my manager was trying to push me to not be a part of the network, because she literally didn’t want me to be getting recognised.

There was one guy from another department who did a secondment in our area, had to re-interview at the end of his secondment and found out he didn’t get the job by logging into the HR portal, his manager who he’d been working with for a YEAR didn’t even have the courtesy to take him aside and let him know.

The managers conveniently find BS excuses to mark people down or put people on action plans right before the half year and end of year reviews. It doesn’t matter at all what you write in your own review as it’s completely based on whether or not they like you."

6801,,"Great business & Culture, with some challenges.",2019-05-11,4.0,Vice President,"Barclays are a really amazing company to work for, without any doubt.  
For a start - the benefits are fantastic.  You get a generous benefits allowance and can tailor your package to what you want, everything from life, illness and accident insurance to gym membership and bike to work.  
The culture is very relaxed, almost too relaxed at times.  Barclays are normally the last bank to get to an offer when they're in competition against the other banks, and this needs to be remedied.   However, this relaxed culture means I've never been micromanaged.  You're left to do a job, and as long as you're delivering, you'll be left alone and can work as you wish.
The opportunities are there, for sure.  I went from Cashier to VP in 8 years, but you do find the competition intense the higher you get.","As mentioned above, the floors of head office are filled with exceptional people, and competition for senior roles is intense.  This, however, is what you need to expect, and is universal across the industry.
Having said this however, promotions, in my experience, are very much about the face that fits, and you do find some very unexceptional people moved very quickly up the chain.  The biggest flaw that Barclays have is their interview process for promotions.  The process ONLY takes into account your performance on a rigid, scripted 45 minute competency interview, and not your prior performance in role.  This hasn't been the case at other banks I've worked at, where the highest performers tend to get promoted.  At Barclays, it's all about how good your (often made-up on the spot) examples to these questions are, and it's terrible."

Not that much work. So if you do your work and don't get vocal about what you have done its equivalent to not doing any work.

Visibility is over valued.

Some colleagues don't follow RISES.. If you don't give respect you are not going to get it.  People feel entitled because they have spent more time in the company.

People who have been with organization for long enough assume seniority in aggressive ways and that can seem very unprofessional at times.

Even the people with expertise in a skill are ignored in discussions relates to that skill just because they are new joiners.

More importance given in discussions to people who are more experienced in organozation  even though they are making the same point as their new joinee colleagues..
In fact at times people copy someones view in front of them and state them as their own... That's what happens when visibility brownie points are linked to bonuses.

7302,,Spring Intern,2018-12-06,5.0,,"As a student who aims for constant learning, development and new challenging opportunities I thought the Barclays Spring Week Insight was a perfect opportunity to kick start my career since an early stage of university. The process of applying was very straightforward, I really enjoyed the process as it involved a video-interview, in my opinion this recruitment tool is way more effective and personal than a cover letter, as an example. 
Once the Spring Week started, I felt motivated and involved from the first minute and I quickly engaged with the other interns and employees of the firm. I woke up every day looking forward to arriving to the office. I couldn’t’ t wait to get exposure to the Spring Weeks learning and development, providing me with a honest insight into the industry, which for me was vital as it made me know how it really is to work in the financial services industry. Before the Insight Week myself and other interns did not know if we wanted to pursue a career in this industry, however, now I am very sure I want to, and if it wasn’ t for this experience I would still have major doubts about my career and future plans, now I have a clear image of my future role and how I will create a positive impact on the financial services sector.
The supportive environment makes justice to Barclays identity. The help I received from my team created an exceptional working environment that allowed me to feel comfortable sharing my ideas and being myself. Their hospitality and the way in which they value the talent of new generations were both motivating and unique. 
What I really appreciated about Spring Week was how from the first day, interns tried their best to talk to each other aiming to create and develop positive relationships which would not only help them throughout the Spring Week insight but also in life in general, as a point of contact for our future careers but also as friendships. I saw a positive competitiveness, something which is much needed in most organizations as it leads to maximum effort and development of its members but also, it leads to people pushing each other up and collaborating towards the goal achievement of everyone.
During this week, the learning curve was steep, this learning was not only about Barclays and its culture but it led to a deep contact with its functions and its employees by also learning about Barclays clients and how to deal with them. I am very grateful for the vast amount of knowledge I have learnt which will help me in my life and future career 
This experience was unique and life changing. It has improved my life, it has developed my desire to become great, but most importantly it has given me the confidence I know I need to achieve my dreams.","From my short experience with the bank I can not find significant disadvantages. However, there may be disadvantages depending on employee preferences. It is obvious that hours are long and projects are extent. Banking is an industry which requires sacrifice and consistency.  Also, in most cases you will be reporting to senior management, some people dislike this as they would like to be their own boss."

Good bonus scheme (quarterly)

Senior managers are easily accessible

Good working hours","No real opportunities for progression. There is a culture of favoritism. If you do not make the correct connections, you cannot expect to progress into senior roles regardless of experience or talent.

Poor opportunities for development

Some (not all) managers who act in a threatening or professionally inappropriate way towards the staff.

Internal communication is bad.

Pay is arguably unjust and too low. You can have 2 people on the same salary, one of which is performing in a much more difficult role, while the other is taking on less taxing work."

7318,,Investment Banking Associate,2018-11-30,4.0,Investment Banking Associate,"Relatively colleagial culture for investment banking, though some groups better than others.","Compensation is well behind peers, and employees are nicked and dimed wherever possible, for example:

The firm defines your “salary” at a figure well below your annual fixed compensation so that the firm can pay your retirement and health benefits off a lower number. The firm is the only bank on the street that doesn’t make annual salary bumps effective January 1st, instead waiting until late March, meaning you lose a meaningful catchup bonus (~5-10k) every year. The firm requires you buy your own laptop and does not reimburse you for very normal expenses like holiday parties, recruiting lunches and dinners.

Barclays is also the only firm on the street that fires a meaningful portion of its staff right before bonuses every year, which is really an awful thing. I saw many colleagues, including fathers and mothers, completely shocked and devastated as they were escorted out of the building with half the comp they had been expecting to live on."

7536,,Big Job - Little Salary,2018-09-16,1.0,KYC Analyst,The only good thing about working at this place was where it was located.,"They make you work more than you get paid for. Senior management are on a power trip and I have never seen any company with such a bad salary bracket in every field.

I want to start off by saying, if you are going to apply for a job at Barclays then take my advice save yourself from working for a company who will pay you peanuts but expect you to work harder than the senior managers. 
Not only is Barclays really bad for giving you salary that is lower than ever other financial services out there, Resource Solutions are the worst for making it look as if its a good salary and they are doing you a favor. The staff at resource solutions will not even try to negotiate a better salary for you. Everybody within this organisation only thinks about themselves. I was working for Barclays for a short while but i noticed a lot, by talking to many of the staff within my department and other departments and nobody had anything positive to say about their job. I also witnessed senior managers prioritizing their friends and family to get jobs before other better qualified staff. 
Micromanagement is also very common, but it ok for managers to do what they want but when it comes to you they treat you like a child. 
Also, if you are Asian or from any other ethnic background, the interview process will be even harder for you than others, so your chances of getting a job here are even more slim."

Quarterly incentives,
Flexibility in terms of part time/full time and changing your hours or shifts.","- The pay is really terrible considering what you are expected to do in your role on a day to day basis.
- There is a constant shortage of staff in ALL the branches in the area I work in which means we are constantly struggling to manage work loads and customers which makes all of us much more stressed and unhappy than we need to be. Despite this, they refuse to hire more staff even though people are constantly leaving due to the highly stressful environment. The staffing crisis is huge at barclays right now.
- Management is BAD, they have 0 support to their staff during the day, they have 0 idea of what goes on in the branch on a day to day basis. All they care about are sales and numbers and performance but do absolutely nothing to motivate their staff  or identify problems with the working environment.
- Career advancement and progression is almost impossible. They are so desperate for staff that they will not let you move on from your role because they don't want to replace you and hire staff.

Most of them will be sincerely grateful when they perceive that you care about them and are trying to help them make the best choices. That is very fulfilling. 

- Decent company benefits and bonus. Nice quarterly and annual ones.

- Good chance to build a career within the company: if the company and job is for you, possibilities of growing are endless. There are plenty of roles, especially in the corporate field.","- The Moment Banker role is advertised as a purely customer service job but has a strong sales element to it. You will be told that what matters is giving the customer the opportunity and let them then make their own informed choice... but if they don't end up taking  the product you will then be pressured by the management because you done enough of this or that. You will essentially be measured according to hinted-at targets that you officially don't have and that you are not allowed to call by that name. There is no fixed number, but it will always be ""more"".
Officially the world ""sales"" is anathema and cannot be mentioned, either with customers or with higher-ups in the business,  but it will be constantly utilized in internal meetings, giving rise to a recurrent cognitive dissonance. 

- The branches I worked in were highly disorganized and there was a certain culture of leniency going on. People just didn't turn up, or they overslept and turned up late, or behaved in a very lazy, unprofessional and juvenile manner and were allowed to just get away with it. The worst they'd get is a slap on their wrist. 
On the other hand, hard-working people with strong values were constantly being monitored and picked up for the slightest inaccuracy. 

-Terrible IT infrastructure. Computers and systems very sluggish and constantly crashing. Sections are full of bugs that stay there for months and months. Designs are very much nonsensical and not user-friendly.

-Senior management severely lacking in many compartments. Colleagues who really cared about helping customers make the best choice were being pressured into leaving the job, colleagues with personal issues (sometimes as serious as mental health) were told to just ""man up"", openly threatened to be managed out of the job or bullied in staff meetings.... and this coming from a company that prides itself in values such as inclusiveness etc. etc.

Overall, something like 10 out of 16/17 members of staff were leaving or actively looking to leave the job/branch."

Its a political setting - UK bosses favor people in the UK. Vendors can become your boss even though you are an employee - especially if the vendor is from UK. Things move very slowly - learning opportunities are less. You need to know how to talk polished english and talk big but deliver nothing. Because Barclays UK employees want to avoid work - if you are doer kind of person and deliver work they feel threatened about their job. If you are a doer kind of person this place is not for you. If you are meticulously delivering value, your boss will pretend not to understand it and will underestimate you, but yes he will speak sweetly with you as if he is on your side and understands everything.  Appraisal is flawed - if a UK vendor complains against you, despite your justifications it wont be considered just because you are India and he is UK.  Boss doesnt have visibility of your work and neither wants to try for getting visibility because he is lazy - so surprise alternative !!! -> you have to to beg your colleagues to give feedback, even if you know they lack any knowledge about your work, so its not smart appraisal and quite random. Then any negative comment is picked up from their feedback and focus is only on negatives and not on any positive. They will also put you in ImprovementNeeded as you are not aligned to them politically. Most of the time of afternoons is spent in meetings.  In Barclaycard, projects are planned to be delivered within 6 months these needlessly go on and on, there is a lot of needless polished english exchange in them - then big meetings are arranged to say with polished english taglines apologizing that this project is delayed by another 3 years. After 3 years also you deliver projects only partially - just think what will you tell in your next prospective employer about what you did in Barclays in all these 3-4 years!! Meanwhile frauds get committed continuously at higher levels, and those who are innocently working at India offshore have to waste time going through hours and hours of Barclays values trainings - while the top level goes scotfree and continue to commit frauds."

- managers take offence if you ask them to help out in banking hall even though their job description clearly states they need to actively pitch in. They turn up just for tick in box for ten minutes a day in certain flagship branches in west London.   In fact they bark back saying “you should work smarter so you don’t need extra help”

- I complained about a member of staff who verbally and physically abused me-and when I went to manager to complain- the managers answer was “oh no please.  Not today.  We have the hot shot directors coming down today...... we can’t afford any issues today”

- a lot of managers are power hungry and can and will pull up staff for not smiling in morning meetings.   It’s insane.   Iv seen someone get ticked off for not looking interested because she wasn’t smiling for no reason in morning group meeting.   The managers feel they can pick on people for sake of it 

- it can be very demoralising and depressing working in an environment where manager have petty mentality.   For example being barked at by counter manager for doing something she does and her pals at work.  But if someone they don’t like do it- they will shout at you and when you complain to branch managers........ they brush it under carpet and tell you to grow up and not take offence. 

HOW CAN ANYBODY BE EXPECTED TO WORK IN A PLACE WHERE YOUR TOLD OFF FOR TAKING OFFENCE WHEN THINGS ARE THROWN AT YOU AND YOU FEEL VICTIMISED.  

Awful demoralising culture.   

Iv seen managers watching someone laugh, then managers will say “have you not got any work to do?”

There’s a culture of not wanting people to be happy.  They want everyone as miserable as they are themselves.  


Iv seen managers sit in banking hall and gossip with their mothers who pop in during their shopping trip.   Iv seen manager play with her kid in banking hall (which managers mother brings in during shopping trip) whilst the bank is full of customers - 

But god forbid that anyone of the cashiers laugh or talk amongst one another in banking hall......   they get a ticking off by manager for not being professional.  

Hypocrisy.   
That’s why I left and I’m now working as a manager in another financial institute and I’m more happy and more healthy emotionally."

Consequently; people who have been working in the business for years have unique knowledge of these systems. Once they eventually leave there is no one else who has the relevant knowledge; leaving mission critical processes in the lurch.
- Upper middle management and senior management unwilling to listen to feedback and warnings of the above. They feel like this is only a stepping stone onto bigger and brighter things, so they don't want to get too invested before yet another director takes over. 
- Some managers have set up their own little fiefdoms and will do everything within their power to keep it that way.

Not one of them in that office has the slightest clue what they are doing nor the relevant experience or qualifications, all talk and no walk. Managers forgot where they came from, which most of the time was fresh out of school and into a minimum wage job for the next 10 years. Everything is rushed and ALWAYS goes wrong and needs fixing. Managers seem to have a very high opinion of themselves which is funny really 'cos you're more likely to get promoted by sexual favours than actually working.  Computer systems are a disgrace. No on site computing specialist. Air conditioning broken for years, no clean air, roasting hot or freezing cold. People really do not matter there. Have a good idea? Keep it to yourself 'cos if the managers see you as a threat to their chance of promotion they will screw you over in a flash, which includes stealing your ideas and/or manipulating your yearly review. If you don't like it you will 'easily' be replaced. Intelligent, good workers are left to rot when people are getting promoted through butt kissing and bribery and who can make the boss laugh the most. The salary is dire and years behind other retail banks. Sexist in relation to all promotion of females while the males get ignored. Utterly disgusting treatment of staff, particularly those with disabilities and/or health problems.  Childish culture, much like school, in the remedial class. Management couldn't give a toss about your work/life balance. The 'Barclays Values' are promoted but the exact opposite is actually what occurs! Undisciplined and disorganized staff and processes.

- Great opportunities for personal and career development.
- Varied day to day working. Many different areas in which you are trained on.
- Really great fast paced environment.
- Great benefits as a full time member of staff which make the staff feel valued such as performance related bonus.
- Really enjoyable place to work once you are trained, as there is a lot of knowledge to learn and job fulfilment. 
- A great job for someone who really enjoys making a difference.
- Some of the more senior staff are really supportive.
- Great company ethics concerning female empowerment and morals. A really supportive company for women who want to further their career goals. 
- Great culture day to day with management support if a customer is particularly difficult which is a great aspect of management.","- Often lots of customer pressure based on you if you are in the banking hall as you are often the first point of call.
- Left feeling overwhelmed and untrained at the beginning of the job - training should be longer and more in-depth. The online training does not prepare you for the job as much as it should and there should be longer practical training to enable best customer service.
- As a temp, there were no benefits including no sick pay or holiday pay.
- Management often place lots of pressure on the front of house staff off the back of MPS customer service calls. We are often told conflicting ideas to approach customer service i.e. We must man Zone A (meet&greet zone) then told after customers say we aren't helping enough to not man Zone A. Told to encourage customers to use Assisted Service Counters, but often getting feedback that as customer service providers we are too pushy/intrusive. The zonal system does not work and needs to be reworked by people who have actually been party to the first line of defence within customer service as they have the best idea of day to day service and know how there banking hall works best.
- MPS system for customer feedback is poor as the questions are open ended and long which results in discrepancies between MPS calls due to differential customer opinion on good customer service. Essential bankers often facing the brunt of this and not getting their good work recognised.
- Management are not pro-active enough and do not show banking hall presence - often showing a begrudging attitude to being asked to cover the banking hall-  therefore it is often condescending to staff to be told how to improve their service as management do not know the day to day running of the banking hall and thus can not devise plans. 
- All staff should be trained on all aspects of the business before progressing as often it leaves the banking hall short as people can not cover the counter and therefore leaves people alone in the banking hall - which is not only dangerous in case of emergency but also reflects poorly on customer service.
- Some staff are on old contracts which is unfair to other members of staff. Staff often got to leave early or not work saturdays because of their old contract - this should be updated to ensure there are enough staff provisions for the whole day - not only part of the day as it forces pressure on the staff who complete the whole day. 
- Management encourage competition between staff which creates an uneasy atmosphere. Praise is often not given on merit - as managers often have their favourites (which is not unique to barclays but should nevertheless be worked upon to ensure all staff feel satisfaction within their job.) Cohesiveness of the team would also improve alongside a healthier working environment if this was fixed and looked at.
- Technology at Barclays is among the best within the banking sector, however often it fails which is not only embarrassing but also reflects poorly on customer service. Barclays should enable all technology is piloted and works well before rolling it out in to all their branches. For example the Kiosk and its software& privacy must be looked at and improved upon to improve customer service. Counter software should be updated and easier to use. iPad's should be able to action prompts and the software should be improved to ensure it doesn't time out constantly which results in poor customer service as often staff take customers out of the counter queue to help them but due to technological error have to place the customer back in to the queue.
-Marketing also needs to be improved upon. Often posters are released with poor wording regarding branch closure or hour reduction which results in unhappy customers. Again, essential bankers face the brunt of this. Marketing should ask essential bankers their opinions or create a poll in some instances - or even take someone on who has had front line experience because the company would benefit from correct wording and knowledge of someone who has dealt with customers on a day to day business."

good place to work temporarily to understand what you don't want and how a large organization works despite having robust reporting.

Lack of progression due to a number of average talented people who have been at the bank for a while blocking the way.
Anyone who has been there more than 3/4 years seems to miss the good old days and more of a hinderance to progress as it will mean more work for them.

Please note this is only the case in a couple departments, many departments i know of have none of these issues."
8464,,Career Graveyard,2017-10-07,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"I’ve been working at the Barclays Investment Bank for 8 years now. There’s been a lot of changes over these years but these have only been gradual. As Barclays continues in its slow death-spiral into irrelevance it’s becoming harder to justify working here.

Work Life Balance - you can ""work from home"" most days of the week because the Bank is saving money on office space. Sure, you can be sucked into working 18 hours a day but you'll quickly realise this is pointless (more on that below) and end up doing the 9 to 5 like a normal person. You’ll probably have to work a weekend every month though (no overtime paid).

People – the ones that are left are clever, talented and, above all, human (if a little bitter) and have a wealth of experience that you can learn from. Because most of the employees have given up there is an atmosphere of capitulation that makes for a day full of acerbic jokes and swearing.","Career Progression – there are no promotions by design. The HR rules mean that you can’t be promoted in the same role. You have to move department to get a higher grade. The side-effect of this is, of course, that there is no incentive to do well in your current role. And as you’re not learning anything new you end up just doing the minimum and do the 9 to 5. You can only become more specialised sitting in your current role and therefore even less employable by another department.

Office – because of the cost-saving you don’t get your own desk so your first hour every day is spent trying to get the desktop and monitors to work. You’re packed in there like angry chickens. That’s fine if you like close body contact but bad news if you’ve got a noisy or smelly neighbour. 

IT Infrastructure - this is decades behind the real world and programmers spend most of their time trying to keep creaking servers running. You’re not going to be working on any new technologies for sure. As teams have been fired their systems have stopped working. Sometimes this can be a good thing – there is no database for tracking holidays so it’s a free-for-all. On the other hand, you’re going to have to pay for getting company emails and conference calls outside of the office.

Management and Culture –the current atmosphere of anarchy is amusing but doesn’t help the less aggressive employee. The only attempt at fostering a company culture is the occasional “newsletter” from the senior management. It’s filled with fake good news so, yeah, thanks for that but I can read the press about the latest fine we’ve been slapped with because of some board members’ behaviour. It’s so anodyne that both the person sending it and the person reading it thinks the other is an idiot. I realise that managers are restricted in what they can do (there are no promotions allowed, after all) but the failure to engage with their employees is either cowardice or contempt."

8590,,Investment Bank: Big Review,2017-08-23,4.0,Software Developer,"I wrote a review just over 2 years ago and I'm still here at Barclays Investment bank – on the whole it's a good place to work. Unfortunately due to lack of career opportunities I feel it's time to leave but decided to write this review so others can learn from my experience over the past 3 years working at Barclays.

First of all, it's a big bank. A lot of your experience will be determined by those around you rather than the company as a whole. Also, the banking group led by CEO Jes Staley is actually made up of smaller parts – as of 2017 it’s essentially two major legs:

Barclays UK
-	The retail bank (typical high street stuff), 
-	Barclaycard (UK only)
-	UK wealth business (rich clients)
-	Corporate banking (small and medium firm finance)

Barclays International
-	Corporate banking (large global firm financing)
-	Investment bank (trading global markets)
-	Barclaycard (outside UK)

These two legs (designed to ring-fence risky stuff away from conventional banking) are both supported by a service company, Barclays Services Limited. The service company is where all the non-revenue generating parts such as IT and other operational back office teams are (they share the same resources); this company supports both the UK and International legs. Each bullet point is a separate company so it’s a very big group. Barclays predominantly focuses on the UK and US markets, clients and firms. Someone working in the retail bank will experience a totally different career to those in the investment bank -there are pros and cons for each of them.
--------------------------------------------------------------

I work in the investment bank middle office (supporting front office – sales and traders).

Jes Staley, CEO. He knows what he is doing, comes across as humble and has sensible plans. Jes makes sure his ‘generals’ carry out what needs to be done, especially around restructuring Barclays for the future (thankfully a lot of big changes are now done). Totally agree with Jes about the need to have a diverse set of people to work with (i.e. no old boy clubs) and the need to have better technology; he understands the bank today is actually a tech firm and IT is not a cost center – it is the bank. Also emphasizes that Barclays has a role to play in society and the greedy self serving banker has to be stopped (not too sure how this works with him taking such a large salary though…)

The brand. It looks good on your CV.

Learn on the job. You don’t need to be up to your eye balls in fancy qualifications to do most of the jobs. Studying finance helps but honestly, it’s not something that everyone needs as the roles across the teams are so varied you have to just have a good attitude and work hard to get it. Like I said – most a just well paid grunts with easily transferable skills to other offices in any industry.

Diversity. People don’t care about your background, ethnicity or anything like that – it’s what you bring to the table and your ability to do your job. We have people fresh from school, 18 years old on apprenticeships and those that have PhD maths doing some very clever stuff.

Work Hours. The culture of “lunch is for wimps” is long gone and working hours are pretty good. No one frowns at you for going to lunch or leaving on time, although most stay beyond their contracted hours to finish the job. A big cultural shift from the days before the 2008 crash. Also everyone is being encouraged to work from home occasionally as this saves desk space (in turn saving the bank money from building costs, etc)

The People. On the whole they are a nice bunch of people to work with. They are always busy but are approachable; I can’t recall anyone saying “avoid so and so because you’ll get shouted at”. Everyone is down to earth and very hard working (except a few management types). Some people here are very smart with PhDs and other big qualifications – don’t worry though as not every role needs a rocket scientist.

Work Environment. It’s quite good to be fair – you get multiple monitors, virtual desktops, access to a lot of software. Some of the systems are old but they are looking to update them over time (will take years). Realistically it’s doing alright though – haven’t quite got to everyone using touch screens but it’s not ancient (Win 7 or Win 10). Nice open plan office area, canteen, meeting rooms, etc but certainly not like Google (unfortunately).","Okay, so now you know the scale of the firm it’s become apparent that it is very hard to climb the corporate ladder. Each company such as the investment bank has its own large hierarchy with thousands of people working for it; due to the numbers involved it is often the case of not what you do but rather who you know which will allow you to progress. You can get someone incredibly talented at analyst level (bottom rank) but will never get chance to move up and really shine due to the odds against them – this means that good people leave as they aren’t progressing as quickly as could have been or they get bored and want new work. Based on what I’ve seen people usually leave the firm after 2-3 years (sometimes just after 1 year) at lower levels as it dawns on them that you are playing a numbers game. 

Politics. Okay, I’ve yet to work for any company where people don’t play politics; it’s a fact of life. Unfortunately I feel that those that have made it to pretty good positions (VP, Director level) are reluctant to do good job and end up falling into the politics game. I hear very senior people saying “work together as one company” but in reality in each team managers are playing politics and looking after their own interests. No one from very high up ever visits the ‘ground troops’ and so they are out of touch of what it’s like back on the floor (I assume they are always in important meetings being told everything is fine).

Pay and bonuses. I said this a few years ago and it’s still the same – unless you are one of the lucky few forget about being handed a cheque with a long number on it. Those days are well and truly over. Sure, some lucky senior people will get a big reward but most of us are just well paid grunts. Speaking of which the pay is good (not amazing), however when you work it out per hour it’s honestly not above and beyond any other place. My contract states my working hours are 9-5. Every day I work 08:30 – 17:30, which is alright (it used to be a lot worse 3 years ago!). I don’t get rewarded for all those extra hours though so it makes my bonus almost insulting each year. Every year people go into “the room” expecting to be told you’ve just got a big fat pay check and every year you get told “here is your 2% pay rise and £1,000 bonus”. Grateful for it but believe the media hype of millionaire lifestyles.

Annual reviews. Seriously – there isn’t any point if I’m honest. There isn’t a structured career path for most to take. It’s like most jobs – take your seat, work hard based on your role, think outside the box by making stuff better and learn some things along the way. There isn’t anything I’m aware of where they have a structured career path, despite HR making out there is such a thing. My manager is woeful at best; it’s like taking career advice from a fast food manager with politics thrown into the mix.

Leadership. Same as everywhere else I’ve been. Lots of managers but not natural leaders. A lot of managers are not real leaders, despite what they view themselves as; happy to delegate and be the chief getting paid the most but somehow avoid listening to concerns, helping nurture talent, provide knowledge to those below, working with other teams. Usually a case of “I’m in charge do what I say” rather than “I have something to teach”.

Pigeon Holed. People feel like they are stuck in certain roles and are not given the chance to move. For example those in middle office have a huge barrier to those working in front office. A complete “us and them” attitude – both don’t know what is really involved by either side. The front office see everyone else as a cost and waste of time; the middle office see sales and trading as people making constant mistakes and not appreciating what we do for them (nothing would go through unless other teams are there supporting the money makers).

You made it! Now you can read about that dreaded one star rating that makes you question if the whole company is rotten to the core (it’s not; it’s down to who you end up working with, promise). :)"

Nobody is being treated the same.  See concerns about HR.,"The Bad ~  The Barclaycard US IT department is being forced into the Global Support model.  The Global model has more holes then a screen door.   Conform to Global standards and embrace the suck!  How does and IT organization ever progress when the foundational Leadership Team changes almost monthly?  Answer it doesn't.  Be prepared to change direction more then a Uber Driver if you work in IT.  

The Ugly~ Lots to list here but will stick to the main pain points.  If you identify as a Transgender you have a free pass to sit at your desk and do nothing all day,  play video games, watch TV, you will never get fired.  This might be a pro to some but it's a major distractor and demotivator  to those who come to work to work.  

There are almost to the point of suffocation a zillion different culture and diversity events.   Be prepared to shake your head at how this organization focuses so much time and energy on this while critical functions are neglected.   Be prepared to feel left completely out if you a white middle class American.   Speaking of which I actually heard a management level person say we don't want grumpy old white people here.  What a disgrace!   Why didn't I report this to HR?

The local Wilmington HR team is worthless!!!! Again worthless!  They protect people who don't do their jobs and scold line managers who are trying to weed out the paycheck stealers.  Follow the guidelines they say?  Since when is sleeping, watching sporting events at ones desk acceptable behavior during work.  Are you effn kidding me?  

The local HR team does their best work across the street at the local watering hole.  Absolutely the worst HR / Recruting teams I have ever felt with."

- Paid little vs. other banks and even other sectors, but constantly told by HR salaries benchmark well. So often feel underpaid and not recognised.

My notice period was 3 months. However, I had asked for an early relieving of 1 month after resignation date. My manager agreed to reduce notice period by 1 month only and HR issued a letter to me that my contractual end date and last working day would be 2 months after my resignation date.  since I did not have much responsibilities at work, I approached the MD for early reliving. He agreed to cut my notice period to 1 month after resignation date. In accordance with this, HR issued another letter to me stating my last day of working and last day of employment both to be 1 month after resignation date. I served till this date, completed all exit formalities and left. Now, HR has sent me FNF in which they are asking me to pay 2 months notice pay , have withheld my final salary and not giving releiving letter after repeated reminders.. this is how I'm being harassed further even after leaving the employment .

8850,,gender gap,2017-05-15,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"Great NY headquarters location.
Internal transfer are possible.","The risk management of the firm has shifted and is now set up in a very conflictual mode where members of the risk organization are encouraged to be aggressive and to use tough language towards their counterparts. Whether that comes from top managers is unclear but it appears to be related to the addition of personal in managing roles with prior-experiences from other banks. There is a clear gap between the official company  culture and the day to day working environment that does not promote collaboration.

Being a woman inside Barclays in NY is very difficult. My new manager explained to me on his first day that I would certainly have kids soon and that in anticipation I should adjust my schedule. Most of the new hires are men and were engaged with less experience at a higher pay rate and with a higher ranking. I first thought I was misinterpreting events but my opinion in a masculine-only environment started to be frequently overlooked. I even reached out to receive some mentoring from successful women in the firm but that did not help. Some of them aknowledged that they were not really happy with their responsabilities and pay. I also learned that other women had experienced similar situations.  The situation was much different in the UK where the salary gap between me and my male colleagues appeared much less asymmetrical and my opinions were equally valued.
   
I also experienced akward situations related to diversity for instance a colleague and I were singled out as assets not for our contribution but for our ethnicity. While several other awkward situations occurred I think this may be an isolated problem specific to our department. It raises the question of the oversight from HR and/or top management on yet another theme that impacts the working environment."

- Office location: near subway station with a good choice of lunch venues
- Office facilities: foosballs, table tennis, bean bags, free beverages, decently sized kitchens 
- Decent salaries, but not above market as before - attrition would be less otherwise
- Friendly and knowledgeable colleagues (in general), not a toxic environment (at least locally)
- Relaxed dress code for a bank - smart casual
- Paid overtime and on calls (or time off in-lieu)
- Work/life balance is generally very good but depends on team/project. Usually not a problem to work from home or leave for an hour or so if you must be somewhere (e.g. home parcel delivery, visit authorities/bank/dentist) - with some notice ahead of time (common sense, not 5 days in advance or the minute you already leave)
- A lot depends on the project/team: codebase, clients (understanding or very demanding/picky), team leads in other locations, etc. Could be a relatively smooth ride with little stress except a few days a year during major releases OR could be hell with constant stress, late nights due to messy systems and management who chronically overcommit and underdeliver.","- Processes and bureaucracy - e.g. it takes several weeks to become productive - have a working PC with access rights and software. And this is just one example
- Interaction with other teams (e.g. DBA, IT support, app servers support, other dev teams) - often need to send several chaser emails, otherwise you get ignored. This got progressively worse with time, but you might get lucky and get more responsive people.
- Quarterly mandatory trainings that are 90% irrelevant to IT people, are a waste of everyone's time and are mostly there so that the firm would fulfill the terms of yet another plea agreement with DOJ (or whoever it settled with this time).
- No budget for any real training opportunities - technical or business, besides the basics, but you can get Pluralsight subscription, which is better than nothing.
- Outsourced support to India and Mexico with staff of dubious quality (technical and/or language) and high turnover. Many support people don't know the systems and often don't want to learn. As a result developers on level 2 duty get swamped with issues that should be dealt with by level 1 people. This eats into your deliverables for the sprint.
- Change management - God forbid you must coordinate/deploy changes into production or UAT (yes, testing) environments regularly - the effort to document and push it through could easily exceed the actual change you did many times over. Only to do it 2 more times because team 3 out of 5 didn't approve your change in the system in time because you didn't chase them enough. If you are pure developer and only push code to version control then you're fine and spared of this.
- Tooling - collaboration tools are a mess, ancient IRC-like clone for chat, disparate (and often broken) systems for online meetings and videocalls. 
- Feeling like working in silos, little visibility of other teams and your own contribution, but this is supposedly getting better
- Limited career progression once you reach AVP - it is a ""catch all"" position where you can find people with anywhere between 3 and 13 years relevant experience.
- No budget for business travel or technical conferences. You can work with teammates daily for years without ever meeting them in person.
- Unless you're promoted, you get about inflation level pay rise for very good performance, otherwise below that, if any.
- Bonuses vary, but rarely exceed one monthly salary, often below that, if any, also they're paid in April for the previous year so they keep you on the hook longer should you decide to abandon ship"

Work hard and network well and you will have a lot of opportunities available to you.
""The Bank"" is very social, a good work hard play hard culture, but don't expect this from backoffice teams dotted around the country outside of London.
1CP is a great office, if you can, base yourself there. It's much more involved. 
The bank is well structured and well led. 
From my experiences management really stand up for their team and take care of their own. If you work hard and do well they will help to open doors for you.","Being based outside of 1CP can sometimes hinder your ability to progress.
I don't think the Bank pay that well compared to other company's in financial services. 
Don't believe the media hype, the bonuses are not as big as you think they are.
The Bank is highly regulated, there is red tape and slow progression of change, but it's for the right reason. 
Work life balance varies around the group. Some areas encourage you to go the gym for 2 hours in the day and then discourage you from leaving before 7pm. Whereas in other areas WFH is a regular occurance and managers will leave 5pm on the dot. 
Sadly, I was sexual harassed during my time. I don't think this represents the Bank (but more the individual) and the Bank handled my case well and the process was very clear. But I don't think he received an adequate level of punishment."

MDs will leave around 5PM-6PM and there isn't an expectation for face time.","Major HR and talent retention issues. Every week, an announcement about a top-level resigning is sent out. Whenever there's an issue, management's solution to fire someone at the top and hire a new and shiny band-aid with a large paycheck to solve said issue. However, what you have in the end is a loss of infrastructure knowledge. There are so many new people that no one knows how any of the legacy systems work, why they were installed, and they keep trying to re-invent the wheel. Company spends a lot of time and money hiring new people and expensive consultants, who at the end of the day are unfamiliar with why the problem exists. Barclays is still stuck in the old days of banking and they have not realized the value of technological innovation or cheap analyst labor. It's a very small company, but people are very unproductive and morale is very, very low. No one is committed to the company or takes pride in the company brand (at least in NY).

I can't overstate how much of a disaster it is. There's barely any talent left - the current employees are either on visas so cannot leave, or are too stupid or lazy to find another position externally. Promotions are absolutely impossible to come by, hiring is frozen across high cost centers, and requests to replace staff who quit have to be vetted by the CEO's team. There's so much bureaucracy it's impossible to get any real work done - rebooting a development server takes around 4 hours and 3 phone calls.

The job is on the face of it a really good role investigating PBA complaints using inhouse systems. What makes it an impossible atmosphere to work in is the quality control team that check  case handlers work, nothing is black or white only grey area's with everyone in the QC team having a different interpretation of the same thing meaning when marking a handlers case you are normally always wrong with something. The stress caused by it is the problem, if handlers just worked cases had them checked and then completed without the traffic light system of having to get certain green feedbacks or you enter the supervised environment then if you fail to make the grade you are out and this way of carrying on is ongoing the whole time, making for a very stressful job which caused me some discomfort. If the  QC department process was totally reinvented then decent hard working people would stay or not get sacked, too many people passing through and I think it is unique to this department as the rest of Barclays is brilliant."

There is also virtually zero communication from upper management. Even though we are constantly told Prague is a key location for Barclays, it certainly doesn't feel that way. What is even more sad is that with no promotions over the last year we now have 3 open positions for more senior roles which could easily be filled from within, some of my colleagues have been with the company for 4 years. 

Also the raise & compensation this year was ridiculous.

Concurrently in those 5 years, demotivation, toxicity, and general wariness about the fate of the bank were pervasive world-wide.

This should situate the company well while some its rivals have waited until now to go through the painful process of shedding non-core businesses and letting good people go","The amount of turnover among senior managers over the past four years has made it confusing for staff.     Not only is there uncertainty about the direction of the firm, but often, it was hard to figure out who your business line reported up to.    Also, too many silly and wasteful directives from senior management which have almost nothing to do with the actual business at hand, but seem to justify the company's fees paid to consulting companies"

This company is also extremely process and ticket based to a fault. Many times you need to submit a ticket to submit a ticket only to have it rejected for no reason at all. It took me over a year to get an email address set up (yes an email address) and by the time I did it was on the wrong domain. I was then instructed to just deal with it because it was less work to deal with it than to get it fixed. This company lays people off frequently. I have been laid off 3 times already, my manager is on his 4th position in the company, and the fear of being laid off causes people to silo information out of fear of losing their jobs. The company is based off of reactionary decisions because employees aren't around long enough to see their projects through and many of these projects are aimed at innovating the company. I have worked at other financial companies and some are direct competitors to Barclays and I am shocked that Barclays is even still in business. Their practices and management structure have put them seriously behind the competition. At this point Barclays is surviving on its name brand alone and even in that case the Barclays name is being tarnished by bad management and executive decisions."

9992,,A real grind meant for short term employment,2016-04-01,3.0,Credit Analyst,"1) Open 24 hours so you can choose to work overnight, normal hours, or swing shift
2) You have the opportunity to earn significantly more through bonuses and overtime
3) Your duties are straightforward so no real surprises each day
4) Decent benefits/retirement
5) Decent pay for the work you do
6) They try to cultivate a cool vibe by doing stuff like doing community service and playing games during shifts.","1) A lot of emphasis on productivity.  Your job is to look at applications and determine if a person is credit worthy and how much they should be lent.  You also take phone calls from customers needing a credit limit increase or a reconsideration on their denied application.  You have to process a certain number of apps/calls each hour and it can be a real grind keeping up with the standards.

2) The hours suck.  You'll most likely have to work 4 days a week for 10 hours.  The extra day off is cool but the 10 hour shifts suck.

3) There's little room for growth.  If you stick around for a while you may get job as a quality review person whose job is to make sure analysts make good lending decisions.  You may also get a manager title but there are few of those jobs available.

4) Short lunches/breaks.  You get two 15 minute breaks and a 30 minute lunch.  I'd rather have an hour lunch and no breaks but maybe that's just me.

5) It's a real grind.  The number of apps/calls you have to work is no joke.  It's a little better if you work night shift as there's less calls which usually take longer to work than apps.  You most likely won't hit productivity standards your first few months there.  Luckily you have a 3 month grace period to get things together."

You have to work for the consultants, work for them while they are gone for long lunches or left for the day or working from on Fridays / Mondays. They will take all the credits and you will look like a full. You might think to talk to your manager or his/her manager but it won’t help as I did many times. There were 6 employees in my team and then 5 left in 4 months due to this consulting firm and then I end up leaving too. I have seen 12+ people left in 6 months (including contractors) and Barclays absolutely did nothing to improve the work environment but hiring more consultants from this firm :)

And yes don’t forget long hours, weekend work and lot of politics.

Management seems very old school with rank trumping technical ability, and technical ability not being considered important in most cases. 

I would find it difficult to recommend Barclays as an employer to anyone who is technically minded, as other companies in the area are far more innovative and supportive, therefore technical roles are filled by those who are drawn to big business rather than techincal innovation.

That is a personal experience in one team but on the whole I have greater issues with the way Barclays is run. They had a vision built on values and then a new chairman came in an it was all change. Everything that had been done for the last 3 years to change the bank into a socially responsible bank had to be undone. It just feels like change for the sake of change. Share price isn't going up so lets make a bunch of people redundant and see if that works. As for the values... they are printed on every wall but you only have to stand outside the lift bank at 1CP one morning at 8.45 to see that staff don't live the values.

Some areas of the bank are really at the forefront of innovation.  If you are lucky enough to work in one of these areas, you can have a very fulfilling career.","Too much change - the bank as a whole never appears to be in a steady state.  Strategy, goal, direction and people constantly seem to be changing.  This creates a constant state of fear amongst some colleagues.

Compensation could be better and the policy could be more transparent.  Difficult to determine the link between workplace performance and compensation."

Indeed the quality of MDs is so poor that other parts of Barclays joke that ""he must have come from Wealth"" whenever they come across a poor leader . And more often than not, they are right. Past senior leaders have done untold damage to the franchise. Thankfully they have left, but the present management is incapable of repairing the franchise. Needs to grow fast, or shut down.

- Very poor decision making by the decision committees. Decisions are not based on commercial gains but a host of ego centric factors.

These poor decisions are then handed down to the employees for execution who get blamed in the end when the project inevitably ends in failure

3. Good opportunity to learn and grow if you have right people with you.
4. You get the flexible hours of working. I could work from home without any issues and my managers supported it. 
5. Company culture was good for learning and helped me a lot in learning new stuff.
6. Despite of not having a local manager in Singapore for 4 years, I never felt neglected and was well rewarded and taken care of my hard work by my managers in UK. (Previously, my local managers were horrible).
7. Company gives amazing redundancy package and is very generous in giving compensation. They are one of the best and will take care of you financially if your position is being made redundant. 
8. If your position would be made redundant, you could apply for positions in other departments (if available) or other low cost locations if you are willing to locate. 
9. If you are happy to relocate to low cost locations, you could apply to a higher position and get a promotion (provided you are in company for a while).
10. Per Singapore standards, they had ample leave plans (annual leaves, hospitalization, maternity and sabbatical).
11. Healthcare insurance plan was one of the best (includes dental and family).
12. Despite of your experience, if
- you are working hard and your manager recognizes it and fights for you.
Or 
- you have charmed right people enough (despite of not working much), you have better chances of promotion.
You will get promoted. People don't judge you from your experience, they evaluate based on your calibre and strength.","1. Due to flat hierarchy in designations, it was frustrating to move to next position. When their IT base in Singapore was huge, it was too much competition and less promotions. However, it became better post 2011/2012 once their IT strength was reduced. 
2. When they had Offshore development centre (ODC) concept in Singapore, they had horrible procedures, bureaucracy and horrible leadership.

4.

5. Promotion process is extremely horrible. You would be interviewed for the position by Senior Managers, someone who has never heard of you might have a say in your promotion depending upon how well you were in interview, it doesn't matter how well you performed in last few years. Even your line manager can't help you sometimes. However, if you have managed to influence people well, you would get promoted easily - you don't have to work hard then. Recently they announced that you could only get promotion only if they have positions otherwise you can't move ahead which is even worse.

Also too much focus on ""your individual brand"" / having the right profile instead of actual merit for being strong team leaders or for actual achievements."
10693,,Barclays,2015-08-09,1.0,Analyst,"Flexible working hours, the company goes out of its way to help local communities.","Every employee who joins the company has to wait a minimum of 2-3 weeks before they get their systems access (sometimes more) so be prepared to sit around for a while when you start.

Worst HR function of any company - nearly every colleague will experience missed or incorrect pay at least once in their time here.

The true culture of this company is all about gains in the short term at the expense of long term losses be that by making staff redundant unnecessarily or paying for cheap systems that don't do the job they're supposed to do. This is why Barclays is struggling and will only struggle further in the future, expect this company to go under in about 5 years time.

Be prepared to learn at least 3 to 5 different acronyms relating to the company's hollow values which change every year and can never be realised due to the aforementioned issues.

The company has gone from one extreme of being a cut-throat organisation that was all about numbers to the other extreme of a company that now pretends to be a humanitarian aid charity (its still all about the numbers) - no basis in reality and why it will continue to fail. Absolutely no commitment to any kind of coherent business strategy, in some areas of the business the name of the department you work for and your job title will change at least once a year if not more. The internal organisation of the company is an inefficient constantly fluctuating mess.

For any job you do at Barclays be prepared to earn at least £5000-£10,000 more in Lloyds, Nationwide or even in a smaller company for the same role, Barclays prefers to hire cheap. Intelligent staff don't last long and move into more reputable companies that pay their employees better, idiots stay behind and learn to hone the key skill of BS which is the only real way of getting far here.

The company expects to own you for a really low wage compared to others, if you get paid more than £32,000 be prepared to lose evenings, weekends, sleep and your partner. If you get paid anything below this you will should have a good work life balance.

Being actually good at your job will only ensure that your managers keep you in your position for as long as possible which is why Barclays prefer to hire external management candidates over experienced and competent frontline staff.

Only about 15-20% of the employees in this company are fit for their roles, the rest are incompetent; there are many Project Managers with no qualifications or previous experience, Analysts with no skills in Excel and don't understand the nature of their roles and Managers who don't understand the departments they're managing and delegate every aspect of their work to frontline staff. The company is rife with parasitism.

Generally the company is less racist compared to others, any racism is only ever localised as there are a lot of individuals from ethnic minorities evenly spread throughout the business however they tend to only hire Muslim women who dress, how shall we say, 'liberally' - there aren't many headscarves about. Sexism is rampant, there are a lot of older women in senior positions but male managers will routinely act inappropriately towards younger female members of staff.

The management staff generally fall into two general categories; the first are poorly qualified individuals who have been there since before the 2008 financial crisis, have slowly risen the ranks by default and hence owe everything they have to the business, aren't likely to leave unless they get pushed out and are generally brainwashed drones of the cult of Barclays, there is a strange cultish mentality around corporate grades and how people are treated based on them. The second kind are also poorly qualified individuals who have come in from the cold and hired directly into management positions, they have no real experience except for a couple year long management positions in other companies, are good liars and have to parasitically leech off competent staff beneath them - the latter tend not to last very long and usually jump into a management position in another company after a year or so (repeating the same lies).

Due to the abysmal hiring processes in the bank the wrong people are hired time and time again. Hiring is a continuous process with staff constantly leaving for better jobs or being made redundant and then the business having to be re-hire their positions again after realising their roles were vital.

Internal mobility does happen but it is very slow due to the fact that the company does not put any real investment training its current staff. The company would rather hire a stranger from outside who has the role qualification they need over investing in someone trusted who possesses everything needed in a good employee sans the required qualification for a higher job. Be prepared to hear a lot of BS regarding personal development.

Only consider this company if there is absolutely nothing else available in your area."

The problem is they have a lot of managers that have been there for 10 or more years and they are too expensive to remove so they employ a revolving door of employees beneath them. They don't care about you as long as they can keep their head count allowances. It's a running joke as to how long each new hire will last. The promotion structure makes no sense and if you get stuck working for a bad line manager who hates you, you might as well start looking for a new job because they will find a way to get rid of you. If you want to move internally bc you don't like your current role, be warned, you must put at least one year in and be in good standing, and it can take months for that transfer to happen. You are better off just going to work somewhere else. Oh and that whole work life balance is nonsense, you will intentionally be given assignments that make it impossible to get out the door at a reasonable hour. If you complain you will not be seen a  ""team player"" which will affect your crappy bonus and can cause you to get a negative review. They have a work from home policy but your manager can say ""no"" at anytime and not let you work from home, don't think that you are entitled to any of those ""wonderful"" perks that they offer.

Minus the sick leave with pay, we only have to work about 215 days a year. Absolutely no disturbance on weekends and weekday lunches are a good 1 hour affair with enough other breaks through the day.

After selling the retail business, all staff is retained in DIFC and we have enough people so that no one person is fully loaded, which is helpful because there are 10 hands for even a single task, however, unhelpful because there is an awful lot of (dirty) politics, incompetent and ill-attitude people (especially in the indirect functions), lots of internal spying and suspicion and generally worthless communication and relations management. It’s a bad environment, but fab salaries and no work stresses, hence, people are fighting tooth, nail and dagger to keep their jobs and have fun.","I agree to most of what is has been already said in the posts below. Indirect (questionable) roles with fancy designations are paid about +85,000/- GBP in annual salary.

11004,,It's all a bit...'meh',2015-04-07,3.0,Assistant Vice President,"Okay...first things first - this will now be the 4th bank I have worked for over the years and I've been at Barclays for almost a year. I'll save you some trouble - apart from Goldman Sachs they are all more or less the same. 

Barclays will look good on your CV

Most folks are nice enough to work with (despite being busy all the time) - they're just human. Most won't shout at you or whatever; it's just everyone is so rushed and busy all the time.

Can be hit or miss as it's so large - get an average or above manager and you'll be alright

Pay seems on par with other banks but nothing incredible like the media portray (we can't all be millionaires; most are well paid grunts). haha

Pretty clear senior management considering they have a day job as well (sending out announcements, updating blogs and intranet sites and so on) - although you're obviously not going to know everything. Be realistic.

Good chance to learn on the job (you don't need to have 3 degrees in finance or anything stupid). Just sit, watch, learn and help - you'll soon get it.

Offices on the whole are decent. North Colonnade could do with some updating but it's alright - South Colonnade is very nice with airy open plan offices and lots of light. You get all the tech and equipment most people would need (multiple monitors, etc).","okay - let's get this out the way first - bonuses. Unless you're one of a lucky few, don't start thinking of mansions, fast cars and so on - it's media hype. Those days are gone for most. Numeration day is a total joke (almost insulting) so unless you're pulling in hundreds of millions for your boss (unlikely) don't think you're on the ticket to success when you get here. Learn lots, work hard and see what happens - but it's not Leonardo DiCaprio wolf of wall street ticket to success stuff. You missed the boat big time on that one.

Crazy working hours. Yes, you get paid well however when you work it out per hour it becomes very average. If you're contract says 9-5 don't honestly expect to work those. I work 8:30am til 6:30pm (middle office) - a lot of my team work longer and we aren't compensated like successful traders / sales people (most old school are long gone).

It's the same everywhere I've been, especially in banks - politics. It's a huge company and people are looking after themselves - it doesn't mean you're going to have a terrible time but managers are so busy looking up pandering to the needs of those above and playing politics with others that what chance to those at the bottom get? Real leadership inspires, nurtures, listens, etc - but most in leadership roles (big and small) are not natural leaders.

With the greatest respect to those in India; stop offshoring Barclays. Seriously, I know you can get 3 Indians or more for the price of 1 in the UK or US but it's about value and not price for what you get. Let's not confuse value and price. Half the company is based out in India by workers utterly confused and inexperienced, not able to think beyond their checklists printed for them. Empty promises, not delivering work, when it is delivered it's all wrong or fudged - ah, I can go on. Seriously, it's easier to get up and work with one person on the other side of the floor.

Some teams can be a bit 'old boys network' but they are rare. It could be much worse - most are normal.

The biggest issue at Barclays investment right now (early 2015) is that it is run by a chap that knows retail banking (CEO Anthony Jenkins). The investment bank is a mere child compared to what it was a few years ago and staff morale is low. It's low because people are heavily overworked due to ruthless job slashing yet the business keeps demanding more and more - there is no more juice to squeeze. I get the feeling the top guys want to turn the overall Barclays group into a retail bank and sell of the investment part eventually - so long as it's providing a good enough return then they'll keep hold. But seriously, the workforce are drained, exhausted and good people leave within just a year.

The bank has tens of thousands of staff. Even those extremely good at the bottom deserving promotion have odds heavily stacked against them because of the numbers game. It's very hard to get noticed when you have so many also wanting to be noticed and seen as 'special'. Don't expect quick promotions, like with most banks (a lot of good timing and luck involved) rather than natural talent and skill."

Its retail and commercial banking operations are doing okay.,"If you are contemplating a career at the investment banking division of Barclays, then you need to 
be aware of the following facts (The source of the facts can be googled easily):
	
	As of May, 2014, Barclays announced that it will cut 19,000 jobs by year 2016. (Source BBC News, Guardian)
	Of the 19,000 job cuts, 7,500 will be in its investment banking division. (Source Bloomberg, Yahoo Finance)
	Barclays was fined $450 million for its manipulation of the global benchmark interest rate 
	(the LIBOR scandal). (Source USA Today, CNBC)
	Barcalys is currently under investigation for its manipulation of the global foreign exchange
	market. (Source Bloomberg, Guardian)

The crucial issue, however, is that the return on equity at its investment banking division is a 
meagre 2.7% (Source Bloomberg, Barclays Annual Report), far below the bank's target of 12% and its 
other divisions. 

When the return of equity of its peer bank Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS) reached such a low level, RBS decided to phase out its investment banking business over the next four years."

Incompetent management - they don't get people to join them to easily. Their market reputation is itself very shaky (well they are themselves to be blamed for it). So the easiest way out for them is to start giving higher roles to people not worth their years of experience to handle such roles. Result is projects having no sight of roadmap ahead. Neither where the project is stuck. They even don't consider IB background for taking people, result is people coming from service based firms and hence the slogging culture which is fast catching up in the firm.

The use of contractual  human resource management professionals who do not participate in the personnel actions implemented by these low level and mid level managers returning to a work in a legalistic environment that they have been working outside of for a number of years as expatriots lends itself to highly problematic applications of employee/management relations initiatives without proper oversight or standardized (i.e., equitable) policy implementation.  Therefore, there is a culture of favoritism and unfair treatment and discrimination that shows a lack of leadesip, or at least a lack of leadership values in areas that should not have this type of a void.

The result of that has been 6 years of purges and downsizes and business realignments.

Even when ones just gone in, is this not bullying in the work place?. Management has a habit of picking on selected certain staff also. When it comes to emergency childcare management tells staff ""get your finances in order so that you can afford a proper child career or get a bigger mortgage from Barclays to help you. Others get away with more than simple wrong doings and attitudes. When a complaint is made about this the management hide their favourites by making statements similar to ""each person is dealt with on individual circumstances"", ""confidentiality"" or ""they will be spoken to"". They still continue to do the wrongs. Management get transfers as ""They find it too busy a branch from my old one....I can't take this."" Other staff can't get transfers as ""there's too much going on"" as being the answer. Well if they find things ""too much going on"" then they are not worthy of being managers. Managers stick up for each other even when they are wrong. When challenged to many things the reply is ""It's down to managers discretion"", this even applies to getting time off for child sickness and doctors appointments etc.. Even cash differance are taken likely when made by certain staff and management come down hard on others who don't even make often or great value errors- favouritism. This is then paraded between themselves as an example setter...just to get marks and say ""I have done my jobs"" but they have done more wrong by NOT doing their job where it counts, both to company and colleagues. Customers are persuaded to take insurance and package account even when it is obviously not suitable for them. Management encourage this for the income for the branch.

Management in certain areas tends to not appreciate their people and fail to give credit where credit is due.

Many of the original Barclays Capital leaders have been exited from the organization and are being replaced with Retail Bank personnel.  Morale is at an all time low given the number and frequency of redundancies.  It's a challenging work environment when you're constantly looking over your shoulder and wondering if this is the round where you are exited.  Due to the challenging financial culture, management in technology seems to be focused more on hitting budget numbers than setting a strategy and leading their people.

There is a healthy work-life balance, shown in spades by the fact that even the MDs have started leaving at 3pm on a Friday afternoon now. If they don't care, the rest of us certainly shouldn't.

A BIG pro is that there is no downside to doing a bad job! No, really. None whatsoever. People are never fired from Barclays Wealth if they're not pulling their weight. They're tolerated for years on end until they get paid off with a fat redundancy cheque whilst those of us STUPID enough to hang around and do some work get paid a bonus which is less that these lazy people got paid on a tax-free basis for being laid off.","The best reasons would be to witness - first hand - what a chicken does after the head has been cut off. Of course, not all chickens are born into this world equal. Barclays Management chickens, however, are given bottomless pits of money to buy in expensive management consultants who will go out and interview the staff and then repackage their own employee's advice as their own. And then set a new ""Strategy"". Yay! New strategy! 

Expect that - and this is the brilliant bit - none of the Senior Leaders want to taste their own cooking. We have lost three very senior people in the space of a month. The Financial Times noted this, as did everyone else. Every couple of weeks, we get another banal email from the ""Leadership"" team about the latest changes to team structure, reporting lines, brand of tea.....

My simply advice would be - STOP WITH THE COMMS AND START DELIVERING SOME ACTUAL STRATEGY.

This is a uniquely ""Wealth"" Problem. No other part of Barclays is this sick, unmotivated or leaderless. Staff are leaving in droves. People are bored stupid. There's no career progression within Wealth, and why would you want to stay anyway? They haven't a clue what they want the business to be, look or smell like in a year. It's dull. Really, really dull."

Work life balance is decent.","The employees who actually do know what they are doing at the firm are not promoted, paid or recognized for their hard work.  In fact there is no recognition for hard work or going above and beyond for any of the employees in infrastructure.  Compensation is poor.  Morale is the lowest it has ever been.

Good work-life/vacation time.,The lives of the majority of the employees were encumbered by an expensive and time-consuming rebranding and reengineering of the firm's culture that had suffered because of the missteps of a small number of key employees.

CEO has also made a good start with re-emphasising core professional values at every level.","Staff who want to help don't know how, leaving a few people carrying a lot of the load.  Better investment in resources (salary, training and career development) is needed.

While I was there, just about every person I knew who worked as a Fraud Analyst repeatedly had their vacation requests or leave requests denied. Even if you have vacation time and request to use it months in advance, it was almost always denied for at least part of it. One time, I requested off for my aunt's funeral and tried to use a vacation day for it. My request was denied, so I spoke to a manager about it. He became extremely rude and asked if it was really necessary for me to go, and suggested that I take only a half day. I told him the funeral was an hour away from the office in my hometown and he said something like ""Well it must end at noon, right? You can drive straight here and be here around 1"". Not once did he offer even a fake expression of sympathy or condolences. He made it very clear that he found it stupid that I wanted to stay at the luncheon afterward that  my parent's were hosting. Apparently only an idiot would want to help their mother out after she just lost her sister. 

This was a terrible place to work and I got out as soon as I could. I started there with a new hire class of 10 employees. When I quit 8 months later, only 3 of the original 10 were left. Some people became so upset with how they were treated that they literally would unplug their phones and walk out of the office to quit right away with zero notice. I was able to stick it out until I got a new job, but barely. 

They try to make this job sound better than it is, but the reality is you will be answering phone calls nonstop from the second you walk in each day until you leave."

Huge distrust between Management and middle ranks

The ""culture change"" programme has been a flop - C suite think by ""sheep dipping"" 100,000 employees through a 2 hour culture session it will change the company's culture!!!

Executive management does not appear to have a pulse on all the negative sentiment that exists internally. Not a fun place to work. Direct mgmt seemingly doesn't care about it's staff. It's not a growing company, it's a shrinking one.  No raises for years. Seemingly impossible to get an interview internally without knowing someone. HR is the worst.

The internal feuds between different business silos is depressing, though probably not worse than anywhere else.  Currently seems to have zero long term vision"
11483,,Do NOT join this firm!,2014-06-23,1.0,Assistant Vice President,A few... such as a good health plan and decent training opportunities.,"The list is endless... but I'll give you some of the highlights:

1. Lots of politics, ZERO meritocracy... Earlier these problems only percolated into performance ratings and bonuses, but now with the redundancies, it decides who gets laid off and who doesn't. Lots of fantastic people are being laid off and lots of useless folks are being kept on board purely because of political reasons. Everyday, this company's total employee calibre (if there were such a thing) drops to new lows :)

2. No management foresight: The decisions taken by management are very short sighted. This includes HR policies, decisions to enter/exit businesses and geographies, and even corporate real estate policies. There are numerous examples: i) spending millions of dollars to build a new system and then as soon as it is ready, realizing that it is useless and reverting to the old system. ii) Firing somebody and giving them a redundancy payment and then calling the person the very next week to offer them a job back! iii) Moving to a new office due to lack of space and then within months, firing half the people in the office iv) Setting up back office operations in a particular country over 2 years and then closing down that centre within a year... the list is endless... the management seriously have no clue what they are doing. Completely useless!

3. Questionable hiring practices... You just need to look at the mix of people in some teams to realize that there is something wrong. Forget about managers hiring employees from the same country. In Barclays Singapore, you see a focus on hiring people from the same state or province! A manager from Maharashtra (a state in India) would have a team filled with employees from Maharashtra, for example. It's weird that the HR does not notice or do something about this.

4. Policies that punish employee loyalty: It is much easier for a manager to hire a new VP from outside than to promote a current Barclays employee in his own team even if the Barclays employee has far more experience and is far more capable for the role. I know a case where a manager advised his own team member to quit the job and reapply to Barclays to get a better position!

5. No organizational stability: I know it is important for an organization to be nimble, but the way the org structure changes in Barclays is crazy... it's like an amoeba! One of my friends was technically moved across 4 different teams during the course of one year, all while doing the exact same job throughout (even his desk did not change!)

6. Increments and bonuses are pathetic. They will lure you with a decent starting base salary, but that's almost all you're ever gonna get :) 

I could go on... but you get the picture."

The worst part was the unimaginably complex and unworkable system of requesting anything, or putting any change into the system. This made attempting to do your job efficiently very frustrating.

Plenty of food & drink establishments close by.,I can sum this up using the advice given to all staff 'Going home to your wife & family at the end of the day is a wasted business opportunity'  In my time there I saw people being dragged back from holidays half way round the world for ad-hoc meetings that were a waste of everyones time.  I saw a clerical junior being couriered a mobile phone so they could keep asking him stupid questions about unjamming the printer etc. while he was in his hospital bed (then made him redundant a month after he returned so they could save money)  I had to work almost all bank holidays even though there was rarely any work to do.  I soon learned to take my holidays in places with no phones or mobile signal and tell people all my weekends were being spent at the other end of the country.   When I finally left it took me three months to stop jumping every time the phone rang.   But I am probably describing every big merchant bank in London.

Working in global operations, a regular day could begin at 7/7:30 AM and ended around 7 PM/8 PM - 11 PM or 12 PM some nights. Only stepped outside for 15 mins to grab lunch and ate at my desk. This was a typical day. 

2. Poorly managed organization - Management is narrow-minded, hypocritical, and narcissistic - apres Lehman days. Your mistakes will be magnified under a telescope and you will be constantly pushed to do more. 

3. Professionalism and social respect is obsolete. - Barclays is not an institution upholding integrity and respect. It does not encourage sharing knowledge and learning from each other. Management sets the standard and have the only prerogative to come in, get the job done, and leave. Senior leads and management buddy up and turn their heads in bias. Do not bother questioning if what you do is right or wrong, management will not listen. People actually had the audacity to yell at each other on the floor. This was appualing.

4. Technology is Legacy - Difficult to use and puts the bank at major potential risk. All at operational cost. Bank is stuck on old ways (technology) and so it seems to be that management is stuck on old perspectives as well. 

5. HR does nothing to your concern.

They always talk about ""long term strategy"", which they change every month.
One month you feel safe, the next month you realize you're already fired.
While attending interviews, the director/Manager will assure you of long term prospects and can give you 100 reasons why this role is important, but while firing they have 1000 reasons to give why this role is redundant. So never go by their assurances. Just join and keep your fingers crossed.

The projects are led by a competent technical team in the UK.,"The work environment here is not too good. Basically the entire management here is from Verizon. It is a pretty well known fact that Verizon has pretty bad reputation in the Dallas region as far as work culture goes. Its pretty much the same here. 

This place has way too many redundant managers who seem to have gotten here just because they were all friends with each other at Verizon. The main management for the projects is in the UK which does a good job of maintaining a process. The Plano center mainly develops the requirements passed down from the UK, it does not have projects of its own. The managers here have zero control over the timelines, deliverables, new features, etc.This also means that this place is at the mercy of a projects from the UK. This has resulted in many layoffs recently as a result of there being less work and budget cuts. They are now also outsourcing most of the work to TCS in India. This is not the best place to be for job security."

They hire people with terrible English. Some managers worship naive and cheap students at outsourcing locations. You can easily find at those places incompetent and quarrelsome people who don't have any basics of work ethics, responsibility, and essentially don’t understand what they are doing.
2.	If you are a professional software developer you better avoid this place, you have to be crazy to go work there. At some places people shoot emails late night and across weekends and try to meet fascist deadlines.
3.	It doesn't matter how good you are or whether you are right. Once you shown a mirror to your manager you will be always shown in a bad light. Objective difficulties to meet a deadline are not considered. It is always only your low performance is the root of all evils.
4.	If you work at outsourcing location you will be cut off from many things they do in London. You have to guess what they know or decided or already done. You better guess well otherwise you will be labeled incompetent and stupid. As soon as one knows something it is a weapon to present itself as a smart and competent. Don’t expect too much help from anyone.
5.	Have a good salary? Watch your back then! They will fire you first as soon as you finished all they wanted you to do, unless you are a one’s favorite."

The company will not change anytime soon...it will take at least 10 years to rebuild the company culture and make it a 'go-to-bank'."

They are being replaced by machine's and having to work harder each day.

Every manager will assign you tasks with toughest deadline possible and if timeline missed even by a day it will be escalated to higher managements.
* Senseless managers sitting in between only to disrupt you, had they not been there I guess everyone would become more productive.
* No one cares about no one here, very unfriendly people.
* Too much power given to manager and no one would ask you for their feedback.
* Transport department could not be worse, make you wait and wait for drops , cabs provided like tata winger etc, changes the drop location without even informing you
* Food is free but it tastes like feet."
11670,,Think twice,2014-02-20,2.0,Assistant Vice President,"Generous in trainings and paid leaves.
Values being promoted by the senior management are good","The ideas and values being promoted by the senior management (read: CEO, MD's) are great and even bordering on ideal, but what happens on the ground is far from it.  It's as if the head is disconnected from the neck!  For starters, there was this mess-up when dress-down Fridays was introduced.  People got mixed messages from the middle managers on which offices can wear jeans and which cannot dress down at all. Came to a point wherein the regional COO had to be called in to clear up the confusion. Talk about cra-zy!

Then there's that flexible, work-from-home benefit being promoted as well, but guess what?  People who wanted to do that in the SG office had to file for paperwork and get Director-level approval, and this process took practically a month. And this approved period is good only for 3 months, and can be revoked.  Most applicants don't even stand a chance, they get shot down immediately by their direct line managers.  Reason being given is that there is a different impression when people work from home, that the productivity is not that high and your appraisal gets hit if you do so. Yet interestingly, they do not account for are those late-night calls with London and New York offices and still expect people to be in at 10am despite being in meetings until midnight the previous night.

It does not end there...

There's this weird practice of firing people on redundancy in January, and then the bank gives the crappiest bonuses to those IT staff who are left behind.  The director delivering the bad news starts with this glum ""the-bank-didn't-do-so-well"" speech, then hands over the insulting numbers.  Think 2-3 DAYS worth for an annual bonus despite getting a ""Fully meets expectations"" rating in your appraisal.  And then give it a few days and the big bosses announce the company profits. Kind of insulting, especially since we have to pick up where those who got retrenched left off with no handovers whatsoever and still expect to deliver their work PLUS our work.  So yes, redundancy is the new promotion for those of us left in the trenches. 

So there, it may be better in other office locations, but the SG office, err, think twice."

2. Seemingly no collaboration between senior managers - often blatant hostility. As a result more junior team members have to force cooperation and results from other teams without senior management buy-in and often will be openly blocked.   
3. The culture at Barclays is driven by job retention, earnings, and fear of exposure among the senior executives, meaning that cronyism, patronage, and bias is rampant. 
4. Ability, impact, and quality of work is irrelevant. All that matters is how your management decides your face fits during the notorious consistency meetings.
5. If your face doesn't fit you can expect to be managed out (by lack of patronage, zero career development support, slashed bonus).
6. Bullying is pandemic and brutal - and can be shockingly open. Instances of whistleblowing being openly discouraged and warned against by senior managers. HR not trusted. 
7. Staff dissatisfaction and turnover is massive - everyone in my team, and many others who I worked closely with, were looking for jobs elsewhere all the time.  We celebrated those who succeeded.
8. Air of total depression among middle management (B5-B7).
9. Everyone acknowledges the total stagnation which has come about through the impenetrable defensiveness and politics within the business - so many good ideas and beneficial strategic decisions are blocked due to senior politics and personalities, along with constant 'playing with the numbers' to twist reports to meet the desired conclusion, even if factually untrue."

If you truly have a desire to rise to the top and are willing to make personnel sacrifices then you will be able to. Fairly good benefits. the new CEO seems very values driven and is ethical.","It is unstructured so many become disgruntled if they are used to a very precise and directive place. This is partly the culture. There is very high turnover, at least in NYC. I think this is due to the competition for top talent. You are only as good as your last months performance so you have to have an A game at all times. Like any place, it depends on who you are working for. I had a couple great managers who I reported to. A few others I would have been miserable. Competition on the street is fierce, layoffs always hang overhead but this is the same everywhere.

I had an engaged line manager and a very good, albeit tyrannical Head of Section. That may be a con too! The facilities in the office were good and the office culture was largely good, though somewhat regimented. It's not a bad place to cut your teeth if your face fits.","Senior managers are not as engaged as they might be, there was little appreciation for a job well done. Salary was awful for the industry and the level of responsibility. I observed racism in the office more than once, nothing of any note was done about it. Opportunities to move in the business and progress were poor. I was a bit ashamed to work for them at the time because they were involved in countless scandals.

11782,,Benefits are a lie,2013-10-23,1.0,Vice President,This review deals specifically with the benefits package in Singapore.  I will address the company itself in a separate review.,"The health insurance makes up nonsensical reasons not to pay out once it decides it doesn't want to pay out.  For example, refusing to pay for a medicine because they don't have the actual prescription as well as the receipt (not actually a requirement under the contract, and never required for any other prescription) or not paying for doctors visits if you ever change doctors because they can label the new doctor a ""second opinion"" which they refuse to pay for.  They don't pay for preventive care.  They don't pay for specialists.  They don't pay for prescriptions.  They don't pay for doctor visits even when you're sick with a serious illness (they don't even want to pay for the doctor who diagnosed and treated my wife's autoimmune disease.  They claim that's not really a disease!) 

The clinics that do take the insurance directly (instead of requiring cash payment upfront, and making you deal with the insurance company directly) are generally terrible quality and not worth visiting.  They have long lines, don't accept appointments, and you get very little time with the doctor for your trouble.  My family has received awful misdiagnoses, and had symptoms completely dismissed by these clinic doctors.  

If you take this job, consider it as not coming with health insurance.  Absolutely do not count on this insurance if any member of your family has any sort of chronic illness.  It will not pay out, and there is no way to change their minds."

2. Always give in to any kind of customer demand , whether justified or not. 
3. Promotes stretching and over-the-weekend work culture.
4. Things told in interviews are much better and prospective than actually given on the floor.
If they told you 10 things, you would be actually doing 2-3 things out of that only and sometimes not even those, but totally different . And justify by saying this has become more critical now , so you need to do this.
5. Separate team-divisions are not comfortable with each other and inter-team movements tough if team heads do not like each other. 
6. Deadend of career to people who are stuck up in low standard work and 'mirage' of IJP is shown.

IT is under resourced and does not deliver as a result.  Systems are outdated and creaking under the strain.  
Resource of the right level and knowledge is constrained and there has been an unwillingness to pay to get the right resource in permanently especially given the longer term location strategy, leading to a dependence on contractors who tend to leave within a couple of months.  This leads to a continual round of training with no benefit and leads to an additional strain on permanent staff.
There is a feeling that we are being made to pay for working in the investment bank, especially pay and bonus wise, which given that the culture is quite different in the rest of the bank (hours and benefit wise) seems unfair.
Location strategy makes people afraid for their jobs and often leads to inefficiencies and loss of learned knowledge and increased risk as processes are transferred.  Especially when there is a huge amount of change going on in the organisation."

Pay is very low in my area of corporate banking compared to the market...cases where people on graduate programme getting almost double what people with 20 yrs experience who train them get.
Bullying culture is allowed to thrive by a network of lifers determined to slow the progress of those around them in line with their whims and fancies. They have contacts everywhere (HR are not confidential) so you either have to make your mind up to go to tribunal or straight to the top, threatening publicity.

Stability of the industry is also some kind of advantage, nevertheless, all of the above highly depend on team you are in and the lead.","Being one of the largest bank in the world they will save money not only on you as a resource but also on software and hardware. It makes it really nasty to come each day to work with fact like this in mind.

They trying to be international company etc, however in reality this is not true. To get promoted in this environment - something unbelievable and unachievable. Depends on your boss, you will be even scared with the fact that he can even make an entrapment for you (which probably also happened in the past). The most surprising is some management members with incredibly poor communication skills. You will feel yourself like a slave.

The most wandering fact is that you will be hired for one job by one people, but in fact you will be working on something totally different and with totally different (sometimes really stupid) peoples. Wandering is also the HR people - they like working for some another company. Ignorance of you as human is quite common. Performance reviews is some game where you always loose. It is known in advance what evaluation you will have :). The company has very effective mechanism on controlling and not promoting people / giving bonuses. They can fail you on anything and make a reason for not to be promoted or recognized.

Very nasty environment to be on. Management will keep saying you lie like we will be the best in entire industry. Annoying is also the fact that there is no such thing as collaboration. It is pity to see some really nice people inside this company. Especially the international members who are getting pissed off usually.

If you coming from some tech industry - think three times before joining this company. Better - simply avoid. Specifics of the business makes it tough as it is very regulated business, in addition, stupidity of some people, miss-communication and even elements of racism makes this kind of job worthless, despite the brand (they trying to promote) and advantages.

The innovation happens rare due to very huge bureaucratic machine. To utilize something new, you have to wait for almost a year to get it working, still with restrictions. Usually people simply give-up of doing something new. Team spirit - is something unknown in the company.

Insulting is the fact they making interview process nice and pretending to be really good by paying good money to recruiters and attracting talent who are ""naive"" and not aware about inside life and a lot of legal restriction. By the way, interviews are really good - they will assess you from many different angles (probably out-sourced) - use them to get trained :). What these guys are afraid of is LIBOR scandal as they loosing/lost their reputation not only as a bank but also as employer. I would say quite unfair player of the market. This is typical game when legally everything is correct but the people are unhappy."

Barclays is the kind of place that the important thing is “deploy at any cost and if it is wrong someone will pick up down the line...”

You can not trust the managers and yes you will get mentally ill with stress and depression.
HR seems to be  with the Managers and playing the political game – all is political and disregards people as persons – dont forget you are not even a head count any more you are a “desk” and how much this desk costs to be around the world.

So forget about career, stability or planning for anything you can get sacked any time because your “desk cost” is cheaper elsewhere or one of the High Managers has family in a another country and decides that “this is the strategy now, lets move roles in that place”.

Barclays is the type of  environment for the following type of people:

If you are unemployed and need a Job asap;
If you are have no experience (apprenticeship);
If you are a contractor;
If you are a  “shark”  type of person and will do anything to get into the ladder (ANYTHING);
If you would like to experience in real life the show “The Apprentice” ;
If you are crazy or a masochist or would like to pay all your sins and go straight to heaven  ( just 5 years will do working in there)  or the combination of all then options.

The reality maybe not be different in other big corporations , however Barclays “takes the biscuit”."

- Good technology working groups, some managing directors are very switched on, especially in Equities.
- Reasonable meritocracy for full time hires - although not within cookie cutter graduate positions.","- Typical of banking, most people are motivated by money and not love of their job.
- Most graduates are on the same salary as new interns - even after having 1-2 years of experience.
- Many graduates get sub optimal placement when joining teams which don't reflect their interests adequately. They are allocated according to 'business need' - but if the wrong part of the business needs a graduate, it can negatively affect your career.
- Graduate scheme training is a waste of time and money for those not in front office. As a technology grad, give us actual technical training. A two day 'beginners Excel' course is not sufficient, particularly for the vast majority of technology grads hired from non-CS courses.
- Internal mobility is a joke. Anecdotally - most people quit and are rehired at a higher salary.
- Since the acquisition of Lehmen's - considerably increased management. When an intern I had 3 managers in between me and the CIO. As a graduate i had 7. What do these guys all do?

- Limited senior management knowledge. As a trader, I have to seek approvals from managers who are clueless about the product, market and risk being discussed. As it is easier to say ""no"", this leads to significant missed opportunities.
- No link between proposed culture and compensation. The ""RISES"" philosophy (Respect-Integrity-Service-Excellence-Stewardship) is a bit of a sideshow when it comes to rewarding performance, which is driven more by politics than by performance.
- Inefficient business set-up. Head-count often unduly high because risk is split across more desks/businesses than required, compared to other banks. Leads to (a) risk not being pooled together to be optimally managed, (b) more headcount with less responsibility and less potential for progression, as well as the wrong people being made redundant.

11991,,Chaotic and poorly managed,2013-03-13,1.0,Web Content Manager,"The salary/bonus was pretty good, although not exactly stand-out from companies outside the financial sector. 

My immediate colleagues in the team were a pleasure to work with.","Senior management are pretty much wholly disengaged from the staff who actually do the work, which leads to very poor choices when it comes to systems, processes and restructures. Few such developments had a positive impact on an individual or team basis, as they were imposed from above with little to know dialogue or engagement beforehand.

Communication was generally really bad. It tended to improve for a short while after this was highlighted, but then returned to what it was like before.

Key things such as external training in new skills, which were vaunted in the interview, failed to materialise (budget constraints were often cited, despite the bank making billions in profit each quarter). Instead, what was offered was the absolute bare minimum – largely focussed around 'internal training'. This boiled down to overworked staff being leaned on to share their skills with others. Hardly ideal.

Resourcing and hiring were very problematic – the demands being placed upon the team were increasing significantly, and group-wide headcount freezes meant that no new additional permanent staff could be hired. Instead, they ended up spending significantly more on short-term contractors to bridge the gap.

Even for a bank, the amount of bureaucracy and time involved to progress things was staggering. 

There was a general obsession with regard to which 'grade' you are – the extent of this is something I've only ever encountered at Barclays. These are, rather obliquely, B5, B6, B7 and SX (senior exec). You quickly get to know your place. 

Restructures within the wider business happened with surprising regularity – almost as if the senior execs need to justify their existence. Often, they had little very impact. We just shifted from being under one overarching division to another."
11992,,Used to be a great place to work,2013-03-12,3.0,Vice President,Until recently Barclays had mostly escaped the pitfalls of the sub-prime mortgage crisis and had kept a clean image making it a great place to work in terms of morale.  Pay was above average.,Lots of discombobulation after the Lehman takeover.  Management structure was all over the place (as to be expected after a takeover) and operating on a global platform never seemed to be within reach due to regional politics -- both before and well beyond the Lehman integration.

Access to high quality investment professionals across Wall Street.
Strong relationships with other service providers. 
A well known brand.
Strong analytic work from internal teams.
Competitive levels of pay for top performers.","The management of Barclays Wealth Americas is run primarily through a culture of fear.  Employees are discouraged from presenting issues or opportunities to improve the firm.  There is no formal process with which to do so.  Employees who informally attempt to raise issues are penalized or disciplined, and hurt their chances of future career growth.

Benefits are skewed towards the top producers, which reduces the amount of collaboration between employees.

Investment recommendations are most often made on the basis of what will earn the firm the highest amount of revenue.   Products are pushed on advisers weekly.  The advisers that sell the most commission-based products are rewarded and recognized more so than others.   Management has a broker-dealer focus that adds conflicts of interest to the Wealth Management platform from succeeding.

Finally, the technology in place is older and slower than that of its competitors, putting everyone at a disadvantage.  Time is often wasted having to correct or re-enter data into various systems, making it harder to stay on top of your day-to-day tasks and goals."

No top-down leadership in IT, very tribal and bottom-up organization, often leading to overlap on work, lots of duplication and no clear picture of where you fit. Broken processes that have been lost in multiple, incomplete restructures make getting most things done a real challenge.

4) No promotion . the role on which you have joined you will have to work on same role and no defined process to move to next level
5) Whatever a 2yr guy does in support even a 10 yr B4 will do same work and when rating is provided manager has lot of point to tell what you have done when a 2 yr guy is doing what u also are doing
6) no onsite. if u get a one/2 week onsite then it is a loss for you. as there is no per diem amount. whatever u spent at onsite they will provide the same amount once u provide the bill and same money u will get in 2 months.
7) any monetary claim amount is paid after a month or more(45 days around SLA time)
8) some manager who have joined 2-3 yr back does not want to switch job as they are getting paid very good salary and for them no work. just co-ordinate and bother the technical people

9) You can not escalate anything to HR as it looks like HR process is there just to recruit the people and have 2 days of induction

If you have a personality, I would advise you to stay away from certain BU's in Barclays. Also, too much competition between managers to be best. My manager would frequently talk smack about the other team manager yet be all nice to their face, and also tell them things that you have spoken to them about in confidence. At times it was laughable and was noted between the entire team as being wrong (even those people who were 'pets').

Discontinuation of Pension plan remove any reason to be ""loyal"" considering Barcap is not doing anything to differentiate it from it's peers as a ""special"" place to work
IT is becoming ""commoditized"".  Push to ""outsource"" IT work, even that with specialized finance knowledge and front office roles, to India under euphemism ""Location Strategy"". 
Crazy requirement of 1 month notice for AVP and below and THREE MONTHS for VPs and above. Company is VERY aggressive in enforcing this. 
Also, theoretically, this notice should go both ways, severance pay for those laid off incorporate this 3 month pay so in reality, company has its cake and can eat it too regarding holding you by the short hairs. 
Internal mobility highly touted, but is a joke. Unless you know somebody, you will not get a reassignment via ""official"" channels. In fact, hiring managers most often don't even respond to internal mobility requests. 
Most people have not had salary increase in 4 years and decreasing bonuses.

The business doesnt value the importance of quality when it comes to building reliable, well engineered software and neither does the IT management chain which is incentivized to always cut corners to get the next delivery on the desk as soon as possible. This comes at the cost of never repaying technical debt so the software is forever descending towards an unmaintainable mess which delays delivery which in turn angers the business which in turn causes smart developers to seek employment elsewhere as dismal bonuses are paid."

Very little opportunity for growth unless you move to London.  Management is on a cost cutting rampage and at our clients expense think it's a good idea to outsource our jobs to India, Lithuania, and Kiev.  Big mistake!

Next year you are extremely frustrated and don't deliver that fast. Some people jump, some wait hoping to get a package at the end of the quarter when layoffs happens. If you happen to stick for another year you will loose even more in your total comp. But there always be a story that it's not you, it's market situation that drives your comp down.
