Foreign exchange fixed income commodities equity USA global Asian stocks money market mortgage backed securities investment and research,Long hours of you really like what you are doing. Long commute from New York city. Inconvenience to go and come back
34,,NA,2021-08-12,4.0,Management Associate,Very bright people and rigorous work,Challenging culture and very team dependent
35,,Excellent place to learn and grow. You get out what you put in. Definitely not for everyone (or even most people).,2021-08-09,5.0,Product Manager,"Surrounded by brilliant people committed to delivering excellent work above all else. Incredibly high bar for quality and a ""whatever it takes"" attitude towards getting there. Once you are established there is a lot of opportunity to forge your own path. Entrepreneurial environment where you are expected to find the problems to be working on and go after those.","The other side of the delivering excellent work above all else equation is people work really really hard and there are periods in which it can be a grind. The culture is not for everyone, if you don't handle ambiguous expectations and directions well and don't have a self-starter disposition towards work you may get stuck."
36,,Some Good- but decent amount of bad,2021-08-05,3.0,Project Manager,"-You will learn a ton about yourself and develop like crazy (if you can find your groove in the culture) 
- Generous comp (assuming you're in the right department) and great healthcare
- Lots of amazing and smart people","-comp isn't standardized and highly dependent on your department. There is no universal definition of ""impact"" to dollars, so people can be paid way more than you, but have much lower expectations. 
- culture is deteriorating (and there are times that it seems like management is okay with it). It is their right to change the culture, but they should be explicit about it (both internally and to candidates)
- Lots of ""power"" politics at play within senior ranks (people always angling for power/influence). If you're a junior person and your management is on the wrong side of ""power"", it could hurt your career and internal mobility prospects
- The organization is always changing. Every time a new senior manager comes into a role, they almost always completely redesign the team. This is sometimes needed and other times just ""another way to skin a cat"" or managers thinking that nothing is good, unless they created it. This causes a decent amount of volatility for more junior people. Then, oftentimes when managers ""fail"", which happens frequently-it just becomes like an ""oops""/learning opportunity and there is no accountability or acknowledgement of the chaos/disruption they caused to the team. This chaos oftentimes means people leaving/losing their roles, transferring to other teams, etc..
- very few people can make decisions and every decision takes a long time. The majority of people are just teeing things up for decisions
- Level of transparency is decreasing, which sometimes causes distrust is how decisions are made (you can't sense check it for yourself)
- They talk a ton about D&I, but the firm is still very white and male. It seems harder for diverse employees to reach top roles (its kinda a ""guys"" club). Success in the culture requires a certain level of confidence and ability to debate- I think this advantages a certain type of background (that isn't oftentimes a diverse person)
- the commute (if NYC based) kills your work/life balance"
37,,Great company to work for,2021-07-25,4.0,Associate,"Great people (some of the smartest in the industry) and awesome benefits (full medical coverage, free food/transportation, 401k, etc)","Lack of structure/career path, you need to work extraordinarily long hours in order to get ahead"

Good place for end of your career","Too academic with decision making 
Unstructured in everything - decision making, comp, career trajectory 
Few people have actual impactful work. Rest is window dressing
Diversity is bad"
39,,A cult in denial,2021-07-11,1.0,Senior Manager,"Excellent pay, excellent benefits, some great people to know (if you can find them amid the cultists and mercenaries)","It is a cult pure and simple. Now that the founder is largely removed though I’m sure he will never let go, it is the worst of what he wanted and the worst of political human nature. With the founder there it was just his delusion that because he could make billions he must be brilliant and right about everything. He had the power to enforce it—-agree or you’re sorted (fired). Some of the most intelligent and academically excellent people in the world are there and it tells so much of human nature to see them all swear by a set of rules that are based on an amateur simpleminded narcissistic philosophy. Horrendous waste of money on useless things (counting how many negative dots people leave, how many issues they logged, etc). It’s all largely gone now—-proving the waste that it was, but in the name of ‘culture’ and ‘values’ political behavior is flourishing. It was bad before but at least had a chance for greatness. Now imagine working at a highly political place but imbrued with a Stalinistic atmosphere. Their current push in the press and on sites like this is to attempt to offset their souring reputation with clients, many of whom have second thoughts about risking their money in hedge funds, especially one with a toxic workplace atmosphere.
If I am wrong, ask them to release all the tapes of the founder yelling at people or some of the crazy principled based diagnoses. After all they are not just espousing truth and transparency but Radical Truth and Transparency. Note how all the positive reviews on this company on this site seem to use the same words and don’t really explain themselves. They tend to be short but extremely positive. Ironically if you presented an assertion about a colleague like that back in BW you would be probed to ‘get at truth’ and likely dotted for failing to perceive problems."

The hardest part is knowing how many people get fired and always being very uneasy about that. 

Your manager will determine if you have a good experience so there can be “teams” of people. This will either work for you or against you.

No true internal promotions, leads to lack of career path. If you are “ upper management” you will be on day one. The days of being able to start as a receptionist or Mail room and work your way up, are no more."

Management is very open and trusting. They share more with employees than I have ever seen elsewhere.","The company is rather established, so don't expect to progress quickly. You will need to be there a solid 5 years to get out of entry level status in many departments. 

The company would be great IF everyone actually lived by the Principles - the book written by the founder that describes the ideal culture.

Aspirational values of truth & transparency, when actualized, are quite powerful
It is incredible to actually have the time to understand myself better and talk through challenging topics openly","Extremely corporate, bureaucratic, slow moving, and -- to be blunt -- uninspiring
Culture felt brutal and unnecessarily unkind, and definitely leaves scars. I learned a lot about my weaknesses, but don't feel like I had the support to actually evolve as a leader. 
In a struggling/shrinking stage of its lifecycle, with little opportunity for internal growth or mobility 
Behind the times on many important topics such as diversity and inclusion

Good track record and brand which makes working there fun and much more pleasant than the average company. Benefits are really first class across the board, especially when it comes to health, 401k, and how they treat employees. Separation package was very generous.","Many jobs are highly reliant on the performance of the flagship fund (Pure Alpha). Poor returns in 2020 saw the need to reduce headcount by a lot, which while not unexpected it is a con given that other industries/ companies are not as volatile. Also, given the size of the drawdown, BW has a long road ahead. Managers are often over scheduled which can make developing as a junior employee difficult. Culture of transparency was not that strong while I was there mostly in part because of the layoffs and there has been many leaks. The company culture varies from department and in Finance it was not as strong, meaning the day to day culture felt like any other financial institution."

109,,Great place to develop leadership skills,2020-09-16,5.0,Coordinator,"Amazing place to work if you're someone who wants to be constantly learning and developing. BW pushes an idea meritocracy and for my team at least, everyone was encouraged to speak up and be heard. You get thoughtful feedback from intelligent people who truly care about your development and are committed to excellence. If you want to be at a place where you are pushed to be the best version of yourself, BW is a great culture.","It can be exhausting to always be on and to get honest feedback 24/7. Every day is like a job interview. I didn't mind that, but some people get burnt out quickly. You have to be willing to put emotions aside to work here - you will be given information or feedback without bedside manner and it takes some time to get used to."

While the culture is over-blown in the media, there are definitely times where folks - especially newer managers - don't get it and end up implementing it poorly. When they go to give critical feedback it comes off as them being more of a jerk then legitimately trying to help you grow (which is the intention and is generally what happens)"
113,,Good job,2020-08-13,5.0,Anonymous Employee,All good  no bad review,No cons go work there
114,,Smart people - Great Pay - Good training and a lot of other bad things,2020-08-13,2.0,Anonymous Employee,"Pays very good with little or no experience. Great training. A lot of opportunities to bond with colleagues. Most of the people are exceptional in the investment engine. Culture is solid, transparency is real and rewarding. You always know where you stand. So the law of no surprise is strictly adhered to.","Work is bad, boring, and outdated. For at least for first 3-4 years, the projects are quite bad. You end up losing your skills and forgetting everything you know. The longer you stay, the more irrelevant you become for the rest of the world. That's not really a problem because if you stay longer they keep making you sign stricter and stricter non-compete agreements. They are so secretive and paranoid about everything. It results in junior employees getting no exposure to the investment process. It also restricts freedom and flexibility. 

It's sad to see some really smart people doing mundane tasks with crappy tools and technologies, wasting time-fighting the bureaucracy and slow-moving tech.

The culture makes the place very verbal and argumentative. That means if you're a Chinese Phd student with not very fluent English, you won't be able to argue back to make your point clear and you will be marked as a bad communicator. The place is very white top to bottom. That is very rare these days for math and tech-driven places. (The purpose of this comment is to help you steer away if you don't love arguing. There is no discrimination or preferential treatment. Everyone is treated equally.)

Employee turnover is very high. They use culture as an excuse to justify the turnover. But, that mostly comes from an easy interview process with no real testing of skills and only culture testing. For more stats, around 20 people joined on the same day as me and we all went through the same training program. Only 2 still work there. You already know this before you join. But the struggle is real when you're actually fired. Nobody wants to hire ex-Bridgewater people because of the lack of any real useful skills and non-compete problems. You may run into more logistical problems because you moved to Connecticut, visa status, school changes for children, and opportunity cost. I know people who rejected four, five job offers to come here and hate every single day at work."

134,,The gift of transparency,2020-01-08,4.0,Manager,I've been at BW for over a decade. Two of the things have kept me here: 1) The people - nowhere else have I found a more genuine and talented group of people that trust each other enough to call out the good and the bad and 2) the transparency and encouragement to rationalize for yourself what is going on around you - by virtue of being able to see and understand decisions at every level you are 'gifted' the opportunity to shape the outcomes for yourself vs. being 'had' by them.,"1) The agility, particularly in the space of innovation, can be limited by the need to make very clear logical connections to rationalize for others why an idea makes sense to invest in. There is limited autonomy to go from the gut... Conversely this is also a strength for BW wrt managing risk and increasing the probability of being right - very appropriate for working in markets
2) It can be hard to distinguish who is right vs. who is a better debater. I.e. open debate is encouraged, but some people are better at it and can push their ideas forward as a result - but they're not necessarily right and often proven wrong after significant investment"

I see real progress in my ability to structure/solve problems and communicate with senior mgmt. I equate many of my experiences to a practical business degree.

The culture. Yes, a culture of transparency & accountability can feel intense, but for me, the many benefits far outweigh any cons. I'm encouraged to have a voice (which is liberating) and genuine relationships with my manager and colleagues (no closed door politics). Challenging yet inspiring to work for a company that is consistently optimizing for quality.","I commute from NYC to CT, which ultimately impacts my work/life balance. But this is my choice, and is more than justified by what I'm gaining from the experience.

The firm is at important point in its story (i.e., the institutionalization of a boutique, founder-led firm). Rapid growth over the years has led to a lot of organizational inefficiency, redundancy, & waste. Senior mgmt. is aware of this & addressing it, but it can lead to some frustration on a day to day basis."

191,,"Sharpening your ""mental"" sword requires grinding, but it's worth it",2017-11-14,5.0,Product Manager,"The culture. Most companies like to say they are transparent for branding purposes, but Bridgewater actually is. While stressful at times for that reason; it was by and large one of the top experiences of my life and has made me a better, sharper professional, and even wife (according to my husband). Bridgewater is a bastion of logic so coworkers can't get away with saying or doing crazy things without repercussions. Similarly, if someone isn't pulling their weight they are called out on it. As a result, I found that I carried substantially less resentment while at Bridgewater as compared with other companies due to being encouraged to get disagreements in the open and solve them. 

I learned more about myself here faster than I would have anywhere else.  My only regret is that I didn't go to Bridgewater earlier in my career, and that I didn't stay longer. Additionally, during my time there I felt I was surrounded by the smartest people I have ever worked with in my life, and was truly supported by the internal community. BW also has one of the best alumni networks I know.

I could not recommend this more to those who are up for the culture - it is worth every minute.

P.S. The benefits here are off the chain - fully paid medical, etc.","The culture here comes with a downside and that is the truth. Do not come here if you are an overly sensitive person, or if you can't take direct feedback. Additionally, in the process of receiving that feedback get ready for some rough days ahead. They compensate their staff excellently, and with that compensation expect only the best.

The only office is in Westport, CT so you need to either move there or get ready for a long commute from NYC. Most colleagues I know, especially the NYC ones, stayed overnight at a hotel nearby several days a week."
192,,The challenge of a lifetime,2017-11-10,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"The culture of transparency minimizes politics and enables the power of collective knowledge.  The community is filled with incredible people who are as caring as they are smart.  The organization sets the tone of excellence in everything from performance expectations to health benefits to constant evolution.  If you’re up for the most rigorous professional and personal growth you might be able to experience in your lifetime (along with the difficult work that takes), consider Bridgewater. I’ve never felt so challenged and so cared for at the same time and feel like I would struggle in any other environment after having had the privilege of working here.","The culture is challenging for many; your work and mistakes are on display so everyone can learn and weigh in. If you thrive in recognition-focused environments, this isn’t for you.  It’s also a tough environment for quick delivery. Decisions can take a long time and those who are delivery driven can struggle with the viscosity. Career paths are less clear than in most organizations which gives you flexibility and ambiguity together (more diligence is needed to be sure career progression steps make sense). Lastly, the environment offers a lot of room for entrepreneurship which leads to great things but often lacks in structure which causes a reliance on key people and tribal knowledge."

I've worked in several groups now across the firm and have always made great friends and found the community to be strong. Id I had to choose 1 reason I continue to stay, it's the people. 
Culture- it's not for everyone but for me, it's hard to imagine working somewhere I can't be honest about who I am, what I think and have open back and forths with others in the company. This is how we engage on ideas, feedback and work through projects. I've learned a ton about myself, have grown professionally from this and in my experience it has created more collaboration and better results. 
Perks- they treat their people well. Free full lunches daily, free bus that picks up employees throughout NYC and brings them to front door of the office, great healthcare. Might sound silly but I really appreciate these things and they save me a ton of money.","Every great place still has areas they need to improve:
Beuracracy- I think that as the company grew very fast and had to change from an individual owned/run firm to an institution, understandably mgmt didn't quite get the balances right across the new structure, processes, etc. that we're put in place. That's led to a firm that has some beuracracy now. People know it's a problem and are actively working to get rid of it and make things better. I think we're on the path but not quite there yet. 
Technology - technology sort of ties to the first con.  The quality of tech provided across the firm is inconsistent  and still has a ways to go in terms of meeting the needs of the depts and being competitive with what other businesses have.

207,,Perspective and Purpose,2017-06-21,5.0,Technologist,"When I reflect back on who I was prior to coming to the firm 6 years ago, I was lost.  I had no idea who I was, what my values were, why I cared about the things I cared about, why I got upset about the things I got upset about and what my purpose was in life, as a husband and as a father.  Bridgewater taught me the art and power of deep and meaningful reflection.  It has taught me and enabled me to recognize how wrong and overconfident I am and that no matter what I think it’s most critical to have top of mind the fact that I might be missing something and that it’s probably a good idea to worry about that and engage others on that to help me. It’s pretty genius and simple but yet most of the world (especially traditional hierarchical corporate America) does not think or operate this way.  In short, here is a sentence from one of our principles “it pays to stress test your thinking, even when you're pretty sure you're right.”  
At Bridgewater, we are all pushed to be excellent at everything we do.  This is a reason that people don’t end up making it here and also a reason why people (like me) value being here even if we don’t have to.  In order for me to achieve my own goals and find meaning and purpose in my life, Bridgewater is the place that will get me there fast.  By way of others holding me highly accountable to a virtually unachievable standard every minute of every day, this is what enables me to grow.
There is no such thing as a pure, 100% idea meritocracy as people are people and imperfect by definition.  However, our ideal and value of being an idea meritocracy is true and not lip service and when debates come up, the idea meritocracy approach always wins.  The people that speak up with the problems are the heroes.  The people that can then practically solve those problems  are the ones being promoted to solve more difficult problems.  I’ve sent sharp feedback emails directly to Ray, other CEOs and senior managers and instead of getting fired I’ve gotten quality and thoughtful engagement.  
The hierarchy here is upside-down vs. most companies.  As a leader gets higher in the organization they become more open minded.  They recognize that the problems they are dealing with do not have easy solutions, that there will typically be a sharp divide among what people think is the right approach and there are big 2nd and 3rd order consequences no matter which path is chosen.  Instead of having closed door meetings or just making a rash decision in their corner office and expecting everyone else to fall in line, they seek out the advice and opinions of others, even those at the very bottom of the organization.  Sometimes these are the people that know the problems and consequences the best.  This is why they listen to you and care about your opinions.  If you are wrong, then it reinforces them being right.  If you are right then they now have more work to do.  Speaking up is always a win-win and is an easy thing to understand intellectually but actually doing it is the big hurdle.  Most people come to Bridgewater with this being a weak muscle.  They key, though, is each person’s values.  If you value harmony, the path of least resistance and when you come to that fork in the road you know that speaking up is the best approach but you choose not to – you are not going to enjoy being here and won’t be successful (an attribute that we call tolerating problems – if you see the problem but don’t care enough to prioritize fixing it or ensuring someone else fixes it).  If you recognize that speaking up is the better approach, you give it a try a few times and see how powerful it is.  This muscle gets stronger and stronger until it’s just part of the way you think and navigate problem solving.  You’ll see the successful paths you are paving and you won’t want to leave because you’ll see how fast you are growing and that most of the world doesn’t operate this way.
The last big pro is our justice system.  At any time, if you have a disagreement that you can’t resolve with the other person you escalate up a level for a more wise judge to understand the situation and provide their opinion.  If you still disagree, you keep escalating all the way up to the management committee.  These are done out in the open and often times others agree with you.  These are the important cases to go through slowly because a lot is learned not only about the actual business problem needing to be solved but about the people involved, what they are like and how they deal with and work through such tough situations.  This process includes the cases where you feel your grade does not reflect your performance or when you think you should stay in a role vs. be let go or move to a different role.  One of the key questions I have for people that highlight key problems in their online feedback is whether they raised the issue or not and if they did, did they keep fighting up the chain or give up?

Regarding benefits, Bridgewater pays 100% of the premiums for a platinum medical plan.  This is huge for my family.","Thriving at Bridgewater is highly dependent on the role you are in and the people you are working with.  When you are in the right role, it’s obvious.  When you are in the wrong role, it’s obvious but it may not be to you.  Think of the symphony analogy.  When you are in the right role, you are helping an orchestra play beautiful music, everyone is in harmony.  When you are in the wrong role you are the person out of tune and off beat.  This is painful because you want to succeed and are trying hard but can’t.  It’s even harder because you see that you are letting your team down and causing others pain to do more work and cover for you.  Bridgewater is not a place where we are ok with the incompetent person on the team, we don’t put them in the corner and design the function and operation around them.  We need the right people in the right roles focused on the right goals to succeed and this is hard reality to face in a corporate setting when we are all people with egos and our nature is to want to look good and be right all the time.  Sometimes the right answer is that you aren’t a fit for that job but people have a very hard time thinking at the higher level and recognizing  that.  It’s ok (and expected) to fight through whether that is true or not but this is a very tough thing to do when you are just trying to work harder and harder and not smarter and your poor thinking and judgment and ego is clouding your focus.  All that being said, Bridgewater is not a one strike and you are out place.  You get many, many chances for a “try-again” or a “do-over.”  In most cases, too many.  You are free to step back into the batter’s box and ask for that pitch you can’t hit again.  At some point, though, you need to recognize that watching game film or getting help from a coach is the better way.  Maybe you can’t hit that Nolan Ryan fastball after all.
In order to grow, you need to fail, you need to work through very uncomfortable situations and go through some level of adversity.  These things are tough on us and can be tough on our family as we struggle through this.  Each person is different but on the flip side I see an incredible level of maturity in my children because of all this – because I’ve grown immensely and am able to illuminate proper values, thinking, purpose and perspective and help them struggle well, too.  The difference between being in pain and being ok is as simple as changing your perspective and am deeply appreciative for what Bridgewater had given to me."
208,,Horrible place for Technologists,2017-06-14,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"Not a typical ""corporate"" environment, get to speak more freely in some regards - i.e. you disagree with your boss. No need to be cloyingly polite all the time.","Too many to count, my top items:
1) Consistently penny smart, pound foolish. For example trying to lowball new hires saying ""you get what you deserve over time"" just results in people not being happy and leaving since raises are slow to non-existent. Trying to squeeze into a seeming arbitrary budget but canceling projects to engineer desperately needed replacement systems.  
2)  Way too much churn around management (no CTO lasts over a year) and direction - nobody wants to be accountable for a decision. Impossible to know what direction to invest in and which to migrate away from since the plan changes every quarter. 
3) Following the above - most systems and processes are massively out of date. There are still Windows 2003 servers serving critical roles and most pieces of the infrastructure are multiple revisions out of date.
4) Cloak and Dagger non-sense. ""Security"" is paramount and there are literally hundreds of people in Security who get to say no to what technologists want to do but they are not responsible for keeping most of the Security tools running. Most technologists aren't officially allowed to know what Security software is loaded onto all desktops and servers, but almost trivial troubleshooting uncovers one of the dozen tools in slowing down performance or breaking something.  Nobody is allowed to talk about how their ""proprietary""  system works since it's a secret - yet it turns out so much is just duct taped together with Excel, VB scripts, and other terrible non-enterprise solutions since nobody was willing to work with and share with another part of the firm and implement things properly. This despite the entire hypocritical focus on What Good Looks Like.
5) 0 development in anything that matters. No training on technology, it's all management principles training - or forced indoctrination into a ""way of being"" that just does not work with technology. 
6) The constant threat of outsourcing. The Bridgewater method just doesn't work for technology - once you have a system it needs grunt work to maintain (as opposed to investing where often the smartest thing to do in don't do anything while you weigh options) - there is a constant desire to outsource the technology teams creating FUD about people's jobs and mental anguish."

I learned A LOT over my time there and is one of the reasons I'm very happy I worked there.  I learned a lot about myself (strengths, weaknesses, etc.).  I feel like I learned much more about business, business communications, etc. than I did as a business major in college.  I was a big fan of the tight knit culture.  I consider myself a shy person, but I became tight with my teammates quickly in my first job there and the third team I worked on.  They have great events throughout the year for employees and they have great benefits for employees (stocked kitchens, lunch, gym, bus for NYC employees, etc.).","All that being said, it's definitely not the easiest place to work and not for everyone.  In my five years, I saw lots of people come and go, some only after a few months working there, so there can be a good amount of turnover.  Within my first year on my first team, pretty much everyone else on my team when I started (about 10 people) had cycled out and I was the most tenured person on the team and due to team manager shakeup, experienced about 4-5 different managers in that first year.  Two of the teams that I worked on were pretty hectic in terms of having bad processes making things really inefficient and creating more work than needed.  As some one living in NYC, the daily commute sucks as well.  It's much better than it could be given there's a bus that picks up employees in the morning and drops them off in the evening, but it's about 1-1.5 hours each way and it sucks being stuck to a bus/train schedule."

I had unparalleled exposure to senior management, was able to take on as much responsibility as I could handle, and I learned more about management and running a company than I realized until I went and founded my own company. At the time, I wasn't always sure how relevant all The Principles and The Culture was to quality management. Now, that I am out of my own I am much better able to navigate ambiguity and complicated decisions because I have a universal framework I can turn to to help me sort things out. The practical application is even clearer to me now, then it was then. Business insider has a great article talking to the CIO Bob Prince that's worth reading if you want to better understand the relationship between the culture and business outcomes.  Beyond a ton of learning, the Bridgewater community is what I cherish most about my 5-years there.  The culture of openness and honesty lends itself to extremely deep and meaningful relationships.  When I left, it was the people that I was the most sad to leave but it's the people that I have stayed in touch with and make me still feel connected to Bridgewater.  And I don't just mean who you would traditionally call my peers, I still keep in touch with my first managers who are almost twice my age.  It is these unexpected friendships, and the perspectives they bring to my life, that I really treasure.","Bridgewater is an extremely intense environment and is not for the faint of heart.  It can be exhausting, at a day-to-day level, to be part of a company that focuses so much on the process of how to achieve a goal and how to improve. If you don't step back to see the larger picture, it can feel like you are never good enough even though that's not the case - just because you can improve doesn't mean that you aren't doing great.

A subset of employees are adept at using the Principles to aggressively further their career/agenda. I was too naive to understand this and was one of those thrown under the bus after 3 years.
2. The technology is horribly outdated. The majority of analytical work is still done on Excel. Culture management is done with manual forms in Sharepoint and on the Ipad.
3. Bridgewater has an edge in the market, but you likely won't be ""in the circle"".

Every person who has been at the firm more than a year now has a little Kool-Aid stall of their own: everyone knows how to sidetrack any real conversation using rhetoric, counter-arguments, and personal attacks masquerading as constructive criticism. Management is terrible, most people are over-valued monetarily and then made to do the most ridiculous tasks ever, and the firm is many years away from realizing that emotional safety is an incredibly important factor for productivity at the workplace. 

Gender: even by finance standards, the gender disparity is egregious. There are murmurings of discontent around the firm about this now, but no real action to counter the fact that almost all managers are men, all strategists are men, all engineers are men. Women usually mill around ""leveraging"" them (fancy Bridgewater speak for begging irresponsible managers to come to meetings on time). While this itself might be representative of a lot of the rest of the corporate world, the Bridgewater ""culture"" itself is so perniciously aggressive and abrasive that it ends up supporting brash, unapologetic, and insensitive masculinity.

Incredibly high turnover (over 50% per 18 months now), which definitely erodes team cohesion and morale. The culture attempts to get rid of office politics, but it ended up creating a tedious bureaucracy that can make it difficult to get things done (though there are several instances of the opposite being true). Although this varies by department, the culture can be highly abusive and there were countless instances of people behaving in ways that would get them admonished or fired at any other firm.

The desire for transparency is awesome, and the perks and pay were pretty fantastic (BW parties and trips are out of this world).

Their benefits package is AWESOME, and despite everything else associated with the company these really are some fantastic, kind people.","Those same super expert-level people will either last under a year or evolve into logical automatons, complete with all the good and bad you can imagine. And the rest of the turnover rate is insane, especially among the younger people they churn in and out. (Started in a training class of about 20; under 10 left after 6 mo, only 5 after a full year)

Emotions are considered to be a factor, but an extraneous one you really should get rid of if you want excel in decision making. And unfortunately the paramount goal of ""optimum efficiency through logical thinking and solid oversight"" has evolved into a frustrating bureaucracy that makes it very hard to get things done outside of the core investment business. 

Also, be prepared for your regular 50+ hour min work week, or face the inquisitive/jealous/demeaning gazes of your peers (and probably some probing and discussion as to why you feel it's ok to ""produce less"" or something).

For instance, I was an admin, so my believability on many things was fairly low compared to others higher up. However, I came from a fairly diverse background where I was previously a project manager and had insight that others may not have had necessarily.

Preferential treatment

System is rigged to create a very negative and toxic environment

Culture brings out the worst in everyone. I witnessed so many good people who turned into demons.  Principles are easily twisted for personal gains.

Poor management.  No leadership skills. Hard to believe this is a world class organization."
283,,"Powerful, if consuming, experience",2015-11-15,4.0,Administrative Assistant,"The sincerity. Nothing is a mere veneer to make something look good. Everyone tries to live up to the principles about how we're going to work with each other, even when they're difficult to follow through. The rules about ethical business conduct are carefully enforced. When you receive praise, you know you've earned it; when you receive criticism, you know it's not spiteful. The work environment is refreshingly straightforward. You always know where you stand.

The standards. Whatever work you are doing, it is expected to be the very best of that kind of work. No job is without challenge - success is always hard won. Every project becomes an opportunity to learn, and you evolve quickly. You have the support and collaboration of all the people you work with, pushing you forward faster than you'll be comfortable with, always stretching your limits.

The people. You are surrounded by people who are incredibly intelligent, extraordinarily quick on their feet, and dead serious about their work ethic. You are never be the smartest person in the room - and you are driven to new levels of ingenuity trying to earn your place. Yet you are welcomed, encouraged, and inspired rather than disheartened.","The work. You have to make sure that work you are doing here is meaningful to you, because the incredibly high standards will only make your doubts about the worth of your job more stark. You can only maintain the levels of energy necessary to live up to the challenges of Bridgewater if you love what you're doing. There's no getting by here, no way to to be just ""okay"" with the way things are; you have to reach for your passion, or burn out.

The balance - or rather, the lack of it. It is extremely difficult to maintain reasonable work-life distinction here. You are expected to devote everything you have to the work. It uses you up; there is no room for secondary concerns."

288,,Ask yourself why you want want to work at Bridgewater,2015-10-22,3.0,Technology General Manager,"In short, you will come out of the experience being a much better version of yourself.  You will be a sharper thinker and know yourself more intimately.  Details: Your cohort of colleagues are likely going to be at least one standard deviation or more above average intelligence.  They will be humble, direct, and interested in sharing a core set of values.  You will learn/refine how to think about things systematically and relentlessly focus on what can go wrong and what to do about it.  And, most importantly you will learn a lot about yourself (some of it will be quite painful) - i.e. what you're truly good at and what aren't which can be monumental in how you shape the rest of your career and life for that matter.

Other comments about pay/food/parties/etc. are all true but keep in mind that total compensation balanced with total number of work hours may not be on average that much higher (10-15%); very few people are invited to participate in long term profit sharing.","The company is generally risk averse, the principles reflect a life-long learning in investing that protects heavily against the downsides.  These are extrapolated to all things at Bridgewater, and naturally you experience a cadence of large outcomes are significantly lower velocity - if you value being nimble, taking risks then this is definitely not the place for you.

Ray is on a multi-year transition out of the company but as of yet has been unsuccessful at finding/fielding a successful group of capable managers who will uphold the same degree of ""everything that Ray can do"".  Founder transitions have rarely been successful, so it begets the question of what Bridgewater may be like 5-10 years down the road.

You live in a constant state of tension....the principles on the surface are very logical and appealing but if you spend enough time living them, you'll realize that it's very hard to do so.  You receive 360 degree feedback daily/minutely, which can be invigorating but prevents you from having an 'off-day'.

Lastly, you will definitely run across principle management ninjas who can bend/shape anything you say into something unfavorable.  This is not particularly prevalent but it exists, so don't buy into the fallacy that there are no politics at the company; there are just fewer and concealed by a shrewd application of the principles (not very hard with that many super ambitious mensa types)."

But since in reality Big Brother is not omnipotent and the Party is not infallible, there is need for an unwearying, moment-to-moment flexibility in the treatment of facts. The key word here is black-white. Like so many Newspeak words, this word has two mutually contradictory meanings. Applied to an opponent, it means the habit of impudently claiming that black is white, in contradiction of the plain facts. Applied to a Party member, it means a loyal willingness to say that black is white when Party discipline demands this. But it means also the ability to believe that black is white, and more, to know that black is white, and to forget that one has ever believed the contrary."" 

Basically sums up the bridgewater experience. If you're interested in working at a big hedge fund, fine, just don't go in with some naive expectation of ""radical truth,"" ""radical transparency,"" and ""an idea meritocracy"" as they advertise--unless, of course, the ""radical truth"" equates to whatever Ray Dalio or his loyal minions say.. They have their own ridiculous version of Newspeak hand-crafted by Ray, including phrases like ""getting to the other side"" by overcoming your ""blindspots and ego barriers,"" which essentially amounts to blindly adhering to whatever your masters believe while ignoring any attempts at logic. All this is made harder to stomach by the weirdly moralistic culture that you have to applaud as ""holier than"" the rest of wall street (holy is an apt word here, as one must respect Ray's Principles as though they are the Word of God).

However, there aren't great checks and balances and the company has become too large.   You have a lot of young kids that have only worked at BW, so they have no idea what good looks like.  Especially within IT, you have a bunch of people that think they are smart, trying to interpret and manage by the principles. 

IT is a funny place to work, as it is completely mismanaged.  ""Managers"" attempt to mess with your mind by using quotes from the principles instead of actually taking the time to get to know their people and build them up.  Most people there do not know how to manage, but because they did well on a principles test or because they can 5 step a simple problem, they suddenly become senior managers.

I have faith that the core departments don't operate in a poor way, after all...they have exposure to Ray and competent people.

Working at Bridgewater is a great experience.  You learn that even throwing money at problems doesn't fix things.  BW spends millions bringing in pwC consultants, and those consultants make things worse and attempt to quote the principles when making management decisions. At the very least, it's worth a good laugh

318,,"Incredibly talented co-workers, surprisingly bureaucratic",2015-05-25,3.0,"Analyst, Research Department","I worked at Bridgewater for nearly 4 years. If you are thinking about working at Bridgewater, I want to say that Bridgewater's reviews on Glassdoor as a whole are accurate. Ignore the 1 star hates and 5 star brainwashed positivity. Just track the themes that repeat in the 2-4 star reviews and think for yourself. Below is my summary, but these same thoughts have been echoed in many prior reviews.

> Bridgewater is the real deal as a macro hedge fund; it consistently beats the market on a risk-adjusted basis and with low correlation to the equity markets.

> Greatest concentration of talented and interesting people across the organization I have ever been in. What's most surprising is that this smartness spans across to even lower level positions such as event planners, administrative assistants, and analysts. Smart people want to spend time with other smart people, and Bridgewater has a huge reputation in this area.

> Good compensation and benefits for non-core functions relative to the market price of similar roles in other companies. Core trading, research, account management are at or possible below market.","> Incredible amount of bureaucracy for a 1,500 person organization. Bridgewater's culture emphasizes criticism and soundness of logic. This is outstanding for some problems, but is a nightmare for solving other kinds. I feel like this culture emphasizes incremental improvements, but makes paradigm shifts practically impossible even for super talented people.
I contrast Bridgewater's culture with Google's culture that lets smart people try moon-shot ideas with lots of positivity and less oversight. Both organizations are immensely successful with wildly different cultures.

>A sub-point of my first Con, but technology is horribly outdated, and the Bridgewater culture for some reason makes significant improvements difficult. As a result, you have to rely on smart people doing smart things with manual processes. Bridgewater literally has a team of 50+ people manually checking for new data points and investigating data points that fall outside 3 standard deviations of historical data points. This has essentially gone unchanged over 5 years despite massive improvements in data science and statistical analysis.

>Job risk. Roughly 15% of the company is fired or leaves in any given year. The overall caliber of hires is very high, so those who get fired/ get fed up and quit aren't idiots/deadwood. Anecdotally, the risk is not a problem for those <5 years out of college who can find good jobs after leaving Bridgewater. It's a big risk for senior hires who have established, successful careers prior to joining Bridgewater.

320,,BW Pros and Cons,2015-05-19,4.0,Anonymous Employee,"Bridgewater has a corporate culture like no other. Grounded in the pursuit of truth and excellence, Bridgewater is an intellectually demanding environment. Founder, Ray Dalio, has coined the company an idea meritocracy. This concept is exemplified in the frequency of debate and feedback, that employees use to generate the best ideas and foster improvement. Bridgewater practices radical transparency, where very few issues, thoughts, and conversations are private. Employees receive weekly recordings of executive meetings, at the company and departmental level. Meetings are almost always recorded, and are referenced when needed. Employees are expected to raise their concerns and give feedback, however that does not mean all opinions are equal, and BW asks it’s employees to consider whether they are knowledgeable enough to hold an opinion. Unlike many places where mistakes are frowned upon, BW embraces mistakes as a means of learning and improvement. Being able to embrace your mistakes and take critical feedback requires an abandoning of ego that is incredibly important, as well as difficult. BW possesses very high performance expectations, that only increase as employees become more competent. Successful employees embrace this and are always looking for ways to improve themselves and the way that things are done. Bridgewater has an amazing community. Having meaningful relationships, is almost as highly valued as truth.  Employees are supportive and caring, but also willing to be harsh and forthright when necessary. Management cares about employees and they go out of the way to help when needed and celebrate, or congratulate, when necessary. The benefits package reflects this care. Salaries are competitive.","Interestingly enough, what one believes to be BWs pros, another will certainly see as cons. Receiving harsh feedback is difficult, and not everyone will have the ability to do so in a productive, learning oriented manner. The culture values substance over style, and not all issues are approached with social tact that would be required in most other corporate environments. This can be especially difficult for more sensitive people. The emphasis on finding the best answer, can be frustrating and bureaucratic, which can be viewed, and sometimes is, unproductive. Company-wide technology is deprioritized, therefore it is slightly antiquated."
321,,There are ups and downs...and its well worth the ride,2015-05-12,4.0,Anonymous Employee,"When I decided to apply to Bridgewater, many different emotions went through my head…excitement, nervousness, skepticism, and pride specifically were at the forefront of my mind.  I don’t think any of these feelings are rare for someone applying to Bridgewater and I think many of them are actually expected and totally predictable.  I was excited about the potential of my future if I was selected to join Bridgewater; I was nervous about the daunting interview process I heard about; I was skeptical about the authenticity of culture (is what Principles describes really how Bridgewater is run day-to-day?); and I was initially proud that I was even selected for a first round interview.  After making it through the interview process and now working at Bridgewater for 6 years, I can say that those feelings were all appropriate and Bridgewater has delivered on each.

I’m now in my 3rd role and can pledge that career growth and new opportunities are readily available to anyone who wants (and can take on) added responsibilities at Bridgewater.  Role mobility is valued at Bridgewater through a free market for talent.  The growth and learning trajectory I’ve experienced here in 6 years is unlike any other company I’ve worked at or schools that I’ve attend.  Bridgewater challenges you in a different way that is not for the faint of heart…you’re pushed every day to think differently, step outside of your comfort zone, and not settle for flat performance.  No Bridgewater employee can succeed by going through the ropes, simply doing what they’re told, and calling it a day when their checklist is complete.  You succeed at Bridgewater by challenging what you don’t understand, pushing current practices further, and thinking independently.","During my time at Bridgewater I've experienced the highs of the highs and the lows of the lows.  The lows are something you hear about and prepare for, but the learning experience at Bridgewater can definitely be painful.  It’s what you do with that pain that really separates those who enjoy Bridgewater and those who hate Bridgewater.  Both types of potential reactions to that pain are common (just look at Glassdoor postings) because Bridgewater can really be a polarizing place.  Bridgewater will never change its values and will never try to make someone fit in whose values are naturally in conflict with Bridgewater’s.  It’s not a place for everyone…in fact it’s probably a place for a very small few.  Going through the pain of the lows (recognizing weaknesses, understanding who you really are, reflecting on failures, etc) can be the most valuable experience one can have in their professional life…the question is who appreciates those types of experiences, who can get above it, and who ultimately wants that type of growth."

Best opportunities for success and happiness are far away from the departments where the founder is involved","Parties and ""team bonding"" events get excessive- forced bonding with co-workers to ""build community"" takes even more time away from family and friends outside of work.  Managers are expected to attend and it is viewed negatively if managers do not attend.  Poor work life balance

Parties get out of hand, and no-one really cares... kind of like ""Mad Men"" in how it operates. Men who are complained about are minimally disciplined, if at all, and excuses made for them.

Forced bell curve on performance, requires constant culling of employees.  Managers know this and need to plan for it, if you aren't in charge of who gets in the bottom 30% you are 75% more likely to be in there.  It becomes a chess game of managers keeping their jobs and ""sorting people.""

Highly successful people aren't good enough.  You are labeled within 3 months of your arrival, and if the picture wasn't pretty to them, by whatever algorithm that they are using this week to assess you, it will never be pretty and you will never come out from under any label you get there... It will be on your ""baseball card"" and follow you to any role for the rest of your career there.  

Reckless assessment and testing practices, using personality and workplace assessments in ways that they were never intended to be interpreted by people with zero training resulting in hiring and firing decisions as well as opinions of people that are unfounded - rampant confirmation bias.  Everyone is compared to the founder and his heir apparent, so if your results are different from them, you are in the red and scores are lower.  No perceived value in diversity of thinking, approach, etc.

Constant failure and revolving door of Senior Executive team and department heads is depressing...

If you can't communicate in their language, good luck uttering a full sentence without being interrupted and negative feedback being recorded for you in their assessment system.  No effort to understand one another.  Most people just trying to survive by attacking rather than being attacked.

Principles are great in theory, but can be manipulated to support whatever theory the better debater needs.  And, if something happens that requires Ray to do something he doesn't want to, to stay in line with his own principles and values, he'll just write a new one to justify what he does. 

The worst part is that Management and the company pretend to be different from every other corporate environment and they fool lots of people who end up being blindsided.   Real truth is that they are just as political, scheming, back stabbing and pushing of their own agendas as any other financial institution, but they are full of arrogance and hubris that they are somehow better and more elevated than people at those other companies.    Its just all the harder to figure out who you can trust there.

You are being watched -- 100% of the time--Through your badges, cameras, computer activity, blackberry, more cameras and all formal conversations are audio-taped.  You are encouraged to report on other employees, preferably publicly, but anonymously is OK too and they'll give you lots of ways to do that."

Every mistake discovered, no matter how minute, is entered into an ""Issue Log"". I was once issue logged for failing to capture the letter ""C"" in the word Complete, when I C&Ped it from one document into another. Had I made this mistake a second or third time, it would have likely been selected for ""diagnosis"". This is where you have a sit down with a bunch of managers who attempt to ""get past your ego"" to the root of the problem. The least painful way to get through these sessions is to agree with their assessment that you lack attention to detail, have an insufficient level of paranoia, are inherently careless, and lack discipline. You walk away feeling like a loser, but at least they're in a great mood for the rest of the day.

Your workload starts out manageable, and is steadily increased until you're struggling to maintain productivity. You start putting in more and more hours. You start making mistakes, which means more issue logs, more diagnosis sessions, more frustration, more anxiety. You start dreading going to work. Eventually, you're labeled as ""not a fit for Bridgewater"", and you are ""sorted"".

Also, did you notice that all the positive responses sound the same. That might be because one or two people are writing them. Even if its 15, do you want to sound like that?

Here is the bottom line: as an investment, portfolio, or management associated you are going to range between 120 and 150k. For that price, you will sign a stifling non-compete, learn nothing about how anyone but bridgewater invests, and deal with humiliating terrible stuff all day long.

Being a Management Associate at BW can allow you exactly that: right out of college, I started working very closely with an extremely seasoned manager who teaches and coaches me every day in all the core skills of a manager. To give an example, I get the chance to run meetings with the former CEO of a 6000+ company watching me and giving me feedback in the moment, only a few months out of school. There are very few places that give entry level folks that kind of experience and development opportunity.","The location in Westport, CT vis-a-vis NYC or at least Stamford is definitely a draw back. Although the free transportation offered by BW is as good as it possibly can be (reliable, comfortable, professional), it's still at least 1h each way to NYC. I have the choice to stay overnight in CT if I choose to, but that's still not the same as going home."
361,,Good Luck,2014-06-21,1.0,,Excellent Training Program for Investment Associates,"Company is divided into Investment Associates and Management Associates.  Management Associates are in charge of everything despite having zero knowledge of the business-- which is investing-- and zero formal training in management other then Bridgewater's own in-house principles, which typically don't produce great results.  

Management Associates are also paid extremely well relative to a) their other opportunities (basically management consulting) and b) their marketable skills (which are zero if they are trained in the Bridgewater management style, which is broadly ineffective and cannot operate anywhere except within the company itself).  Investment Associates, in contrast, are not paid well relative to their other opportunities (top tier hedge funds).  This creates a corrosive culture and management is not sympathetic about the insufficient comp of the investment professionals.  For those who have been with the firm for many years, comp begins to increase with Phantom Equity (but not real equity); but this typically requires signing lifelong Trade Secret Agreements which prevent the investment professionals for ever leaving, so once again the incentive to compensate fairly (as if employees had any options to go elsewhere) is nonexistent.  All investment associates sign two-year blanket non-compete agreements which make finding employment in the finance industry after leaving the firm extremely difficult.  There are many employees who are unhappy, but realistically cannot leave because of the pieces of paper they have signed.  

The culture itself is cult-like.  A typical exercise in transparency will consist of Ray Dalio creating a real-time poll for all the participants of a meeting to fill out on their iPads (yes, everyone has a company-issued iPad with Principles-related software and apps, and is required to carry it at all times) in order to see who agrees with what he is saying and who agrees with somebody else.  You can imagine the results.  The iPad can also be used to rate other employees along various dimensions of thinking and emotional capabilities (such as ""Linear Thinking,"" ""Lateral Thinking,"" ""Stress Tolerance,"" ""Grabbing the Bull by the Horns,"" and the enigmatic ""Comfortable Knowing What He/She Doesn't Know""); the rankings are then weighted according to the rankers' ""believability"" (because to treat all rankings as equally valid would be democratic, not meritocratic-- a big no-no in Bridgewater's culture), which is largely calculated based on the correlation with scores Ray has given to people (so the more your ratings of other people are similar to Ray's, the more believable you are).  This has the predictable effect of pigeon-holing people into both high and low stations relatively quickly.  Despite the questionable accuracy of these personality metrics, the company invests immense resources in analyzing the personality data.  The engineer of IBM's Watson supercomputer was hired not to work on the systematic investment logic, but purely to analyze personality data.  The firm's technological infrastructure is backwards, but because of Ray's obsession with the principles there are teams of dedicated software developers to build iPad apps while the management of billions of dollars continues to operate on 1990's technology."

The benefits are wonderful (now that they have a legit family leave policy) and there are many ways to integrate yourself quickly into the Bridgewater community (concerts, happy hours, plays, other outings). Standing desks are pretty common and make for a more productive workplace, in my opinion. It's not uncommon to be walking down the hall and the CIO says 'good morning' and stops to have a chat. Extremely smart and interesting people.","Tough culture - be prepared to be reduced to your mistakes and weaknesses on a daily basis while maintaining a smile on your face. The 'principles' are sometimes used for evil and not good by managers with no people management skills (and even worse analytical skills). i.e., they're sometimes a fall-back formula for firing people.  You will never be let 'off the hook' (which can be a good or bad thing) and no working day is ever easy.  After too much time there (2+ years) and depending on your specialty/experience, your attractiveness to potential employers starts to wane because you become really good at working at Bridgewater and nowhere else. The company is becoming extremely bureaucratic compared to 5+ years ago but that's probably a natural outcome of growing so quickly.

Their Principles are wonderful in theory, but in practice it didn't work for me or several co-workers in my department. You are supposed to be transparent and let everyone know what you are doing at all times (via email updates, shared daily journal entries, etc.) however this led to no one taking responsibility for anything because it was ""everyone's responsibility to make sure everyone else is doing their job."""

You have a desk and a phone, and a computer( with outdated tech). You get an understanding of how other people percieve you.  And you can then do things to fix, how people percieve you.  However how people percieve you does not = your actual strenghts and weakensses. It can be very useful to perfect how other people percieve you and make it work in your favor, - so that you can use it to succeed at other places.","BW worked well as a startup. I love debate, goal oriented and ruthless improvement and beating the competition. I enjoy making money.  However, I do believe that these ends have to be pursued through honest and fair means. I realize that these convictions are quite outdated these days.  During the days of Ray, BW used to be fair and honest. Ruthless, but fair and honest.  Now that Ray is gone, it has lost its edge and has stagnated to become an institutionalized cesspool of cleptocrats.  People mindlessly follow and execute “culture” processes, but the conviction and understanding behind the principles is no longer there.  United States had good intentions and ideology too, when it first started, too. But the influence of the founders has faded, and the ideas and principles they have set forth, have been subverted, corrupted and abused by power-hungry sociopaths . The very same principles that Ray set forth to defeat dishonesty, ego and stupidity have been co-opted by self-serving managers to stifle debate and dissent. Instead of exploring weaknesses to help coach others and to drive for self-improvement, managers use a focus on weaknesses to take down people they perceive as threats and to destroy the confidence and self-worth of juniors to solidify their control over them and to boost their own egoes.  Managers use debate not to find truth, but to deflect attention and blame from themselves and onto others. Instead of being managers, they have become politicians in the middle of re-election ( where re-election is every single day) , twisting words and slinging mud, aiming to take out the opponent. With electioneering happening every day, it is no wonder no work ever gets done.  Imagine all the idiosyncrasy, bloat, ego, politicking, conflict of interest and bickering in the US House of Representatives.  Now imagine all of that transposed onto a Hedge Fund. – well that is BW for you. If you want to learn how to be a politician debater, expert at deflecting blame to others,- then BW is right for you, and it pays better than working for the government. However, if you actually want to learn anything of substance, learn some transferable skills and get something done, then forget BW. BW is not a quick and agile firm, it is an inflexible, slow to act, soul crushing bureaucracy. True, their bureaucracy is built differently and crushes the soul differently ( other reviews have explained that in depth) than the bureaucracy at other big IB banks/institutions. However,- the end result is the same: progress and change is stifled to the max and the soul is crushed.  The heavy weight of BW processes and culture creates its own kind of red tape, which is difficult to cut through to get anything done in a reasonable amount of time. Ray set out to restructure human nature in his image for his company, - but he couldn’t keep out the parasites, and the parasites have taken over the host, subverting the culture to their own purposes and sucking it dry."

You get to work with some super-smart people and generally the quality of conversation is an order of magnitude better than other places I have worked at.,"Bridgewater is facing some growing pains as it moves from being a small company run by Ray Dalio to something more institutionalized. Some of the principles that have worked well at a small level don't necessarily scale well, which results (for example) in managers through the ranks translating principles in a sometimes back handed way.

Bridgewater lacks a bit of a sense of humor - there is a fair amount of attention in the company on meaningful relationships, but the reality is everyone is pretty intensely focused on their business responsibility. I made fewer good friends at BW than other places I worked.

Because Bridgewater can hire great people given its brand, pay is ok but not great in most roles and unless you are in the top tier of the company long term progression is unlikely. But for three to five years, a great experience for most people who get past the first eighteen months,"

Narcissism runs rampant, which is counter to what ""The Principles"" express. Weird meetings where people tell the ""truth"" about each other. Mostly an opportunity for people to tell you what's wrong with you in an abusive way. It's like group therapy with a very sick therapist in charge. Cameras follow you everywhere, meetings and conversations are recorded. Might as well live in Soviet Russia. Very, very weird place. I'd say close to a cult.

If in the right department and management change, you can always ask the question - but don't expect the pat on the back for being the smartest or the most experienced. Thoughtful, considered questions and a particular brand of humility and hubris are always welcome.","The standards never slacken and there is no where to hide - expect to get home at the end of the day, every day, feeling like you've been put through a wringer in some regards.
Additionally, the philosophical-culture enthusiast can get caught in a trap where talking seems more important than doing - but ultimately you are held accountable to what you do (or don't) deliver, so it requires a lot of discipline to be in this culture."
376,,"The culture looks great on paper, however in practice.....",2014-03-13,3.0,Recruiting Coordinator,"I worked at Bridgewater for a little under a year. They are always hiring for HR because they divide it into Recruiting and HR. And they always are in need for recruiters because their turnover is very high. The culture on the HR side is not as intense as the culture is on the recruiting side since the recruiting department is more involved with the ""money"" and therefore more exposed to the culture.  But crazy stuff aside Bridgewater can be a good place if you end up with a good team!",For the most part I think their culture is interesting/borderline unproductive. It can be very intense at times because they tend to nit pick at what you do wrong even if it's something small. And focus on those issues rather than the work you are supposed to be doing. Which can be very stressful.
377,,I've been at Bridgewater now for 5+ years and cant imagine working somewhere else,2014-02-19,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"The Community - the people are what make a place and the people and relationships you build working here are really one of a kind and long lasting. You are surrounded by really smart people with all different and interesting life experiences, who work hard, care a lot about this place and will have genuine conversations with you about what they think and push to help you get better. There is no talking behind peoples backs or shady decision making happening behind closed doors - its an open environment where we work through problems and feedback together and in that, creates very trusting and honest relationships. If you want to be at a place where you can just be yourself and surround yourself with other people doing the same thing, this is a great community to be a part of. 

The Personal Growth– I have learned so much about myself while working here, which has helped me evolve both professionally and personally. It’s just such a cool experience to think about who I was when I joined, how much I have grown in these past 5+ years (i.e. I’m a much better problem solver, more open minded) and to imagine what my journey will be like as I continue to evolve in the future. The rate of improvement and learning here is like nowhere else I have experienced and it’s just such a unique opportunity to be at a company that fosters so much personal evolution and learning. 

Ability to Make Impact – this place and your job really are what you make it. You have a set of goals and responsibilities but how you achieve those things can really be up to you.  This place wants independent thinkers, people who strive to make things better, will put themselves out there with ideas and have the drive to take on projects or improve how we are doing things. In my experience here, I really have seen this to be true. We are a growing firm with lots of change happening so it’s really an exciting time to be a part of this place and the opportunity to make an impact really is huge.","Work/life balance can be tough – I think because the people that work here are so passionate about what they do and this place, it can be difficult at times to maintain that work/life balance and go home when you know there is so much to be done. Over the years, I think I’ve for the most part been able to manage it OK (because I know there will always be tons to get done, but am comfortable prioritizing the things that have to be done and the stuff that can wait until tomorrow), but I’ve seen this as something many colleagues have struggled with."
378,,I can be myself,2014-02-07,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"I found my transition into Bridgewater surprisingly easy. Everyone talks about how unique and harsh the culture is, but the way of being at BW felt natural to me from the start... 
I have been there for 2+ years and I have found it to be a very liberating place to work.  Everyday I just walk in and be myself. I am not stressed about looking good (both figuratively and literally since you can wear what you want) or worried about office politics or what's going on behind closed doors. I just focus on doing my very best at my responsibilities and being open to the learning that comes along the way.  I always know where I stand on my performance because I get the feedback constantly.  I find by and large my colleagues to be of high integrity and  easy to get along with. And unlike other places, I know what management is talking about behind those closed doors bc they send out the tapes of it to everyone!  Its awesome to not have to fear about making mistakes or saying ""I don't know"" - just frees up your mindshare.  I can focus on how I can contribute and make impact without distractions that can come into play in more ""typical"" work environments.


Also a big plus for me and one of the reasons why I came to BW is the high standards that it maintains.  It doesn't mean that everything is perfect -  far from it ... but the place despises mediocrity and laziness.  It really is a place that wants to be excellent and acknowledges where it is isn't.  BW doesn't tolerate slackers or people who are just ""along for the ride"". Who really wants to work with those type of people?","There is not a lot flexibility re: telecommuting or flexible work arrangements which as a working mom would be a welcomed benefit. That being said I find that my managers and colleagues respect how I manage my time and there is no ""facetime"".  If you are explicit about your reality and limitations, people will be reasonable."
379,,A great place to start a career in investments,2014-02-05,5.0,Investment Associate,"Bridgewater hired me right out undergrad (where I was a Liberal Arts major) as an Investment Associate. I've been here for 3.5yrs. I'm really glad I came for the following reasons:
-I've found the culture really fulfilling - work with brilliant people who push me hard to get better, but care a lot about me. As a result, I think I've grown a lot here.
-The Investment Associate class - a nine month crash course on how to be an investor - was outstanding. Better (and harder) than any class I took at school.
-Even past the first year, strong focus on training and developing. ""Trading game"" is a good example of a training tool - Bridgewater will take the other side of any global macro trade you want to make (big or small), and your profit or losses comes out of your bonus - a great way to get your hands dirty in markets and testing your ideas.
-Work is hard, thought provoking, and interesting. I seem to be more challenged and stimulated by my work than my friendsw who pursued other careers (esp. banking and consulting).
-Great career opportunities. High ability to try out different roles to get different experiences.
-I work with really fun, cool people. Really like my co-workers and bosses.
-Lots of resources and willingness to experiment with good, innovative ideas. A place where you can be very entrepreneurial if you are able to do it.
-The set of clients and folks that pay attention to our research is impressive - you have the opportunity to influence the understanding of people who matter.
-People and policies are flexible and reasonable. Easy to go to the gym or a run the middle of the day.
-Beautiful office, in the middle of basically a forest and wetland.
-Great pay and benefits, particularly if you stick around for a few years.","-Biggest for me is location in Westport CT rather than NYC.
-Relatedly, Bridgewater's telecommuting options suck. In certain departments and role, you can't work from home without a (rare) exception for a particular project.
-Hours aren't great, though not banking bad. I average working about 9-9 M-Th, 9-5 Friday, and 2 hrs on weekends. (totaly of 55-60 hrs). Lots of flexibility though (Usually I can leave early no problem if I want to)
-For those who may want to switch careers within macro hedge funds, you got to wait a couple years (go to business school) due to non-compete agreement.
-I love the culture -but its not for anyone. With open feedback, you have to have a thick skin sometimes.
-Company facing growing pains related to a lot of new hiring over the last 4yrs, including inexperienced people bumping into eachother."
380,,"Great, challenging environment",2014-02-05,4.0,Facilities Manager,Great people. You will be pushed and challenged constantly to perform at your best. Very open and transparent environment.,"Tech infrastructure is outdated, making simple processes very time consuming."
381,,Exponential Personal Growth,2014-02-03,5.0,Candidate Lead Manager,"Because of my working at Bridgewater for the past almost 3 years, I am a better manager, better husband, better father and better goal achiever (to name a few).  I'm grateful that others who care about me have pushed me as hard as they have, I'm grateful that I'm in an environment where I can push others just as hard and I'm grateful that I've had the opportunity to intellectualize the company principles.

It’s amazing that someone like me who is overconfident, lazy and forgetful, who doesn’t plan well, who doesn’t think about the 2nd and 3rd order consequences of actions well, who has trouble with verbal communication, who is a narrow thinker and who struggles with really seeing things from other people’s perspectives (to name a few) can truly succeed at Bridgewater.  Why can this be the case?  For the simple fact that I know all of these things about me (and others know as well) and am working hard to ensure they are front of mind in every decision I make.  3 years ago I knew none of this.  I’ve learned how my ego (essentially making decisions to maximize for me looking good) inhibits me from getting to the truth and making progress.  I’ve learned that I make lots of bad decisions based on really bad assumptions (including assumptions I didn’t even know I was making).  I’ve developed a sickness to incompetence and desire not to accept it.

Whether or not you agree or disagree I strongly suggest (which I do so to all of my close friends and family) you read the company principles and get whatever benefit you can from their “self-help” nature.  Having reminders such as “make sure you realize what you are missing” and “make sure you consider whether the other person really knows what they are talking about” (to name just a couple and paraphrased in my words) should have immediate positive impact on you in both your professional and personal lives.  Ray recently articulated that Bridgewater’s way of being is “meaningful work and meaningful relationships through radical truth and radical transparency.”  Very accurate, very well said and in my opinion is at the core of why Bridgewater is unique and great.","Upsides far outweigh the downsides however it isn't without cons.  There is impact to my family in the sense that hours are longer than my work in a different industry prior (but less a function of Bridgewater and more a function of the financial services industry and my ability to deal with it well) and because of Bridgewater's high horsepower environment I'm usually pretty tired when I’m home and take a little while to unwind and recharge (again, these are likely more a function of my inability to deal well vs. a set expectation by management)."
382,,"Great experience, tough but rewarding",2013-12-20,4.0,Anonymous Employee,"Emphasis on firm culture which is based on being open and forthright with one another, smart/bright employees, great benefits, no surprises backstabbing etc., if you like the culture and like your day to day job no better place to be, above average pay","Not for everyone, read up on the company culture before you apply, long hours, systematic processes stifles innovation somewhat"
383,,True meritocracy; strong focus on talent development; no politics,2013-12-13,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"- True meritocracy -- Your scope of responsibility / success here is largely dependent on the impact and business outcomes you are capable of producing, not on how many years of experience you have or whether or not you've ""paid your dues"" in lower level analyst jobs if you've shown that you are capable of handling more. Really great environment for young professionals who want to grow fast and be at a firm who is willing to take bets on them.

- Ongoing focus on talent development and evolution -- I've been here for over 5 years, and have consistently gotten great coaching and mentorship from my managers. From what I've been able to tell from my friends' experiences at other companies across a variety of industries, the level of investment Bridgewaters puts into stretching and pushing its people is unparalleled.

- Surrounded by some of the smartest people I've ever met -- Every day is dynamic and challenging as a result. You're never really allowed to get away with lazy thinking, which has pushed the quality of my own thinking to improve vastly over the years.

- Refreshingly open culture -- You don't have to deal with BS office politics, you don't have to constantly wonder what your boss and peers think of you, and you're encouraged to fight for what you think is right. To be clear, all this means you have to put your ego / defensiveness to this side, and have to be openminded to the fact that what you think is right may not actually be right. A culture like this is definitely not for everyone, but it's fantastic for those who share these values.

- Strong community with deep caring and truly meaningful relationships.","- Biggest challenge for me has been that it's been hard for me to be able to step away from the intensity of the day-to-day to ensure that I am balancing all the other aspects of my life well. It's not actually an hours worked thing -- it's a being able to shut my mind off from the various threads going on at work thing, which I think is a combination of my own personality and the intensity/pace of working at BW (i.e., I am pretty sure I wouldn't have been able to advance to the role that I have today had I attacked my job less intensely). 

- Not a con for me personally, but the key thought that I can't emphasize enough for those who are considering applying to Bridgewater or are going through the interview process -- push hard to make sure you are getting an accurate picture of the culture and how things actually operate in the day-to-day. Ask lots of questions, etc. The culture is really fantastic for those who are looking for that type of experience and journey, but can be pretty unabashedly terrible for those who aren't."

- People:   Some of the most exceptional, talented people you'll ever meet have found their way to Bridgewater. Incredibly humble and authentic on the whole. Many seem to become lifelong relationships. You want to go to work everyday.

- Your Development:  There are prb few places - let alone corporate companies - on this planet that devote as many resources to understanding you and helping you develop. The open feedback and culture all drive to understand the truth about you and flush out both your strengths and weakness. The understanding is not judgement based - it's incredibly useful. If you are open to taking feedback, you can learn to guardrail against your weaknesses and amplify your strengths. Not criticism- real feedback . 

- Culture:   A unique place. A real meritocracy. Refreshing – no closed door conversations. You will see best practice management principles you read about in books, actually practiced here. Hyper logical, rational thinking. Clarity wins the day.


- Opportunities & Work:   The things you get to do will blow your mind.  From working with famous entrepreneurs , investors, and scientist to working on cutting edge problems. The  organization is adaptive and in a constant state of change. Which means you can have incredible impact. Not structured or run like a ""hedge fund"". More of an institution. Job assignment works on matching you (based on your unique ability profile) to the highest demand ""problems to solve.

About You
 
- You have to ask good questions, and learn to ask better ones

- If you don’t like confronting what you are really like / your ego, may not be the place for you

- May encounter very different principles than you've seen in your career. For example ""content less management"" (e.g. By and large, the idea management is a practice unto itself).

- It will take a little while to adapt, and then once you do, you’ll have a hard time working anywhere else. People who leave Bridgewater seem to miss it ( I know I do!)"
387,,Never a dull moment,2013-11-27,5.0,Senior Investment Associate,"I’ll try to add some color from my own experiences without rehashing too much of what others are saying:

-	As I titled it, never a dull moment. Virtually every day there is something fresh happening, something kooky to laugh at, new opportunities for impact or growth, or just good old fashioned camaraderie. I have basically never been bored at work and I have a ton of fun on a day-to-day basis.

-	If you want to understand markets, you aren’t going to find a better place for training. I don’t understand folks on this thread who say that they don’t have useful skills when they leave. Understanding markets and economies in a way that is both deep and practical isn’t useful? 

-	The part of the culture I like the best is the self-correcting nature of it. I find it deeply calming to know that when something dumb is happening to me (e.g. if I had an incompetent manager, or I am encountering bureaucracy) it is unlikely to persist, and that I am empowered to squash it. 

-	I actually put the work/life balance as a pro, though I do recognize I’m a bit of an outlier in that regard. I think many or most of the work/life balance issues people have here are self-imposed by their own personalities. I’ve been super clear with my managers that I am going to work 50 hours a week or a tick above as needed, and no one has had a problem with that in 6.5 years. Then I get in early M-F so my nights and weekends are wide open for family and hobbies.","-	If you bring the culture home, you need to do so with care. “Yes honey, now that you mention it, that dress does make you look fat.” Yikes.
 
-	My days, and by extension my career path, are not things that I could have predicted. I find that exciting and liberating. Others find that stressful and demoralizing. It’s a question of personal preference. 

-	Relative to many other employers, you may have higher highs and lower lows. Again, not necessarily a con, but it is for some. A few days after it happens, your mistakes are unbelievable learning tools if reflected on and examined objectively. In the moment when you realize the blunder and are getting lit up…that just isn’t fun, even if it is constructive. 

-	I think we have too many people. Until that gets resolved (and I believe it will), there will be some bureaucracy/bumping into each other."

- challenging environment that promotes rapid personal development: i've grown tremendously since working here in ways that have impacted both my professional and personal life, if i got nothing more than that from my experience working here, it would have been worth it. 
- caliber of people: have had the opportunity to work with extremely bright, conceptual individuals that have fascinating backgrounds, experiences, and perspectives.  
- community/meaningful relationships:  the community is very tight knit and i've developed some very strong relationships and wonderful relationships during my time here. There are many BW ppl - both current and former employees- that are a significant part of my/my husband's life.","- can be difficult to maintain work/life balance: it's a demanding environment and the hours can be long (but in my experience definitely not as long/bad compared to ibanking or other wall street options)
- nature of environment/challenges can be stressful: I am naturally a high anxiety person, so i've had my bouts of struggles with stress and anxiety while working here. It is intellectually demanding and the culture, while i love and appreciate it, can be difficult at times and i have to deliberately put in place mechanisms for myself to ensure i'm maintaining perspective and balancing emotions. 
- culture is not for everyone: you certain have to have a certain value set to work here, and i recognize and appreciate it's not for everyone. I've met fantastic people who just don't click with the culture."
389,,"Intense, challenging, and invigorating experience",2013-11-27,4.0,Investment Associate,"I'm a 22 year Investment Associate at Bridgewater-- my first job out of college. I also interned as a Management Associate during college, so have had the somewhat unique experience of operating in both roles. 

Pros:
- In my experience, the people have been hands down the best part of the job. I'm surrounded by a group that is incredibly smart, funny, willing to work hard, be challenged and have fun. A true community. 

- The firm encourages ""acting like an owner,"" and so there are real opportunities and freedom to shape things that are bad. I think this creates a pretty cool, entrepreneurial environment (despite the size of the company)

- There is a huge emphasis on personal/professional development at all levels, but I can speak best to the development of young Investment and Management Associates. I had weeks of intensive training before starting my job, I'm taking an investment class that spans the entire year, and get copious feedback on all aspects of my performance. People care enough about you and your trajectory to really invest the time to help you get better. 

- Interesting, challenging work. Throughout their time here, people assume as much responsibility as they can handle, so there's never a dull moment. And, if you are finding your work dull, you have the freedom to explore other opportunities within the firm.

- The little things rock: fully stocked kitchen, catered lunch, bussing from NYC to connecticut, gyms, beautiful offices, great benefits, business casual dress code","- The firm's culture calls for achieving excellence through radical honesty and transparency-- which means a lot of negative feedback. This can be really hard, and hurt sometimes. Intellectually, I think it's a good way to operate but that doesn't mean it's not a challenge. 

- There is very little racial or gender diversity among the Investment Associate community. The gender ratio among Investment Associates is very bad. While there are ongoing efforts to figure out why this is the case, as a woman, the atmosphere can feel very masculine and alienating at times. 

- The hours are long (not like investment banking, but not a 9-5 either), and the commute from NYC to Westport CT is long. Many people have two places-- one in Connecticut and one in the city for the weekends."
390,,"Very positive experience driven by a pursuit of excellence, thoughtful people, and an unorthodox but effective culture.",2013-11-26,5.0,Investment Associate,"-You work with a lot of truly exceptional people (intelligent, high bar for excellence, very thoughtful, sound judgment.)  This is really, really invigorating.
-If you are willing to go out and get it, there is nearly an unlimited opportunity for learning.  Feedback is sometimes harsh, but very often enlightening as a way to improve oneself.  Quite frankly, I think people telling you things you may not want to hear but will make you better is a damned good indication that they care about you and/or your learning.
-The culture is very strong and has a lot of benefits (and some issues, to be sure)... The bottom line is that without having worked here for a reasonable period of time, the culture will not make much sense because there is not sufficient context - There isn't enough space to explain it here.  What I will say is that I worked at BW for 5 yrs, have reasonable professional experience elsewhere, and consider myself well-adjusted.  I literally have no idea how some people can draw the conclusions that they are drawing.  You'll have people calling it crazy (I am an excellent bettor, and I'd bet that the majority of those people are likely either more emotional side of the spectrum [which is totally fine, just not something BW's culture is particularly tailored to], stubborn, or are just bitter because they were fired), which I think is a pretty unfair assessment and highly unlikely to be true given how effective the culture has been at (a) retaining a large number of employees that lasted past 12 months and (b) generated excellent investment outcomes for decades.
-The company parties are really fun.  The company goes all out, the event planning team is awesome, the younger employees aren't afraid to let loose, and even the more experienced people enjoy a good social atmosphere.  The peak of fun was 2007-2009, but I think the social scene is still fairly vibrant.
-The benefits and perks are certainly north of market.","-There are very, very, very few influential investment decision-makers (let's say 4-5 inner circle, and 5 more right outside that).   That's it.  If anyone says otherwise, they're lying. The bar for being one of these people is exceptionally high, and the path to get there is ill-defined and quite frankly, involves a fair bit of randomness (honestly, you need to be exceptionally sharp and conceptually gifted, but there is a right-place, right-time element to it.)  If this is what you want to be, you're fighting an uphill battle.  There are other rewarding roles at BW, but don't expect a seat at the table.  Plus, as the cream has risen to the top in the last few years, there is just a much smaller probability of getting to these roles.
-Compensation-wise, they certainly pay less than other hedge funds (their A-players get paid handsomely relative to everyone else, but even the A-level is less than other smaller shops), but at BW's size and with it's structure (analyst don't have their own books, P&L, or even individual investment ideas), that should be expected.  With that being said, they pay well, but I certainly would not put it in the ""pros"" as others have.  This comment applies only to investment professionals, as that is the only thing I have context for.
-Work/Life balance is tricky.  People work hard, but the experience is all-encompassing.  Most of my friends were BW people.  I didn't mind this, but over time, it became tough to escape work.  People liked their jobs generally, but there were ups and downs.  Social dinners involved talking about work ups and downs.  People knew how to talk to each other in the parlance that BWers often used.  The culture is great, but it is so hilariously easy to make fun of, so we did that too while we simultaneously appreciated it's value.  Like I said, a positive thing for me, but perhaps a negative for some.  Work is also really tough and intense usually, so I'd come home with my brain mush.  It was tough, but rewarding."

-Always being challenged (can be a pro and a con), since everything is held to a very rigorous level of logic and there's a huge focus on figuring out the best answer
-Huge investment in training and development for Investment Associates
-Find out things about yourself that you wouldn't in other environments (could be a pro or a con). At Bridgewater, everything is ""personal"" in that everything important ultimately has something to do with someone(s) who failed or succeeded at something. And we scrutinize those things to improve.
-Close-knit culture, especially among the Investment Associates but it's true generally - people here are friends and family, not just colleagues
-Rapidly changing company, across many dimensions - particularly management and leadership. So there's a lot of opportunity to have impact (though there's a flipside in that lots of change makes things more chaotic)","-Always being challenged - nothing is easy. Even small things that may not be that important are focused on. Lots of reinventing the wheel
-Still working out the management challenges around future leadership transition, things are changing rapidly and somewhat chaotic - e.g. lots of turnover in senior managers
-A bit of decision paralysis - too much decision-making is done by a handful of senior leaders who become a bottleneck. Middle management is mostly not empowered (some exceptions)
-Sometimes the culture can be exhausting - it takes a lot of energy to have difficult conversations about mistakes and what people are like, their strengths and weaknesses, at the level of depth and frequency that we do here
-Location. Westport is ~2 hours door-to-door travel if you live in downtown Manhattan
-Some areas of poor training and onboarding. Investment Associate training is great, but a lot of the rest still hasn't been worked out well"
392,,Never a Dull Moment,2013-11-07,4.0,Management Associate,"I'm a 23 year old Management Associate at Bridgewater, the first company for which I've worked out of college.  I was given great latitude after my first six months, managing a small team of three in the Real Estate department.  

Most of my friends at peer institutions sit behind computers, organize legal briefings, and draft up financial models on Excell.  I get to constantly interact with people, understand the way they think, help them better solve problems and, as a result, am appreciated for the work I produce.

Only a year and a half in, my experience at Bridgewater has taught me how to think practically and rationally.  And it's filled with some of the sharpest minds in the world.  This is not the place for someone interested in ""going through the motions.""  That type of mentality just doesn't fit in.","1)  The work is hard and the people are demanding (the firm is obsessed with doing everything excellently).  It's a painful place to work at times, and can feel extremely painful, if not downright ruthless, if you don't really understand/cannot connect to what the firm is trying to collectively accomplish (systematize the way decisions are made about people in the same way the firm has systematized the way decisions are made about the markets).

2)  While the Management Associate program is relatively new (compared to the Investment Associate position), there isn't yet a clear development trajectory for my position.

3)  Starting out, the content for my position can be hit-or-miss.  Though depending on one's talent (potential and track record), this shouldn't be an issue.  Bridgewater allows and encourages its top performers to freely explore opportunities working at some of the highest levels of the company."

Your career trajectory there is totally up to you - they do not have an analyst/associate/VP/MD ladder like other financial firms.  You must be assertive and open minded.  Speak up, and you will be judged on the merit of your contributions.","Bridgewater is struggling with leadership from its senior management.  They have attempted to bring in outside executives in recent years (not people who have ""grown up"" with the company, like their existing CIOs), and all have failed to uphold the extremely high standards set by the founder.

It is the weirdest thing I have ever experienced and wish for no one else to ever experience this. It's such a unprofessional atmosphere too... everyone cursing, commenting about other and talking about others negatively behind there backs (but people at Bridgewater call this 'triangulating'.. to act like they aren't gossiping... but it's the same thing!).

I joined Bridgewater when there were around 300 people.  Opportunities abounded and I was quickly promoted through the ranks, learned an incredible amount of skills, management experience and projects.  The compensation and benefits were fantastic and work life balance was steady.  Now at 1200 people that barely exists. There's still opportunities for growth but every few and far between now
If your right out of school, this is a place to learn skills.","The culture has become extreme that in some jobs 40% of the workload can be principle related making it impossible to keep up with getting the 'real' work done.  Therefore, working late at night and weekends.
The first principle 'trust in truth' is a joke.  Employees have to review each other, take polls at meetings via Ipad, place 'dots' on people via Ipad during interactions.  Backstabbing is the norm.  Manager's and employees whisper in the hallways which is unprincipled.  Feedback must be given to another persons face.  Mistakes must be issue logged and diagnosis sessions are held to probe into why you made the error.  The issue could be 'why did x not invite x to a meeting.'  Is this a good use of time?  
It's madness.  None of the managers' want to make a decision in case they have to go before the owner. to get reamed out and them have the recording sent to the whole company.  The owner feels it's a wonderful learning experience for all but I've found many of them to be completely humiliating.  Ego and emotions must be checked at the door but on tape, I've never seen anyone more emotional or egotistical than the owner.  He totally believes his company is operating fairly well culturally.  His principles are listed on the website.  Back in the days when he used the holistically, they worked well.
If you're an experienced hire, don't change companies.  I seen so many high level managers who believe they have what it takes but I've only seen one or two make it and both were down graded to different roles."

433,,Principled insanity...,2012-04-20,2.0,A Leverage,"The Money, the money...oh, and the also the money","Ray's, cult-like obsession with his principles creates a special form of corporate insanity that creates an environment ripe with paranoia...where the Bridgewater Principle Nazis inflict their own version of the final solution on a daily via issue logs and endless interrogating on principle trivia. 

Bullying, pettiness and insane focus on the totally unimportant is not only tolerated it's rewarded in the name of the principles. 

It doesn't take long for people to understand that the reason BW pays 2x the going market rate for ""talent"" is everyone that's smart enough to be hired there knows they're really being hired as a lab rat in Dalio's private Animal Farm."

Folks do not engage in pissing contests like you see in ibanking / on wall street.","Not too many negatives I can think of. It's a tough culture (open an honest, etc.) but if you are ok with constantly getting feedback, it's a cool place to grow."
