272,,Overall you will have opportunity to learn a lot,2021-09-14,3.0,Senior MEMBER TECHNICAL,Freshers are exposed to new technologies and given the liberty to choose in which domain they want to work.

275,,"A little slow and stuck in their old ways, but an amazing place to work",2021-09-10,5.0,Graduate Software Engineer,"Almost everyone else on my team had been there 10+ years so they were experts in their field and knew exactly how everything worked on their product(s).
My team and everyone else in the company was genuinely lovely to work with and always had time for me if I needed help.
The graduate starting salary is generous with equally generous pay increases every 6 months (usually a few thousand pounds).
35 hour work week.
Flexible working - As long as you were available between about 10am-4pm and put your hours in, Broadridge was happy. Whenever I needed a few hours off for doctor, dentist etc., there was never an issue.
WFH - I left before people were returning to the office, but the plan at the time was to let people choose where they wanted to work so you could be completely remote if you wanted to be.","The company is enormous and lots of their software has been around for at least 10-20 years with new features just bolted on. There were lots of buzz words in meetings about cloud platforms, Docker, microservices, and rewriting the code from the ground up, but change was slow because of the size and complexity of the software.
The graduate salary is the same for all graduate roles. This means that the money for more highly paid roles (like mine as a software developer) can start to lag behind what you'd get elsewhere. Most people get a bumper pay rise after their 3 year grad scheme ends though and I think the company are looking into changing this to stop people leaving.
I was only involved on 2 projects over the 2 and a half years I was there and it would have been nice to work in some different areas. My team had never had graduates before though and they did try to expose me to as much variety as possible; I'm sure they'll be better at this in the future as well. There was also the option to try a completely different role if you wanted to."

541,,"If you've been acquired by Broadridge, begin looking elsewhere",2021-03-01,2.0,Associate Software Engineer,"On paper, Broadridge is very prestigious and cares about many things other companies usually would overlook. E.g. they were named the ""Best Place to Work for LGBTQ Equality"" and ""Best Place to Work"" for a number of years now. This is for the most part true if you work for the central body of Broadridge.","If you do not work for the central body of Broadridge and have been acquired, you should look elsewhere because you get the expectations of a Broadridge employee but none of the care. 
Gradually after the acquisition, workload has slowly risen to where it is necessary to work 10+ hour a day in order to hit deadlines but there have been no other changes on the company's end. No changes to pay to meet the rest of Broadridge's pay scale, overtime pay is not taken in consideration, and no yearly raise to match inflation.
(Overall, the average starting salary for a software engineer for Broadridge on Glassdoor is very off for acquired employees.)
Let's even ignore the pay discrepancy problems; managers use a metric system that is not transparent. It is possible to have your team in good progress standing, finish all planned work on a current sprint, and begin working on items on the next sprint and still have ""slow velocity"".
The only real benefit that I've gotten so far is borrowing the company's title for my resume to apply elsewhere."

You can tell they truly care about their employees and their health. I also appreciate how our CEO Tim is very transparent with the organization and constantly keeps us informed on any updates or changes.

RSP matching is decent if you're willing to stick around for the duration.

Paycheque is usually on time.","Salary is Ok, but on the lower end for Software engineers (look elsewhere).

Convoluted overtime policy - designed as if it's an employee benefit. Makes it much harder to make up for the mediocre salary. Solution is to just stop working overtime and let them try to backfill your workload by hiring bums off the street.

Bottom-end workstations for developers. Doesn't even support a third monitor (no joke).

Parent company likes to gobble up smaller companies, reap the profits, and let the former company dwindle. A real headscratcher from my perspective, as they will likely get sued at some point for contractual negligence."

Production leads act like it is a burden to help you. The training is inconsistent and there is no actual training program in place. Mandatory overtime one week a month and two weeks per quarter. Holidays are required. Print jobs are not properly timed, and back up plans are not in place. Majority of day shift employees have been there years and are lazy. They spend most of their time on their phones or gossiping. Night shift is expected to meet unrealistic deadlines most days. Human Resources on site is useless. If you ask a question you are just given a phone number to call at corporate. Overtime you do work is back paid. Temporary employees are expected to work 50+ hours a week for $11 dollars an hour.

- Pay: it is absolutely trash unless you come from outside. If you're a graduate, look elsewhere. Pay rises are terrible. Then they will hire someone from outside with the same job role as you, and despite you having more experience and knowledge in BR, they will get a much higher salary. 

- Managers won't have your back. They will pretend to like you but will not hesitate to throw you under the bus to save their own necks.

- No self development opportunities. You're a slave at their mercy, especially if you're not caucasian.

- They claim to be 'Ready for Next', yet have no interest in investing in emerging markets. General managers don't have the balls to challenge this.

- Massive projects can come in, but no new staff to deliver them. They expect the same team to deliver the large projects even if it means working 7 days a week without pay."

The contracting firm, Accelerated Innovators, does not offer any type of benefits. They also told me over the phone that the contract was supposed to be 3-6 months prior to the interview. After landing the job, the contract length turned out to be 1 year. And to make matters worse, management tends to not convert members over to normal staff until AFTER two years, if not longer. They honestly expect degreed people to not only get paid 10K-15K less than your average associate, but they also expect you to do it without any benefits.
Management is shady. There are a lot of backroom dealings that directly impact the rank and file that don’t get properly discussed and there’s your good old boy that we like to call favoritism at play. One lady live filed a document to the SEC a week early and still has her job. That’s like going to a restaurant, ordering food, and having the cooks make your order and then throwing it in the trash while you watch.  Another lady got fired for being late and taking breaks (they really don’t want people taking breaks unless it is dead slow, as if they do not know that labor laws are a thing). However, everyone is family! Also, it takes people 5-8 years in order to get a promotion. Weeeee. 
Overall, this job wasn’t the worst job I’ve had but it needs a lot of improvements. I also got fired because I was looking for another job and didn’t wish to immediately switch my shift from the overnight shift to the second shift in order to fill the seat of the lady that got fired for being late because I had scheduled some interviews and couldn’t reschedule. And the kicker is that my boss didn’t call or email me. She had the temp agency let me know that I was terminated. 
Keep it classy."

I’ve been informally told that promotions are limited as well as how much you can receive in a raise. This can be frustrating at times, but if you’re comfortable with a slow and steady rise, it works.

Flexible work arrangement 

Employed

Better commute","I still can’t believe I resigned from my prior employer to assume the responsibilities tasked on the team I’m currently on. 

Stay away from Operations; Note this review is based on the team I currently work on and not the company. Let’s first address that once you leave the office in the evening you’re expected to complete your assigned task if not finished during your leisure. This is a red flag.  You’re essentially overworked with no time for yourself.

Management & Peers over step their boundaries and will micro manage you and your duties. 

Sneaky culture that is filled with folks who like to assert their power and presence; dog eat dog mentatilty plus condescending approach.

Salary provided is low comparable to the work load remember how I mention you take the work home with you so you’re working overtime and it’s exempt. 

Undervalued and not acknowledged for the work performed.


So I truly regret leaving my previous employment for a place that makes you miserable.  Note to those seeking employment here, please make sure you join the right team but there is no way of knowing unless you do an externship and it is there you’ll know."

1039,,Don't join. Never ever join. Worst company,2018-07-06,1.0,Anonymous Employee,May few other projects have very little pros in Broadridge except the project called ICS. ICS is totally a waste project.,"1. Higher management executive VP, VP are very bad in processional, complete unethical behaviour, too much money minded and cost cutting fellows.
2. You may get a chance to work in cutting edge technologies but you never be in a position to learn even single concept due to the hight pressure and push from onsite coordinator
3. Company is totally onsite coordinator centric not a employee centric. Higher management people in India never support you and they won't question onsite counter parts for their  literature behaviour.
4. You will not get the Individual credit or identity for the task accomplishment. For any success counter part onky will receive appreciation mails
5. Very bad about money, totally cost cutting company.
6. Project lead or manager never provides shift allowance or comp off for the production deployment night support. And they never provide food also. This because of VP and associate VP's influences, higher management is too concerned about the money and don't want to spend upon employee.
7. You have to work in alternate weekends for supporting their application (applicable to most of the teams) and you should be available to support production deployment over night time in any day(weekend or weekdays).
8. For these support and all, company never provide any kind allowance and if you take comp off for this work then you will get escalation from VP.
9. Personal mobile is not allowed in work area as it is finance based industry
10. You will not be recognised for the work you done
11. Company doesn't know the meaning of process and process management like other MNC do.
12. No SLA for any of the employees request like form 16 request other payroll related stuff and hr  stuffs
13. Completely unprofessional attitude with higher management people. There are lot of scenarios those I can't really describe it here
14. No work life balance at all. For the weekend support whenever you receive auto failure mail you have to fix it even if it's a night time.
15. I am from development background but still weekend support and production support are applicable for all developers. There is no dedicated team available for these processes. Here itself you can understand how the company worst in process and how they are doing cost cutting
16. Never see culture in company."

Where do I start.. 

Poor Management; lack direction and too focused on his own workload and not the betterment of his team or improving team morale.. ignore emails

No camaraderie;  the focus is rather on helping themselves get ahead and no helping you as they don’t want to feel their job is being compromised if they do because at the end of the day they need their job

Very Sneaky, gossipy (men ""talk"" more than the ladies) and cliquey culture 

Selective; nepotism is rampant 

Turnover in department due to all of the above plus impromptu lay offs

A little of advice to those seeking to join;  The grass is not always greener wish I had stayed with my previous employer as coming here was a BIG mistake.  Had another offer but opted for this team due to a higher pay.. translation BIG mistake. A Glassdoor reviewer within once said before you accept the offer know what you’re getting into.. And their statement rings true dependent on the team you join.  While employed with previous employer knew my work backwards and had job security. And emails or pings were never ignored if seeking assistance from my manager and/or peers. 

In retro, BIG mistake, so Now looking for suitable employment before I either quit or get terminated.."

The policy changes from person to person though, some people can take liberties whilst others can't.","Probably the worst London HR team in all of my 30+ year career (and I have been in many big companies!). HR team in London does not care at all about the wellbeing of its staff members. They are ruthless, arrogant, and I have often heard one of the senior people in HR making very inappropriate remarks.

Even people in HR have recently left, as the team is not run to maintain the wellbeing of its staff, but instead are only there to protect the senior mangers. If you are a senior, they will respond to you. The rest of the staff, they talk down to you and are not interested. Many people leave with the same excuses, but they do nothing to keep its staff - probably because they want to get rid of people to outsource to India, and instead of giving redundancy packages, they make work conditions awful so people leave. There is also nobody else to complain to, as they run the show. 

Do not even consider joining this company in London (I don't know what it is like in US, but I hear it's even worse in India)."

And there was a very distinct message to no longer do things the way we did them when we were ADP. While I appreciate we were now a different company, if something, like a process, for example is not broken, why change it. Especially when there were so many other things we could and should have focused on. Changes in senior management causes a lot of stress and after working there for over 20 years, it was made clear I was no longer appreciated and was moved into a new role. That move was made by someone who lasted barely a year! It’s unfortunate as I loved what I did."

1227,,Nothing positive.,2017-05-30,1.0,Quality Supervisor,The only good that I can say about this experience is that after 12 years in the United States Marine Corps I can say that Broad Ridge showed me what bad management was. I now have an example of everything not to do when managing employees. If there is anyone who wants to compare good and bad leadership and organization this company prvoides a perfect example of the latter.,"- Work life balance is horrible. The company tries to promote a sense of family among employees that creates favoritism. 
- Compensation for the amount of work performed and responsibilities held is not reflective. 
- Management is incompetent and reactive instead of proactive. 
- Intra-office politics and relationships take priority ability and/or position. 
- Management was incompetent when it came to basic quality and compliance standards. A lot of illegal practices occur. If you are brave enough to point them out you are told ""this is how we have always done things"" and/or fired. 
- A great deal of fraternization between associates, supervisors, and managers. 
- Employees are promoted based on personal relationships and not ability. Therefore most of the leadership is not knowledgeable.
- High turnover rate and little to no standardized training. 
- Temporary employees are hired and fired cyclically.  Temporary employees are told that they have no say and no rights because they are ""just temps"" and can be replaced. They are treated badly by Broadridge employees and belittled by management."

1235,,Operations Associate,2017-05-13,2.0,Anonymous Employee,"This company has so much potential.  Lots of smart people on every level & a hard-working group of people.  I'm a big fan of my team & know there are tons of intelligent people in this department.  I do believe that most people have the best intentions to succeed here & help others.  With a new platform, bringing in new clients & smoothing out processes should be much easier than previously.

A lot of the time, you feel you're all working towards a common goal.  It's a rapidly growing company & the people here have a lot of pride in the work they do.  Although it's a decently high stress environment, we try as much as we can to enjoy each other's company with smaller happy hours & larger department dinners & barbeques.","The current platform & system is atrocious.  Problems nearly every day which the technology team fixes by putting bandaids on a boat leak.  Management could care less about the people below them as long as numbers are hit & their clients are satisfied.  Staying late is a necessity if you have any chance of advancing, which is nearly none.

The pay grade is on the lower scale for an operations position, although benefits are decent (not great though).  Management expects you to do the work of multiple people, & when you go above & beyond for them they take credit for it.  There is little room to grow.   They hire management positions from the outside instead of promoting from within. There are plenty of misfit toys who are incredibly smart people but are merely here because they can't find anything better.
The people who do get promoted from within  are either connected to senior management in some capacity or work so many hours during the week management has no choice but promote them.

As previously mentioned, the pay structure is ridiculously rigid.  You get one bonus per year, regardless of performance, & a ""raise"" that's a slap in the face if you actually work hard.  Raises & promotions are hard to come by, & this department falls into the ""penny smart, pound foolish"" crowd."

Over the past few years, the company has grown significantly in size. Broadridge spends cash to acquire companies, but it is widely known (internally) that they are poor at integrating them. Shock typically sets in within a year as weakly executed integrations begin with unrelenting urgency to hit arbitrary dates on misdirected projects steered by power hungry mongers supported by blind upper management… and those projects will ultimately be scrapped and recycled by those mongers into ‘new’ ideas and projects to restart the cycle again. There should be cycling classes for folks to spin their wheels there, literally and figuratively. The truth is that many people have become disenchanted and just do what they need to keep their job. As the company has grown by acquisitions, upper managers are unable to keep up connections with associates, so they rely on insight from fat cats in the old boys club to convince themselves they know what’s going on. Just keep it hidden from the clients.  If you’re a lucky associate, your manager is in the boys club or connected with one of the boys AND supports you, otherwise forget it.

Ineffective management and hostile working environment: 

The nature of working for Broadridge is volatile by design. During the ""proxy season,"" which takes place between January and May, temporary workers will be hired to assist the full-time staff with their responsibilities. Despite this, work is overflowing during this time due to a lack of foresight by those responsible for hiring. During your interview you will be hired based solely on your ability to proofread documents, there isn't even a test of any sort. If your resume has an English or writing degree on it then they will most likely accept you immediately. Getting a job at Broadridge is not the difficult part, it is keeping the desire to want the job that is. 

Like many places, Broadridge management has a problem when it comes to separating personal with professional. As a contracted, temporary worker you will bear witness to loud chatter, inappropriate sexual relationships and disruptive practices that bring the personal lives of each co-worker and manager to the professional setting. You will later witness management act on these established bonds with the workers under them, giving special treatment to those they tend to get along with out of office hours. 

Blame is often placed on the most vulnerable workers in the department, in this case it was the temporary, contracted workers. Effort is not made to improve productivity, mistakes are bottled up for weeks at a time and dispensed all at once during group meetings where accountability falls on a team (such as ""the temps"") and not on any one person. This creates an environment where those that purposely do not do their work are on the same level with those that put in a level of extra effort to make up for that decline. Workers are unable to improve their own methods and practices because criticism is rarely constructive. 

Other complaints:

As many as 7 Temporary workers are stuffed into a small, non-ventilated room where heat quickly builds up due to the use of computers. To remedy this, a small fan may be given to the workers to share among themselves. 

As a worker you will receive conflicting instructions from managers in different areas. This can lead to confusion and a lack in productivity. 

Creation of documents to be proofread are often constructed first by workers who cannot speak fluent English (some from India and some on-site), which lowers productivity for the entire department."
1329,,Associate,2016-08-10,1.0,Senior Associate,"The best Pro I can say, is I will never refer this company to anyone...if you want to sell your soul, then this is the place for you.  Pros of having a turnstile of employees is what makes this company still prevail.","I can't list the amount of cons.  Way too many.  Not speaking as a former employee only. But speaking the truth! Lack of career opportunities, low wage, horrible benefits, and poor work/life balance to name a few.  The ""superiors"" expect you to do the work of 5 people and when you do accomplish that.  Now they asking you to do work for 10 people. While giving you zero raises and cheap incentives.

2. Minimize your basic salary so that employer doesn’t have to submit the high PF every month for every employee.
3. Make freshers sign the bond for 3 years as the HR is sure that they will leave in 3 months after realizing the true culture and work.
4. Give a part of your CTC as coupons so that BR don’t have to pay taxes to govt. and get these meal coupons for themselves at discounted rate.
5. Take more than twice of the MRP of small items such as keys, cards whenever lost in office.
6. Give a part of your salary as allowances so that in appraisal even if the basic is increased by 10%, net salary will only increase by 5%.
7. Give a minimum amount of Planned Leave to collect for an employee so that employer has to pay only the minimum basic amount for limited leaves.
8. Take 5000 off from your salary whenever you unintentionally bring the phone inside office.
9. Keep the notice period to maximum time with no buyout clause so that they do not receive that minimum basic amount whenever employee tries to leave early and they get the maximum benefit out of an employee.
10. BR will make you purchase a phone from the company and get the same on discounted rate so that they can earn upto Rs. 1000 from each employee."

There were also a number of opportunities to network with fellow coworkers.,"There aren't too many cons I can think of. One con was that it took a few weeks for everything to get set and organized.

Office location is the other.,"Bully managers have no ability to lead because they are too focused on their own growth and stepping on others to achieve success. It's almost a guarantee they will never have looked at your resume.

They only hire out of India. Canada jobs are few and far between. Sub par workers mean unsatisfied clients.

Upper management is located in the US. There is 0 visibility to your manager's manager. No effort is made to get to know teams in other cities and there are no opportunities to raise concerns about managers to their own manager. They have 0 interest.

They will keep someone in the same low level position because they want to make themselves look superior. They don't realize that growing and promoting their team will look good on them. They will tell you you're ""too junior"" to take on higher level work that you ask to do. There is no progression and there are no opportunites 

They will force you to change personal performance appraisals. They will intentionally rate you lower in order to give you less of a bonus payment.

They have no respect for anyone who commutes and will ask people to move closer to the office (without offering a pay increase or promotion) and will prevent certain people with the ability to work remotely. This has nothing to do with job title or function, it's based on the whim of these so-called managers. Management has 0 respect for work/life balance.

Management often screams and yells on phonecalls while at their desks. I have never seen such unprofessional behaviour in my life. You will feel like you're at a daycare, not an office.

They will tell you not to wear headphones or speak to others. When they see relationships being formed amongst colleagues they feel threatened instead of recognizing the opportunity for growth and teamwork.

They will speak negatively about you to others and will be passive aggressive towards you. They talk behind your back insulting your abilities and will ask others to deliver messages, never wanting to appear to be the bad guy.

They will lie to you and make up pretend job titles to prevent you from asking for promotions or raises. Then they will change your job title to something that has no meaning whatsoever. When you question it you will be ignored by HR. You will still be paid at the same level as your previous job title.

They will ask fellow colleagues to rate your work 5+ years into a job to prove you aren't capable when they never truly knew what your job function was in the first place. Certain people are not meant to manage certain types of roles.

They will try to humiliate you by making ridiculous edits to your work; they don't trust you as the expert. You will eventually get so fed up you will send their own writing back to them. They will edit their own words without realizing it. 

They will request you do menial tasks and invite you to meetings only to take minutes when your role was never secretarial. 

Raising concens to HR will do nothing. They do not protect workers."

Smart phones, storage devices, white papers, blue line papers(for taking prints for internal use within work area only) are strictly prohibited. If at all if you are caught with any of them, then you will be fined minimum of ₹5000, no explanations are entertained, just be prepared that your next salary would be deducted by 5k.

12% variable pay(bonus in terms of company's terms) that is paid annually. Don't expect 100% variable pay on your first year in the company. 

Come early to get your self a parking slot for your 4 wheeler, if not park some where outside and ready to pay challan to traffic police. Some of my colleagues pay as much as ₹700 per week as challan by parking outside.

I don't know who designed the employee policies here, but who ever it is, he/she is very clever. Easy to get in but not so easy to get out. If you decide to leave the company, either you should leave your an annual hike or your variable pay or some times both. 

Forget about annual hike on completion of your 1st year in the company.

There is so called team fund under each manger. Working on weekends? Late nights? Pizza party by your manager? Whatever may be the occasion, every thing is utilized from team fund. So hope that your team would be left with some amount enough for a team outing or at least a team lunch/dinner(this for sure :)).

Want to take a print out. Wait you cannot use printers inside work area. Don't worry there is a common printer outside work area for the entire Broadridge campus, only hope that there are blank papers available, or the cartridge has enough ink, and at the end the printer is working :).

Cafeteria. Forget about it. There is only one service provider for your lunch/dinner. Like it or not just adjust with it or get your own box. Going to have your lunch along with your team? You need to wait for tables to be available. Too small cafeteria that you will not get a free table without waiting during peak hours (1-2pm)"

Ability to work from home.
Lots of different roles to move into.
If you want to learn Indian, this is a great company to do so.","Upper management is clueless.
Worked at the company for over ten years.  Was laid off in lieu of outsourced jobs.
Pretty much anyone with more than 10 years of experience was laid off.  Too expensive to keep those employees in the eyes of the management.
They keep completely inept managers.
All aspects of the company are being outsourced.
Unless you are Indian, you will not have a future at the company.
Very outdated platform.  Technologically speaking, close to ten years behind the industry.
You will not learn any cutting edge technology.
When your job is outsourced, you will have a hard time finding a job because the technology is so outdated.
If you happen to have a position that requires on-call, be prepared to be called 24/7, even if you are on vacation.
As long as you are a ""Yes-man,"" you will go far in management.
They do not want any creative opinions.  Very much a ""that is the way we have always done it"" mentality.
Very low salary.
They keep preaching one of the best places to work.  That only applies to one office in NJ, not the company as a whole."

Too low paying for client service jobs when it's more than your average customer service position and you need to know about the financial world.
Some department managers allowed to be constant blockades in getting fixes out for clients.  Upper mgmt. doesn't seem to know how to deal with problematic people like this and instead ignore their actions which allows things to progress to worse scenarios.
All talk about moving to newer technologies but not everyone gets to share in the changes.  Some training occurs for tech departments but you are not always allowed to use what you have learned.  A waste of company money and department resources if they aren't going to be able to apply what they have learned, even if it's just a prototype.

Employees are largely back office drones and senior levels are achieved through joining the senior clique by saying but not necessarily delivering the right things. It's a sort of commune. The company would love to grow but has no idea how to do that as there is an intellectual deficit across senior levels. Because people earn promotions by being liked rather than through ability there are no management skills and subordinates will not be supported unless they seek to be liked too. Anyone who actually has ability and looks to disrupt the safety of the seniors positions will be discarded.

Great Senior management that cares about its employees","Intimidating middle-management who could care less about there employees, lousy pay as well"
1747,,Good Employer,2012-11-26,4.0,Anonymous Employee,The company has personal development programs to help you achieve personal goals in your career.  Also there is a lot of recognition.,"The payroll department is pretty bad with making mistakes, so you have to keep an eye on your electronic pay stubs.  Also perks such as tuition reimbursement and gym reimbursement are outsourced, and there are lots of problems with them."

If you stay long enough chances are you'll get promoted to manager.","Tied down with bureaucratic systems, quality of co-workers highly variable. Company doesn't spend a lot of time actually trying to do anything innovative. Sometimes employees try to do something innovative but company is a hinderance to that. Doesn't pay very well for the financial industry, so tends to lose employees to clients (who pay better)."

Great immediate supervisor.,"Many talented people unappreciated and let go.  Too much micro-managing.  Unfortunately you are only a HEAD to corporate.  Senior management lay off too many talented people.  Only care about sales people, not the operations associates who are the backbone of the department."

Software is old and does not satisfy the needs of the users, technology leaders throw up roadblocks and do not support their business owners. The head of IT is only focused on passing his audits and has an entire staff dedicated to scouring forms to ensure check boxes are checked without regard to any other content. Senior leaders worry more about their audit scores than doing their real job.  New products are announced to the street that don't exist ."
1756,,"On the whole, it was okay.",2012-09-14,3.0,Member Technical,Financial domain knowledge does help.  It is a good place to learn about financial markets. Finding a back office job in an investment bank after you work here is easy and fruitful too.,"On the other hand, work gets menial and repetitive for most people after about 2-3 years.Middle level management is quite bad. Compensation benefits are not so great."
1757,,This is one of the better companies I have worked for.,2012-09-05,4.0,Director,"Broadridge tries to maintain awareness of your family and the work/life balance, they stress their values openly as opposed to simply posting them on a website, and they continually express appreciation to employees for the success of the company.","Salaries at Broadridge tend to be lower on average.  Although they encourage mobility within the company, politics among senior management sometimes thwarts it."

With great measures of security. Contributes towards society through MVF...",Training process is not that satisfactory
1759,,A dependable company that looks after their staff,2012-08-21,5.0,Sales,The company looks after its people and treats them fairly for their contribution. It has global presence and a wide range of customers and solutions within financial services. They are well respected and have a good reputation.,The range of products and solutions that the company offers varies greatly depending on the country. There is a greater presence in North America than internationally and some overlap of solutions.

It is a market leader in its core business.,Initial salary packages low as compared to industry. They have vertical hierarchy rather than Flat structure that makes things complicated.
1764,,Average company,2012-07-02,3.0,,"Good people (most). I always found someone who was willing to help or give guidance on different projects, or what someone really meant when they said something in a  meeting (we had a lot of double talkers at the sales organization)","A lot of double talk, primarily by senior management."
1765,,Horrendous,2012-06-29,1.0,Senior Director,"Great people in E2, dress down two days a week,  and free bagels 2 times a week. Good location, decent compensation.","IT uses bureaucratic nonsense to avoid delivering!  Fill out this form. No,not this form, that form, Didn't check the box. Go directly to jail and don't collect $200.  Chalk one up for the auditor who caught it  This is demoralizing to the work force that want to work hard and support the their business partners.  What used to take 10 minutes to do now take 3 days. 

Senior management does not support the masses. Senior management from E1 have no respect for anyone from E2.  If it's not Proxy nobody cares

Management knows the economy is bad and uses it to abuse the work force.(""Yes it's wrong but where are they going to go"" is a common saying used by Executive Management). 

Too many H1 workers!  Americans are capable and can write .NET & JAVA as well as foreign H1 workers!  

Penny pinching demands from the big shot (don't fly / drive,  no blackberry for people that need them) while they spend thousands on  fancy ""business/ personal"" dinners, useless ""seminars"",

 IT has too much power. They need to understand that they work for the business who works for the client and that you both work for the shareholder. Revenue is how you grow and without clients there will be no revenue. Support your business unit (even if you don't like them or like the products they are selling).."

You stick to your designation as long as you dont approach the management, ( like who cares!).

Work life balance is not uniformly distributed across the organization, some teams balance and many dont (rather cant, they say that is how the business runs)

This company provides a great work vs. life balance.  Ability to work from home on occasion is a big plus.,"Due to the large corporate structure, promotions appear difficult to come by.  Bumps in pay are also relegated to the standard 3% increases year in and year out.

- Supportive teams. The people that end up working here will face the same challenges you do. As a result, they sort of band together sometimes, and have each other's backs.","- Poor management. Lack of ethics.
- As many others have stated, it is a bit ""cliquey"". If you are not in the ""in-crowd"", advancement is impossible. It does not matter how great your ideas are, what you accomplished, what you have done for the company, how committed you are, or how well you did your job. If you are not part of the group, try hard as you might to reach the sky, you will never even see it. Favoritism plays a large part in this.
- The pay and position title is low and does not represent what you actually do. 
- Workload can be extreme for the pay.
- Workload is not distributed properly between employees (read above).
- It is possible and common to have responsibilities above your position/pay grade, but to be denied advancement/pay.
- Often, they will seek a new employee instead of promoting from within (with experienced employees).
- You may be required to train new employees that are hired at a position that is 2-3 levels above you. Ridiculous, because if you have the knowledge and ability, you should be put in that position. 
- H/R is not particularly supportive of employees.
- Although the company is very diverse, the diversity ends once you hit any of the supervisory/management levels.
- Because of this, extraordinary talent is lost all of the time. 
- Ineffective employees are often advanced, much to the detriment of the departments, and other employees."

1785,,An Ideal Employer,2011-12-11,4.0,Project Manager,"After working for years on Wall Street with other big firms, Broadridge made me an offer as a full-time employee.  The money was great.  I was also enticed by the benefits.

After working at the firm for several weeks, I can say that this is a diamond in the rough.  It'd be best for you to get in here soon, before more people catch on!

- The people at this firm are not political.
- The IT resources that I've dealt with are FIVE TIMES BETTER than their ""counterparts"" at my previous employers.  As a Project Manager, I don't need to nag or bug my resources to do things.  At most, I just have to remind them.  This leaves me with the time and energy I need to dedicate to the strategic direction of my project.  It's very refreshing to be able to act as a Project Manager, rather than a babysitter.
- The ""unofficial"" benefits of this firm are innumerable.  Broadridge, SO FAR, seems to be incredibly understanding of the differences among its employees and their family/personal situations.  Many people work from home once or twice a week.  Also, if you are a responsible employee, they are more than willing to negotiate a later arrival time (9 am is standard; but several people in my group have young children and thus they cannot make it to work before 9:40).
- They don't do any of the obnoxious things I was subjected to on Wall Street - they don't print out my  long distance phone calls to my mother (I only call her from my work phone 1/weeks, but at my previous employer, I got a talking to for a 13 minute phone call to my mother in her hospital room immediately after she got out of surgery). 
- To make a long story short, YOU MUST do your work - it's def not a place for under-achievers.  BUT...if you are able to perform your job well - and you need flexibility - they are the BEST!!!

I really like it here.  I can't believe I wasted so much time working for those male chauvinists on Wall Street!","- the cafeteria
