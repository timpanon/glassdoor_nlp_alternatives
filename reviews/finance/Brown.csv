1,,Negative Experience,2022-04-12,1.0,Anonymous Employee,Colleagues are great. Decent work life balance.,Partners have put employees through extreme stress. Senior leadership shows minimal empathy towards employees. True colors have shown this past year. Partner's interest is only in money and clients. Employees always come last.
2,,Still operating like it’s the 90’s,2022-04-12,1.0,Vice President,None come to mind. Even WLB has gone down drastically.,"WLB, Technology, Not enough people, Toxic culture, constantly fighting change. Endless amounts of presentation decks, no standardization anywhere. Morale is virtually gone and people are promoted based on tenure, rather than if they are actually capable of doing the job. They hire from the same pools of candidates and there is no diversity.

It’s a mess that is constantly being mopped up with no finish line in sight…"

13,,Great Company in Transition,2022-04-02,5.0,Vice President,The people are fantastic. There is a culture of inclusivity that happens seemingly naturally because they hire good people. There are high levels of mutual respect exhibited throughout the company.,"The company is going through a very big transition, and it feels like things are standing still until the State Street transaction is completed. Employees moving to State Street seem upset to be leaving BBH. Employees staying at BBH seem eager to put the challenges of this transition behind them. Management and leadership does seem to understand the challenges of being in transition, and they have offered many resources for people as this unfolds."
14,,Compliance,2022-04-01,5.0,Vice President,Excellent team and culture; supportive senior management,Salary can be below market
15,,Close this deal sooner rather than later,2022-03-30,1.0,Supervisor,WFH but who doesn't still?,"Low pay, work increasing, morale plummeting."
16,,Once a great place but now on it's way out,2022-03-29,2.0,Vice President,"None that I can think of. They market their ""culture"" as being collegial and collaborative but it's only a façade...

It's as toxic as one could imagine. People back stab, withhold information and encourage their colleagues to jump through hoops for no apparent reason other than the enjoyment of seeing you fail.

The only pro that comes to mind is WLB and what is left of it...","Where do I begin... Low/Terrible pay, Virtually NO onboarding or training and they essentially throw you into the job for you to figure it out yourself. There are some good teams/people here but they are a scarce bunch. Don't bother looking for a career here unless you have an Ivy league education...

Most managers have no idea how to manage people and are set in their ways. Legacy employees constantly fight change and instead of moving with the times are always going against it..."

26,,Flexible Hours Low Pay,2022-03-14,2.0,Risk Management,Flexible work hours. Internal mobility. Competitive 401K.,Little to no pay increase for promotions
27,,Mediocre at almost everything,2022-03-13,2.0,Anonymous Employee,"- Annual Bonus + Profit Sharing bonus (up to 15% of gross annual pay in my case) - not all companies do that. (PS. May no longer apply after the merger with State Street).
- Annual merit increases. I didn't even had to ask. They just are. Very nice, thank you.
- Good office location in Krakow. Easy to get there by public transport.","- Pretty much every experience I had in this company from onboarding to my exit interview was a mediocre experience. In the end they send you a survey with like 30 open questions but you only have 20 mins to finish it because it has session timer :) If you miss it you have to start over, because nobody in many years have bothered checking if maybe adding a 'Save for Later' button would make sense. This is just a small example of many annoyances you'll have to face there. Technically everything is there, but when you start digging you'll find silly things everywhere.

- I had this monthly report that I had to do. It could be easily automated and I wanted to do that, but the tools I had were insufficient. So I wanted to have installed a free and opensource software for it. Nope - you can't have it, because the Application Support team keeps track of who has what in Excel and they don't want to track singe users with custom software. I had to do that stupid report manually every single month for 3 years...

- Some managers there are like 70 years old. I don't mean to be disrespectful, but their willingness to try new things is non existant. They also like to micromanage things a lot. Resistance is futile.

- Their technology stack is outdated by like 10 years at least.

- Do you like working with agile methodologies? Scrum maybe? Forget it. Apart from maybe devs in FinTech you are going to work with waterfall at the way.

- Monumental bureaucracy almost everywhere. I wanted to order a small travel wireless mouse, because by default they only give you a regular size USB mouse, and I wanted something pocket size for conference room surfing (I hate the touchpads on Thinkpads :). I kid you not - I had to wait like 2 weeks,  and it had to be approved by management 3 levels above me. In the end it was denied without explanation and I had to go buy one in a local computer store. True story.

- The merger with State Street had killed pretty much all my projects over night because of organisational uncertainties of how things will be run in the future. After that I've quit because I had nothing more to do at this point.

- A lot of pointless trainings. 

- The Krakow office is just an endless ocean of cubicles. No privacy whatsoever. 

- The formal dress code is stupid. Nobody ever comes down there so why bother?

- BONUS - in all my proffessional career I've never encountered a company that had such a horribly implemented VPN for employees. For 3 years noone was able to diagnose why my VPN works like 30% of time. Timeouts, random errors, problems with sessions etc. In fact at one point I even had my laptop swapped for a new one and I had the same issue. And no it wasn't my bad Internet. It just sucked. Bonkers :)"

They are very proud of their 200 year partnership *yawn*",Toxic and poor mid and senior level 'managers' with hidden agendas. The partners are a joke. Nepotism and favoritism is very common. Veryyy olddd school mentality and soooo slowwww with anything innovative. State Street acquisition. High risk of burnout due to toxic work conditions and mental health suffers. This once reputable firm is now pretty much a complete embarrassment and has been going downhill for years.

63,,Not a place for a long term career,2021-12-09,2.0,Corporate Actions Analyst,"- the firm has good name recognition, so it’s a decent resume builder
- they hire anyone with a pulse, so it’s a good starter job to leverage your way into a more analytical finance role at another firm
- people are generally friendly
- work life balance is normally fine but cyclical
- opportunities to update processes and workflows to your liking","- not a place to make a career, mostly a starter job
- embarrassingly low pay, rare promotions
- take on more responsibilities without getting any raises or promotions
- extremely high turnover, you’ll constantly be training a new guy (my entire team turned over twice during a 1 year period )
- operations roles are not analytical at all and are mostly button pushing, which gets boring
- my role required tons of manual excel sheet manipulation where small errors led to large financial loss for clients. Technological support for these processes was severely lacking (so much automation needed)"
64,,Great company,2021-12-07,5.0,Supervisor,Flat structure great company to work for.,None that I can confirm
65,,Great place to work,2021-12-03,5.0,Investor On Boarding Representative,"Management are very knowledgeable and will give junior staff a lot of time in explaining things and helping staff with their workloads.

Flexible working schedules.

Overall the people here are very nice.

Office is nice and modern, gym subsidised canteen etc.",Work life balance could be better at times but is this is expected in this industry.
66,,DO NOT TAKE THIS JOB,2021-12-02,1.0,Senior Client Account Manager,The pro is that you work for a finance company regardless of background. I doubt things change after the merger with State Street. Only pro is you could work here for a months and leave to get a firm on your resume.,"OVERWORKED. I worked here for almost five years and have nothing to show for it. They do not care about you or your personal life. If you take this job out of college be prepared be here for at least five years making well below industry standards. Sure you will get promoted once or twice but even the promotions come with disrespectful pay raises. The difference between account managers, senior account managers and supervisors is minimal and the pay shows it as well. As a financial firm they have it down to a science to nickel and dime the employees. Outside of pay be prepared to do everyone elses job on top of your own. You will become someones lacky at somepoint whether that be clients, advisor, or coworkers. Pressure from managers to get thing done outside of what your technically authorized to do. Senior managers are so far removed from the actual day to day process they think everything is fine when the entire staff is drowning in an endless sea of emails. To make up for it you will get a random pizza party for a morale boost. If thats your thing then this job is for you! As the years went on high turnover became a common occurrence. The young ambitious college students smartened up and left for a job that will actually pay them. I cannot stress this enough look elsewhere if your applying, especially for any account manager positions."
67,,Very operational work(my time here was before the state street deal),2021-12-01,3.0,Corporate Actions Specialist,"For recent grads- If you grind(and yes processing corporate actions is a grind) out 2 years this can be the begining of a path to a better job in finance. You can leverage the knowlege you gained of the custodian banking world as a way to move to a asset manager (or other better jobs)
- The people here are usually good people","Very low pay

284,,Red flags everywhere,2021-01-02,2.0,Anonymous Employee,"There are some really, really good people and peers that work at BBH (however, be wary of ""Lifers"" who are stuck in their old ways and do not embrace new ways of thinking). Pay and benefits are reasonable if you negotiate (stand firm). Remote work is supported during pandemics.","This company offers some of the most uninspiring and cringeworthy management I've ever witnessed. Any excitement, sense of team and trust, or morale that I've often experienced with past ventures is squashed by the infamous personality traits of the dark triad seemingly encouraged by the culture here (narcissism, Machiavellianism, and psychopathy). Ah, good ol'BBH. *sigh*

I noticed several red flags early on at this company, but was hopeful they wouldn't amount to anything. ""Hope"", it's a nice sounding word isn't it? They will take someone fresh (maybe you) and wear them down to the point of mental/emotional exhaustion and apathy, and then literally laugh in your face. To put it another way, your soul will receive a full dose of novocaine for every day you're there. If you decide to work here, be very aware of the snide, spiteful underbelly of the culture; they depend on a fragile foundation of optics, brown-nosing, lip service, gossip, and false promises to cover their hinds and instill fear tactics - it's pathetic.

What's frustrating through my observations are that long term strategies or roadmaps (if they even exist) are not shared with project teams; it could be compared to a secret black box that managers hide behind to mask their incompetencies while still promoting a false sense of power and accomplishment (i.e., job security and information hoarding that cannot ever be questioned by worker bees). There is also no professional development or even support for it (managers avoid or flat out ignore that conversation when asked). So, imagine ... new employees are coming onboard and then are guessing about how to do their jobs correctly, never knowing any better. Everyone works in silos and there is hardly any sharing of information to get work completed seamlessly. Short-sightedness, firedrills, and checking-the-box is the norm here (any type of process improvement or innovation is hindered by firedrills). Performance reviews? Let me tell you this, no one on my entire team has even been recommended for a promotion, let alone receive one, since I've been here. Oh, and profit sharing is non-existent (false promise example).

Listen, if you're okay with checking-the-box, no innovation, and having most every process tied to email requests, Word templates, and Excel spreadsheets, this is a fine place for you. If you're all about giving hairy eyeballs when someone leaves to grab a coffee and you enjoy being treated like a 4th grader with your peers, sign up now. If you're content with never being recognized for hard, quality work and meaningful team accomplishments that add value to the organization, then this is your place. If you're comfortable with your manager never relinquishing control, micromanaging, stepping all over you and your work, causing you to lose the feeling of autonomy, ownership, and pride in what you do everyday ... well then, come work here and you'll be below average and miserable along with the rest of them. There is too much else to live for than this place.

Fortunately, a silver lining to all of this is that BBH has taught me how not to behave when managing people and projects. I encourage anyone who believes that they have an ounce of self worth to explore other options; this place WILL drag you through the mud and gravel, but it will also make you realize what's most important to you in your career and in your life when you finally decide to leave. I wish good luck to you."

Comp is NOT competitive but it could be construed as fair.","Lets first identify a few of the values BBH posts on Glassdoor:
- A collaborative environment that enables you to step outside your role to add value wherever you can
- Opportunities to grow your expertise, take on new challenges, and reinvent yourself without leaving the firm
- A culture of inclusion that values each employee’s unique perspective
- Rewarding work with the flexibility to enjoy personal and family experiences at every career stage

The culture at BBH is nonexistent. A quick look at the top of the food chain shows a diversity that is nothing more than old white men (40 just at the top; not including all the reporting lines branching out) running your traditional private bank while pretending to be a technology forward firm. They pretend to be connected by conducting ""manager reviews"" however there is zero accountability or lessons learned which in turn leads to a management structure of lackluster performance and intolerance to opinions and ideas to better the working environment. [I.E. Your manager can work from home, but you will not be afforded the same professional courtesy.  Your manager will call out sick, but you will need to cause a widespread epidemic and still won't be told to go home and rest. Your manager will sit on their phone 8 hours a day having no insight into your daily work, but you will find out about their concerns 12 months later when you get your review with surprising revelations. Lets not forget the horrible treatment of consultants, the workhorses/SMEs of the company, and yet they can't even attend a town hall. Without them, there is no tech forward company. Sure, you can continue sending SWIFT messages via fax if you'd like. But you will be overtaken by blockchain in a blink of an eye.] 

Opportunities?! You will be stepping into a highly political arena the moment you speak with HR. They represent the partners of the firm, NOT you or any employee. Your 'opportunistic' promotion will not be merit based (most likely lateral). It will however be based on how involved you become with making your managers manager look good (again, not merit based). Frankly, it will be based on the golf course or bar. This all assumes that your manager is proactive because without that you won't even be a contender in the ring. There are non-officers in the bank with 10+ years merely because they have terrible representation. It's sad and pathetic as there is no accountability on behalf of management for any sort of standardization across business lines so it self propagates failure. [This doesn't even address merit increases. Don't expect loyalty to pay the bills. If you want a raise, plan to quit, unless you are thick skinned and can deal with management literally laughing in your face.]

One would think critical listening at a firm with the 'prestige' like BBH would be inherent. No one listens, but they can DEFINITELY talk...and talk...zzzzzzzzz. If you want a large sample size of individuals who are so narcissistic that only their own voice gets them through each day. Here's the place. 
There is little to no collaboration, it's a top down fed process.
You will not reinvent yourself; they went the way of SME/single contributor approach years ago. However to move around they expect a broad skill set (btw, no relevant class based/otj training beyond entry level). Which is why they can't fill many positions internally.
It should be clear by now that the culture is not inclusive. It's a brutally punishing grind and those that are left to pick up the pieces do so with less staff, disgruntled workers/managers, zero budget, long(er) hours, and zero recognition. 
I would like to believe that most people would try to find work rewarding. You can do your work to the best of your abilities, strive to inform management of change or opportunities to thrive, or challenge and implement enhancements to processes, but the recognition factor is saved for a select few. It's unrewarding and thankless."
374,,Sitting in Limbo,2020-02-12,3.0,Operations Specialist,"Good people, good place to learn, good first place to work.","Huge turnover mostly due to lack of compensation. Raises less than inflation on ""non-promotion"" years. No clear answer on questions like ""what should I be working towards"" or ""where can I expect to see myself in 5 years if I keep working hard"". Fact of the matter is senior management is well aware of the culture and environment they have created, resorting heavily on contract employees to cut costs and deal with high turnover when stuck in a pinch. No one sticks around because the comp is well below market standards to begin with. Anyone working here longer than two years should plan on being here for 5+ before seeing any sort of promotion, raise, etc. It's easy work and most teams are overstaffed, so if you like to be comfortable, this is your place."

Most companies focus on and prioritize #2. Then when #1 comes around, they completely botch it and leave the employee with a terrible last impression of the company.

 #1 will tell you a lot more about what kind of leadership a company has. 

And, if done right and respectfully, #1 should also lead to more referrals. This company has zero referrals from former employees, speaks volumes."

Trade management department is awful- the floor is lifeless, you are practically tied to your desk counting your how often you’ve gone pee for fear of appearing to take too many breaks. There is little organized training and nothing academic/ comprehensive. The managers take little to no interest in the people they manage, rarely expressing appreciation or offering any kind of encouragement.  New employees arrive  and are escorted to their cubicles  and introduced to one or two people on their team, but nobody else in the office. The environment is so stiff that people don’t attempt to introduce themselves to new employees; so new employees go weeks and months without knowing the names of people sitting less than an 10 feet from them.
Of course, there are nice people throughout the department, but the management sets such a poor tone and offers so few opportunities for interaction that you wouldn’t know it.  High turnover for young employees (no surprise there)"

They have strong ethic and belief in what they do. The blablas and debriefs are pleasing. Somehow it survived the 200 years and there's a tradition and stories to hear here.","What you hear on town halls has nothing to do with how the work looks like. It is like there are two separate worlds - one of the senior management and one which is real. Operational teams are overwhelmed with work. It's like they want to maintain small and elite company, but at the same time want to do everything. Small teams of few people are asked to do several very different jobs at once. Including non-operational work, because there are not enough people in projects, information management, network management etc to do everything a bank needs to do. Managers of these teams are steamrolled to do everything, know everything and oversee everything. Every new business, new regulation, new system or new control just brings more and more work. Old work doesn't go away because they never have money for investing in automation or never care to challenge processes that were there for 20+ years.  Even if you are persistent enough to finally bring your idea to someone who is decision maker, they won't care because they are high enough to have no clue about what you are doing. Besides, every idea is about ROI - never about quality of life. Even if they introduce a new system that only adds more work - because they invested in it, they will want to cut the headcount. Some teams are on the verge of imploding and people are massively leaving because they can't stand it anymore. And when teams lose someone experienced and need to onboard a new hire, it gets even worse and the cycle continues. And one could think if you have a specialist that works several different jobs at once, and at the same time is required to provide exceptional client service and manage multiple risk controls because that's what we do, that specialist and their manager would be paid way above market standards to compensate for all of that. Well, jokes on you. They pay as little as they can, then wonder why new people aren't accepting the offers or why the attrition. And try ever mentioning to the high management that maybe it's because of the salaries - they will look at you as if you cursed out their mom and say it must be everyone's fault (teams not caring about new hires, managers not knowing how to handle interviews etc.) but definitely NOT the salaries. How it still stands it is a mystery - must be thanks to the very loyal core employees in each division. But now it looks far worse than few years ago and it really feels like a suicide watch."

There is so much dead weight and incompetency (including the managers) within this company. 
It is a job, don't let anyone try to convince you that you are special or a promotion is around the corner.  Do your work, keep your head down and pretend that you are friends with everyone.
You will not receive any financial licensing or certifications - the upper management prefers that the employees are so under qualified so they don't have to pay them more.

522,,Control Freaks,2017-11-27,3.0,Associate,"Job is stable, especially if you don't lack skills and engagement. Managament is generally approachable. People are nice in general. If you like to matter just to feel better, you can matter here more than in other companies.","Something wrong is going on here recently. It is turning into a control-freak enviroment, where half of your work is actually controlling your own work, controlling your team's work, controlling other teams' work, checking external emails, double checking external emails, checking internal emails, check lists, check lists for check lists, reports for check lists, maker-checker, reports for maker-checker... People have no time to do their work properly because of all the controls in place, staff is so distracted that it's leading to even more mistakes so they introduce more controls thinking it is going to help. And even a single random mistake of some guy on the other half of the globe will lead to even stronger controls for completely unrelated groups, just because why not. Not to mention teams are already too small for the job they are asked to do, if they want to do it properly with all the distractions. 
While they expect staff to be ultimately perfect and giving superior client service, they give little in return - compensation falls below market average, and their philosophy is to ""compensate"" you with more responsible and engaging work, which of course turns quickly from ""we respect and trust you"" to ""we demand from you so deal with it"". In the end, you will be long gray-haired or depressed until you finally see some money - but with the responsibility you have, you would probably find a better paid in the market anyway. 
They love talking a lot though, making the illusion of company culture where people want to collaborate with each other and everyone is happy. They are so serious about it that if a voluntary afterwork event doesn't attract too many people they will make managers quietly force people to attend just to create appearence that people care and are engaged. Some even had their managers addressing it on evaluation reviews that they do not attend any voluntary events. 
So in short - overcontrolled environment, demanding a lot from people but beside good word from the management here and there not giving much in return. Teams are too small for the job they do, constant staffing cuts and shuffles going hand in hand with increasing responsibilities and additional tasks. It can only last so long until it all collapses."

Management are very friendly, and it is quite stable once you are hired.","The company is still a little old on giving employees the opportunity to learn new operations and technology. It is a little slow on advancing technology, operations and workflows. You will not gain anything out of this company if you were to look for other opportunities. Everyone in the company are too relax and won't want to learn new things, take your opinions or ideas to improve the process. Don't hope you will make a name for yourself in the company, it have to dedicate your life, try your very best to stay close to well known management to stand out and get promoted to something you want. Many companies who interview you will find that your skills are a joke coming out from this company. They don't practice or have standard level like PMP or CBAP. To be honest, none of the departments don't follow the PMP, SCRUM, Agile, ITIL, CBAP standard, which is going to hurt you when you try to apply for another position for another role. 

Pay percentage is very low, the same goes for bonuses. No matter what you do to save the company money, you will just get a title instead of a pay raise."

You can get promoted regardless of time with the company. There are some very smart people that you will encounter along the way and ample learning opportunities.","The two biggest problems are the benefits and technology.

As a smaller private company, they have not invested in technology like the bigger banks. There are way too many issues when dealing with systems and all of the new platforms being used. They are a decade behind the technology you will find at other banks and it is frustrating.

Base salary will be generally lower than similar positions are other banks. Bonus will be higher (sometimes significantly higher). However, the main issues are benefits. If you come from one of the bigger banks like JPM or Citi, etc., you are used to 401k match 100% up to 6% (with vesting in a few years), excellent healthcare, perks and discounts (i.e., gym memberships). Here they match 50% up to 6% (5 full years required to fully vest), the worst healthcare you will ever encounter in your career (Expect to pay hundreds/thousands for ANYTHING. Don't ever go see a specialist for anything. You have been warned), and hardly any useful perks/discounts on anything (e.g. Equinox costs $205 for all access currently in NYC.

672,,"Temp to Perm - Awful Management, Broken Promises",2016-03-14,2.0,Fund Accountant,"There will be a few things I will miss as I am leaving BBH for another employer. One - my fellow employees were great, willing to help and answer questions, we became like a small family. Two - the atmosphere is usually very peaceful and the office space was quiet and modern. Three - the balance was pretty good but you can quickly get sucked into work, you will need to be accountable for your own balance and learn to say no. I have seen too many employees take on more work than needed to without any recognition or pay increases.","The main reason I am writing this review is to provide some incite into what can happen inside the big banks. I was originally hired as temp to perm, with my manager promising I would be perm in 3 months. I worked hard, had no complaints or negative reviews and everything was going well. Within 3 months my manager told me I was able to go perm and submitted my paperwork. One month later still nothing had progress and I asked at least three times a week what the status was. They repeatedly told me to be patient and that it would happen - they just didn't know when. Around that time (now I have been a temp for 4 months), my manager was let go. Panicked, I asked the new manager who was under the associate that left what was happening to my paper work - he said to be patient and he would ask, always letting me know that he did talk to upper management. Fast forward 7 months, I accepted an offer from another place with a similar job. I told that junior level manager and he came out and said ""can we out bet the salary on the other position"". Shocked! I can't believe that now when I am leaving they want to keep me on permanently, so I entertained the thought. They offer me 17% less than my soon to be employer and 2% less for a bonus. I immediately said no for several reasons being that who knows if this promise will happen and being that I would be valued anywhere else and i don't feel that at BBH. Working as a temp for 7 months when my contract was 3 is ridiculous,"

If you're semi-competent, you can exert minimal effort to accomplish your daily list of monotonous tasks.  If you're incompetent or just lazy, don't fear either because it is nearly impossible to get canned and there is plenty of room to hide.  There's also plenty of downtime for lunch strolls and mid-day gym trips. The Boston office is nice.  Plenty of conference rooms to schedule phone interviews.","Dead end job.  Late hours and had to work all major US holidays. 

The ceiling is extremely low since there is minimal churn in middle and upper management. Leaving was the best decision I could have made. Doubled my comp and can actually stay awake at mt new job.  At BBH I had received 3 promotions in 4 years and still only made $50k in my last year there, complete joke for the industry. At one point Iwas making less than one of my subordinates who had transferred in from a shuttered department. Not exactly motivating.

Now that BBH has adopted the assembly line approach, it is no longer the preferred stop on the Boston custody/fund accounting carousel.  JPM and State Street are eating BBH's lunch by paying more to attract fed-up BBHers.

Most people are taught how to do a few tasks and not why they are doing those tasks. Information is thus silo'd among few individuals who actually know what is going on.  Everything is done by email. Most of the day is spent checking the 500 emails you are CC'd on to see if you need to act on any of them.

System is basically a giant patch and crashes all the time.  Consequently, blood pressures rise as deadlines approach and senior managers start their code red alarm drills.  Clients are often sold various lines of bs if/when deadlines are missed including blaming other vendors.

Minimal skills gained after 1st six months aside from doing your job as efficiently as possible.

The ""BBH"" culture kool-aid is laughable. Every group and every department t has a completely different feel.  The CSG teams act like they are important while the NavHub group does most of the work.  Partners and senior managers are in their own world."

Access to know worldwide clients who have been around for decades","1. Low compensation. BBH does not offer a competitive salary like other banks. The bonuses are discretionary and less than 10% of your salary. Many of my coworkers did not get a bonus after working long (60) hours and weekends the previous year.  


There was a recent college graduate who worked there part time as a consultant for almost 2 years making $17 per hour until she was able to receive a full time offer of 40K. I also met another employee who was making 80k + 10% bonus after 16 years of employment at BBH. 


If you get laid off, there is not a severance package unless you work for the firm for at least 2 years. The employer’s matching contribution to your 401k is not fully vested unless you work for the firm at least 5 years, otherwise BBH will remove the funds from your brokerage fidelity account. If you are stuck at work after 8pm, the firm won’t even buy you pizza or pay for a cab to take you home. 


2. Long hours: 8:30 to 7pm on slow days.

 
3. No room to grow. If you want to move up, you will need to be there for many years and getting a promotion is unusual. Old employees are frustrated and hate their daily routine because they have been stuck in the same role for years. If your boss hates her/his job, it will be very difficult for you to succeed. 


4. High turnover. During employment there, almost 24 months, I saw at least twenty people either get laid off, fired or quit voluntarily. BBH specializes in hiring temporary employees, “consultants”, at low wages and maybe one out of fifty get full-time direct employment. This way the company avoids providing other benefits, such as health and dental care, 401k, etc. I met many ex-employees who confirmed that BBH was not a good place to work. Every employee makes mistakes on a daily basis since most individuals are new and do not know what they are doing due to the high turnover and the long time that it takes to train people.


5. Poor management. The managers there lack managerial skills and cannot communicate effectively. Some of them did not even go to college but they have been there for many years. My manager acted like a puppy dog willing to do whatever for her boss. There is so much unnecessary politics since BBH is the oldest private bank. 


6. Hostile conservative work environment. The managers set you up in many ways so you make mistakes and they have evidence in case they want to get rid of you later. My last six months there I was put under so much pressure because my boss needed to use an excuse to get rid of me. She would say one thing and the team leader the opposite. Do not trust anyone in management because they will stab you in the back in order to keep their job and be part of the boss gang. If you suggest an improvement using technology that your boss is not familiar with, you will be ignored because they do not like change. 


7. Break/vacation requests often denied. In 2014, I was denied four vacation requests and ended up carrying over 10 days. Unfortunately, I could not attend important family events. During the Thanksgiving and Christmas holidays, my boss told us that no one was going to be able to take those days off including her. Once the day came, she did not show up and sent an email that she was going to be working remotely. I worked almost every holiday in 2013 and 2014. Another issue was taking regular breaks. Most coworkers ate lunch at their desks to avoid conflicts with our boss. If you wanted to go out, you were expected to be back in less than half an hour, which was impossible since you have to wait for the elevators. I sent an email to HR and complained, but never got a response.  


8. Old technology. BBH uses trading systems from the late 70s. Imagine placing trades upwards of $1 billion in a system like Microsoft command dos. It was so easy to make errors. Unfortunately, BBH is known for having customized systems to meet their clients’ needs. This exposes you to learning weak internal manual controls and simple procedures that will not help you in your next job."

The company has long maintained that its people are valued; but that was under the old partnership.  With the new wave of MBA/Lean Six-Sigma leadership, people are now only valued at a certain price.  This is why many positions are being off-shored to Krakow and good people are leaving in droves."

In reality they provide NO room for advancement to those young European graduates and offer pennies for which it is hard to make it through the month. 
- In the meantime their bunch of awfully wealthy top managers who create legends around themselves make deals with companies such as Fidelity, which are supposed to wisely invest people's money to secure their retirement, but when the time to collect it comes, not only do we have to wait to get it back long times as if they were doing us a favor, but they steal the large cut of the profit. Far too large. It serves  the unethical ""woolfs of wall street"" of our times and therefore, it is just a part of the global  financial speculation in  which the wealthy get wealthier and the poor move numbers from one excel spreadsheet to another to make it all possible. 
- With its excellent customer service BBH serves banks that make international purchases that are damaging to developing economies and again, they are partially responsible for the massive global gap between the rich and the poor.

- Some of the employees are very intelligent, dynamic and talented.  I have had the opportunity to work with experts making significant contributions in their line of expertise. 
- Good vacation policy for employees who are officers and above.
- Strong corporate social responsibility program.  The firm is truly committed to 'giving back' to the community and encouraging volunteerism ... it's one of BBH's best qualities which is deeply felt across all levels of the organization.  
- Company reputation and name recognition within the financial services industry.","- Compensation is insulting; raises, when they occur, are negligible.  Compensation lags behind other firms and the gap continues to increase. 
- The culture is changing and morale is very low within most areas of the firm.  Outsourcing, near-shoring, excessive cost-cutting, increasing workloads (combined with insufficient staff to cope with responsibilities) and lack of honest communication regarding the firm's strategy is driving high turnover rates.  The firm continues to tout itself as a dynamic, private company with a strong commitment to its employees, yet the actions of the company mirror the large global custodians.  It's sad to publicly admit that BBH is no longer what it purports to be - a firm with a unique approach to the industry that is special because of its privately owned structure, caring partnership, dynamic culture, highly skilled staff and insistence on thought leadership and service excellence above all else.  
- Fired many life-long 'BBHers' to achieve cost savings. 
- Review process and promotion opportunities are not transparent or fair.  There are many employees in middle management who do not perform well as individuals and fail to adequately develop staff and manage both resources and priorities.  On the flip side, there are also many employees who are not recognized and rewarded appropriately for their performance and contributions to the firm.

- Good perks
- Company has deep pockets to get latest tech","- Pl. understand that BBH is at it's core a custodian & fund accounting company (the other businesses are not growing). And Custody is not a competitive industry. There are only few banks in the market and barrier to entry/change is huge. So you can continue to be bad and still make money in this business.

- Since it is a old company, the company is divided into fiefdoms rules by satraps (bosses). Each Satrap is virtually a king in his domain and is usually surrounded by sycophants.

- To win the race (i..e Partner) you don't have to be absolutely the best, you just need to be tad better than the second guy. And since most people here suck, the bar is pretty low to get ahead.

- As an example, consider a regular project which should not take more than 6 months to complete. In BBH it will first goto an incompetent boss who will be unable to deliver that in 2 years. Since it's not a competitive industry, no harm done.  They will manage to find a manager who will deliver in 14 months and who will become a star that's the level of competency here.

- Unless you are in sycophant circle, anything you say or do is academic.

- People who are independent minded, don't want to kiss ass, generally want to try new things, take pride in their work, have intelligence - pl. stay way.

Rule of thumb - if there is no incentive to change people won't change and that's true for BBH."

High turnover is also a problem.  The biggest issue I saw at the company during my last few years was extremely low morale among the other workers.  Hiring freezes and high turnover caused everyone doing the work of several people while not getting compensated to do so.

Get to work with a notable company in OppenheimerFunds. 

Decent pay relative to other back office companies. 

Basic and constant hours. 

Is not intellectually challenging.","The company neither rewards exceptional work nor punishes over subpar work. The expectation is that each employee puts in a ""C"" effort and gets recognized as such. This is exemplified by the expectation that you work 40 and only 40 hours a week. Putting in more than 40 hours to finish tasks is not recognized as good practice - they would rather things get left undone. 

No recognition for hard work. Again, the expectation is a pedestrian work pace through your 8 hour day. Creating efficiencies or new best practices have to be approved by upper management after a gauntlet testing phase. The preference is to just ""follow procedures"" and existing protocol. 

No long term growth. When looking at candidates, the person who has been at the company the longest will get the position over the candidate who is more qualified. This creates a bottle neck at the top with very little room for career growth (in regards to responsibility, salary, etc) over the near term. This leads to the next point: HR rules the company. This is the only company I have worked for where the needs of managers gets trumped by HR (see above). A very frustrating atmosphere knowing your growth is tied to HR practices not your personal aptitude. 

Morale? Move along. You will find none at this company. Temps, low personal development, and little recognition make it hard to stay positive. Translates to an exceptionally high turnover rate. 

Is not Intellectually challenging. Recent grads work hard for their degrees and are looking for a challenging job. This job is nothing but following written procedures and clicking your mouse all day. Hard to go from the stimulating atmosphere of college to shutting your mind off each morning when walking through the doors. 

My advice if you are looking for entry level work out of college is to keep looking for new opportunities. This is very far from the investment decision process and is not investment banking. You can find something better! I promise you!"

They also use these ""anonymous"" surveys to go after managers.  So if there's a disgruntled employee in your area....look out.   They are currently outsourcing tons of jobs to Poland, so I'm sure there will be more stateside job elimination in the not to distant future.  They have already terminated over 200 employees since January 1, 2013.  The performance review system is a joke and is easily and often manipulated to get the desired end result.  They are strict believers in the Bell Curve, so if they don't have the correct percentage of people in the lower tier...again...look out.

With all the effort, I never complained and never asked for more until I felt I was ready.  When I was, I was shunned a promotion for not doing the things management felt should have done, rather than what I had accomplished.

- Pl. understand that BBH is a custodian & fund accounting co (the other businesses are not growing).  Custody by it's nature is not a competitive industry.  There are only few players in the market and barrier to entry/change is huge.  So you can keep sucking and still make money in this business,
- Since it is a old company, the company is divided into fiefdoms rules by satraps.  Each Satrap is virtually a king in his domain and is usually surrounded by sycophants.
- To win the race you don't have to be absolutely the best, you just need to be tad better than the second guy.  And since most people here suck, the bar is pretty low to get ahead.
- A normal project which should not take more 6 months, the sucky Satrap will be unable to deliver that in 2 years, the Satrap who will deliver in 14 months will become a star that's the level of competency here.
- Unless you are in sycophant circle, anything you say or do is academic.
- People who are independent minded, don't want to kiss ass, generally want to try new things, take pride in their work, have intelligence - pl. stay way.

Time off is granted almost all of the time.","Tomes could be written and still not cover all of the downsides of working at BBH. 
I will inclue the most glaring reasons.
The majority of employee dissatisfaction (for new hires) stems from BBH's archaic and ultra-conservative hiring practices. 
To put it simply, they do not hire permanently. Oh, yes, you will be told that if you ""work hard and impress your supervisor"" you will be granted a permanent position.This is an outright fallacy and one that severely affects employee morale. No benefits, no vacation, no sick days, no personal days. Outrageous. It makes people who are in this position want nothing but to leave, and it affects the day to day in many different areas of the bank in a very negative way. 

Other areas that BBH could stand to improve go all the way up to the top. There are supervisors and VP's who literally don't know (or care to know) the names of the people they work with every single day. This divide is off-putting to say the least.

There is little chance for upward growth within the bank. Lateral moves are common but the encouragement of growth is not evident. 

Pay for temps is low especially considering that you will receive 0 benefits of any kind.

The HR department couldn't be bothered by temp requests for new opportunities. Who could blame them? The turnover rate is through the roof, if somebody isn't happy, they figure they will leave and a new mark will fill the spot without haste, and they are correct."

Staff turnover is astronomical especially with temps, employee performance reviews are not efficient - annual ratings, promotions depend on ""peer assesment""  and ""who you know"" in the company than on the real job and skills employees are performing day to day. A lot of competent employees are not appreciated for their potential and commitment and are trapped with their career prospects so it is not a place for ambitious and skilled individual. In the same time company underline its interest in talent acquisition and talent management. Many line managers/supervisors lack of leadership and management skills and do not understand the true meaning of partnership if it comes to their relations with employees. You will be surprised with lack of professional knowledge of managers/frontline supervisors in their related field of profession, and you will be wondering how come this person got promoted to that level.You can end up working for Peter Principle who is also greedy to take a credit for his/her employees work done. Isn't it scary that incompetent person can decide about performance of highly skilled employee? Dirty office politics in business units is a part of day to day business practice and has nothing to do with the ""unique culture"" of partnership and ""open door policy"".

Client service is falling steadily as the bank will not admit to the grandiose failure the India outsource project is and continues to accept sub par accuracy on their behalf.  Majority of managers are not suited to lead.  I have found that most may be knowledgable in accurately completing team responsibilities, their ability to manage is non-existing.  New employees are treated with a disposable attitude.  To cope with high turnover, new and even temporary employees train their own replacements taking the burden off management.  Everyone is miserable except for managers at associate level and up.  It's too bad that the company is spiraling down as fast as it is as there is a large motivated talent pool waiting for the chance to lead the company prosperously into the future."
