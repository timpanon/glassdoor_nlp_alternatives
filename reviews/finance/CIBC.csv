For example, if you bring $ 5 million new business into your book and $ 10 million mortgages get paid off or transfer out from your book, you are net sales is minus $5million !

667,,Great job at a mediocre bank,2021-10-26,3.0,Mobile Investment Consultant,"- MICs have a flexible schedule.

- Decent overall compensation potential.

- All the perks that come along with being a bank employee (free banking, preferred lending rates, share ownership plan, group RRSPs, pension plan, health and dental benefits, corporate discounts, etc.).

- Bank supports continuing education. Employees can advance their education and achieve certain accreditations if they aspire to do so.

- Commission can be earned for involvement in selling various products (bank accounts, credit cards, mortgages, etc.).

- Many great front line employees, colleagues.

- Low level managers are generally very good, especially considering the BS they have to endure from those above them

- All-around competitive product offerings and client-facing systems are very good. This is helpful when trying to acquire clients' investment business.","- Truly awful leadership at mid to upper levels. I could write a book about how this bank is mismanaged. They always talk about ""purpose"" but it's obvious that the words of leadership ring hollow.

- It's clear that shareholder interests trump everything else.

- Employees are constantly scrutinized and treated as untrustworthy.

- Commission levels are pitiful compared to similar positions at other institutions. This is largely due to the implementation of the meagre base salary that the bank uses as justification for asking MICs to perform tasks that are not really a function of the role. The bank fully expects MICs to convert internal funds to managed, shut the back door on assets leaving for other institutions, build and deepen client relationships, perform client outreach, be active within the community, and much more, all without any pay or recognition whatsoever for these activities.

- Atrocious validation process and guidelines for commission pay. Leaves MICs feeling like the bank is purposely trying to avoid paying us. 

- Convoluted compensation plan that does not align with how the bank wants MICs to perform their job and deliberately excludes the vast majority of MICs from achieving maximum bonus levels, even if they achieve plan.

- MICs receive no compensation for converting internal deposits to highly-profitable managed solutions with a 30 day window for what is considered eligible new assets. No compensation for funds transferred from Simplii. $2M cap on total new assets per client. Limit of 24 months for new assets per Imperial Service client.... the list of conditions is seemingly endless. If a rule to deny you compensation for an unusual situation doesn't exist, they'll create a rule to deny you.

- Management is seemingly determined to convert the MIC channel into a telemarketing channel by incessantly harping about leads-actioning, completely oblivious to the fact the leads they provide are unimaginably bad with zero potential. Management has demonstrated total ignorance regarding how MICs are truly effective and how they acquire business.

- Technology and IT systems are the worst in the entire industry. It's impossible to overstate how dysfunctional, disjointed, unreliable, outdated and unintuitive the technology is here. Even the hardware and peripherals in banking centres are ancient by modern standards. 
CIBC intranet and Sharepoint are resource-heavy but incredibly cumbersome, difficult to navigate and loaded with outdated and/or irrelevant content. Search functions desperately need improving. 
(The Asset Management portion of SharePoint is a highlight but even that could be organized better).

- Backend processes are riddled with delays and mistakes that undermine the frontline work of staff, annoys clients and generally makes branch life difficult for everyone.

- The physical condition of banking centres - buildings, equipment, furniture, decor, etc. - is an embarrassment. Space is very limited.

- MICs must rely on overworked, underappreciated and underdeveloped front line staff to be effective. 

- Employees are not provided with effective training and education to carry out the job that the bank wants them to do. Most feel like they've been thrown into the pool and forced to sink or swim.

- Meddling compliance procedures are painful and cumbersome.

- Disconnect between CIBC core, Imperial Service, business, commercial, Wood Gundy, Private Banking, CIBC Trust and CPIC creates numerous conflicts and undermines the ""one team"" approach. The conversations internally always seem to be focused on how to get credit or recognition rather than how to best take care of the clients."

Bad management old software.","CIBC is worst when it comes to software and pay they will pay you peanuts and expect you to do the job of 5 people. 
1. Everyday calling client minimum 10 clients a day 
2. As working in a digital center without Tellers you will have to service the clients day to day banking transactions.
3. You u will bring mortgages and do it on the worst COINS software which is impossible to navigate.
4. You will also sell Mutual funds to the client.
5. At same time you will do lobbing.
At the end of the day clients are so angry coz there are no tellers i don't know who is making all these dumb decisions in the top management.
EMPLOYEE APPRECIATION MONTH WHAT DO U GET $5 DOLLAR TIMS CARD.
Pay is so less compared to work they ask to do. 
For last 10 years, everyone is getting the same pay but they will make billions of dollars and keep increasing fees for the customers. 

I don't know who is hiring IT department they don't know s___ still running internet explorer which everyone in the world knows slowest software in the planet. 

For one business credit card they will make you fill 10 different forms how dumb can that be.

- Good benefits
- Decent name on resume (for some potential employers)","- There is a lot of bureaucracy standing in the way of quick progression, attitude is that you need to ""pay your dues"" for a (long) period, even if you are better than most at the next level
- Pay is not competitive for high performers, and you will be up against caps on increases (max 15%) each year unless you have a manager who is willing to fight the system for you. This has a disproportionately negative impact on people who are early in their career.
- Since pay isn't good, you work with a lot of people who are not/barely competent

Promotion almost always follows standard meritocratic criteria such that you can understand why people get promoted. Too many benefits and perks to mention.","The main con is a big one: upward mobility is severely restricted. It's very hard to get promoted, and when you do the salary increases are minimal. This is an overall awful problem with the Canadian economy, but it's certainly easy to see at CIBC. As much as the people who get promoted, deserve it, it's very hard to get. The second great con, is how routine based all the work is. CIBC avoids creativity and letting employees think for themself. CIBC wants employees to follow strict procedures to the letter. I believe this extends all the way up to the C-suite. Everyone is working like they are on an assembly line. It's a grind."

Flexibility to work remote and on site, however strongly encouraged to work at the branch as much as possible as you cannot close business on your own you need representatives to process account changes. Good people. Supportive leadership team. Good organization.","Commission model changes drastically year over year which significantly impacts your ability to make consistent income. 

The role has evolved from encouraging independent business development to more of a call centre model where call penetration is micro managed very closely. 

Some branch leaders don't fully support this consultant role which makes it difficult to get buy-in from front line staff to get included in meetings. There is no incentive for front end staff to include you. If they would change their scorecard that may change their behaviour.

The branch you're assigned to is a luck of the draw and will play a large part in your success or failure. Not all branches are equal in transaction/meeting levels, engaging team members yet all MIC's are compared equal."

The lack of accountability extends to IT where employees have easily lost 2 weeks each  of work in the last year due to IT issues. Email was  down for 4 days in December. Like how does that even happen at a company of this size?

The work environment is super bland since someone had the brilliant idea to paint EVERYTHING beige. Bathrooms are cramped on some floors and some people tend to miss the toilets, quite regularly.  It's quite sad... and messy. The bathrooms are also often out of toilet paper and paper towels, at least once a week."

Management does not know how to take care of their employees, hence CIBC has the highest turnover.  Your management sees you doing well and instead of appreciating your good performance, your targets are raised for next year/quarter. I used to do a lot of credit applications and we had a huge target to approve credit and people would do anything to meet targets . This included forging documents and trust me that used to happen a lot. CIBC talks a lot about being customer focused, but actually it is the total opposite, CIBC will do anything to make money and rip off their customers and yes that includes forging documents to approve credit to people who would never be able to afford it. I am just glad i am not a part of this Bank anymore. I'll give you a hint, If you are anywhere close to Regina, SK, stay away from CIBC especially the contact center. The management is so bad, and just sales oriented. If you are good with sales you are rewarded regardless of how you get there. Anyways thats my rant!"

Sales meeting every morning to go over your meetings for the day. How many calls you have made. It's elementary school once again.

Workplace favoritism, not always the most competent ones gets the promotion/raise. High performing advisor has so much leverage, they can even close the sale and dump the client to someone else once no potential left.

High turnovers, organization has been cutting jobs on CSR, FSA, AMCE and etc. Majority of the staff transitioned from PC Financial had all left due to lack of support.

3322,,Your happiness will die in 3 months,2019-01-17,1.0,Customer Service Representative,Getting a bi-weekly salary above minimum wage. That's all there is really.,"This is for any potential CSRs - if you got accepted stay there for the first 3 months of training to collect a cheque and then RUN!

Let's go through the journey that existing teammates and those before us have gone through. First you start your training playing wonderful games for team building; cute children's games that pit your teammates against eachother. You learn about how management loves to boast about different teams one-upping each other. You have wonderful long lunches and breaks. You sit in front of a computer and read all day over procedures. When you start your job shadowing and get a taste you quickly realize how much a facade everything is. The procedures you read are still not sufficient enough for you to understand how to deal with client's accounts. But everything is okay because you deal with basic procedures. And look at that nice cheque that the union snatched some of your money from. Look at that cheque that the other 4 major banks would give you a higher dollar amount but alas, you are at CIBC. Remenber all the amazing competitive benefits that again, the other 4 major banks would outperform.

When you are inducted to the next level, there are high risk procedures involved. You are pulled back into training for a WEEK and then are thrown out back onto the floor to perform complex procedures. Management tells you that a support leader must watch over you while doing these procedures. But you'll have one, if you're lucky TWO, to handle a whole team of people which can be anywhere between 13-25 team members.

When you get a couple audits for performing procedures wrong. They'll tell you that your probationary period will be extended. If you find yourself late one day due to the transit system, they'll mark you late (even one minute late). If you fall sick you will have a sit down with your manager and upper management about your attendance. They will call you incessantly even if you're in the hospital. They must hear your voice.

Now when you're there expect for everything to fall apart before your eyes. You go to the washroom too much because you drink the recommended amount of water? They'll watch you. You decide to take your time while servicing clients? They'll say you talk too much. You decide to speed things up? You're too fast; you're not promoting enough useless services. You were told one thing about how to perform a procedure? You do what was told to you like a studious worker - now you're not empathetic enough. Or why didn't you offer them free money for the abuse you take? Someone is calling you useless? You can warn them and hang up but you can't really. So you'll end up crying. 

You'll then start to remember the signs given to you during training, your trainers, agents on the floor of how horrifying it is to work in CIBC. You'll see people come to work when their children are seriously ill. You'll find out after a year a team of 19 can become 1 or 2.

All the while you're sitting in front of your computer looking at how outdated the procedures at that even 'til this day you can't perform a PIN reset over the phone unlike the other 4 MAJOR banks. You'll realize this when you're apologizing for old systems that can't do much. Or when clients call in yelling because CIBC is investing in ipads and humanless branches instead of getting some real powerhouse engines, forward think engineers, programmers, data analysts to change the way the bank is perceived. Maybe you'll realize when you're popping pills for anxiety, or when your coworkers drop like flies, or when CIBC is the fifth bank on the top 5 list.

Heed this warning."

I have never felt so low on my mental health because it has taken a toll on me with this job. Yes, they “train” you with procedures BUT they do not tell you how to actually solve issues and they do not prepare you mentally. Clients call all the time and most of them are angry so you get verbally abused everyday and they do not tell you these things. You kind of just have to deal with it on your own. You need to have a “thick skin” to get through this job every single day and I have learned not to care. After all your training, you have coaching with your Team Leader and go over your performance and they basically tell you to be more empathetic, to say sorry even if it’s not your fault. There is so much contradictory with this job that it is hilarious, “you talk too much on the phone”, “your after call and hold time is bad”.. it’s like a never ending ride and you can never win because they always have something to say. And no matter how much hard work you do in the job, it doesn’t matter.. if the manager perceive you as something else they will go with their guts and ignore all the hard work you do. I definitely would not recommend this job. This place is horrible. I have never felt sooooo low with my mental health after being on this job. It’s like you have anxieties because you don’t know how to properly serve clients BECAUSE they do not train you properly. My advice— fake it ‘till you make it."

Management really tries to make the environment supportive and fun and retention is the priority at the banking centre level. They pay for most of your credentials, which opens a lot of doors and career advancement opportunities. CIBC is changing the way they want clients to view them, and it’s less of a product push than it was a couple of years ago. They want the client to be the centre of the conversation, and targets are based on client relationship and customer experience surveys instead of the number of products you sell. This is one of the things I noticed and really liked, because I felt less like a salesman and more like a financial advisor. The mutual fund offerings are also very competitive, and in a market where ETFs are becoming more popular it’s really nice to see the mutual fund portfolios outperforming similarly allocated ETF’s and other FI’s mutual funds.","Experience is very much based on the branch you work at. The compensation is low considering the amount of work expected out of you, and as a Senior FSR you are often looked to when there’s a problem that needs to be fixed so you spend time doing things that never reflect on your performance. Also there’s a big push to make outbound calls to clients, which more often than not is taken as a negative by the client. This is starting to change, but still something that sucks. All that being said, the biggest issue is the amount you’re paid vs the amount of work you do."

There is such disorganization between the call centre and the branch. The managers live in some kind of Lalaland and I even heard them making fun of people who were in sick leave and talking amongst themselves. I went to the hospital once and I had called my manager and the absence line, I respect the phone off in hospitals and they had called me 10 times that day, excessive much?

3401,,Financial Services Representative for over a year,2018-11-27,1.0,Financial Services Representative,"I really can't see any in this role. I guess having a free banking and getting waived on credit cards is plus, but expected when you are working at a bank. Benefits are at par with competitors such as BMO and Scotiabank, but much lower than RBC  or TD.","- Because the role is sales without any commission or bonus, there are not much tools for branch managers to motivate  people. This turns into micro-managing to death. Since the turnover in the role is so high, there is no little to chance of getting laid unless voluntarily. 

- Achievers or rewards for delivering results are a joke. Rewards include movie tickets, max 20$ gift cards, and a lunch. 

- Clients complain about turnovers, and people who worked there long enough to move onto other branch roles admit that FSR role is the most miserable, underpaid, and demanding job. You face the client, do all the due diligence, and are paid lower than national average. 

- Pre-booked meetings are at the centre of attention. The banking industry is pushing digital/online banking, but at the branch level pre-booked meeting is mandatory. If you have your day booked for the day, you have no time helping clients at the branch. Managers will constantly disturb you for helping clients at the branch, giving you no time wrapping up or having few minutes break. 

- It seems CIBC rewards people who worked there over 20+ years at a branch level for doing administrative jobs. Branch managers have little knowledge of the process and new systems. They know how to check your outlook calendar and outbound calls/booked meetings and ask you to do more.  

- Incompetent veterans get transferred back and forth doing nothing and getting paid too much while newly hires and young people suffer. You have to pay your dues to climb even at a branch level."

3417,,THE WORST PLACE I HAVE EVER WORKED,2018-11-09,1.0,Financial Services Representative,There are none (except free banking),"This is by far the most toxic work environment I have ever come across.

- You're micromanaged  CONSTANTLY.
- They have incredibly high turnover and don't care at all.
- Weekly ""call listenings"" Where they basically listen to random calls (or calls you choose) and pick them apart asking why you didn't ask certain questions or follow their scripting. Every single thing you do is monitored. You get in trouble for going to the bathroom often or needing a second to get a drink. Every minute you are not on the phone, you're being watched.

- If you're written up you lose the chance of any bonus.
- Despite what they tell you, the only goal is to sell to clients. It's not all about client experience. They want you to sell sell sell to everyone. If it doesn't make ethical sense they still want you to sell and somehow encourage you that you're doing the right thing. 
- Management is awful. They don't care about you or your goals. They will throw the seniority card in your face every single time a new posting comes up for a different position. ""There are people in this building who have been here 20 years that want that job too"" and ""What are you doing to work towards that position"" Unless you have an in with the managers and go out drinking and do extracurriculars with them then forget the chance to move up. They will keep you in your position, promise you they will do a development plan so you will move up, make you sign it to cover themselves but never follow through on any of it. 
Also the compensation sucks here.

Sick Policy:
This is probably the most ridiculous part of working here. You get ""unlimited sick days"" HOWEVER if you are sick too much you get written up. KEY THING TO NOTE... ITS SUBJECTIVE. There is not an actual number of sick days to adhere to before you get written up its whatever they think is too much. Also, they don't accept sick notes or doctor notes at all. You have to call in sick to the phone line. THEN call you direct manager and leave them a voicemail. THEN wait by your phone all day for your manager to call you back to verify you're actually sick in order to be paid. It's key not to miss that phone call. 

The managers are all on a power trip. Save yourself the headache and toxic environment and...DO NOT WORK HERE. Leaving was the best decision I ever made."

- In branch sales roles and tellers are encouraged to direct clients to do banking online and use digital resources rather than coming into the branch but at the same time they increase a financial Services Rep's. sales targets each year when they are sometimes already unattainable at our remote location. We are telling clients to use online banking and do everything online yet at the same time are being told to meet targets of getting clients in the branch to do what we already told them to do online. It makes no sense. 
- FSR's have sales goals to meet each week and at the end of the year. I spend too much time doing small things for clients that have no effect on my sales numbers and I think there there should be an administration position in the branch doing these small time consuming things so I can focus on bigger and more productive client meetings.

The strong undertaking of several years ago was to provide an excellent customer experience. Now it appears that they are forcing customers to transact business through channels other than by visiting a branch. I find that this has impacted front line employees who are being terminated with no concern for their well being; many feel discounted, under valued. unappreciated and not honestly treated. Remaining employees are being tasked with increased targets and minimal support to accomplish ever growing demands, resulting in poor morale. I feel that complaints of harassment and discrimination are quickly denied by upper management and many staff have left for health reasons, both physical and mental. To new employees, I suggest going into employment with CIBC, to not consider it as a long term career choice. Give them what you are fully capable of contributing, and take everything that you can from them - it is a fair exchange. BUT, position yourself to move on to a more appreciative employer in 5 years."

RED FLAG #1  You dont want to work for an organization in which by in large people in leadership roles possess little to no post secondary education especially in this day and age where almost everyone out there looking for work has some kind of post secondary schooling. 

RED FLAG #2 Before quitting - Ive worked for the organization for over 10 years in multiple departments and divisions and 2nd major red flag is the high turnover of staff. This is easily a real bad sign of an organization when there is a constant revolving door ofstaff trying to figure a way to get out of their jobs - trust me I was one of them. It seems nice on the outside but once your in you want run back outside.  

RED FLAG #3 Over the years working there things have gotten much worse not better. Modern technologies have transformed the work environment into ultra micro managed  areas where every meticulous thing you do in a day is tracked. Essentially this trend leads to horrendous work environments where people feel like their walking all egg shells all day, every single day. What a miserable way to go through life."

The uneducated ""Team Leaders"", adherence, the inhumane conditions of being tied to your desk by a headset, the unethical practices of predatory tied selling... The list goes on and on. 

And lastly, I leave you with the Dilbert principle. The Dilbert principle refers to a 1990s theory by Dilbert cartoonist Scott Adams stating that companies tend to systematically promote their least-competent employees to management (generally middle management), in order to limit the amount of damage they are capable of doing.

Couple that with the Gervais principle, Gervais Principle, part of which is the idea that people at executive levels in large companies systematically promote incompetent but enthusiastic people to middle management as useful scapegoats. Whereas people with possible executive talent jump from the lower ranks to the exec level, bypassing the middle morass.

You spend a month in the classroom learning how to navigate the most unhelpful, unintuitive computer systems ever. It's all long lunches, potlucks and team-building activities in the classroom. When you do finally get out on the phones, it is a brutally rude awakening. Every minute of your time must be accounted for. Bathroom breaks are discouraged. You get hundreds of company e-mails every day and are given no time to read through them. Management comes up with weird games that pit employees against each other, trying to one-up each other's sales. You are made to listen and critique each other's phone calls. The hours are incredibly long, lunch break is only 30 minutes, unpaid. If ever - god forbid - you're sick, you have to call your manager and then have your phone next to you so that they can call you back and speak to you. They do this to try and determine if people are actually sick. It's incredibly dehumanizing. I've heard stories of supervisors creeping employee's social media accounts and building cases against them if they think that they are abusing the incredibly strict sick day policy. Part of the training process includes uncovering weaknesses and exploiting them - they call these ""discovery questions"". They engage in predatory lending practices. Employees are disciplined for missing opportunities to sell people credit products, even when it's clear that the person has no use for it or would not be able to responsibly manage it. Absolutely the worst bank. I quit three months in after having to go on antidepressants due to extreme anxiety and depression, and I'm not the only person to have this experience either. I quit without even having another job lined up because I could not even set foot in that place another day. Turnover is extremely high.

CIBC is very process oriented organization to the point where there is more paperwork to fill out then the work itself. 

As an employee it can be difficult to take pride at this organization for the following reasons:

1. Has fallen from #2 to #5 Canadian Top Bank (with no definitive plans on how to reverse its drop)

When I got sick, I couldn't afford to take the day off work, so I enjoyed spreading the virus around to everyone else on my team. Employees  are only interested in protecting their jobs, not in actually doing meaningful work or making processes more efficient or effective. Our office was closed due to security reasons, but I did not have credentials to work from home, so I was required to risk my safety and go into the office if I wanted to get paid, even though I couldn't do any of my work because the people I needed to meet with were working from home.

- good benefits (comparable to other banks)","Depending on the team you end up on, the experience can be horrible. On this team, there was massive favoritism, no opportunities to advance, no opportunities to learn new skills, indirect bullying and micro management. 

Even when these issues were brought up in employee surveys, employee reviews, hr interviews, ultimately no changes were made causing the team to fall apart in less than a year. 

There are also no opportunities for work flexibility. This is true of a lot of departments at cibc not just this team. Other teams have better people managers but none of them provide work from home options, compressed work weeks or shortened work weeks. The company as a whole promotes work flexibility depending on the department but the manager mentality in the majority of departments is too old fashioned to allow it.

Advice to people getting interviewed: ask questions about the team: is it team work oriented? Do team members share experiences and knowledge? Does management regularly acknowledge hard work? Does hard work get rewarded?"

The culture has changed alot in the last year, and all for the negative.

The volume recruits are being given is uncomparable to any other banks, and managers sweep under the rug how exhausted and overworked their employees are, and worse, they mentally and emotionally punish them. Which is interesting considering that many senior managers and director and fairly new to the organization, and their level of actual recruitment is minimal so they don’t know how to do their job, but they know exactly how to play politics with the VP so they themselves look look.

Free daily banking (must have a CIBC account as an employee)
Employee recognition days (lunch often provided)
OK benefits","HR will tell you CIBC fully covers any education required to advance your career within the company during the interview process. I applied and completed my IFC course only to find out that this is not true. The reimbursement is to the Regional and Branch managers discretion. I was a top performing CSR and only received partial reimbursement. 
Often left short staffed without any assistance on the frontline from management or financial representatives (even though they are available in their offices).
Scheduled hours can change at anytime time, for any reason and you are obligated to fulfill those hours. (Evenings and weekends)
They have reduced the number of hours in many branches for CSR employees effectively replacing full time positions with part time roles even though CIBC makes substantial increase in profits quarter after quarter, year after year.
This is a role that management openly states is being phased out.
Management knew a lot about finance, investments and how to push sales but knew very little about people management. You may be given poor or very little advice on how to improve. (As a previous manager with another company I had experience reading score cards, my manager was unsure how to read or present mine, so I showed him/her).
You are trained on how to handle a robbery situation and let's just say the procedure does not have the employees best interests in mind. 
Vacation requests must be given in advance (seniority in the company gives you first choice), December is usually blacked out for all staff. (in reality it only applies to frontline CSR's).
Your performance will be heavily measured by your ability to refer clients to Financial Service Representatives (In order to obtain a successful referral, the FSR must obtain a sale from the client)"

-great support from financial planning consultants and trust department","-unealistic targets with no material backing as to how they are determined. Huge variation in the targets of similar portfolios in your area for no apparent reason
-many branch managers have little to no finance or investment experience and are suppose to be coaching financial advisors to be more successful in these areas
-frontline staff is severely cut and the remaining sales staff is suppose to step in and take over deposit transactions etc which takes up a lot of valuable time. This is not taken into account with regards to breakaway expectations/targets that were rolled out when branches had ample csr coverage. 
-in addition to above the goal of CIBC is to push clients to online platform and out of branch... Yet fsrs/advisors are being measured and told to bring more and more clients into branch (to show meetings/sales) for things that can be completed over phone or online.
-they roll out new software ""compass"" and new system updates but all it does is slow things down, bog up the sales process and make everyone seem incompetent because of all the bugs and issues that haven't been fixed. Anyone who has real sales experience and who has been properly trained does not require a program to recommend sales opportunities. 
-leading into next point... TRAIN your employees. So many fsrs/advisors are giving FINANCIAL advice to clients yet don't even comprehend what they are talking about. This WILL catch up with CIBC and its reputation as a reputable bank."

Training programmes were quite enjoyable, albeit conducted at irregular intervals.  The company will pay for additional credentials as well as upgraded education for employees.  This is an acceptable job for someone fresh out of university, but does not offer long-term prospects.","I was offered the position based on investment based knowledge and education; however no focus is placed on investments at the retail level.  All focus is placed on the ability to sell credit, even to those who do not need/may not be able to service it.  Advice given by other staff members is often incorrect/inappropriate/uneducated.  The company only pays attention to staff errors when there is a potential for media exposure.  Attractive time off package, but this is expected to be booked up to a year in advance, with all time given to senior staff first.  As most branches have a skeleton crew, this means vacation is often forced when you do not want/cannot make the most use of it.  Staffing levels also result in inconsistent days off.  It was very uncommon to have two scheduled days off at a time, and nearly unheard of having a proper weekend.  Many branch level employees, particularly managers, seem to be complacent in their roles which can be very frustrating to someone who is ambitious to advance beyond a basic retail role.  Bonuses are also awarded with no consistency between business units (with managers often threatening individuals who share with others what they were paid) and no specific formula followed.  It seems this can cause confusion, if not genuine distrust between the employee and the company as a whole.  It can also result in individuals being penalised for the performance of their larger business unit despite strong personal performance.  Benefits are not commensurate with a company of this size, insurance coverage often involves low coverage amounts of higher co-pays.  Most other benefits are also taxable, so keep this in mind.  Office culture is very dry, employees are not encouraged to socialise with each other, and people are often reassigned frequently to other branches.  The company will insist employees participate in sponsored charities (United Way, Run for the Cure, etc) however employees are expected to contribute on their own, and are not compensated."

Secondly, how CIBC can assign person for mentoring Insurance products, where that person never have worked at Insurance Company before? The level of knowledge of CIBC employee is a very low, even Branch Manager, how you can be a manager of the branch if you don't know or even heard in your life about CFA designation? CIBC keep asking you to reach your sales target and the same time pushing clients go to the online and telephone banking?! How stupid is it, you don't have tones of new clients every day but you keep asking about sales targets. Keep calling the same clients over the phone and keep offering them the same offer which you asked 1 or 3 month ago?

- The company is at least trying to move towards a modern banking experience, although not going far enough.
- Stable hours if you get a permanent position","- Starting compensation is the lowest of the big five banks and the Caisse
- Management is generally unqualified to be in there positions.
- Management is only interested in pushing product with no regard for creating a better client experience. Everything is about sales and regardless of how valuable you are in terms of solving customer issues and and improving a client’s experience the only metric you will be judged by is how many credit cards, LOC’s, etc. you can push. Because of this, (no surprise) client retention is abysmal.
- Rather than coaching, mentoring and providing helpful insight the go-to tactics for motivating employees is bullying and indirectly threatening the possibility of being fired. 
- Product information and coaching documents are available in the labyrinth like database of information for employees, but A) it’s extremely difficult to find answers to questions, and B) The material available refers mainly to sales tactics and how to bypass customer complaints rather than addressing them. 
- There’s a huge turnover rate of people that move onto better banks out of the big five and those who have ended up staying at CIBC seem bitter and very passive aggressive. It’s understandable when you look at the type of treatment from the top but regardless it makes for a very unpleasant workplace."

Helping clients make important decisions and guiding them through a maze of financial products and services is your role. FSR in reality a Financial Planner or Financial Adviser since you deal with everything such as chequing account, loan, mortgage, mutual funds and credit cards etc. Job stability is high, pay is great and the role in the bank is not a job but a career. This is a sales role so be prepared to sell with passion and confidence because at the end of the day if you are doing what's best for the client, it's not really selling but rather advising. Job is easier when you are in a big branch as there are lot of walk ins and you can capitalize each meeting to meet your sales targets (coming from someone who's worked both in the biggest branch and smallest branch).","As of 2016, the annual sales targets have gone up in terms of Bas unit sales which is mostly from opening new deposit accounts, ovedraft, credit cards etc. However at the same time CIBC is promoting Digital Migration that is any client that walks in to a branch, FSRs are expected to pretty much show them how to do everything online including opening a new account on your phone and applying for a credit card etc. Not too bad if for branch sales people including CSRs if you're in a big branch with lots of walk in but if you're in a small branch, it can make your job extremely hard. You will have to make a lot more calls in the office to get clients into the branch I'd say 2 to 3 hours daily in a small branch as opposed to 1 hour in a big branch."

Raises are 5 cents a year after working extremely hard. They only notice your ""sales numbers"" and not the back office or investigation work put in. They cut hours down because our ""transaction count"" is low. However they don't factor how many clients walk out because of the wait for one teller. A ""transaction"" may be a wire payment or changing a bank card that could take up to 15 mins per client. Extended hours but they keep cutting staff. Very stressful . They don't support people who have families and kids. This job is best suited for single people who only are interested in sales. Pay is horrible for the effort and work involved.

Instructors are really friendly and try to make it as easy as possible if you come from a non banking background. 
Free banking and great employee rates. 
Career growth within the bank eventually, depending on what you're looking for. 
If you meet sales targets for 6 months (2 quarters) you get a 2k permanent raise, followed by another 2k raise if you meet for a second 6 months. So 42k plus end year bonus. Some guys make like 60k gross but they sell like crazy.  

To be honest I never finished college and I feel I have the potential for a long career if I play my cards right. There are days when I loathe the job however if you can stick it out there is potential for a long and well paid career. To make 42k without schooling and without breaking your back by doing physical labor, there are deff worst jobs out there to be had. It is not perfect but it could be a lot worse and a lot less pay and I Have been there so I am thankful for what I have.","Some clients that call in are just really awful people, a lot of stress if not meeting targets, you will prob work afternoons for 2 plus years (f you last that long) because shift bids are based on seniority. 
Targets have been adjusted to be more manageable but it is stressful quarter after quarter to meet them and some days you want to just stand up and quit. But then you think about the pros I mentioned above and you keep going. 

It is deff not for everyone and I almost gave up a few times, but I have an really great team leader who helped me with my sales so it's not as bad anymore. Half of the 14 or so people that we started training with have quit or got fired, but a few also have moved on to better positions within the bank."

This place pays the least out of the top 5 banks and expects the most.,"They advertised the job as 9-5 but gives you ridiculous targets that can clearly not be met with just 8 hours.  In order to meet their targets, you have to stay much longer in order to fulfill your requirements.  The more appropriate title for the Financial Service Representative position is telemarketer.  They expect their FSRs to make 35 live contact calls weekly and left messages, no pick ups, do not count.  They judge you on a system where anything below 50% counts as zero to make you feel worse than you already do.  CIBC prides themselves on mobile and telephone banking when those are not real advantages.  Simply put, expect a high stress environment sent from the top down with pay that does not justify the work.  You would notice that the average tenor of a CIBC bank employee is 1 year and very rarely would you encounter representatives that are properly trained to do investments or mortgages.  Their training program gives you the very basic theories of financial planning as it is a entry level retail job but throws you out to the front lines without any real hands on experience.

They've self-proclaimed themselves to being a client-centric bank when they haven't made any changes to being that.  They're a very heavily product focused company that has a target system that may not necessarily work out in the best interest of clients when their workers are trying to meet their BAS (units measured for sales)"

Those of us who do well or just a little bit under are treated poorly, bullied and made to feel like less valued employees. I struggled as a people leader under my manager because the individual sabotaged my role at every turn with the staff - and rated me poorly as I attempted to turn around a compliance poor branch.

Good on resume for future career opportunities OUTSIDE CIBC","Lots of CONS, I don't even know where to start: This is the worse job I've had in my entire life! 
- Extremely low pay (35K) considering the amount of hours put in, and even after obtaining IFIC and successfully going through FSRDP, my requests for a salary review were repeatedly ignored, despite consistently meeting targets. 
-They expect you to kick butt right after training and put you on the  same target scale as older employees.
-If you work under a Branch Manager who doesn't like you, you're screwed, as it was in my case. She openly harassed, bullied and intimidated me. Brushed aside all personal requests whatsoever. It was all about SALES SALES SALES. Some very arrogant Branch Managers and even some FA's who were very reluctant to assist. 
-We were MICRO-MANAGED like kids in high school really. Constantly checking on FSR'S to see where they were with targets. Monitored you pretty much every second. 
-Advancement Opportunities are hard to come by. Be prepared to stick around for quite a while if you want to move up the ladder. A branch manager flat out told me She would NEVER recommend me for any higher roles 'at this point in my career' When I needed assistance, she would ask me to call the employee help desk. 
-If you suck at sales, this is the wrong job for you. Majority of your day will be spent Calling existing clients to up-sell them stuff, majority of which get extremely pissed/annoyed when they get these calls. 
-The Targets are unrealistically high and keep going up every year. It is virtually impossible to meet all those targets with the amount of time allotted, and they will NOT pay for any over time whatsoever. Zero work-life balance. 
-Zero Bonus if your manager hates you. Your life and career advancement at CIBC pretty much lies in the hands of your direct manager. Even when transferring branches to the same FSR role. 
-Lots of conflicting feedback from various levels of management (Branch manager, District manager, and DVP) 
One tells you one thing, another says some other thing. Lots of useless 'sales' meetings to attend daily when focus should be on Customer service."

Those are the people that used to be good in sales rather then have a formal education in that field. No way to transfer to the head office if you are good performer. If not good, they will transfer you or just get rid of you. It is all about sales target. Little or no appreciation. Cannot raise your concerns or advice eon any improvements since you will be told off."
5356,,"Lack of decent compensation, proper training and management.",2013-11-29,1.0,Financial Services Representative,Management always tells us to call national support and acts like the branch is run by national support.,No overtime compensation unless you fight for it. Need to upgrade hardwares.

5362,,Break Away Broke Me,2013-11-20,2.0,Financial Advisor,Great training. Good Comp system.,Micromanaging as a result of the new Break Away Program
5363,,Terrible,2013-11-12,1.0,Financial Services Representative,"If you are new to financial services, you will learn a ton of information regarding day-to-day banking, unsecured lending, secured lending, fixed-term investments, etc. Being someone who had very controlled finances throughout post-secondary, I was very unfamiliar with a lot of banking products so the information I absorbed was immense and beneficial both to my role and to myself.

The pay is also pretty good (starts at 39k with the ability to make a few thousand extra by the end of the year). Do not mistake it though, you are worked for every dollar you earn so don't think your work value has increased through this increase in pay.","The work environment is simply terrible. The managers are tyrannical and constantly micromanage employees. Positive reinforcement and constructive criticism is dismal at best, even when you are attaining your targets. The management will look for any excuse possible to maximize your output and cut into your wallet. This includes reprimanding your quarterly bonus due to a couple of lates no more than 5-10 minutes each. If you enjoy working for an organization that resembles the SS, look no further.

The call centre is constantly understaffed and poorly scheduled which means period of having one or two minutes in between calls to periods in which there are up to 70 calls waiting for your queue.

The management was overtly incompetent. The majority were not qualified for managerial roles (I doubt some even had a high school diploma let alone any sort of formal managerial education) and those that were, were often overlooked due to office politics. Affirmative action is rampant in CIBC's North York call centre, and I do not mean this in a good way. What it means is that a lot of people are hired unfortunately based on the colour of their skin rather than the content of their character and their qualifications for the role which ends up with CIBC becoming a victim of incompetent management. One manager at the North York call centre is even brave enough to show up to work daily with slurred speech and bloodshot eyes. I was subject to some forms of racial and ethnic discrimination in the work environment but due to the fact that I am a male of European origin, any sort of complaint against this was mocked by the management and human resources."

Zero support from immediate management or higher management.  They seem to prefer female sheep who will follow rather than a person who is intelligent and can lead.  Software was the worst I have seen in any bank.  Tellers have no idea what most transactions are.  Managements number one solution is to ""Call the internal help desk"" when an employee does not know how to solve a problem.  The software uses codes, hundreds of them, to input things that are simple point and click ""windows like"" software at other banks I worked at.  Constant customer complaints and long customer lines.  Why do people still bank there?  Because its too much hassle to move accounts once you start.  I will never consider a position at CIBC again for any amount of money."

5521,,they will usew you until you gain fulltime employment,2012-09-12,2.0,Customer Services Representative,decent trust with long tenured company,NO promotion from within unless they feel you are not going anywhere
5522,,Back stabbing culture and fear based senior leadership,2012-09-12,1.0,Consultant,"- Decent compensation
- Free coffee / tea
- Downtown Toronto
- 9-5 culture","- Culture of 'busy bodies' that backstab people. Trying to get colleagues fired seems to be a hobby of most people at this organization.
- Inflated job titles. Someone who would be called a Manager somewhere else is called a Director at CIBC. A Sr. Consultant is a Sr. Manager. This has caused small people to feel they are big and important. They feel entitled to be respected and get upset when new hires don't respect a 27 year old ""Sr. Mgr"". Ridiculous. 
- Sr. Leadership are incredibly two faced and rule by intimidation. Being honest with your own manager is career suicide at this place."

They've established unrealistic targets with absolutely useless technology.  The workload is unbearable and most of the underwriters are on burn out.  Morale amongst employees is at the absolute lowest I've ever seen it. The Mortgage underwriter position is one of the worst jobs at CIBC.  Underwriters were laid off in Calgary yet the sales force has increased and they constantly complain about service levels being to slow to remain competitive.  Basically underwriters have a bigger pool of deals to underwrite but less employees to do so.  New technology  was introduced with little or no benefit, saturday shifts were introduced with no real increase in revenue, only to copy TD bank.  The bank is totally reactive and doesn't know how to retain talent. Recently many employees have left for greener pastures. The pay is poor in comparison to the job demands and most underwriters work an excessive amount of hours in order to meet their unmanageable daily targets.  The sales force has absolutely no training program to train new sales staff and most of the underwriters have to essentially train new sales staff on top of all their other job demands.  The technology the underwriters are given is slow and inefficient yet the tasks they are required to do only increase each year. A work life balance is totally frowned upon.  It would be nice to have the option to work from home every once and awhile but due to the poor technology that is impossible.  Underwriters are totally kept in the dark and are only made aware of significant changes at the last possible second.  Management isn't helpful because they also seemed overworked and constantly stressed.  Feedback is non existent, unless a mistake is made at which point coaching is offered."

- no investment in training is provided to the staff
- archaic technology
- at the beginning of 2012 - they literally stated that the bank wishes to be #4 in mortgages.  i cannot for the life of me begin to comprehend why any institution in any industry would not strive be the best
- as much as the bottom line matters in all industries, this bank ONLY looks at the bottom and has no focus on employee morale, employee growth and development or the fostering of an entrepreneurial environment where individuals are encouraged to provide productive and constructive ideas to better the work environment"
