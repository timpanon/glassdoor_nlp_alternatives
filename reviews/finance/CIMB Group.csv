However things turned sour when it was time for me to move. Its almost like you become an enemy. That, I find is most childish and unprofessional. Both from my direct superiors as well as from the HR department. If your direct superiors are against you, you are in trouble. This is because HR sides with whoever has the highest grade, instead of whoever is right. CIMB used to be a good place to work at. Now, unfortunately, it has gone to the dogs.

40,CIMB Group,Good environment,2022-02-28,5.0,Trading Assistant,Good environment. Friendly colleagues and bosses,Not any that I can think of
41,CIMB Group,A mature and profit-centered company trying its hardest adapting to latest and current trend with a half-hearted effort,2022-02-24,3.0,IT Tester,"*Always up to date with current technology especially security related

*There's internal whistleblowing service managed by third party consulting firm. A proof of commitment that frauds are not tolerated here

*Good, heck, probably best boss and supervisor I ever had. Hence one the biggest reason why I decided to stay this long. Disclaimer: I can't say the same for other division.

*Great benefit. I mean my previous employer didn't really provide me with employee-rate mortgage, employee credit card with no admin fee, emergency funds and many more. And they're both banking institutions.

*Good career opportunity. There are internal job postings in case you want to try new experiences and I know a guy who previously worked as Relationship Manager and ended up working as Product Owner. I'd say it's a pretty big step up career-wise from sales to product management.","*You know that Steve Buscemi ""Fellow Kids"" meme? It fits perfectly the current condition of CIMB Niaga. A mature corporation trying so hard to impress younger generations yet at the same time, they couldn't really grasp what these younger generations needed

*Apparently even its people are having a hard time to adapt to the digital era. They have bought this new and cool internal messaging software yet only some use it to some extend. WhatsApp still the king of messaging for CIMB Niaga. You may try raising this issue but pretty much the answer would be ""because vendors don't have access to it so we still use WhatsApp."", ""No one use it so why should we"". Just another excuses. And to this day, no one seems to enforce this or really cares, not even sure the C-levels even use the software. Again, it's like they bought this cool messaging software for thousand dollars not because of necessities, it's strictly for the trend.

*Trying so hard at converting to Agile method unfortunately like many others before them, it didn't really work that well hence they're stuck in what we call a limbo between ""waterfall"" and ""agile"". Seems the C-Level don't really care as they don't really understand what it means to be ""agile"". Heck, no one here know what agile is. They know they need to separate their requirements into Story in this tools called JIRA, do weekly sprint meeting and daily standup but that's it. They don't really know how to create proper Story and what should be called an Epic ended up into one Story. Yes, various features coalesced into one story which is pretty much a big mistake.

*Project timeline does not make sense. I'm not even sure what's the purpose of project management office here. All they do is just providing this unrealistic timeline and we ended up having to negotiate hard for it to be extended. Ironically, they prefer a person with PMP certification for new hires. So.. yeah, there's that too.

*Proportions between developers and testers in a development team are not equally balanced. Won't be surprised if one day the developers ended having to SIT and UAT test their own creations because the testers ended up resigning due to heavy workload with no increase in salary.

*Don't understand the importance of Product Owner in agile environment. The fact the business team decided to use MT (Management Trainee) kids as Product Analyst/Owner irks me the most. A position that should be filled with those who understand what Product Owner is all about instead is filled with fresh graduate with degree in law or archaeology who had zero courses regarding IT Project Management or Agile. Of course if you ask me, the biggest reason is because they're cheap and available compared with hiring new and experienced Product Owner which not only expensive but also take a long time to find.

*Lastly, if you want to learn agile. I suggest you find another company as I don't think CIMB Niaga is the right company to help you learn."

Couldn't even get my commission because my branch manager didn't know the after sales process, and everyone was too competitive to want to teach you.
Someone in the branch tested positive for Covid on my second day of work but nobody told me about it because they didn't adhere to the 60% work forced and didn't want to get in trouble. I had no idea until 2 months later. 
There is no such thing as protecting whistleblowers identity. Whatever is reported will be shared by all of management and eventually trickled back down to the staff and staff gets in trouble and humiliated. Didn't happen to me but I heard stories. 
Branch manager threatens sales staff everyday that they could be fired and replaced. EVERYDAY. 
They still owe me some money when I left, however nobody replies emails and couldn't get through HR because it's ""not my department to handle"".

Very high attrition rate and that says it all about their culture. Working for this bank has been the worst career decisions of most of their employees, no kidding. Life changing. Read your job offer very carefully until the last part so you know what you are getting yourself into. Don't be the next person to suffer the burden of wanting to desperately get out of a miserable life. Ask around if you are not convinced. People here don't sleep, they work long hours (double shift most of the time) even during weekends and holidays and no one is spared regardless of the position... and that makes the CEO proud because they are ""fast-paced"". Essentially, you will be working for free most of the time and I think the company is saving a lot from those free services. And when you leave suddenly, the company earns even more because of a binding contract that might require you to pay. (Won't share more details about it but be warned - again, check your job offer). In my opinion, they practically save millions of money with that tactic (employees give free service outside working hours, then might be asked to pay when they decide to leave). For a very small company with many vacant positions all the time (and most of them are jobs for leadership positions), you gotta think twice before joining them. On the other hand, a lot of people there care about each other because they share the same sentiments. They encourage each other to leave. They cheer and congratulate people who get out succesfully. Then they hope and pray that they're next. That part for me is the only thing fun there. 😜 I hope this post saves someone's life from becoming miserable."

If you're moving up from the management trainee programme, they offer in-depth career advice services (though this is apparently changing moving forward, offering less career advice, and just giving you a higher base salary -- which sounds great to be, to be honest).

If you aim to impress and work like a dog even when it's not required -- showing your own imitative and coming up with new suggestions -- you will have many chances to be recognised. Whether you have the energy to try after what the job does to you remains in question.

Irregular hours have improved a lot from the days of the early 2000s booms. Fairly flexible, you leave work when you're work's done (as long as it's after official hours), and permitted to come in slightly later in the mornings.

Exposure to wide range of businesses and industries, so ample learning opportunities. 

Decent health benefits and life insurance benefits.

You need a passion for the industry to survive.","Deal flow is very limited by the connections of the bank to companies, so deals can be lost to other rival banks. At the bottom of the food chain, you do a lot of work and are recognised for it, but a lot of it will never pan out and there's nothing you can do -- it's only the bosses that control what can and can't go through. Be prepared to be unattached, or to keep a rational distance, or you might get some heartaches. Nothing unusual for this line of business though.

Long hours, obviously. It's a bank, boo hoo. If you're not prepared to put in the occasional weekend here and there, or be prepared to work late (10pm onwards) with basically no prior notice, are you even in the right line of thinking?

Sunset industry. Group CEO is pushing for a change to consumer banking. Are you prepared to enter a declining field where you're no longer a king? 

Also building is filled with cockroaches and poor ventilation. 

Even if your boss personally wants to promote you, HR paperwork might obstruct certain items and you'll have to wait. Allegedly."
