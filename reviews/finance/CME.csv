122,,Just ok,2021-07-29,3.0,"Director, Operations",It's almost a recession proof company. When the global economy is falling apart CME volumes tend to do well. It ends up being a fairly stable place to work.,The leadership is honestly weak. Smart people are promoted into leadership positions but they're not necessarily good people-leaders. There is a lot of cheerleading about how great things are but it's kind of like working for a utility.

127,,"Nice people, decent money, boring and often slow-going. Poor management.",2021-07-17,3.0,Software Engineer,"Money is pretty good, especially for the amount of work. It's a lax environment where you really don't have to work too hard. Benefits are good, people are nice. Salary is decent although not the best growth opportunity. Healthy work-life balance, generous PTO.","Work can be really boring. The nature of the business requires that they are extremely cautious with putting new code into production. This leads to very slow development cycles, and a pretty huge amount of bureaucratic busy work. My number one complaint here is that most of our work revolves not around designing and implementing new features, but trudging through an outdated and overbearing system of red tape to get anything done. There are hard rules around deployments to different environments and an insane amount of energy and effort goes into just managing that process. And for some reason this is all the responsibility of developers.

Middle/high management obviously does not care in the slightest about best practices or any standardized processes for software development. Most of the code and systems in place for testing, deploying, etc are a complete mess. But most teams are barely staffed enough to get their work done on time so there's never any opportunity or incentive to improve processes. 

CME also claims to care a great deal about their employees, always boasting that they are on some such ""Top 100 Best Places to Work"" list. And emphasizing their dedication to diversity. But the reality is they put bagels in the lobby and a ping pong table in order to look like an employee focused tech company when all we want is competitive salaries and regular raises. In my years at CME I don't think I have come across a single black developer. I have many female colleagues who feel they are mistreated, talked down to, and dismissed by their older male coworkers. I also know of multiple situations where mistreatments of this kind were grossly mishandled by tech managers and HR staff resulting in an ostensible ""solution"" to the problem that actually just made the employee who was harassed very uncomfortable in their work environment going forward.

During the pandemic, while CME was making billions of dollars in profit off of their employees labor, they made the decision to slash all promotions and raises for their employees. During this same period, CEO Terry Duffy's compensation rose ~30% (4 million dollars). As a consequence, from what I am seeing, there is a large exodus of talented younger tech employees for greener pastures. Plenty of other companies, especially in this space, offer higher wages and more interesting work. But you will certainly have to work harder at those places."

140,,Boring and bureaucratic,2021-06-16,2.0,Anonymous Employee,"The almighty dollar. Total benefits are worth a lot, even if salary alone isn't at market.","The work is honestly boring. There isn't a real path for innovation because the leaders don't want it. It's easier to rest on their laurels as they continue cashing in on their pensions, most well past normal retirement ages. In other organizations, high potential talent is generally earlier career individuals. Here, it tends to be people who are mid-late career, and this is where the development dollars go. 

If you aren't mid-career or later and a white male, this is probably not the place for you. This company is the poster child for virtue signaling (without any real action). Diversity isn't their thing. They should own that and stop lying to everyone that they care about it."

That is great if you are an MD pulling 100+% bonuses with profit sharing. For everyone else, it's a meat grinder; here's why...

You know how Oreos lost their mind and sell self-knockoffs like birthday cake Oreos and, God help me, cookies and cream Oreos? CME, having run of ideas around the time Leo and Fred retired, keep coming up with similar galaxy brained garbage. Their great idea is to sell 1/10th the product at 1/20th the price and give themselves big bonuses based on volume...

But it's tech where the pigs get the lipstick  Years ago, Tweedledumb and Tweedleangry implemented a palace coup and took over.  Tweedledumb wanders the halls spouting business aphorisms like it's actual wisdom. His favorite is ""A's hire B's, B's hire C's,"" completely missing the irony of the fact that he hires D+'s. He has been stealing other's credit for so long he now mistakes it for actual work.

Tweedleangry's mistake is that he equates volume with leadership. The loudest yeller wins. Years of HR training have taught him to hide his disdain for women under a disdain for everyone, and to occasionally promote someone who isn't one of his golf buddies to give the illusion of fairness.

Leadership below them has, through aggressive mediocrity, been thinned into a gruel of those who are too incompetent or too beaten down to be an actual threat to the Tweedles.  Everyone else has been beaten into a pulp  trying to complete an integration that started when the Trump wannabe CEO decided to buy the corporate equivalent of 3 raccoons in a trenchcoat.  The reward for 70 hour weeks will be a mid summer layoff.  I only stick around because I'm hoping I'm in the group that gets fired."

Raising any attention to malpractices, while “encouraged” is just a trap. 

There is no long term strategy for the data business, just looking to live quarter to quarter. Senior Mgmt constantly “empowers” the employees by choking them for strategic ideas and implementation, but says outright no to any new business initiatives or cases. 

Some excellent and talent individuals are suffocated by management , who take credit for any successes and lay blame otherwise. 

People from various  teams regularly disappeared without explanation, especially just before their 2 years of service were over (just before any employment rights kick in). 

Another common approach was to advertise position as Director and then lower the titles to manager at the interview or just before the contract signing stage, stating that there is no difference in the packages when clearly bonuses differ by title as her the HR handbook. 

They hire talented and diverse people but suppress them and allow a few rotten apples to run the show. 

I was told by my boss to take credit of other regional teams and present their findings to senior management as mine - literally told “to learn to be crafty”

My boss constantly plotted against other people and openly bragged about playing chess moves while others play checkers. 

I could go on and on but you get the picture.

Great exit opportunities in finance and tech.","Demoralizing amount of red-tape.

There is little financial incentive to over-perform. Target bonuses are small for the industry and little separates the highest and lowest performers, compensation-wise. 

Company-wide architectural decisions are made by the least qualified/most politically-connected, leading to brittle and unresilient systems.

The tech division is rapidly turning over FTEs. The most motivated/talented engineers have been flocking to HFT and BigTech for a few years, and are subsequently backfilled with contractors and fresh college hires. This seems to be the conscious strategy going forward; let attrition take its course and hire armies of cheap foreign contractors to be trained by the one or two remaining holdouts."

There are exceptional teams free from the blow 'cons'","Monopolist in the market that doesn't bother cutting many incompetent people on the payroll .  Lots of talents left recent years. 

Prepare for ' world-class' bureaucracy and 'industry-leading' politics. You'd be lucky if you have a boss who understands your work and cares about you, and the chance of so is decreasing as these people are leaving. Your boss is most likely only pretending to be knowledgeable to backup his/her micro-management, and has no interest in recognizing who're the actual performers among the astonishing number of free riders who probably are better paid than you.   He cares about his next promotion even it means cutting promising projects. You and your boss aren't the same team, you are two professionals who takes care of your own career.

All Job Descriptions in the job market are somewhat painted but here it can get extreme. Hiring Masters from Ivy-like schools and leaving them with literally no intellectually challenging work is not uncommon.  This company can afford. Years later real talents either leave or can no longer find jobs matching their current rank &  salary elsewhere because in other places you actually need to Do things.

Pension (though small, most companies really don’t even offer this)
If you really look, you can find small groups of smart talented people
Insanely profitable business, with little competition (really almost none at all)","Lots of favoritism, especially towards remote Belfast and India offices, and frustrating organizational politics. Additionally, there isn’t any transparency from upper management on how decisions are made or if there’s any data to back those decisions. These points, as well as all the “security” related policies, which just end up wrapping everything in red tape, ultimately drove my decision to leave.
Also, there exists in CME a know-it-all culture among senior management, where they seem to bury their heads in the sand in regards to pain points and the insane bureaucracy. This attitude of “everything is great and we have no problems” results in nothing changing and all these pain points only becoming more and more painful. 
Another huge frustration is the “throw some stuff at the wall and hope it sticks” mindset, with zero accountability when projects fail and it doesn’t “stick” (and usually it doesn’t).

From a technology perspective, lots of talk about “innovation” and “hiring the best” but that’s mostly just talk. The tech stack is a quite boring in most teams, with a few exceptions. In fact, when it comes to tech, the company is really just playing catch up at a brutally slow pace (mainly due to extreme red tape brought on by “security” measures, many of which are excessive and have nothing to due with real security).
From a hiring perspective, the technologists that are hired tend to be picked based on either industry experience or just the gut feeling of someone with a big shot title, and rarely on the applicant’s actual technical skill. Too many hiring decisions are made from the top down."

Uninspiring and inauthentic senior management more concerned with their golden handcuffs than their people and challenging the status quo.  Bad HR policies that stifle talented mid-level employees.  Toxic, gossip-filled, silo'ed, and territorial culture that deserves its own Uber-style exposure.  Splashy efforts at ""innovation,"" but when's the last time CME made real profit on a new business?

Fun tip: look at the tone-deaf propaganda responses from HR on these Glassdoor reviews that politely deny that any problems exist, often with a line like ""that's not the environment we recognize!"" and a reference to an engagement survey that's taken every two years.  For example, they say that their education reimbursement is twice the industry average! Wow! But they fail to mention it used to be 100% covered. People joined specifically for this benefit, before it was ripped away with no warning, causing major life disruptions.

These keep ticking over without the need for much innovation. So there  isn't much incentive to eliminate ""dead wood"" from the payroll. Over time I think this has led to a gradual accumulation of ineffective managers and incompetent support staff who would have otherwise have been moved on.

London is very much a satellite office. This is fine if you're working on a properly devolved project with local leadership, but it can become painful if the US is directly in the driving seat.

-Good quality environment if you just want to come in a down a job","After two rounds of lay-offs, removal of naysayers, the organization has been left with an out of touch upper management supported by a middle management layer paranoid about its future in context evaporating opportunities.  

The other recent reviews speak to this reality, no communication, no career progression, middle-management comprised of screaming alcoholics, etc.  The once interesting opportunities are drying up quickly as the company has focused on “organic” growth and switched to cost-cutting and maintenance mode.    It boggles the mind watching such a profitable company drive itself into the ground.  The company maintains a cash balance of 1.8 billion dollars, margins of an incredible 61%, almost all of which is returned as a dividend to shareholders and barely a dime is reinvested in any sort of innovation.   But why?! Do Google and Apple pay all earnings out as dividends and not re-invest to innovate? Would their shareholders like all cash returned as a dividend, I think not.    Last time I checked, CME wasn’t a utility company, so what gives? 

This “organic growth”(a euphemism for 0 re-investment) focus has left what remains in the middle-management layer scrambling to justify its existence in an ever shrinking pool of opportunity beyond business as usual work.  The doer level employees are left with the scraps, despite having more to offer, while the management put themselves in front of meetings scrambling to drink from the ever drying well of opportunity, desperate to keep their spot.   Ground level employees are left doing monotonous tasks and have no meaningful involvement, no opportunity, zero progression.  

The resulting environment is one of resentment, indignation, boredom, and apathy among staff, and massive career insecurities at the middle manager level.   Survival for the management layer is priority 1 and this only brings out the absolute worst in people, translating to back-stabbing, petty politics, abysmal management, no career development, lacking communication, and flagging employee morale.  

Meanwhile over at the ED/MD/Sr MD rainbow unicorn palace in the sky, things couldn’t be better!  Their middle management yes-men reports do what they’re told, never complain, and deliver their ever shrinking workloads with a smile.  For the executives in the high castle, costs are being cut, profits are flying in(thanks macro-economic environment!), a reducing workload is being delivered, nobody is complaining, and bonus checks couldn’t be better, all of their efforts are a resounding success!  Or are they?  And what about those Engagement Survey results?  What Engagement Survey results, Engagement Sur? Engage-a-what?  Never heard of it.   Career development?  Oh yeah, just go to that online tool thingy and fill it in, yeah it’s real real important guys, we care."

Politics rule here.  Lot of folks advance by whisper campaigning (bad mouthing) their internal competition or by playing golf with management.   Or just by saying yes.  

PMO a joke.  Top guys have a stunning lack of vision and leadership skills.  Hire yes men and hope for the best.  Shocked many still work at the company.  Detractors or folks who voice an alternate view are let go or demoted.  Losing best talent and not recognizing good talent is common practice for missed opportunities.  Many legacy exec directors are holdovers that wouldn't be marketable anywhere else.  Lack of focus on business process gives it that 90s feel where emails and outdated spreadsheets run amok.  Many unhappy folks in leadership affects productivity.  What happened?  

And now offshoring most of IT and eventually Operations?   Good move (sic).  That'll keep talent here.  This last Strategy scheme will undo a lot of good built by rank and file that put the CME where it is.   And will impact quality.  Oh yeah quality  ... forget it.

That was the year of the first IT re-org.  They put someone in charge of Infrastructure that has a shiny resume, but no actual leadership skills and plagiarizes his communications.  Executive and middle management have been replaced with brash people from Citadel in overtly nepotistic ways.  Citadel is known for overly high expectations of their employees and practice decimation techniques.  The difference being is the prop firms like Citadel pay way more than CME does and only expect to retain you for 2 years.  It doesn't work for an exchange.  

I still keep in touch with old co-workers and the morale is worse every day.  They keep restructuring (firing) and plan to outsource anything they can to India.  People are fleeing this company.  If you want stability and a reasonable 45-50 hour work week don't expect it from this company.  You might as well work for a proprietary trading firm and make 20-40% more with the same level of stress, lack of work-life balance, but more money and better benefits."

A good developer usually will get burned out by convoluted change management steps that required.

Directors don't show up to meetings and don't prepare for anything.  There is a total lack of leadership and reinvestment in employees careers.

881,,Poorly Managed On All Levels,2011-11-09,2.0,,"there has always been a very good work/life balance at this company (known to most as ""Dow Jones Indexes"").  they also support flexible hours for many teams.  benefits are extremely good, even with the reduction or elimination of certain programs in recent years.

there is a generally laid back atmosphere, which is nice as well.

good place to start off.

almost everyone there is nice and easy to get along with in a work environment.  the team spirit aspect is definitely very strong in most departments.  from my experience, there is no backstabbing or throwing people under buses from almost all employees.  overall, a very honest, straightforward group that works well together.","first and foremost - salary.  that has always been the number one reason people have left.  but it's not even so much the lower starting salary that upsets people (because remember, they do accept the salary to begin employment there), but rather the fact that NON-MANAGEMENT promotions and raises (other than minimal, across the board cost of living adjustments) are scarce.  this single-handedly destroys morale and furthers the already massive rift between management and non-management.

people don't expect to be in the same position with more or less the same salary years later after joining the company.  but that is exactly what happens to the vast majority of individuals who work there.  this is all while middle and upper management seemingly promotes itself in an endless circle, creating new positions at random when needed and having far too many in the same title.  they only decide to throw a bone to the people actually doing the work after they have given themselves raises and still have money left.  excuses about there not being enough money for promotions is a joke, especially when you hear the CEO tell us how profitable the business is and how great it is doing and we are still hiring new people.

communication is absolutely horrendous at all levels, and particularly between management and non-mangement.  goals, timelines, etc - many time they are non-existent.  most of the time the communication issues stem from people not being able to articulate what it is they really want.  and many times that is simply due to them not knowing.

employees are given a veil of respect by management, but actions speak louder than words.  if you are praised for a great job and have a glowing performance review, why then is there no promotion and/or raise...time and time again.

favoritism is rampant and is primarily the sole reason for promotion decisions, rather than actual performance.

it is most definitely NOT an environment for generating creative thought.  almost all ideas are promptly stifled, whether they have merit or not."

889,,A waste of my time & talents,2011-03-20,1.0,Worker,The compensation and benefits package makes this company a tolerable place to work.  The everyday people who actually make the Exchange function made my time there enjoyable.,"CME Group's culture closely resembles the culture of a bad high school movie. Everyone who is in the ""in-crowd"" can expect to receive favorable raises and promotions, in spite of ability. Those who are ""outsiders"" can forget it. Education and ability are not equally rewarded, while incompetence is handsomely rewarded. And if you have the misfortune of belonging to a minority group, your chances of advancement are nonexistent. Before the misguided purchase of the CBOT, one of the bylines of the CME was ""the Exchange of Ideas."" Unfortunately, a lot of the prevailing ideas concerning fairness and diversity at the Merc resemble some of the more odious ideas which were prevalent during the 19th century."
