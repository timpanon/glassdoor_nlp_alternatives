It was still pretty learnable and I became just as equipped to do my job as the fiance and econ majors.,"Client Reporting Group was easily the most looked-down on by client-facing groups. We were blamed for poor data management although other departments did data entry. We hired contractors from India who were incompetent and unable to reach out to managers. We constantly got locked out of client portals because of them, making us miss deadlines. Effectively, we were the liaison between client-facing stakeholders and an understaffed and underpaid data entry team handling completely incapable contractors. We often got the heat for other departments' problems, and constantly had to be the bearers of bad news. Given the issues other departments had with making deadlines, we tended to work crazy weird hours to finish projects."

165,,"Great place to launch your career, just be sure of what you want",2020-07-12,5.0,Associate Investment Director,"This review is for the GIS team - I can't speak as well to the other groups. 

People:
You receive what you put in - managers are cognisant of the effort you put in and will reward you for hard work and competency. The people at CA in the London office are on the whole a friendly laid back group of people. If you build up a strong rapport there will be a lot of opportunities for you to grow and take on more responsibility. Promotion targets were clearly laid out, and there were no surprises. 

Teams:
On the whole, you get exposure to a more diverse range of clients than at other consultancies (where they are predominantly pension funds). This has become less so following the consolidation of clients under their overarching team groups (e.g. endowments under E&F). Geographically-focused teams still have a range of institutional clients though. 
It was easy to take time off for holidays - i never had any push back if communicated far enough in advance.

Work:
The work provides a strong grounding in asset management across a variety of asset classes. Beware though that the investment analysis is at the fund level rather than the security level. This is an important distinction and affects the exit opportunities available: mostly fund-of-fund, institutional investing, or B-school. CA is a good feeder into top MBA programs if that interests you. There is also a lot of autonomy in the work - so long as you do the work on time and well, then people don't mind if you take longer lunch breaks or come in a little later etc.","Certain personality types, particularly more introverted ones, will struggle. My general observation was that those who were more outgoing and eager to take on work had an easier career progression. This can be a bit hard on certain personality types, though this is to be expected given the work is inherently client-facing.

Some mid-level (AIDs) and senior consultants seem to be a bit too comfortable/settled at the company - giving an appearance that they are just there to collect the pay check rather than push themselves or those around them to be better. I would recommend new joiners try to avoid these people when looking for mentors that will be more invested in your growth.

Hours can be a bit long compared to IM but nothing like management consulting, banking etc."
166,,Great Research Department,2020-06-29,4.0,Investment Research Analyst,"You get to work with smart people, participate in thought leadership, and build analysis with proprietary data.","The experience for each job varies a lot by the department. As someone looking to build a career in investment management or research, look for roles in GIR or GIS."
167,,"Good Culture, Bad Management",2020-06-23,2.0,Investment Associate,The managing directors and analyst culture at Cambridge Associates are top notch.,"Investment Associates typically have to work quite long hours (occasionally up to 80-90 hours per week) but are compensated quite poorly for the effort they put in. Attrition rates are quite high, with over half of my investment associate group departing the firm within 1-2 years. 

Management is deeply entrenched in an archaic thought process - CA is not longer a top-tier placement for young professionals to work and the caliber of undergrad hires has decreased dramatically in the past 5 years. 

Additionally, management refuses to take ownership of abuses and overwork at the junior level. Instead, they act as if the junior level departures are the norm and they refuse to realize that changes must be made at the upper level in order to affect lasting change at the junior level."
168,,Great Place to Start A Career,2020-06-19,5.0,Analyst,"Incredible place to learn investment management, specifically alternative assets. 

Collaborative and friendly work environment","Salary is typically low end for hours you put in comparable to IB or Private Equity.

You will work long hours consistently."

172,,Stressful workplace with unrealistic expectations and poor pay,2020-04-27,1.0,Investment Performance Analyst,Great to have on a resume.,"Dysfunctional teams and unrealistic expectations:
A lot of the work you do as a performance analyst is reliant on work done by other teams in different departments, across many offices. Those other teams regularly fail to deliver what you need to get your work done on schedule. We're talking days or weeks, not just hours, behind schedule. Yet you are still expected you to get your work done by your original deadline, which results in pulling crazy hours and being incredible stressed.
Additionally, unexpected requests will be made regularly and everyone expects their requests to be prioritized. When you push back and try to manage expectations yourself, the response is essentially ""tough luck"". And if you are unable to deliver in the time they expect, it's blamed on you. In a healthy workplace, your manager or team lead is suppose to help manage expectations which leads me to my next point...

Managers and Team Leads are superficial titles:
In a healthy workplace, a manager / lead team is suppose to advocate for you, provide guidance, and manage expectations of others who effect the work you do, which then in turn allows you to work effectively and efficiently. 
At Cambridge, managers / team leads provide little guidance and do not help you manage expectations or advocate for you. They are a ""manager"" or ""team lead"" in title only.

Underpaid:
A lot of what is stated above would be ""forgivable,"" if you were paid appropriately.
A year or so ago Cambridge experienced a large number of people leaving the company. In response to this, they hired consultants to figure out why. The #1 reason (among other things) was that they pay significantly below industry averages. They have done very little to correct this. The ""reason"" they believe they can get away with this is because they have a reputable name in the industry. 

In summary, Cambridge is a toxic, stressful workplace with unrealistic expectations and poor pay."

176,,"High Turnover, Low-Cost Analyst Program",2020-02-07,2.0,Investment Analyst,"Company looks good on a resume. Use the analyst job as a stepping stone to business school or a better job after graduating college. 

Work atmosphere is like a continuation of college. You can wear whatever you like to work and office is extremely laid back.","The analyst program is a low-cost high-turnover program. Lots of people leave after 1-2 years for higher paying jobs and those who stay behind get crunched as management struggles to hire quality people to fill the positions. Starting pay is $65K with a $3K bonus. After one year pay went up to $68K which demonstrates to analysts that talent retention is low priority. Most analysts are overzealous recent college grads who do not know any better so there is a lot of pressure from other analysts and directors to work till 10pm-12am and those unwilling to work those hours for no extra pay aren't considered team players. Very toxic culture that is unwilling to come to grips with any semblance of work/life balance. IA's and directors broadcast that people are staying late and the whole ordeal is very unhealthy. 

The job does not involve much investments, but rather formatting exhibits into PowerPoint presentations for client books. 80% of work involves building these decks for client meetings or calls, 10% involves keeping track of entry/exit dates for investment managers, and 10% actually involves investment and portfolio management. 

Probably 5 percent stay through the 4 year analyst program to become directors. Most people leave because a rigid time-based promotion structure is in place. Analysts  who perform well are kept at the same title and pay as deficient analysts. Any attempt to move up faster is denied."

178,,No One Wants To Be in Data Processing,2020-01-08,2.0,Data Processing Team,"• Get to work with a smart, friendly group of people who I genuinely enjoy working with

• The work is generally pretty easy and low stress outside of peak reporting

• Hours pretty stable, with overtime only needed in peak periods

•Management does allow for schedule flexibility outside of normal flextime arrangements when needed

• Can get experience working with international teams","• At times it feels like the firm has no idea what to do with our department. Too much money appears to have been blown on technological silver bullets that are behind schedule and over budget. As a result, hiring has been drastically slowed down yet there has been notably high attrition .   

• Senior Management seems out of touch, it doesn't seem like they understand the job or what team members do day to day. Their views on the future of the role reflect this. Our department head is in Boston and while they visit Arlington, they have maybe spoken to the entire team once or twice. It is unclear how aware they are of the sentiment on the floor. 

• No real progression in the role after the first promotion.  General progression is Junior Associate; Associate; Analyst; Senior Analyst. Past Junior Associate (first ~12 months)there is no difference between what people at the other three levels actually do in their day to day. Expect to be an Associate performing at the Analyst level until you hit an arbitrary tenure mark (~15-18 months after promotion from Junior).

• Expect to be held to benchmarks from when the team had 2x the people and resources. 

• Client facing colleagues at times can be rude.

• The international team you work with is taking aspects of your job offshore."

So much turnover, employees and management seem to come and go like a revolving door. Always short of staff, everyone is consistently at capacity, this is clearly due to all of the turnover.

Management is very indecisive,  they can’t seem to make a plan and follow though on it. This has also led to a lack of organization from the top management to the Investment Analyst down. Our CRM system is an actual joke no one updates is so client information is never up to date or accurate, which is not great soon we’re a Investment Firm dealing with Billions of dollars.

Absolutely no real room for growth it’s utterly Impossible. There are manager and directors who have been in the same roles for twenty-five plus years and aren’t partners and don’t hold an equity in the firm. This is the huge reason there is such high management turnover, they company doesn’t appreciate their management the way they should.

Largely lacks any type of racial diversity, everyone is a carbon copy of one another.

-Good chance to get leadership experience at a young age 
-Compensation/benefits are good the higher you go in the organization but the investment in junior staff needs to be improved to keep people there.","-No strategic vision on where to go as a firm. Focus is entirely on making clients happy but comes at a cost to other clients/employees.
-Middle management is trying their best but when firm-wide leadership has no idea where they are going and do not give a seat at the table for middle-management, it creates an unfortunate dynamic. 
-Cost cutting is extremely detrimental. Firm-wide management expects cuts in costs every year, even without corresponding investments in technology. People are always expected to do more with less. This is at the same time as the firm going after more sophisticated clients.
-The back office is scary for an institutional firm. There is no recognition of shared services being an asset but only a drain on resources. 
-Incredibly dysfunctional relationship between shared services and front office. No seat at the table for anyone in support services and complete lack of understanding by client facing staff.
-Politics are very toxic the higher that you get in the organization. 
-Technology and technology implementation are the worst I have seen. There is no unified vision on where to go in this space and decisions are made in a vacuum which then end up negatively impacting other groups. Firm-wide management tends to buy things that are 'pretty' but then doesn't understand how to invest in the back end architecture to make that pretty application actually usable.

Got to work alongside a few quality individuals and learn from investment directors. Had access to a rich database of proprietary market research and tools.,"Toxic social culture rampant with gossip. Sociopathic management and team leads with unrealistic expectations and lack of empathy.  Atrocious training program that lacks structure and seems to be improvised from new-hire class to new-hire class. Below market-average pay. Management simply increases your workload once you have a handle on things, leaving you in a perpetual cycle of overtime. Not necessarily their fault due to the high turn-over within the department. Not a true finance culture within PRG, many employees gloated of their lack of a finance background and inability to pass CFA. Management indirectly encourages inefficient work through low salary and overtime pay. Department's idea of ""problem solving"" is PDF formatting and brute force number crunching, both of which are elementary tasks that were effectively carried out by college interns. Error mitigation is reliant upon manually updated spreadsheets that, at times, can take minutes to refresh, aggregating to a lot of time wasted over the course of the day. Expect not to be challenged creatively, but to be challenged by the sheer volume of work given to you. Growth in the department equates to modest salary bump that is disproportionate to the extra work/responsibility given to you. Hard work goes unacknowledged and rigorous debate on department operations/processes is not encouraged, further promoting inefficiency and leading great talent away from the firm. After a webinar by the CEO addressing Cambridge's future and the cultural challenges of the firm, many PRG employees mocked him and made fun of his efforts to address a serious problem that seems to be eroding the entire department of PRG itself, which was very unsettling. Would recommend Cambridge to anyone applying to work in their Global Investment Services department (GIS), but not in the Performance Reporting Group (PRG)."

-	PRG has some of the most kind and supportive managers you’ll find.  They truly care about their employees and want to see you succeed and grow.  I had some personal issues come up during my time at CA, and I’ve never been so grateful for the support and understanding of my manager during that time.  If you need something, all you have to do is ask for it.
-	Benefits, such as insurance and ETO are very generous.  PRG also is very accommodating with work from home requests and flex scheduling.  Also provides CFA and tuition assistance programs to help set you up for future career prospects.
-	PRG sets you up to be successful from day one.  With an extensive training/mentorship program, resources, and continued learning encouraged, you really are given all of the tools you need to be successful. 
-	There’s a lot to get involved in outside of client work, and you have the opportunity to own projects and teams early on in your career.
-	You learn a ton about the industry, and it taught me so much that has helped my career move forward.  I went from knowing nothing about finance to becoming a subject matter expert, and that’s a testament to the resources you have.","-	Peak periods can result in long hours at times, but that’s generally limited to a few days a month. 
-	PRG is an entry level department, so there’s not a ton of growth within the department after a few years.  
-	Pay is a bit lower than entry level jobs at other finance firms, but raises are done regularly and often.
-	Client reporting work can get repetitive at times
-	The department doesn’t get a lot of recognition from firm-wide leadership.  There’s not a ton of engagement from those at the top of CA, and the smart individuals in PRG deserve more than that."

They have the operations groups kept separately from the investment managers so you don't get to learn anything from them and the operations groups are definitely treated like unfortunate necessities that they want to get rid of but can't because they're not very good with technology. Middle managers are absolutely awful at their jobs - meetings are ""so what are doing?"" ""oh that's ok"" ""i have another meeting now"" - literally no feedback and they play favorites with employees who buy them presents or go drinking with them. If you do a good job with your reports then you're given more work - expect to be working much more than 60 hours a week. I was so surprised when I got to my new company and found out the multitude of things that were happening at Cambridge (only a few mentioned in this review) were not normal - - one of my new coworkers told me it's like I have PTSD and I've met with the counselor at my new job (WHOA a company that cares about employees mental health????) and she's appalled at what went on at CA.

Insane micromanagement is the norm. The review calling it adult daycare couldn't be more accurate. Being a Team Leader is nice - if you like having to micromanage every detail of your friends workloads and getting no pay increase. The Assistant Managers are mostly decent but all too scared of higher management to actually advocate for their employees which leaves the floor feeling unappreciated and stuck in a business line that is clearly being phased out.  Every single person in the department is covering more work than ever before and doing it at a higher quality, and management's response was? Make it harder to get promoted, so now it takes a minimum of 2 full years to get paid what's considered a starting salary in most Operations groups at other firms. Not to mention the criteria seems to be based more in if your considered a ""Chosen One"" than your actual work. Once you get that promotion , you basically get pushed out the door, so they don't have to promote you to the next level and pay you a senior analyst salary. If you've been here for over 3 years, it's like watching your own funeral. Responsibilities just slowly get taken away until you give up and move on to another firm."

To start- the collaborative team environment is the perfect place to grow independently, but still feel the support of a team. Everyone in the office is genuinely interested in the success of others. Management has an open door policy, that unlike most financial firms is actually open door. They actively listen to employees concerns/interests and make changes on a real time basis. Cambridge also provides the ability to move into other roles within the firm. Lastly, there is a strong work life balance with the role and the collegiate environment makes it easy to create friendships in and out of the office.","This role is not typically a client facing position.

You learn the systems and then you might have some challenging clients, but really you're done learning anything new. Efforts to up the learning happening in the company are quite sad - ""colleague to colleague"" learning only meaning that a coworker gets assigned to make a one-time presentation on whatever they feel like.

-It can be really hard to fit in if you aren't of a certain type or pedigree. For example, analysts are hired only from Ivy League / top schools (despite having zero investments knowledge), which creates a ridiculous ""bro"" and ""polo club"" type culture. This is also apparent among consultants who went to the same 5 business schools - there is almost no diversity of thought in the firm. Basically, if they taught it at Tuck, then that's what everyone does. This is not just limited to the main consulting organization, but each group has its own ""type"" it hires for. Marketing is full of people who comment on how you are dressed, what you are eating (especially if it isn't gluten free), and how thin people are.

330,,Solid company to start your career,2016-06-01,5.0,,"Working here is pretty much what you make of it. You could go on to complete your CFA, go on to work at a Hedge Fund or get into a top MBA program, OR you could trudge into work everyday, do what you're told and clock out promptly at 4:59 pm. 

There's a ton of opportunity if you know where to look (volunteer for projects that come up!).  I thought the company treated its employees fairly, and I liked the people I worked with. Towards the end, I was going out to the bar for a drink with my colleagues on Thursday nights, and I genuinely enjoyed their friendships. I know of more senior people who worked at big banks only to return to CA for the collegiate, intellectual atmosphere. 

My boss offered me opportunities to learn and was accommodating to a schedule in which I arrived at work slightly earlier and left slightly earlier. This allowed me to go kayaking almost every night during the summer, which was huge for work/life balance. Also, when I left for a new opportunity, the new company told me that they highly valued seeing Cambridge Associates on my resume.  

Additionally, when I was there , Sandra Urie was the CEO, and I can't say enough good things about her. I've never met such a kind, intelligent person. She was soft-spoken when I met her, but surprisingly patient and a great listener (qualities I've found are rare in my interactions with other executives).","The work can be tedious and uninspiring--especially if all you do is reporting or data entry. If you're in that role, you should meet your deliverables and search for side projects. 

The pay was not competitive--particularly for the industry. However, at a younger age, you may be better off accepting lower pay for a solid footing into the industry. Despite being offered opportunities to learn, I left for higher pay, and I regret that decision. CA is old-fashioned, measured, intellectual and built on trusted client relationships. They are the steady hand on the investment tiller. If you suffer from this illusion that finance should be exciting, insanely remunerative and fast-paced, CA is probably not the place for you."

Associates tend to exit to a variety of roles within investing (mostly institutional, although direct investing is possible with some strategic planning). The CA name gets you far (although a lot of other prestigious firms can get you just as far).
- You receive a lot of responsibility early on. It is common for IAs to present in client meetings, as well as hold a position in portfolio construction discussions.","The freedom / responsibility that the IA's receive is a double-edged sword:

- Hard workers are generally rewarded with more work. Promotions are pretty strict (1.5 years), although that seems to be changing.
- Your experience is heavily dictated by your initial client list, which paves your Director exposure over your career. It is hard to pivot out of this initial client list, as many teams are long-term oriented and don't like to risk swapping out a top-performing IA for someone else.
- There is little to no interest in recruiting top talent. IAs with no formal recruiting training are given the freedom to run recruiting (Directors do not conduct any interviews). Say what you will about office diversity, but there is an issue when Recruiting teams think it's okay to reject applicants for falling outside of the CA ""norm"" (AKA queer, non-NESCAC students that don't fit the WASP prototype that parades CA) due to ""fit"" issues.

Over many years the majority of the MD level employees have felt underpaid and under appreciated.  This has resulted in an undertone of unhappiness at this firm.  There is a ""sweep it under the rug"" culture here. There was a known trade off between salary and quality of life here but that is now a myth, which has added to unhappiness.   I believe this has resulted in Cambridge being less competitive these days than in the past."
360,,Investment Performance Analyst and Team Leader,2015-10-26,4.0,Investment Performance Analyst,"Great people with a very friendly and involved culture. Even performance analysts get exposure to the investment directors, who are some of the most intelligent and accomplished people I have been around. From my experience in Performance Reporting, the department leaves it up to the individual to get involved in project work and build a resume and leadership abilities outside of core work. It's normal to become a team leader and analyst in about 2 years, but it's up to the individual. I left the firm with extremely transferable skills and accomplishments and found it to be a fantastic first job out of college. Flex time and working remotely are huge wins also.","In Performance Reporting it was extremely cyclical, so some weeks everyone stays late every night whereas others are not as bad. Also, the firm and department have both reevaluated compensation and benefits to be more fair and transparent, so it's not as bad as it was."

-Good initial exposure to professional setting post college, but don't stay beyond 2 years unless management improves career paths","-Disconnect between offices in communication, strategy, culture, and career opportunity
-Lack of respect for MIG within organization. Strange considering the proportion it carried to the rest of the company and the foundation it provided for the consultants, Benchmark Services,  and research to do their jobs...either way it was incredibly noticeable.
-Very poor leadership at mid level in US office, though this appears to finally be improving, Upper management completely out of touch on day to day operations.
-Poor workload management. A few key persons that were smart and hardworking, carrying the load for the rest that would simply twiddle their thumbs. Partly due to caliber of individuals, partly due to poor management. Management appeared to rather push the good workers to near breaking point instead of taking time to train  those not yet at the right caliber.
-Never have I heard so much complaining and ""venting"" from a peer as I did during my time at C|A MIG..not a good sign
-HR is useless for internal transfers. Have seen them fail in communication several times. Company has lost great employees as a result."

Knowledge: if you're interested in investing or finance, there is so much data and information at your fingertips. You have to put in the effort to analyze it yourself or find some of the few directors with the time and interest to mentor you through the hard analysis aspect because that won't just be offered to you if you just follow the standard track.
Experience: just learning how to operate in a corporate culture vs school is very important and Cambridge is very flexible and forgiving here.
People: a lot of recent college grads. Majority are great people that are supportive. Not the competitive atmosphere of typical finance jobs (pros and cons to this)","so many details we can talk about but comes down to an ownership problem across all levels. From senior management to directors to associates, general attitude is checking off boxes and not thinking through whether that's enough to accomplish the final goal effectively. 
Management more concerned about appearance than being open and honest to really get feedback and fix problems. 
Directors more concerned about appearance in relationships than absolute best return profile.
Associates more concerned with finishing tasks than learning or improving processes so tasks are easier."

The position allowed for a lot of growth, development of soft skills, and the ability to build out a resume quickly. You get a lot of broad exposure to the world of finance, and working for CA looks great to recruiters and  to b-school admissions. Like everyone says, if you put a lot in, you'll get a lot out of it.

386,,Manager Information Group,2015-06-15,2.0,Investment Operations,"As with other mid/back office roles, your job is to please everyone. The good thing in CA is that when you make a mistake, the management team tends to be very forgiving. The environment is encouraging and friendly (save for some competitive few who want to be part of the management team) - your strengths are appreciated and they will try to help you develop your weaknesses. Good for people who are interested to strive for designations such as CFA, CAIA, CIPM etc. as the company pays for those and you will have plenty of time to study. 

You will learn mainly soft skills (multi-tasking, communication etc.) and not technical skills - you do get some asset classes overview, strategies but they are extremely generic and nothing that you can ever apply in other firms. Hence, it is a good first step into the industry but my advise is to leave after a year or else you will get stuck.","There is really very limited things you can learn, and very minimal that is applicable out of the firm unless you are interested in investor relations. When you move on to taking on management positions, your task is more focused on people development i.e. have check ins with members of the team to ensure that everyone is doing fine, write extremely detailed reviews for your team, interviewing of candidates (you will spend hours a week doing so), develop excel trackers to ensure that everyone is doing their work etc. basically, you lose touch with learning any technical skills that will enable you to move on to other roles unless you are looking to go into HR. 

Culture is very sheltered, which is good for risk averse individuals who appreciate guidance, but is nothing like the ""outside world"". I felt like I was in school as we were highly encouraged to take part in auxiliary teams/ book clubs/ toast masters. 

The ability to talk will bring you far. People who are PC can survive well - if you don't believe it, fake it till you make it because that's the key to survival and doing well here."

388,,Performance Reporting Associate review,2015-06-08,4.0,Investment Performance Analyst,"- The culture here is very vibrant, young and collegial, possibly because this is an entry level position and thus we primarily hire fresh graduates. When I first read up reviews about the firm, I thought the term ""collegial culture"" was simply a buzzword, but over the 2 years that I have been here, I can say I have truly immersed and experienced the culture of collegiality and strong emphasis on team work. 
- Flexibility and autonomy: Management here gives employees a lot of flexibility and autonomy to handle day to day operations. I am thankful that I do not have my boss breathing down my neck everyday! 
- Growth: There is a lot of room for growth and career development, especially given that I have joined as a fresh grad. Once again, management provides a lot of autonomy and gives us a lot of room to spearhead projects that we are interested in, as long as we have proven capable.

- Good benefits (401k, Insurance, PTO)
- CFA Reimbursement / Top-Notch grad school opportunities make the Associate experience a great career-starter.","- Lower than average comp for hours worked has resulted in higher turnover at the Associate level. It also (seemingly) strains recruiting efforts, as top candidates go to better-paying firms.
- Experience on the consulting side is 100% determined by the Directors you are staffed on clients with.
- Little motivation to outperform; top performers are simply given more clients and eventually burnt out by overstaffing.
- Management is slow-moving on strategic decision-making and seems uninterested in having a transparent discussion about the direction of the firm. The last Glassdoor review that constructively assessed these misalignments was promptly deleted. I think this speaks to the attitude of those at the top."

The culture within MIG does consist of a bit of micro-management, which is expected with data entry and request-based work.

Most of the managers in the MIG only got the position because they are too boring and unintelligent to figure out how horrible the MIG has become. They act like the head of the department is god and do whatever he says, even present data entry as FUN.  The worst part is, I think some of them think it is fun.
Employees are micro managed.  The department talks about increasing productivity, but so much time is spent on stats reports, updating statuses, and even RECORDING WHAT THE EMPLOYEE DOES DURING THE DAY OVER 15 MINUTE INCREMENTS, that it's nearly impossible to do any real work. 
They still present the job as if employees receive projects like they did when the group first started, but now it's mind-numbing work all day, every day no matter the tenure.
The micro-management in combination with the repetitive, boring nature of the work has caused more turnover than the department can handle.  They are constantly understaffed, pushing more of the mind numbing work to tenured employees who have chosen not to take a micro management position as a team lead, and removing the opportunity to do any type of interesting work."

420,,Save yourself and don't work in MIG.,2014-08-22,3.0,Investment Operations Associate,"* Benefits are great - 3 weeks ETO for your first year, 4 weeks after, which is WAY above standard. All benefits are top notch. 
*  Colleagues are great. Young, fun atmosphere in that sense. We liked to do happy hours, go out to lunch, etc.
* Easy work. You do NOT need a college degree to do any job in MIG, though of course it's required. You can learn as much as you want to, but it's not necessary to do the work. 
* C|A as a whole is wonderful. Great CEO/COO, firm has a terrific reputation, clients love us, etc. We also just hired a CTO so hopefully IT stuff will improve. I recommend the company to a friend, NOT the department. 
* Pay, relative to what you do, really isn't that bad. Also, you get OT which can significantly increase your salary.
* Flextime/flexplace. It's more structured than other places, but it still exists.","* MANAGEMENT. Micro-managers, micro-assistant managers. AMs think they rule the world, and some of them are truly truly awful. Bossy, rude, take all the credit for your work, and the managers aren't around enough to notice. Since a management team shift in September 2012 and the addition of assistant managers in September 2013, there has been insane turnover because the work environment is terrible. The average tenure of my group in the last 12-18 months has probably dropped from ~2 years to less than 6 months. Management acts like they care with their words but never follows through with their actions. 
* Work is repetitive and boring. Once you're through a couple quarters and know what's up, not much is going to change.
* MIG is too stuck on following standards and guidelines to use common sense."

-Associates who want to go onto business school get into top ten schools regularly and the CA name is well known and respected, at least in Boston","-The salary is not competitive in the finance or consulting industries, and while the entry level salary is okay, the promotion increases and bonuses are basically non-existent which can be demoralizing
-While the Associate group is very social and bonds quickly over the long hours, at times morale can be low among the group because the pay is really not commensurate with the hours expected and frustration breeds
-Promotions are decided by ""peer"" leaders, who read the feedback from the consultants you work with and then summarize it and present it to you.  This quickly becomes a popularity contest and puts an unnecessary ""middle man"" in the feedback loop."
437,,Great Firm with Strong Growth Opportunities,2014-04-16,5.0,Associate Consultant,"Much like any thing in life, you get out of it what you put into it. The firm values hard work, dedication, mission alignment, and intellectual curiosity. I found myself intellectually stimulated and was always encouraged to take on additional projects that were of interest or fit within my skill set. The experience I gained through both my normal position and the additional projects on which I worked gave me a rich story pool for business school essays. 

 The real reason you should consider Cambridge is for the people. Yes, the work can be hard. Yes, some parts of it can feel repetitive depending on your position in the organization. However, you will have the ability to work with, and more importantly learn from, exceptionally smart and talented people who take a personal interest in your success. The relationships I left with were truly invaluable, and I’m amazed at how much I grew, both personally and professionally, because of the mentorship I received while employed in the Dallas office.","The organization is relatively flat, so if you need a title the transition may be difficult."
438,,Great opportunity for knowledge building,2014-04-15,5.0,Research Associate,"A role in the Manager Information Group or Performance Reporting Group is a fantastic opportunity for individuals right out of college looking to break into developing asset class-based investing knowledge. The training program is not intimidating at all and allows individuals of all backgrounds to succeed, whether someone’s major was Finance, Accounting or French Literature; this also lends itself to those with more established careers that are looking for a switch into the investing world.","The role itself is a back-office support role; therefore someone is not going to be “making deals” or “making decisions.” However, the work an individual completes on a day-to-day, whether in Performance Reporting or the Manager Information Group, does help the front-office (consultants and research) to make the informed, thought-provoking decisions for Cambridge clients."

The new management team is dedicated to the department and has put PRG on the right track.  Employee engagement increased significantly with the new management team, which I felt was a big positive. Because of the changes there are lots of opportunities within the department to get noticed and grow. If you put yourself out there and get involved, then the managing team will notice you and reward you for your dedication. Colleagues are smart, and you get access to a lot of great research, as well as access to hedge fund and long-only managers. I think this is a good place for an entry level individual, as you will learn valuable skills and get access to really smart people.","The hours can be long and unpredictable, especially around 7-12th business days each month, depending on your client load. Also the ability to move elsewhere in the company isn't clear. If you are not entry level and have a few years of work experience, the growth potential is not as great as fresh out of college."

441,,Save Your Soul; Do NOT work in IT!,2014-03-26,2.0,Software Engineer,"Flexible hours, good work/life balance, very friendly people to work with.","Compensation is a JOKE. If you're a developer, you will never use the latest technologies. 90% of our applications are not MVC based and because we are not a tech firm, there is no interest in pushing for using more robust languages or technologies. If you try to push for making something better or faster by implementing a new process or framework, you will get shut down because everyone in IT is afraid of change. Most developers have been around since the early 90s and have not bothered to learn any new languages since then (all while getting cost of living raises throughout the years). All of our new applications and new projects are being completely outsourced and costing the firm hundreds of thousands, if not millions. Developer roles are now completely support based, no new development is happening. 

This is an investing firm, not a tech firm and IT is always considered a support role to the firm's decisions. Currently everyone in the firm thinks IT is a joke because we have major operational issues and cannot keep servers running smoothly. This then drives the idea that we need to outsource everything instead of promoting/hiring people who actually know what they're doing. 

Don't be a part of this sinking ship."

A lot of micro-managing within the firm."
461,,Waste of Time,2013-11-03,1.0,Research Associate,"Benefits. Excellent benefits including health, transportation, etc.","- Degradingly low pay. Even at the manager-level of the data department it is a wonder how they can support their families on their level of pay.
- No exit opportunities. While you do learn many ""soft skills"" that's all you'll learn. Any other skills are Cambridge-specific according to their proprietary databases and utilities. Whatever transferable skills you do learn are very hard to show on your resume. 
- Micro-managing managers. In the Manager Information Group much of your time is spent on status reports for the next person up...who is spending much of their time on status reports for next person up...etc. etc. etc. At the end of the day you have managers who think they know about each employee but are actually naive. A non-hierarchical structure would serve the organization better. Finally, all reports go to the department head who is never around anyway. Once every six months you'll see him getting coffee before he ducks away into his office. Its basically like the department head doesn't exist--though he is worshiped throughout the department.
- Awful performance reviews. To their credit, management is truly trying to improve performance reviews....but I've been told that it's been four years and they don't have much to show for it. Managers are not specific enough when it comes to what is needed for a promotion or how you can improve. They'll use some general language related to MIG's ""values"" and say how you lack a value. When asked for specific examples, they ramble off in unrelated general thoughts.
- Misleading job descriptions. The word ""research"" is flexible but has a generally definable semantic scope. This position includes nothing remotely close to ""research"". Don't be mislead from the title--you will not provide unique insights into relevant matters. Process improvement and ""self-audits"" are NOT research!
- Mind-numbing work. The good thing is that the Manager Information Group is gaining respect within the firm. The bad part is that this does not change the content of your work. Its true that the department gains more ""business"" from internal stakeholders...but it just leads to more abuse by the consulting and research departments who actually do work that is somewhat meaningful. Your work will be divided into three categories: (1) process improvement--related to the department's operations, tracking utilities, etc. (2) status reporting, and (3) data entry. The latter two take up way too much time for a department that prides itself for being efficient. The first, process improvement, is not nearly as exciting as it might sound. Basically, you need to constantly reinvent utilities and processes because management/the firm is too cheap to invest in long-term solutions (which would cannibalize our department)."

This ethos is shared among staff that are positive, engaged, and who facilitate a highly collaborative environment. Knowledge sharing and thought partnerships are fundamental to Cambridge’s success and indicative of their commitment to employees. The firm is swift to recognize contributions of staff and offer new opportunities for employees to increase their positive impact on the firm and clients.

Given Cambridge's focus on total portfolio advice including Private Investments, Hedge Funds and Traditional Long-only investments, many of the various career opportunities provide a diverse insight into the industry and its varying asset classes. As individuals begin their careers with Cambridge this offers a wide scope to evolve their interests over time. This is a great place to start your career and a great company to grow your career with.","As a global and very diverse organization, it is important that a firm maintain a strong communication strategy to keep all staff educated on company developments.

You may have hopes and desires, but these will be dashed. The only skill you develop is soft skills. Sure, there's value in soft skills. But why not just go into motivational speaking or HR? Why try your hand at finance?

You will learn virtually nothing at this firm and you will leave with few skills and experience to cite than when you began the job.

Money--let's be honest, it's one of the main reasons we enter into finance. Money, money, money. Cambridge will give you none of it. Pay is sub-standard (though it is in line with the skills required to execute the job).

If you decide to join Cambridge, develop an exit strategy from day one. Get in for a year, get the name on your resume, then make your entry into real finance--not some cush job that can be completed by a high schooler."

- Communication between departments is limited, despite groups working together.
- Consultant-first attitude leads to disdain towards consultants.
- Too focused on low-turnover.  Many employees skate by without really putting in the hours of others, but a refusal by management to cut ties leads to complacency and leads to bad work ethic going unpunished."

- High Caliber Colleagues.  My department is very selective when it comes to recruiting which means that all of my colleagues are highly capable individuals.  It feels good knowing that my colleagues care just as much about their work as I do.

- Interesting Work.  I can't share too much here, but I get to build relationships with individuals at all levels of Cambridge and as well as those that work at the industry's leading investment management firms.

517,,RUN THE OTHER WAY!!!,2011-03-11,1.0,Investment Performance Associate,"The people at Cambridge Associates were very nice to work with. The average age of co-workers was probably around 25, so it is easy to form friendships. 

People who go through the 2-3 year career path tend to position themselves well for graduate school. 

This position helps to improve time management and organization skills. 

Free Wall Street Journals! 

The office in Arlington is in a nice location as well.","Where to begin... 

If you are a recent college graduate seeking an entry-level career in finance to learn about financial modeling, budgeting/forecasting, investing, etc. this is not the place for you! The Investment Performance Associate Role is beneficial to people pursuing either a career in data entry/administrative work, or who are using the position as a stepping stone to graduate school. Each associate is responsible for collecting various financial information from funds that clients are invested in. Financial statements are put in PDF form and information including MVs, monthly return, cash flows, and cash allocation is circled and then entered in a proprietary system. After the data has been entered and is corrected of errors, the report is ready to be generated. This process continues as long as you are an Investment Performance Associate. 

Needless to say, very little learning/creative thinking actually took place in this work environment. I felt as if I was killing brain cells every time I entered a number into the computer. The first job that you take should help to develop fundamental skills in the career you choose to pursue. Other than a paycheck, I felt this was a waste of time. 

The position also requires a substantial overtime commitment. I worked anywhere from 40-70hr weeks. There were rumors of people working in excess of 80 hours/week during the busiest times of the control cycle and developing stomach issues from stress. Employees are not compensated for this overtime and there are no bonuses for Investment Performance Associates. 

I could justify the monotonous work, long hours, and low pay if there was some sort of light at the end of the tunnel. Unfortunately, at Cambridge Associates, the light at the end of the tunnel is actually a full speed train on its way to run you over! There are no raises for Investment Performance Associates. You are stuck at $46k until you get promoted to Senior Investment Performance Associate that make around $50k. Investment Performance Associates generally stay in that position for 1-2 years, but I have actually heard of people getting stuck in that position and making the same salary for 3-4 years! Senior Associates are then promoted to Analysts which serve as a liaison between consultants and the Marketable Performance Reporting Department. In other words, they double check your work to make sure there are no errors before sending the reports over to the consultants. There are no incentives to succeed and do well in the firm.

The turnover in this department is also exorbitantly high! I think about 30 people left while I was there. Unreal!"
518,,My time at Cambridge has been frustrating at times but overall a good place to begin your career in finance.,2011-02-25,4.0,,"Benefits and Time-Off are fantastic, Work environment is relaxed, Expands knowledge of Financial Concepts and Principals, Oppotunity to move departments after 6 months","Middle Management si frustrating and not congnizant of day to day operations,  the performance reporting department can be too casual at times."
