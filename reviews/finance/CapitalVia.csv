The research part of company does such a blunder that 95% of the customer stop taking there advice(for which they paid very heavily) after 1 week.
HR is doing such kind of blunder that they are not ready to listen any thing about the polices(thou they also know that their policies sucks). even if we have paid leave balance in our account they will not allow us to take leave.

They are such stupid that if you are ill and you want half day leave , if you are intimating them telephone then they will tell you that you will be terminating ETC ETC.

And yeah, Capital Via has a very favorite word  i,e. (ABSCONDING)  I don't know from where the management learn this word because for every thing they just keep on saying that if you will take a single leave we will abscond you.. But the matter of fact is that there absconding process in totally worthless.

Suggestion for employee:- Leave the company ASAP as I do.
Suggestion for customer:- Don't take their advise because they will spoil your whole investment and will leave you alone in the middle of no where.
