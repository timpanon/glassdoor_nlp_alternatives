6,,Teller job,2022-04-13,2.0,Teller,Get to talk to people.,Management clearly doesn't care about the workforce.
7,,Horrible Experience,2022-04-13,1.0,Software Engineer,There are no pros just cons.,"- Had a horrible manager who just talked down to me, has been negligent in showing up to one-on-ones, a big ego complex and basically gaslighted me and some of my peers. 
- WLB was terrible for me, I worked long late hours and sometimes during the weekends with no OT pay. I've also seen others working way more hours than me as well even working on the weekends and getting called up to fix prod defects.
- Even when working long hours I didn't get rewarded in the end when it came down to compensation reviews and I ended up with a good annual review as well. I basically ended up with nothing, not even an adjustment to inflation.
- They're very insistent on returning to office when all the work can easily be done remotely.
- Compensation is not as competitive compared to other companies.
- They also did a recent layoff to a good amount of my coworkers b/c of higher ups decision to decrease payroll, when our higher ups including Jamie Dimon got a nice pay increase, bonus and stock options.
- The company also cheaps out on labor hiring contractors, consultants, people with H1B visas and workers overseas and making them work long hours.

The work environment was just so toxic in general, with possible legal issues just looming around the corner. I honestly don't know where Leadership is deciding to lead the project I worked on b/c it's just a sinking ship with many holes that they're trying to cover."

Office environment.,"A great way to save money, but you need to know about many policies in an everchanging environment. You are the face of the bank, so if the system is down or a clients check hasn't cleared, be prepared for the wrath. When it was busy, there is no time to relax. You have to keep a rhythm while still keeping your wits about you, checking all the details making sure everything is correct. If you mess up, it could mean major ramifications. This job isn't for the faint of heart and the individual who struggles with multitasking. Throughout my years there I was robbed three times, once at gunpoint. It's expecting the unexpected, always. Don't expect to rise in the ranks unless you spend all your time pitching accounts and services to people and not doing your teller duties. You'll be promoted to a banker position in no time. If you dedicate all your time to making sure teller transactions are done promptly and accurately, management will criticize that you don't upsell and promote their products (which are useless btw). It's backwards a**."

The culture is ok: I haven't met anyone I consider an A hole. Manager is alright.","Compensation sucks. Met a guy working there for 8 years and his total comp is 115k. Bonus is around 5k, or 10k if you're really good, and the best developer still left there made 20k bonus after working literally 12 hours a day and being on call for every production issue. All the good people are looking to leave. I'm paid at 110k total compensation (100k salary and 10k bonus). But this is variable since bonus is variable. And I have a master's degree + 5 years work experience. They barely even give raises, and if they do, it's a very small bump that in some years won't even match inflation. There's also this toxic banker mentality that you need to ""earn"" all raises, even though we literally just an inflationary bump so that we're not effectively making less money. 

The better you are, the worse your work life balance becomes. In the team I'm at, they will expect you to be on call during weekends for prod support. Fixing a bug in prod is the worst thing I've ever seen in a company. The Solution itself is technically simple. But you're not authorized to deploy the solution yourself. So you're stuck in like an 8 hour call just trying to get other people to run your fix, as they try to fight against you. Eventually they finally do, but my god, the amount of red tape you need to go through just to fix a production bug so a customer transaction can go through in insane and idiotic. Management is aware, and they do nothing other than say that you'll be on more of those calls, almost like a punishment for even bringing it up. And you're still expected to get all your normal work day of work done when these daily production bugs happen. So work life balance suffers the more involved you get with the company. They will try to have you work weekends. And for what? The compensation is trash.

They also are forcing everyone to return to the office. Including developers. This is stupidity, 100%"

251,,"If you are not good at sales, this isn't the job for you",2022-02-09,2.0,Associate Banker (Teller),"The benefits are nice and you get paid vacation and sick time plus some personal days. Running daily account transactions gets repetitive, but it's safe and easy. Co-workers have always been great. You have to wear Chase apparel, but the company gives you a yearly allowance to spend on the online store so you never have to spend your own money buying work clothes for them. You can easy move up in the company if you're willing to kiss every butt you come across.","The company is in the middle of a large shift in positions where they have done away with the Personal Banker position permanently and changed the teller title to Associate Banker which essentially means you're a teller, but have access to do basic banker tasks. Eventually the goal is to have Associate Bankers replace the Personal Bankers and begin opening accounts and more. You are no longer solely doing transactions but instead you are expected to do transactions AND promote account products and other services to the customer at the same time and you are expected to manually record every sales interaction so it enters the database. At the end of the month if your numbers aren't looking good, you will get a sit down with your manager. And if you're unlucky enough to have the manager I had, they will harass you and make little attempt to try and help you improve until you can't take it anymore and call it quits. This is how they weed out the remaining Associate Bankers who started as tellers and were never good with sales.

Doing your what is expected of your job or even going above and beyond is not enough to move up or transition in the company. It is known to be very political based. If you have THAT kind of manager, you have to be willing to kiss their butts every chance you get (which is something I've never been able to do). You would think they would look at the skills you do have and help to place you in another part of the company that will help you thrive, but they don't. Maybe you're like me and you've never been good at sales, but your customer service records from customer surveys have always been top tier. Nope. They don't care. It doesn't matter that the company drills ""The 5 Keys to a Great Customer Experience"" into your brain every single day in every single meeting or in every single conference call. It doesn't matter if you meet every single one of the 5 Keys everyday. If you're not selling and pushing for clients to open more accounts or more products, you are a bad employee in their mind."

369,,Stay AWAY,2022-01-07,1.0,Specialty UW,"The company overall provides decent benefits, there is a strong focus on culture and 'fun'..","At least in Specialty UW Jax, management is blatantly abusive. This started around 2015, and became MUCH worse after covid. Working from home, there is no witness to communications, so the abuse simply escalated. It ranges from verbal attacks and condescending comments, to false reports of poor job performance, to outright illegal activity, such as telling an employee they will be terminated if they discuss salary. The salary, BTW, was abysmal compared to industry standard, with highly experienced UWs in the dept that handles only the most complex and non conforming loans, making around $60-80k per year. When people began leaving in droves after covid, the salary was raised to around 100-$110 per year. That's better, but still below standard. And it came with the threat that if you told anyone your salary, you'd be terminated.
When covid first happened, many people stayed home, only to have management openly brag how they'd remember everyone who 'bailed' at bonus time. 
One could write a book on the examples of openly hostile, egregious, and sometimes illegal practices in the Jax Specialty UW dept,, but hopefully a warning will suffice.
If give Chase a try, at least avoid Jax Specialty UW at all costs."

Great company, just not in the branches 


Other LOB’s make 2x for 3x less work and just as much support and freedom. Not worrying about stupid downloads and Plan for the Day that adds 0 value to my day.

We clearly see the difference between the JPMorgan side and the Chase side","You CAN make a lot, more than managers at other banks…IF you have a lot of investment clients, even with caps….OTHERWISE you don’t even get credit for opening the checking and savings, no credit on checking dollars for consumer?! What bank does that? None, and home lending? 1/30 referrals to close…if that, while they make $300,000+ a year. The RB position isn’t respected, you will be forced to open account and work for free, but they PCB will swoop in on all your legwork and take all the credit. But leave you with the maintenance, AB’s in Market Expansion have 0 knowledge and the managers they hire have 0 knowledge around anything, much less than coaching.

They have the most overbearing audit rules that make 0 sense and “misconstrue” something is always a high audit finding…nothing lower…..

I definitely became a much better banker while employed here and they actually have effective methods for calling, building rapport, and closing business. Well known bank with industry leading product offerings in many cases, customers come to you and every calling effort is at least somewhat of a warm lead.",Priorities can often be put in the wrong place. Experience is highly dependent on market and the manager/district manager. The reassigning of roles for the branches is an abject failure. Company is not willing to pay for or even attempt to retain talent for basic staff to the point where they are regularly closing branches because of staffing issues. Customer experience is not prioritized at all. Incentive plan can and will change at a moments notice which can drastically affect your pay.

Most of these calls are cold calling, trying to set appointments or get the client to stop in the branch. You have to be good at selling to be successful in the role. You always calling on the phone. When I’m not on the phone I’m helping the clients that stop in about 40% is account opening, 60% is service issues. I left chase because banking is changing about 90% of what I did in the branches can be done online. Account opening takes about 5 minutes online, but if you stop in the branch can take 30-40 minutes. The pressure to sell is so high, if you don’t perform or hit your sales number, your manager will coach you, or you will be placed on a PIP. I enjoyed my job at first, I just couldn’t handle the pressure to sell 100% of the time. 

Most branches only have 1 banker, so your location could get short staffed. I mention that about 60% of what I do with clients is service its hard to make money. Company doesn’t appreciate you and will always want more, and more. Your success will depend on your calling, and location. You have to sell everything from Credit Cards, Home lending, Business banking, etc.…. They are also big on selling investments to clients all the time."

I know someone else who works there. That person is in middle management. When they speak about work, it is like they are speaking about a totally different planet in a different universe.","They don't care about their customers or their entry-level employees.

 I am very customer-focused, but I have trouble meeting my handle time on calls. I have been told by multiple people above my pay grade to not help the customers so much. I have been advised that I need to think of my own stats rather than helping our callers. Although I have received numerous recognitions from branch personnel, I have been told the reason I get those is because I am doing to much to help them, and they don't mean anything because I have trouble meeting my handle time. 

My immediate manager is constantly threatening me with being written-up. It is a very stressful environment.

For phone work, they do not have a proper training program. They expect you to learn how to do the work while you are actively taking phone calls with real customers in real time. I have worked for two other smaller banks. Both of them had a training environment to review test accounts and make changes so the trainees could learn the systems BEFORE actively taking phone calls. 

Chase has all these different groups you can join, diversity and culture-wise, but it is like an oxymoron because they don't care about their customers or employees."

They pile more and more stuff on you, despite the fact we've been short handed due to covids employee shortage. You get reviews from customers and they post them for all your coworkers to see which can be humiliating if the survey is bad. The reviews also create the possibility to get bonuses for the whole team, but if you get a bad survey you can cause everyone to lose that bonus, which happened to me. It is beyond stressful. I now understand why everyone quit when I started. Honestly, I don't know if the branch I was just like this, or the company as a whole. Oh, they also pay new hires more than some of there long times employees. Which is something more and more employees are catching onto it seems.

748,,Okay Place to Work At,2021-08-02,3.0,Bank Teller,Depending on your manager the hours could be flexible. Depending on the branch work could be slow.,"You will have to work part time to get your foot in the door, then eventually you will get more hours.
Performance based on needing to get a 5 star rating. Just based on my review of not giving 5 stars across the board everyone in the chase corporate office will probably get a talking too. It's a very brain dead way of rating work ethic and giving bonuses to employees."
749,,Chase is a Joke,2021-08-01,1.0,Bank Teller,"Seeing people’s banks accounts. Noticing how people act like they got it, but their account shows less than 5 bucks. Hilarious.","If you are thinking about working for this company, do not work at the bank.. especially if the position you are applying for is for “teller”. Your job title might describe you as a teller with teller duties, HOWEVER, if you are in a branch with those “fancy new ATM’s”, you will be the adopter of the branch. What is an adopter you might ask? Well, let me explain. Adopters are those who get the misfortune of standing at the door for the majority (if not the entire time) of their shift and greeting customers while awkwardly trying to force them to say what they are going to do at the bank today. They also have to help the stupid people who don’t know how to work an ATM and force a conversation on the people who use the ATM’s. Some times the people at the ATM don’t want to have a conversation, and it is awkward when they don’t want to have one, but it is your job to make them talk to you. Me personally, I use the ATM so I don’t have to talk to anybody. Nope, not at Chase. You have to talk to every single person. Guess what else you get to do if you’re an adopter! Absolutely nothing! Some hours of the day at Chase are slow. Which means standing around doing nothing but waiting by the door hoping someone comes in so that you can beat them down with questions like “what brings you into Chase”, just for them to be like, “nope, I’m going back to the teller”. It also gets annoying to hear “oh, these ATM’s are going to take your job”. Toward the end of my time with Chase, I started not to care and would respond with “that’s okay, they can have my job. I don’t do anything anyway”. Customers would also ask, “why do you guys promote this ATM so much? some times it is not faster than the teller” most of the time I’d agree to spare an argument. But they were right. Some times there was a line at the ATM, but not the teller! It was ridiculous at times because the back teller would be on their phone while I’m at the front trying to herd cattle. It is your job as an adopter to force everyone to use the ATM’s. The more people who use a teller, the worse the branch’s numbers are. They only have you up there because they only care about numbers. And you HAVE to stay put at the front. You can’t leave unless you have someone watch the front for you, most likely a banker. Even if the banker agrees do watch the front for you, they do so reluctantly. Nobody likes to be at the front. If there was a big line at the teller, and no one was available to watch the front, you’d have to let the customers wait and have the back teller do all of the work, which was frustrating because they were sometimes so slow. Then I’d have to hear it “is there no one else to help”. There was nothing I could do. Chase puts more of an emphasis on its ATM’s than it does their customers. It is also embarrassing to have to ask someone to watch the front to go to the bathroom. It makes you feel like you are in kindergarten all over again. Everyone else gets the freedom to walk around and go to the bathroom whenever they’re not with a customer. But adopters have to wait. Adopters are pretty much the butt of the company. They are the first face a customer sees, which means the angry customers that come in are going to start yelling at you just because you’re the face.

Tellers/adopters don’t get paid enough to deal with all of the bull corn you will deal with on a daily basis. Pay is nothing less than 12/hr anymore because Chase does not allow employees to be paid less than that. It is still a sad wage. It puts you under the poverty line. If you are with Chase for awhile, expect to not get raises past a certain dollar amount. You will have a better salary at WalMart. Sad, but true. 

The employees that you will work with are all fake. It is sickening to watch them be fake with certain customers, and then talk mess about them once they leave. I also noticed how much behind they kissed when it came to people who had money. They treated them extra special so that they could sell financial products to them and make the compensation money. But the people who came in and had no money, they would get treated like vermin. They are also fake to your face. Most of them are alcoholics. It’s understandable because I can tell they are unsatisfied with what they do. It is funny to me because they always complain about the bad pay, but they stick around at Chase because they don’t know what else to do with their lives. 

If you are a teller, you will mostly report to the lead teller. Some branches have multiple lead tellers, depending on how big the branch is, and some will just have one lead teller. If there is one lead teller, they are the lead teller operation specialist. It is just an excessive title for what should be assistant manager, only they are not paid like an assistant manager. They have just as much, if not more, responsibilities as an assistant manager. Chase is downsizing and most branches don’t have an assistant manager anymore, which is why the LTOS position exists. The LTOS at my branch would get almost 50 hours every week, probably to compensate the sad pay they get. This was unfair to the other tellers, as we were only able to be scheduled a max of 20 hours, 30 if you were a favorite. Which brings me to my next con, favorites. If you are not kissing enough behind to management, expect to have less than 20 hours a week. Also, expect to always be the closing teller if you’re not a favorite. It is annoying to be the closing teller because half your day is gone because you will go in mid-afternoon, which means you’d better get all of your errands done in the morning. On some days of the week, the closing teller will have to stay with the LTOS while they restock the ATM’s. This will cause you to leave close to 7. Most LTOS’ are lazy as well. They expect you to do all of the closing duties by yourself while they click around on Amazon instead of balancing their money. They think they are above the things you do, when in reality, they are also a teller just like you.

Chase has all of its employees do monthly assessments. Most are redundant, and if you score less than a 90, it hurts the branch’s numbers. Chase also adds a bunch of pointless training every month for everyone to do. They expect you to finish it between customers, but some of the training tasks will time out if you are inactive for some time. There are also monthly questions called ICSC’s that the LTOS has the pleasure of bothering everyone with. It is a required task that Chase makes everyone, except financial partners, participate in. They are lame questions that get asked such as, “can you explain to me what we do in a burglar situation?”, and you have to give step by step instructions, or else the LTOS will tell you the answer needs to be more specific. 

Every individual Chase branch’s success relies heavily on OSAT scores (customer satisfaction surveys that are sent out to random customers who have recently visited). Every morning during the huddle, we will go over numbers and we find out how our OSATs are. We get categorized as bronze, silver, or gold, and anything with a score below 65 is nothing. If we finish in any of the three categories at the end of a quarter, we get money for the branch to celebrate and we also get a bonus. However, the bonus is a joke. A huge percentage is taken out of the bonus check due to taxes. At Chase, you are just a number. You are easily replaceable. I watched a banker get fired due to failing numbers, but this man was with Chase for 23 years. Instead of coming up with a solution for him, he was let go. The next day, he was replaced with a different man. It happened that quickly!

Hours at Chase are long and dismal. Open at 9, close at 6. A little known fact is that all Chase banks actually open 10 minutes early and close 10 minutes late. Which means that someone can walk in at 6:09 and cause a banker to stay until 7:10. You’re lucky if you get a lunch break. Every state is different when it comes to break rules, and in mine, it is not a law to mandate brakes. It is ethical to allow a break though. If you work a certain amount of hours a day (i.e. 9-5), you’ll probably take an hour lunch break. I as a teller worked 6 hours, some times more, a day, and I would never get a lunch break. I would always leave work starving. It is also difficult to stand for 6 hours straight. As an adopter, they did not allow us to sit down. On the weeks where I would have to work 6-days straight for a month because other tellers were on vacation, I would go home and have to ice my feet. I’m actually in great shape, yet I was having feet and knee problems. Dress shoes are not the best shoes to wear while standing around all day everyday.

If you start off as a teller, you can probably have a good chance of moving up to a banker or manager. But if you want to apply for a corporate Chase position after being a teller, forget it. It is difficult to move out of the branch setting if you are a teller. It’s not worth it though. There were corporate Chase employees that would come into our branch some times and they would often throw shade about Chase when talking to me. Haha.

Telling people I worked for Chase was cool because it made me sound important.... just as long as they didn’t ask what I did there. Once I said I was a teller, they’d give me a MEH face and say “oh...” Then it’d become awkward. Leaving Chase completely was the best thing I did for myself. Walking out of that branch for the last time was like walking out of prison."

Their system is extremely intuitive. Everything is very simple and easy to learn because of an efficient work flow and system.

Working alongside Chase Partners is key and many are very experienced and willing to help. If you build a good relationship with partners, youre bound to do great.","Just as many great branches there are, there are just as much if not more dead branches. These branches get so slow on average, I saw only 3 people per day or none at all. With that kind of performance, you can expect a poor work environment. Coworkers are so worried about their own success, it feels very fake/pretend happiness that there is no team building.

In a dead branch, you get the worst computers and speed. Every morning, on routine, I would login and within 10-15 min get booted off the system. I would have to restart everything before I can start my day. Very Very slow computers in many of the branches.

The partners dont visit the dead branches on a daily, They come when necessary and spend the rest of their time in better branches to build their book. These leaves the disability of building a connection with my partners. Chase also changed the incentive plan to force RBs to slave away and make nothing. Absolutely nothing

Then there are the the poorly run organizations filled with politics and poor leadership. The signs always always there early, do not wait, it will not change. Move internally or move on.","A con that applies to everyone is the PAD Personal Account Dealing policy which restricts what you can do with your investments (stocks, real estate, family business involvement, etc.). The limitations and policy are downplayed in the offer. Examples include, you must, no exceptions, own any stock you purchase for 30 days. If the underlying company announces something as drastic as bankruptcy on the 29 day, too bad, you must hold it (of course the bank and the funds it manages are not held to these restrictions). You can not buy/sell stock without prior approval from the bank... no exceptions regardless of your job function. Anyone who wishes to retire before 70 needs to look at the PAD very closely.
 In addition, as mentioned... politics run rampant in this company. The bank made an effort to replace upper management with new faces with good industry reputations but middle management which vastly outnumbers them. Individuals with 20+ years who acheived promotion thru the politics and relationships vs merit. Its very important you learn as much as possible about your manager before accepting an offer.

You will get an annual review at the end of each year and that determines any pay raises. There are only 2 categories that they judge your performance on and you can either be On-track or Growth Area. BUT since literally every aspect of your job is put into TWO categories if you are having a hard time grasping ONE concept they will give you a growth area rating which means NO RAISE FOR YOU! At the time of writing this I, an employee of four years, with multiple raises over the years to the point of making almost dollar more then the new hires last year, am currently making LESS THEN SOME NEW HIRES!! This is called pay compression and it is a well documented business situations that is regarded as one of the worst situations a company can be in. But instead of actively trying to rectify this Chase is ACTIVELY making sure it happens. Chase is not a reputable company it is a large, scummy, corporation that slathers clown make up all over itself to make you THINK it's a great company to work for but the truth is they will treat you like you are the dumbest insect to ever dare crawl your way into their presence."

Inclusive company discussions about minorities, the LGBT+ community, mental health, etc.","If management in your branch is terrible you’re SOL, expected to do the job of a banker without offering incentives and with less training than an actual banker gets. Over exaggerated development and promotional opportunities. Pretend they are all about the employees experience but if there are any issues it’s written off as gossip. Working later hours than originally communicated due to last minute issues and poor planning on managements part. LAO gets away with treating employees disrespectfully, talking down to them, passive aggressive behavior, yelling, constant criticism. Branch managers can be as nice or patronizing, as supportive or as belligerent as they want to be. They all get away with bad behavior like they would at any company. Chase just pretends to hold high standards without actually enforcing them. They overwork everyone and expect everyone to be cross-trained in every position but only pay you for one position and it isn’t worth the money even though it’s better than most jobs. Bankers get paid hourly wages barely higher than associate bankers but they receive incentives for the products and services they offer to clients. Associate bankers are expected to offer and up sell without receiving extra pay. Company cutting corners by having us open new accounts for clients on a tablet so they don’t have to pay incentives. Expected to do over the top things for clients like call a company they paid too much money to as to sort it out for the client if we can’t help them from Chases end.

-Extremely unreasonable goals. Depending on the department you will take a HIGH volume of calls just one call missed will fail you for the month 
-High stress/Anexity inducing job.. if you care for your health this isn’t the place for you
-Management doesn’t care about you, they just care about how their numbers look they will try to get rid of you as soon as you have any difficulty with the job.

Do yourself a favor and steer clear from this place it will be the best decision you ever made"
1200,,Not bad,2021-03-13,4.0,Lead Associate Operations,"good work life balance. 3 weeks of vacation, 3 personal days & 2 weeks of sickday that can rollover. insurance benefits, 401k",dealing with rude customers. getting bad surveys under your name every week for customer experience can create alot of pressure because sometimes it's not your fault. bankers have to make 75-90 phone calls a week mandatory.

1203,,Relationship Banker San Francisco,2021-03-13,4.0,Relationship Banker,"People actually like banking with Chase. Overall its a good company, and they do a good job of hiring good people in my experience.","As a banker, the way you make moeny is by referring people to advisors for things like business banking, financial advising, and homelending. The incentive caps are brutal here in SF. For home lending your incentive is tied to the first $500k, anything above that you get nothing. So if you get a client to buy a home with Chase, it doesn't matter if its a $500k condo or a $2million mansion, your pay will be the same. So basically in SF, you will hit the commission cap every time. That can be good or bad depending on how you look at it."

1206,,Great Company,2021-03-13,5.0,Associate Banker,Chase is a great company to work for and has a low turnover. They work really well with student schedules and have great mentors. The company has amazing company culture for MOST branches and they pay better than most banks.,Growth in the company is a little difficult if you start as an associate banker and they typically do not offer full-time positions in this role and it is hard to balance another job while working at Chase.
1207,,Overall good pay & good benefits,2021-03-12,4.0,Senior Specialist II,"The pay is above average for the area and the benefits are great. It’s recession proof. Even during tough times like the pandemic you have job security. Your colleagues are really nice for the most part. I believe you start off with 3 weeks paid vacation now and it doesn’t take many years to get 4 weeks, plus 6 sick days and 2 personal days in addition to 12 weeks paid maternity.","They are all about the metrics. If your numbers aren’t in line they will let you go. Now they do work with you to help you if you’re struggling, but your metrics are important. A call center environment isn’t for everyone. I’ve been with the company 12 years and overall it’s a good job, but you have to continue to perform if you want the schedule you prefer, holidays off etc & to keep your manager happy."

1289,,Worked for ten years,2021-02-21,3.0,Branch Manager,Chase provided me the ability to create wealth for myself and a stable job i could rely upon. I received fair treatment and opportunities for growth during my time there. I started as a teller and worked to become a manager and was one for 6 years. They attempt to build a strong culture and try to care about their employees.,Upper management doesnt seem to understand the day to day operations of a branch. They force feed you employee appreciated but fall short when their is a true need. There are not many plans in place to facilitate short staffed branches. I have been told in order to be moved up in the company I would need to move/shmooze people I found repulsive. The pay is not on par with other financial institutions. If you move up through the company as I did the only way to get a well paying salary is to leave and come back. Managerial bonuses are a yearly decisions and can be impacted significantly by staffing they is out of your control.

Right after the acquisition, you can tell everything went downhill. It just got worse and worse. The company changes everything up yearly as far as how they operate and when I was a banker, they drastically cut the commission which is why I went to be a manager. The way chase works is the person high on the ladder, to protect their job, has to throw someone below them under the bus, and in turn, the next person throws another subordinate under the bus to avoid the axe. Very stressful job and the company seems greedy. Before I left they cut a bunch of staff in lieu of machines that nobody likes so that tells you they care more about saving money than customer and employee satisfaction, regardless of what they say. Washington mutual was WAY better to work for."

1351,,Disappointing and depressing,2021-02-03,1.0,Full Time Associate Banker,"They provide decent benefits (I wouldn’t say great,) and plenty of vacation time, for an entry level job the pay was pretty good","Literally everything else. At least in Market expansion, no body has it together. My manager was ill prepared for management, training was three months spending eight hours a day at a computer learning about robberies and bank laws and learning nothing about the actual job, and they’re entirely sales based. On my interview I was told this is not a sales job, they “build relationships.” Obviously that’s my fault for believing a company like Chase would care about its customers but it was very misleading to go from that to being forced to call at least 30 people a day to ask them to use auto save when we had just opened and no body knew who we were or why we were calling. I was asked to call credit card only customers and ask if they need any help, and if they said yes I was to direct them to a hotline. My manager was condescending and frantic and is still making my old coworkers miserable to this day. The people who worked at chase before market expansion told the new bankers that chase isn’t usually such a horrible place to be, so I can’t speak for other markets. But I was depressed going to work everyday and quit my job without a backup plan because it was that miserable, and I have been employed in some way since 16. It was genuinely the worst experience of my life, I could go on for hours about why market expansion is miserable and no body should work here. Also, it’s seriously like a cult. The managers that talk about chase like it’s the greatest place and speak in chase language (build relationships! Remember your five keys! Have ‘me too,’ moments with your clients!) and are afraid of upper management and to say a single negative thing about a company that is CLEARLY failing it’s employees are drinking some kind of kool aid. Scary stuff."

1366,,Good Company - Not a great position,2021-01-26,3.0,Relationship Banker,Good benefits if you make under 60k. Lots of resources for employees.,"This is a review for the Relationship Banker position. To sun up this position is basically like playing the role of Notary, Tech Support and Used Car Salesman. In this position you will get endless requests to notarize documents regardless if the customer is a client of a chase or not. Sometimes they are greatfull for the service. Tech support, if you like people asking you how to use thier phones and walk them through all thier issues understanding not only the Chase App but any other reason they are having technical issues. Then it moves into the salesman aspect of the role. They will tell it is offering solutions for the customer , but ultimately it comes down to Chase wanting you to influence the customers to move all thier business to Chase. Which is fine, Chase is a business and needs this to grow, but if you don't enjoy sales you won't enjoy this aspect of the position."

I found most of my time at Chase being short staffed and always trying to catch up. The commission structure was terrible and hard to track while working. I think this is done purposefully to keep from paying employees what they are truly owed. And the pay is also horrible."

Working a job at a bank is somewhat of a noble profession in that at the end of the day, you are always helping someone financially from starting a savings plan to passing inheritance on to family. From buying your first home to helping to finance the goal of purchasing rental homes. You will build relationships with good people. Since the company is in over 30 states. More than likely wherever you want to move to or travel to, if it's a large city the chances are Chase Bank will be there.","Unfortunately, there are some huge cons to the company. On a scale of 1 to 10. 10 being the worst, Chase Bank is a 20 when it comes to being micro managed. Especially in the retail branches, branch managers and their market directors are encouraged to plan out and set before you your goals each and every single day. This is for new bankers as well as tenured bankers. You are constantly compared to your peers and made to feel as if it's a one size fits all approach. You will be pulled daily in about 20 different directions. And no matter what is going on, with the company, a client or even in your personal life, you will be held to an unrealistic amount of phone calls, and meetings scheduled and held and lead generation and what leads are worked and when you'll call them back... etc. And everything is tracked. The company is very widget based choosing to focus completely on numbers and metrics rather than focus on helping employees to be the best version of themselves and have personal and professional growth and just truly helping clients. Also, unfortunately, with all this stress, upward mobility is highly impossible and the path forward is rarely show to you. If you are a banker, you may be able to be a branch manager one day. That is about it. Forget being able to be a financial advisor, employee working in the private bank or a commercial bank employee."

1610,,A Mixed Bag,2020-10-17,3.0,Relationship Banker,"Being that JP Morgan Chase is, (well) JP Morgan Chase, they do have some of the best technology that banking has to offer. Their systems are incredibly fast and user-friendly, making the operational aspect of your job seamless. The benefits are pretty good too; I was hired towards the end of the year and received 6 personal/vacation days to use in addition to some sick time. They also give you $150 every year to use to purchase Chase-branded attire; and some of it is pretty neat! If your manager allows it, the Chase ""swag"" that they have available to order is pretty awesome too. It can range from vests to wireless chargers to headphones to umbrellas which you can always take with you at the end of your tenure. The work-life balance was great too. You seldom have to work overtime and you get your schedule a month in advance. And finally, you do get a free Premier checking and savings account with employee coding, meaning that there are no monthly service fees regardless of the balances you keep. The perks of working for the biggest bank in the US!","Chase invests a lot of money into employee benefits but skimps IMMENSELY on salary. They give you a ridiculously low base salary and then say that you can make much more by producing deposits and investments for them. The sales commission is literally what determines whether or not you'll be living lavishly or eating microwave ramen noodles until your next check. That being said, it made me feel like I'm nothing but a sales machine to them. They also do these little certifications where you can choose to become a Small Business Specialist, a Manager on Duty, Medallion Certified, and/or a notary, but do not offer additional compensation for it as it is good for ""your own development."" When it comes to yearly raises, they don't always grant them. I was told during my review that I make my own raise. It was a punch in the gut that led me to look elsewhere for employment. The nail in the coffin for me was how they handled COVID. We reduced our hours and were told for the first few months that we were not allowed to sit with clients at our desks until we could have plexiglass installed. We could perform banker transactions behind the transaction line. However, our manager STILL had us sit with clients at our desks because, money, right? They promised us some sort of deal with Uber and Lyft that never happened. They gave a $1000 COVID bonus broken up into 2 months that came out to a little more than $500 total after taxes. Instead of giving us some sort of hazard pay for continuing to work, they bought us lunch every Thursday. I would have much rather that they keep that money and pay it directly to us. Oh, and the growth is far and few in between."

Commissions can be good if you are in a good area.","Branch employees are overworked, undervalued and underpaid. The company is so massive that you become just another number. Branch employees are basically the grunts of the whole operation, they do all the work imposed by upper managment that have no experience working inside of a branch. Your job will be at risk in transaction or new account you open because policies and procedures protect the company and not the employees. As a branch banker you will be expected to prioritize cold calling over interacting with customers physically at the branch. Your sales production will be irrelevant if your cold callling numbers are low. The company promotes digital banking and skiping the trip to the bank, but doesn't allow branch employees to assist through any digital channels. So instead of being able to help clients over the phone, or online, employees are forced to tell clients to do it themselves through self service options. Branch employees have minimal support, branch support is overseas and are simply robots that read policies back to you."

1798,,A company that cares about people,2020-06-11,5.0,Private Client Banker,"Chase truly cares about people. I see it in how we as employees are treated, and in how our clients are treated. Even though my role is sales, I feel more pressure from management to offer great service than to hit numbers. They have taken phenomenal care of us during the Covid crisis, even though we are ""essential"" workers and go into the branch each day. The PTO is generous and the benefits are excellent. I've worked with many amazing teams and had ample opportunities to grow and progress my career. I believe in what this company stands for and admire the executive leadership team. For as long as I work in the finance industry, I plan to work for Chase. I don't know of another big bank that cares this much.","It's definitely retail - you have to work into the evening and on Saturdays. Each branch is a bit of an island, mostly at the whim of the branch manager and their direct supervisor, so if either of them are not great, you definitely notice. I've seen great people prevented from making career moves due to local management's social games and pettiness. To make a career move, you take a temporary pay cut, since you are largely paid by commission. To transfer, you basically have to start over on building your sales pipeline. Each promotion I've taken has resulted in 6-9 months of lower income while I build up my pipeline again."

I'm all for constructive criticism but they're just plane rude. also you can only work part-time for this position which sucks because the higher positions that are full time require you to move up through all the lowers positions first and require years. inconsistent scheduling. your schedule changes every single week so it's very hard to plan around."

1864,,Chase is a great place to work!!!!,2020-04-22,5.0,Branch Manager,"I really enjoy my time working at Chase, it's been a great experience for me. I'm completely new to banking, and I had a MD take a chance hiring someone without any experience. I can say after only having a little over a year with Chase it's been great.  

  

The training program was great for me I had to learn banking from the ground up, I started off as an AB, then moved to a PB, and completed my BM training in multiple locations. The support from my MD, and peers has been great, I enjoy working for this company.  The benefits Chase provides are great, Health, Dental, Legal, 4 weeks of vacation etc.....   

Chase really is a good place to work, I enjoy working in the branches, everyday it’s different, I enjoy that part of the job. 

 

Pay is really good my first year I received a bonus over 10K which was nice.  Branch Managers have protentional to earn about 40K a year in bonuses.  

 

Chase also puts a big focus on Diversity, which is another reason I enjoy working for this company.  

 

 

I’m glad I took this job, I’m glad I working for the largest bank in the country, Chase.",I would like have like if the company kept the pension.

1866,,Chase Bank cheats thousands of small business owners AND their employees,2020-04-20,1.0,Personal Banker,None except they make it easy to leave.,"Shady business practices.  Chase prioritized larger PPP loans so that they could make more commissions. My wife and I asked for less than $100k, but I am sure that requests for $10m where much more attractive to Chase for the commissions. Shameful."
1867,,A good steady job - still retail,2020-04-19,4.0,Teller,"You're inside the entire time (unless something is going horribly wrong..).
The work isn't particularly hard: their teller system is easy to learn and your job responsibilities are limited. 
Pretty good pay (don't accept less than 15$/hour, that's the average and I've heard Bank of America starts higher)
Depending on location, you can get as many hours as you want. Relate to your manager that you want to pick up more hours, even at other branches and they will let other managers know that you're willing to do that (be ready to get called randomly, even on your day off if you do this).
Tons of resources. It's a giant company, and if you're smart and persistent you can definitely go places. Easy transition to becoming a banker.","You have nowhere to run - you will be sitting at the teller window all day, and you absolutely will deal with some nasty people. If you can't handle that/ if you don't like to interact with people, don't work this job. 
It. Is. So. Boring. The work is easy, but truly monotonous. You are literally a human ATM. 
No worker's union - corporate says that they care about you but don't believe it for a second. The company wants to save money - as time goes on, roles will be more consolidated but pay will not increase. 
Expect to be understaffed (why pay for more workers when ATMs do more work for less?). Also, this job is only not dumb easy when you're understaffed, at which point is somehow becomes hard AND boring. 
Lastly, if you want to work in corporate, starting here will be a long, long road. This is a retail job, and the strings connecting lines of business in this company are thin. Better to start low level corporate than try to get your foot in the door on the retail side."

1874,,"Can be interesting depending on team, but bureaucracy is constant and priorities always changing.",2020-04-09,3.0,Software Engineer,"Okay experience and pay.
Trying it's best to become more tech focused.
Pretty good work life balance across the board from what I've seen.
Could be a great place to settle at the end of your career depending on your situation.","Still not even near a traditional big N tech firm despite trying to become more tech focused.
So much bureaucracy.
Slow pace can be frustrating if you're young or ambitious.
Experiences vary DRASTICALLY between teams so vet that as much as possible.
High to C-level people in management moving/leaving has lead to constantly changing top-level priorities, which in turn can lead to greenfield projects that are dated or no longer aligned with firm goals within months of development work."

Part of my roles included handling executive office complaints, a specific department had a backlog of 45 days however the executive office CEO wanted us to tell people it was a 48 hour turnaround (for legal compliance) during a recorded conference. Reported this to our code of conduct/ethics line...the CEO that was recorded instructing multiple people to lie received a promotion. I also witnessed discrimination illegal at the state and federal level. People who used sick time were openly and clearly discriminated against for promotions. This is not one of those hush hush things, this is stating the reason why someone didn't get a position is because they used sick time. When I spoke up against this my manager told me 'to sue'. People on FMLA were also punished for using it, workforce would often fail to adjust statistics on people who used FMLA to the point that a single day of FMLA would destroy someone's entire month of schedule adherence. Workforce was apathetic to the issue saying they were overloaded. These people on FMLA were then shuffled to managers that were not favored, basically screwing over the manager and his team. Chase struggles to innovate, and is more focused on traditional banking instead of leading the pack. As a result, what was once a good leading brand is now becoming stale and dirty."

* good career advancement if you have the right management on your side","* say good bye to work life balance. As a banker you WILL be working 8:30am to 6:30pm. My daily commute was 7:40am leave and come home by 7pm everyday.
* As a PB you are still responsible for being a teller. You are required to do every position in the branch without additional hourly compensation 
* short staff every saturday
* saturdays are supposed to be 2 on and 2 off alternating. This is only a suggestion, if whoever does the schedule at your branch is more concerned about their work life balance, be prepared to be working 8 Saturdays in a row.

Ineffective training, only on the computer and no hands on work. Their “customer obsessed” approach is counterintuitive. They charge fees to cash a chase check but expect the tellers to make up for the fact that Chase does not actually focus on the customer. 

I hated going to work. I haven’t work there in months but very often reflect on how grateful I am to not work there anymore.

They caused a crisis last June by not telling us something major was coming, and then didn't give us any talking points or answer any of our questions for THREE WEEKS.  By then, it was handled. It's a good thing that they hire the best of the best because we had to handle it, and boy, did we take care of it.  We are the reason your customers didn't bail."

There is also something too be said for working within a culture of diversity and differentiated management styles.  The main focus at the company is giving the best possible experience for the client or prospective client from the very get go, and remaining consistent in a fast paced technology curved outcome oriented environment.  Despite regular routine performance reviews and top down challenges, the opportunity for growth experience I felt was terrific. The opportunity of income was also available with diligent effort.","Two mission critical management challenges facing branch management are staffing and attrition.   When there are too few personnel to fill the branch shifts and allow for time away, personal verses work life balance suffers.  The burden can be very very taxing for the extant staff.  Additionally, managerial competence with requisite  organizational team leadership is essential to sustain a branch through troughs in staffing."

Chase likes to promote this approach internally called “One Chase” where multiple business partners from different LOB can help one customer essentially cross selling different products from lending to investments. Has a lot of great consumer banking products and the best credit cards imo at the moment.,Management including upper management doesn’t care about your happiness or your pay. Pay for employees is the same nationwide and there is no consideration for employees working in expensive cities. Meetings are never done when they should be so business partners from different lob are never in check. No means of being proactive only reactive when things go bad.

Pay is decent. With such a well recognized name it is really easy to convert leads and the phone  is always ringing.,"You will be working on the most outdated and insufficient technology still on a DAS based system that constantly has problems. And the new system I'm sure they spent lots of money on resources on is barely a step up considering technology in today's world. Hours are horrible and starting you will be put on the late shift and will be stuck there. Have to work weekends. They don't say mandatory overtime but if you just want to keep up you will have to do a min of 5-10 hours OT a week and will come down on you if you don't keep up or you are of the phones to work on an urgent file. Are glued to the phone on inbound if you log out for a minute to call a scheduled appointment or to use the restroom you will usually have a manager walking by asking you why you logged out. in the beginning and just in general they use scare tactics asking if this job is the right fit instead of helping you with what you're struggling with. I have consistently heard management ask coworkers to leave the company and its better that way so they don't have to fire them that way they can work for the company in the future in an other department. Do not seem to care that they have high turn over they actually seem like they encourage it. Also this is the first place I've worked where coworkers are always saying how they hate this job, they hate the company and they want to leave. Usually there is maybe one or two people that say that but they don't last long but this was everyone. I can honestly only say there was one coworker that loved their job.  There is not anytime for continued learning, company or department goals or performance skill sharpening besides the required annual but even then you just take a quiz online and there's no meeting.  They change their KPI's since they are so understaffed (maybe because people are dropping like flies) and it will squeeze the last bit of life out of you. No employee recognition, no holiday party or team outings. I've never felt more of a number in Corporate America. You will not have a life outside of work and you will feel like a rag being rung out and squeezed for the last little bit of energy you have. I have  worked for other large companies where I had felt valued and loved my company so I know it is possible for a corporate America desk job. Also on an email sent to all employees from the CEO after a shooting there were some political innuendos that i thought were inappropriate I do not think companies should take political stances nor should I know my CEOs political stance from an email."

District managers visiting the branch almost breathing down your neck to see what you do in a day and it wasn't a comfortable feeling.

2158,,Avoid this Pit of Snakes,2019-10-02,1.0,Relationship Manager,Technology for clients and internal systems was integrated and streamlined.,"This bank is a quagmire of bootlickers and politicians. Working here was like living in a snake pit as a non-reptile. Co-workers routinely spy on, tattle tell and micromanage you, although none of these people are your direct superiors. The culture is such that fellow employees and teammates take credit for others' deals, and if they cannot, then they put down their co-worker's prospects, deals and achievements and suck the oxygen out of the room for everyone except their own agenda. It was sickening to be here.
The people that succeed here are those that lick the boots of the people that are running the show. I guess that could be said of many companies, however at one of the largest commercial banks in the world, one would expect a higher standard. After all the scrutiny banking has come under over the last 10+ years, one would expect ethics, civility and morals to be more prevalant than they are at JPM Chase Orange County. I could go on, but you get the picture. If you choose to join this pit of snakes, you most likely wll get slammed with ridiculously high sales goals as a way of forcing you out if you don't fit in (i.e. lick the boots of all your new masters). Look on LinkedIn. See how many have come before you thinking they could succeed. Then see how after about 1.5-2 years, most have left the company. Please avoid these reptiles."

2168,,Chase is an excellent choice,2019-09-26,5.0,Relationship Manager II,Excellent company. Great teamwork. Excellent resources. Terrific benefits.,Fear of being displaced would be number one.

2170,,PROMOTE WITHIN,2019-09-24,1.0,Relationship Banker,"Benefits, 401K, Tuition Assistance, Health Insurance. However this is provided and expected from any large company.","Promote within:   
Chase must work on making a connection between Consumer branches and Corporate. Business resource groups aren't enough to help Branch employees land corporate positions. I've interviewed over 6 times for entry level positions in corporate in different lines of businesses and I've heard the same thing. ""You just don't have the experience we are looking for"". Branch employees shouldn't be treated like external candidates. They possess transferrable skills that with training, are able to excel in the position they desire. Both recruiters and hiring managers need to do a better job at providing feedback to internal candidates. This may be why there is such a high employee turnover in the branches. Due to my experience applying to corporate jobs and the lack of response, I've lost interest in pursuing a career at JP Morgan Chase. My question will always stand as why will we not develop an internal employee to the position they are pursuing and rather hire external candidates. Why don't we develop branch employees to acquire relevant skills to transition into corporate roles. I've heard way to many times employees leave the company and come back in order to land these roles. JP Morgan chase is better than this or they should be. 

Pay/Salary: 
The company has to work on providing a raise to the base salary of all branch employees. We work extremely hard to maintain company profits and we do it with integrity. I've heard salaries from different corporate employees and I am astounded with the great discrepancy between corporate and branch employee's wages. I live in New York City and the cost of living here is extremely high. Unfortunately my income at JP Morgan Chase isn't enough to combat my expenses. Please take time to evaluate this and it will show your true employee obsession. Our competitors are paying higher salaries to their branch employees."

Health insurance covers much more than most other financial institutions. 401k and pension are also good.,"Pay is terrible. Licensed bankers make the same hourly as tellers. They will give you more and more responsibility but never increase your hourly wage. They try and justify their low hourly wage but monthly incentives. Unfortunately, unless you are in a high performing branch in the right geographical area incentive goals are very hard to reach. They are also docked if they do not meet standards."

Chase is also rolling out an ""upgrade"" to the teller role, which came with a dime raise, but way more responsibility.

They recently cut pay for HLA's .   New ""initiatives"" appear almost weekly.   There is pressure daily to meet metrics for a lot of different things that have almost nothing to do with your actual job.   Operation functions have been outsourced and many support people don't understand their job.   HLA ends up being responsible for every function of the file.   There is a persistent threat from management about performance.   Performance improvement plans are common.   Generally, Chase is looking to move the function of the HLA advisor to a call center model.   It's a very stressful place to be."

2344,,Your success and happiness depend on a roll of the dice,2019-06-16,3.0,Relationship Banker,"- It's a prestigious company so you can use it as a springboard to something better
- You will learn a lot about the financial industry and corporate America, which makes it an ideal first job out of college
- If you enjoy people, business, and learning as much as I do then you will meet a lot of awesome customers who can share their wisdom and experience from decades of successes and failures.
- Affordable and high quality healthcare, dental, and vision
- Matches 8% 401k contribution to your 5% AFTER 1 year
- Vacation/sick time are adequate to industry standards
- Extracurricular events can be fun, informative, and good for networking especially when alcohol is involved. But then you starting finding out/confirming the cons...","- Commissions are both capped and largely dependent on who walks through your doors. Don't let them sell you on the phone calls thing, chances are your assigned book of business has been worked over for years. This means your success/$$$ is dependent on your branch assignment, NOT hard work or your ability to sell. I cannot overstate this point. Make them show you the branch banker performance for the past year before accepting an assignment.
- It's a retail setting rather than a professional one. This means anyone from the public can walk into the bank and right up to your desk with service demands and/or personal problems while sometimes debasing you throughout the process. Some of them will become regulars. These are not opportunities to earn trust with valued clients through ""customer obsession,"" they are a demoralizing drain on your time and energy.
- I got lucky with my manager but there are some pretty bad ones out there who can make your day to day work life torturous with micromanagement and shame tactics. Hearing other bankers' horror stories at events was a regular occurrence.
- Annual banker bonuses were eliminated and replaced with quarterly bonuses related to customer satisfaction surveys. Aside from the fact many customers can  never be pleased and will happily destroy your quarter with a bad review, you also are just one person. If one or more people in your branch are bad with customer service or simply have a bad day your personal bonus will suffer.
- A majority of your commissions will come from someone else closing the deals you send them, which means once again your level of success is not completely in your control. If your Financial Advisor isn't hungry or a closer you're screwed.
- Transfers and promotions are hard to come by. Once they hire you into a position they typically want to keep you there. They accomplish this with all of the usual corporate nonsense like setting up moving goalposts, backroom discussions with leadership, claims you're better off, etc. it's all a distraction.
- Many branches are woefully understaffed. This means you will be working long hours and hard days, often focused on things and people who offer little opportunity (pure service for low tier prospects).
- It's clear to me the shareholders resent retail bankers' existence. They are trying very hard to automate us out of existence but since they're not quite there yet they are instead cutting salaries/commissions/bonuses, demanding increases in quality/quantity of work, and attempting to make us feel responsible for all those things listed above that are, once more for the road, out of our control."

They do not give good raises and they try to gaslight you that what they do give is market rate.  Stay one year because they start you at a decent salary (I got $5K more by negotiating), but there is no IC promotion track, so leave ASAP.  

If you want to go into management, and you are the kind of mild-mannered white guy who would actually get promoted by the mild-mannered white guys who currently command personnel, you could stay longer; or if you use politics to get transferred to another team so you can learn another language on the company dollar, those are both fine reasons to stay longer.

The monthly goal for our branch is $3m in new money... really difficult to compete again other great banks with much higher interest rates... but we are supposed to sell on the relationship- this isn't mutual between the bank and customer. The customer has no reason to really stay with us. I get asked daily, why should they have money with us when they have been banking here for 20 years and have nothing but .07% interest on a savings account to show for it. No one cares about relationships when it comes down to losing money.

Daily we are wiring out over $1m+ to other banks, which increases our bottom line from $3m a month to $4m and so on... 
Tellers have turned into ""associate bankers"", more responsibility without a pay increase. These positions are being done away with because of 'smart' ATMs, which means people are losing jobs.

You can be the perfect employee with perfect reviews  and no blemishes on record and they will eliminate your job all because they no longer want your site to be a location for your department.  No option to relocate, just a too bad for you, wrong site, wrong time.  They don't do this to just new employees either.  I'm talking people who have been there for 20 years or more and this happens ALL THE TIME! Nobody is safe and they will lie about the reason.

If you have a good manager that supports you and the team life will be good. There are some managers that show up half the time and when they are there they spend most of their time on their phone.
2467,,Micromanage enviornment,2019-04-16,1.0,Home Equity Loan Processor,Looks good on resume as company has a strong history.,"I could not wait until I found something else while at Chase. It was a micromanaged environment with little to no downtime, extremely stressful because of high DAILY goals to close loans., and your literally  just a number as you actually have a number you sign into everything with.  Its processing call center style!

The management pretty much awards you with sugar like the ""candy cart"" or jeans which makes you sit more and eat a ton of junk. One girl close to me got a blood clot and probably due to excessive sitting and no focus on employee health physically or mentally. 

 The management pins you against your other ""teammates"" by writing your name on a board and number of loans closed. Most companies have monthly or quarterly goals not here!! So, very stressful and alot of pressure for barely that much  money and no commission. Also, they started to have everyone wear headsets that beep when someone calls so your all the sudden on the phone no matter what your in the middle of as your ""processing."" The headsets were uncomfortable as they have to be on all day.  You also have to push an in and out button if you go to the bathroom.  The managers watch where you are from these lights on the computer all day. They of course do not have to wear them and many times stand around a chit chat which noone else can do except management.

The job is like an assembly line. You call a new customer and read word for word off a template that you just full in the customers personal info so very not personal experience and you as the worker feel and sound like a robot. Chase records all your calls with customers and its like big brother always watching you because all of the sudden you will get a message from this ""team"" to go over how you did.  Again, so stressful as it's random and creates so much anxiety. It was absolutely horrible!! 

 Many of their employees are overseas so your trying to coordinate with other people in a complete different time zone. Management looks down at you like bug to be squashed if your not motivated 100% of the time to close loans. It's demeaning as a college graduate to be treated like a number and people are let go constantly like the wind. Very sad."

Also, they promoted a new manager to my branch and she lacks a lot of basic people skills and engages in employee gossip, takes one male employee out to lunch and has not done so for others (clear favoritism, distracting due to gossip), and talks badly about the customers from behind the teller line along with other tellers.

In doing so, the new Kiosks -ATMs have replaced a few teller positions and all assistant branch managers were laid off with severance pay or the option to step down as a “Lead Teller Ops” with basically the same responsibilities but with lower pay. Clients were often angry because of the long waits at the teller line taking it up on the employees that unfortunately cannot do anything about it other than apologizing for something that is not even their fault.  The Private Bank has also been watered down, almost any banker can be promoted to Private client banker without any increase in salary most of the times.

2568,,Private Client Banker,2019-02-15,1.0,Private Client Banker,Easy to make money here especially if you are knowledgeable about the products and investment side of the business.,"Where do I even begin.... I was hired as PCB externally from an outside Investment firm so I already held my 7, 63 and 65. I had previously worked as sales support and the way the role was positioned to me is that I would essentially be doing the same thing  (partnering with an advisor and helping identify and develop leads) except in this role I would have the opportunity to earn commission. this was not the case. When I think of the biggest issue with my experience overall it really comes down to lack of transparency as well as due diligence. Please let me explain... while interviewing they had me meet at one of their “new build” branches which is just a nice way of saying upgraded and overall significantly nicer facilities. The interview was predominately focused on investment and outbound dialing which was something I was very comfortable with. The managing director then had me interview with the manager of the branch, which was fine. I got the job. They then let me know that I would be working at a different location than I interviewed at, I wasn’t familiar with the area but I knew it was closer than the location I interviewed at. So the manager I interviewed with was not the one I’d be working for...hmmm. When I arrived on my first day it took very little time for me to notice that the area had a huge homeless problem that lead right up to the customers that frequented the branch. I couldn’t get out my car without people begging for change, cigarette, food whatever. Nonetheless, I took that in stride since the area was considered affluent with a touch of gentrification. Then I was acquainted with manager # 1 of 3 of my tenure at Chase (did I mention I worked at Chase for 5 months) the first Manager was.... well rarely there and when he was most of the staff, including me wished he wasn’t. It wasn’t long before he received a promotion. Go figure. I started my on boarding and registration process on my first day (I.e submitting my u4). 5 months later as I submitted my resignation my u4 still hadn’t been submitted. On boarding was absolutely horrendous. They said I would be registered within 30 days. Until you are registered you cannot start training for the job or making commission on investment business. So after the first 30 days I continually reached out to the registration team with only an automated reply of “due to high volume our response will be delayed” for nearly 2 months I did nothing but sit there. No trainings to do... no Banker to shadow ( did I mention chase is always severely understaffed) when I started there was only 1 relationship Banker working and she was on leave, which I later found out was due to how bad the work environment was there. In addition to nothing to do for two months and an absentee manager, I had to onboard myself.... order my own buzz cards, find out how to set up my phone, order my office supplies. I had to rely on the chase resource internal site to figure out how to do everything!!!! Now as you may recollect I said I wasn’t registered the whole time I was there.... by month two I was over it. Escalating to every group emailing managing directors until they were to the point of “fine go to training and we will finish up the u4 by the time your done.” 4 weeks of training go by and wouldn’t you know... still not licensed.... only this time I get an email from the licensing team saying “it had been so long since I submitted my u4 to the time someone actually reviewed it that it was considered “stale dated”” and I needed to resubmit the U4 and a background check to restart the process. At this point they have me the green light to begin working.... and so I did, however they failed to consider that I wasn’t getting paid off of investments and as I emailed away trying to get info on a method of tracking and recourse I was told I shouldn’t even be working if I’m not registered. Oyyyy veyyyy. In the meantime 2 more branch manage in trainings blew through with an overwhelming high level of micro management, making work simply unbearable. I could honestly go on all day but needless to say this 5 months at chase was the biggest waste of my time, talents and career plans."

There seems to be a tendency to hire from outside the firm more rather than to promote from within, so knowledge employees end up leaving, this is the case in BRANCHES.

The biggest issue is that over the past 6 months a change has occurred. For some reason chase finds it necessary to make their licensed banker make over 35+ calls a day to existing clients. This is boarderline harassment and have already had numerous clients leave do these new calls!  They say it’s to help deepen relationships? But how is having your bankers call the same people month after month and expecting your clients to appreciate it? Not gonna happen. I get cursed out on the phone almost daily. And when you bring the concerns up the chain to the Market directors they give you the same corporate answer and say you have to make these calls cuz it bring a value to our clients. NO IT DOES NOT!!

Senior leadership tries to wear many hats and then passes responsibilities to members of the team to handle. Authority is given to individuals at any moment and then taken back for any reason, thus creating an atmosphere of uncertainty and trust. Teammates are suddenly against each other due to the toxic atmosphere created.

Though there are no quotas to meet each month, you do get a generous compensation for referring customers to the bankers.
You get the best Chase account offered with all the benefits of that account (free money orders, free checks, no monthly fee).",There really isn't a downside.

Chase says they encourage it however they don’t provide the staffing to do so. Staying in job role is impossible. The branches are so short it turns the branch manager into every role in the branch at any moment of the day. It makes it very hard to focus on the things that require attention. They are HORRIBLE at compensation for employees who advance in their careers. Often times Chase will hire someone from another firm at a higher salary then a current employee who has been there for a decade. It’s crazy to me. I started from the bottom and worked my way up and am compensated less then someone who has no banking experience coming from another company. And this happens often.

2694,,Help Desk Specialist,2018-12-01,2.0,Help Desk Specialist,It can help you pay rent while you find another job that is actually worthwhile.,"Everyone in the Toronto office is out for themselves. Many Team Leads have this arrogant superiority complex, when they themselves are lazy as can be. Every person points a finger at another person for everything, because the culture in this office is fear. Recognition and positivity is all faked and just comes down from corporate edicts from above to pretend they care.  The reality is that in 2018 they have settled on focusing on call Average Handle Time and scripted language. It does not matter if you actually help your clients, as long as you hang up on them in a few minutes or less and open by saying ""Welcome to Chase"" and close by asking ""are there any other questions, thank you for calling Chase"" then you pass. Spending the actual time to help the client doesn't matter, because this is a scripted and top-down managed call centre that doesn't care about independence and workers thinking outside the box to help their customers. As soon as you show interest in a customer and spend 5 minutes off the phone to figure out a problem, your score drops because you're considered non-productive. Also, the leaders in the Help Desk are ultra secretive. They won't even be honest with you when there are dogs coming around to check for bed bugs, one even lied to me and said they were looking for drugs. There is no reason not to be transparent, the bossy control and fear and secrecy environment is what makes this job unbearable."

Chase is trying to position itself as one of the best companies for work/life balance.  That couldn't be further from the truth.  There is no work/life balance at JP Morgan Chase.  Merchant Services and other business units don't allow employees to work from home. Even when their employees are commuting 45 min - 2 hours each way to work.  That doesn't leave you much time with your families because you've been traveling/working all day.

A lot of unhappy people in the offices.

Some people in management do care about your progress but unfortunately other do not. Get to know your team that way you c an get a feel for where you’re located. Don’t trust anyone either, I know it’s contradicting but if you express you’re opinion or thoughts or considerations you will get in trouble for it.

JPMorgan Chase is a good name to have on a resume.","It is a call centre, so you have to expect the micromanagement that comes along with it. This service centre got new leadership about two years ago and it turned the operation upside down. First of all, they now obsess over AHT (average handle time), Chase focuses heavily on getting customers off the phone rather than actually helping them. Training is terrible, because departments aren't specialized into separate sales, customer care/billing, or technical support teams they have tried to force all agents to take all calls and know everything. Lastly, the Pro of having JPMorgan Chase on your resume is undone completely by the fact that this is not a Canadian company, so the office is just an outpost and entirely controlled by US managers in Tampa or Phoenix. The Canadians never speak up against the poor leadership (like the AHT mandate) that comes out of the states, the people in this office have no control and are all yes-men. They say yes to whatever big brother next door wants, because all they're concerned with is keeping their jobs. So its intensely frustrating, because managers in the US look at graphs and spreadsheets and make decisions without really understanding the distinct operations in Canada. Did I mention this remote management only cares about AHT and a few scores which have nothing to do with providing good customer care? Oh well, its a call centre, what can you expect?"

The open door policy is only open if you say what management wants to hear. Every year upper management changes our pay and it is never a benefit. Taking away the annual bonus was supposed to free up raises, but no one received a raise. Unless you consider a 30 cent raise in 5 yrs a raise. We get to hear about upper managements year end bonuses, that just keep going up. We only get paid for a small portion of what we do because of caps. We can't get enough support staff in the branches to help customers, but we're required to keep our scores up. This causes a lot of stress on the whole branch. We have to cold call customers to try to sell something, and if we do, we don't get compensated for everything due to caps. The branch environment has very low morale.

Every year it seemed incentives were cut. The base pay is a good $7k-$8k less than any other bank and your incentives are CAPPED.

They want to brain wash you despite facts being common sense, they will tell you that branches don't matter that you determine income, completely false!!!!!  No accountability for managers other than numbers th y don't control. The company donated money to hate groups while talking about income inequality while bankers have to buy Chase uniforms, not joking.  They have no loyalty to employees, if you have been there 20 years and they check you credit and don't like something, fired.  All they do is bounce around executives to different positions so they can all vote themselves more money while taking it from employees and shareholder.

When I was sick, my boyfriend's manager called my manager to see if he had called out too- which is crossing the line. My relationship was in line with Chase policy because we were NOT in the same branch, there was no reason she should have been snooping. I saw people get passed up in the company for ""knowing the right person"" even though they were not qualified, and actually qualified people were passed up. I saw two people get selected for a better position, then LOSE IT because their manager made a phone call to keep them in her own branch. Turnover was insane in the company. Last but not least, the very last thing I was told was when I left the company I was that I'd have to pay back my licensing if I ever came back to Chase. Well, today- they put ""MISC DEBIT"" all over my accounts and zeroed out not just my money but the money that was my dad's and my boyfriend's since I was a joint on it.

Most branches are good at referring. Built in opportunities from customer base. Management in San Diego are very good. Underwriting is mostly make sense. Conservative but not as bad as other big banks I’ve worked at.,"Conservative underwriting. Too much turnover of branch personnel so constantly retraining for referrals. Bonuses are difficult to obtain. Will make good money but tough to make great money unless you come in as a big hitter with real solid business sources and negotiate your dedicated assistant/ support team. Because there are a lot of time wasting activities thrown at you. Read on. Too many operations tasks for sales. Too many internal email time wasters. Bonuses too hard to obtain and cause resentment and makes sales folks get too much into ops. (Csat bonus based on overall satisfaction not loan officer satisfaction so resentment when ops brings down marks and pull thru bonus causes many LOs -like me- to end up spending way too much time trying to decode multiple k-1s, 1065s and 1120s, running AU, researching guideline manuals, emailing internal employees like uw managers, etc about likelihood of approval, etc ). Too long onboarding. While still employed,  after working there over a year, I was inexplicably removed off all systems access as if being offboarded.

They will train you, pay for licensing, hone you to their standards and make you comfortable, as long as you don’t think.

The benefits, though constantly constricting, are ok.","For a company that place is such an emphasis on finding value to add (in soliciting customers), they fall short in adding value to their existing resources and people. 

It is truly sad when employee in a booming economy has to fight for pay raises and commission payouts, When a corporation is showing extraordinary profitability. It is also truly sad when employees hit plateaus or glass ceilings because it would cost That same employee to move up the ladder. It would cost them in time it would cost them and lost sales pipeline and ultimately in income from 1 to 3 years. 

It’s also unfortunate that there is a Glass ceiling when it comes to age and upward mobility in this company. Find me a NEW relationship manager who is over the age of 40.

Finally, it’s unfortunate that this company has pigeonholed itself in the offering of products and services. While they sell the shiny appearance of “private client”, and offer these positions to potential employers as “a privilege” - It is no longer a truly privileged position. And there is no true value (for branches outside of major metro areas). Rates are same, lines are same and the banker that was supposed to be their dedicated point man can’t help, because he’s reversing the fees on an account for someone who shouldn’t be banking in the first place.

The only thing that made Private Client special is that employee - he/she is the difference between standard retail brand banking and private client banking. Not the product, not the name - it’s the employee.

Employment with this company Has turned out to be a diminishing return on my investment of time, money and expertise.

big company branding","I don't know why so many people thought their benefits are good. let me tell the truth.

Health Insurance:
Chase has high deductible insurance like other companies. But the catch is their saving accounts. They have two accounts for Health: MRA and HCSA. (notice: other company usually offer HSA which is totally different.). 
MRA is called medical reimbursement account. When you have body checked annually and some data is met, then Chase will give you $200 to this account and the fund CANNOT be used for dental and vision.
HCSA is called Healthcare saving account and you contribute semi-monthly. Basically money in your account is yours. However, if you contribute more than $500 per year and don't spend them by EOY, the amount over $500 will be forfeited by Chase. YES, your money will be taken away by Chase. Looks like they are making money and it is their benefit not yours.
When you left the company, fund in MRA will be forfeited by the end of that month and fund in your HCSA will be forfeited by following March.

401K:
You don't have 401k match first year period.
You will have 401k match second year and the match will come to your account at the end of 2nd year: If you leave between 1-2 years, you cannot even see the money. 
You can keep 401k match at the end of 3rd year. But notice they always give you the match at the end of year, so you cannot make money  from the match through the years.

Annual increase and Incentive:
3-5% sometime less

Culture & Value:
Each line of business just pushes their responsibilities out and so many politics go on. If other people's pay grade is higher than you, you need to follow their orders even if they know nothing literally. Some of them just have more years of work experiences than you and they don't even know how to use the tools required for their daily work, but you still have to cover them.
Once I was in a meeting and people were arguing on one issue. One of the person went to phone book to look up the rank and took side. Nothing is right or wrong but only politics and pay grade."

-Easy work","-Chase allows for “known” customers. Meaning instead of asking for the customers ID, because you “know” them you bypass the information. However, as a new employee who knows no one this can be very annoying and uncomfortable. Most customers are rude about it, and would rather hold up the line than present their ID while they wait for another employee to be free and enter “known” on their behalf. 
-In training ID is a topic highly discussed, but not followed. 
-Training focuses on teller express and not enough on the internet portal. The portal can help answe a lot of questions the customer may have."

3469,,Choose another bank to work for...,2017-11-18,1.0,Anonymous Employee,You get a free account and decent healthcare options.,"Relationship bankers are required to do everything yet get paid nothing in comparison. A PB does half the work and their payout is way higher and so much easier to get. 
Bankers are basically trained to be pushy sales people and tele marketers. You dont really help people bank, you just try and hustle all their money. Chase claims to be there for everyone but if you have less than 250,000 they wont give you the time of day. Managers micro manage you constantly yet never do any real work themselves. How can a banker have more training than a manager who is in charge of said banker?!?!  Managers will also constantly hound you for new accounts, mortgages, invesments, making calls. Your basically their go to lackey as an RB that has to pick up the slack for everyone else who is basically getting paid the same as you (or more) while they do practically no work.  Also, financial advisors will not help you with any of the investments you bring them if they arent above their bonus making level. So even though Chase says they offer investment options for all, the only want people with a ton of money. One more thing...if they tell you banking is great because its awesome hours, they are lying. Working 8am-6:15pm every day, having to work Saturdays, being forced to take hour long lunch breaks (basically adding am extra 5 hours of not being paid to your week) is not my idea of good hours. Oh. And then getting vacation time but not being allowed to use it when you want because the manager has already gotten first pick to be off every holiday and weekend (ensuring they give themselves a 3 day weekend atleast twice a month)."

3477,,Mortgage Banker,2017-11-16,2.0,Managing Principal,"Internal Referral System for various bank sales professionals to receive bank client prospects from both banking staff and other bank sales executives.  Bank managers, tellers, and other bank staff were all very professional and great people to work with each day.  The career opportunities within the mortgage division are very good because this division is so inefficient that someone could move up quickly if they can manage to tolerate all of many issues existing the mortgage division.","Mortgage division was a mess to put it lightly.  The loan underwriting dept was much better at denying loans than approving loans.  If there was a single weakness in the loan file, the loan was denied.  So, it was very, very difficult to get a loan approved.  If the loan was approved, then it would have to go back and forth to the UW for review an average of 13 separate UW reviews before reaching final approval.  As you can imagine, this created a very lengthy loan process for loan applicant clients.  For example, a loan file typically spent 60+ days in loan processing before getting the clear to close from underwriting because of the number of reviews made by loan underwriters, the addition of new loan conditions by underwriters, lack of a sense of urgency found to exist pervasively throughout the loan fulfillment operations Centers (regional operatations Centers or centralized processing and underwriting Centers) back and forth of a loan file.
The loan software systems used by the bank were all proprietary, thus no one could have prior knowledge and experience with the software unless you had already worked with the bank before in some other role before migrating into the mortgage division.  Many of these proprietary software systems had significant flaws, were unreliable, and created many problems with both loan origination and processing that do not exist within the mortgage industry, but instead were a result of being associated with the bank and the attempt to integrate banking software with mortgage industry software.  To sum it up, the software was a mess and the software alone created many significant issues for the bank’s mortgage division."

3484,,Excellent Advancement Opportunities Without The Paycheck,2017-11-14,3.0,Business Analyst,"Chase is an excellent company to work for because they offer excellent benefits such as health coverage, 401k, and employee stock purchase options. They also have excellent pathways for advancement and will promote within before choosing outside candidates. They are very fair regarding employee conflict as well as resolving disciplinary issues. The pay is generally competitive when you are first hired, and most employees won't find it to be hard to have their prior salary matched. Chase also offers a great Wellness Rewards program which will offer substantial contributions into your medical MRA accounts for completing wellness activities. Chase also has a pretty diverse culture with employees of all backgrounds and lifestyles. In closing, Chase provides ample personal and vacation time and offers a nice pension once vested in the company.","On the flip side of Chase hiring within, they do not increase your salary very much when obtaining a higher position.  I went through 5 promotions within my 8 year run at Chase, however my salary did not increase. It actually went down because I was an hourly employee when I first started, generating a lot of extra income in overtime. So in reality, I actually made less income in my final year than I did in my first year, even though the circumstances were a bit extraordinary (I worked a large amount of overtime due to a merge with another bank). However it does not change the fact that knowing your first year of salary was higher than your last, especially considering this was nearly a decade later.  What was even more discouraging is that Chase would rather have you to end your employment, go to another company, and then match the pay the other company was willing to pay you, rather than just give you a fair raise. I probably would have stayed with Chase if they were more fair about the pay."

I really enjoyed the salary structure, usually 38k base plus commission, so you get what you put in, lots of potential to make a lot of money but key word: POTENTIAL, also loved the bank holidays, hours, paid time off (vacation, sick, personal), great 401k match and ESPP, overall the job is not very hard","-expect to wear A LOT of hats, since the branches are shrinking  drastically on staff, expect to make your 10-50 calls per day to schedule appointments and bring in new money but also you might have to be a greeter, provide manager overrides at teller window and help 90 year olds balance their checkbook
-they paint the PCB role to be an elevated position, it really isn't, all the bankers are pretty much expected to do the same thing
-NO ROOM FOR ADVANCEMENT -as a banker, you'll either be a Branch Manager (60-70+ hours per week, no thanks) or if you're a top ranked banker (pretty much top 3 in the district), you can maybe move to Financial Advisor role. I was hoping to move into one of our many, many corporate offices in Dallas and even with a degree and several years of banking experience, didn't receive any support for advancement, get the experience and don't say longer than 3 years, or you'll just get stuck
-daily sales requirements -Chase tries to act like they're different than their competitors, all big banks are the same. Tracked daily on getting the silliest things like mobile and paperless. 
-Too much pressure on client experience to the point where it's not genuine at all, we have greeters or ""adopters"" that basically greet the clients but their sole purpose is to get clients to use ATMs, it comes off so fake and very awkward for the client"

3592,,Poor Leadership and Mentorship,2017-10-12,1.0,Relationship Banker,"All the pro's were theoretical.  Theoretically it was performance based and commission would have a huge upside.  Theoretically, it is the best bank to work for so you would expect a leadership that would set you up for success.","1.  Chase does not invest well in their employees and their lack of staffing creates a domino effect for a bad working experience and bad customer experience.   2.  The con is you can be a great sales person and great at building relationships but if you don't have a good team that you work with and/or you are in a slow branch then your success is largely limited.  

I am not one that likes excuses.  Commonly a slow branch gives you time to make calls and create business, however an understaffed slow branch has you spending more time on transactions and less time on building relationships and following up.  

For example, I started work knowing the day to attend work but not knowing the uniform  or even the time to show up.  It was very disorganized.  When I was finally sent to  part 1 of training in training they said you are not suppose to do any transactions yet.  There is usually a separation between training and on the job.  The theoretical vs actual but at Chase they are completely different.  I get to my branch and my manager tells me not to tell the customer i'm new and she immediately puts me in front of the customer to assist with transactions.  This presented the worst experience I have ever had as the branch was short staffed and I had very little support. I felt bad for the customer and felt awful.  I continued working as hard as I could and made my case for promotion within 6 months from personal banker to Relationship banker.  I had over a 100 referrals to my FA who closed 0/100.  He was awful!  The 2 days he was gone I had 2 referrals to another FA who closed 2/2.  I had referrals to my business partners and Mortgage bankers but my commission was marginal due to a slow location and very little investments.  I asked for help but none was given.  I asked for advice but there was no constructive advice.  I wanted to set time in my schedule to build my client list and follow up but none could be afforded because we were short staffed constantly.  The turnover is pretty high at Chase.  I wanted to get transferred but my numbers weren't high enough.  I wanted to change jobs but there was no support.  Your success as a banker in large part depends on the success of your partners.  I like team environments but if you have a weak team as a banker you are very limited.  Keep in mind I was the only RB and there was 1 CPC banker who was the RB for 6 years in a slow market where the RB dominated the clients in the branch."

The monthly sales goal went up 25% while cutting the ways in which to meet those goals. While on a national call with upper level management to review the new incentive plan, management seemed to not care and not understand why their employees were upset. 

Your advancement within the company REALLY depends on your branch manager. If your manager is motivated to help you succeed day in and day out, you should be fine.

3653,,Quite humiliating experience - Licensed Relationship Banker SBS,2017-09-21,2.0,Licensed Relationship Banker- Small Business Specialist,Quick way to make a guaranteed paycheck while humiliating yourself doing the silliest things.,"Opening doors for customers, getting them coffee, pretending to care, getting yelled at by high-net worth individuals for not being able to perform miracles, cleaning up dog poop at pet-friendly branches, etc. Look, it's the kind of job you get when desperate and need to pay rent. Only reason I did it.

The worst part was having to buy your own uniforms. The company doesn't provide them, so you have to spend $50 on a sweater that says Chase and $30 and $25 on a Chase branded shirt and tie but those aren't useful outside of the organization.  Why would I want to spend the $14 an hour I make off you to buy YOUR uniforms? Ridiculous.

Your success is all based on what branch you get, if you're in a crappy neighborhood, best of luck to you trying to make a living selling people on ""Chase Billpay"" - $2 at a time."

Because branch traffic has died down they expect you to make calls all day every day, 30 to 40 calls and have scheduled call blocks with the Mortgage, Business and Financial Advisors in the branch. If you don't like the phones this isn't for you, the calls are a MUST!!!

-CHASE CAN BE RUTHLESS. When it comes to policy and procedure they have ZERO tolerance for doing things your own way or bending the rules. They are big brother. You are constantly being watched. Don't bank there if you work there. They are all up in your business even if you think they aren't THEY ARE! I've seen so many people get let go for little things they didn't think was a big deal. Chase doesn't care YOU are not worth the risk!

-If you have a heart and care about people, THIS JOB WILL COMPROMISE YOU. Chase only wants to work with rich people- this is evident in the products they offer and increasing focus on households with more then 250k. THEY DO NOT CARE ABOUT CUSTOMERS. Chase is all about the money and they are very black and white when it comes to approving products for people. You will want to do the right thing by clients but Chase will deny your customers the most basic products. There is no exceptions- No means no."

The best job perk is having JPMorgan listed as your employer on your resume.","If you're entertaining the idea of working at Chase Paymentech Toronto, stop, look elsewhere and don't turn your back. Where do I start? 

Extremely high turnover and employees on sick leave have plagued the company for the past 2+ years due to a bad reputation in the payment processing space, managers with draconian management styles, colleagues who are unqualified, incompetent and inhumane, extremely low pay, laughable benefits and bonuses. 

Chase used to operate like a mid-sized, happy family business until new executives joined, changing the culture with their unrealistic demands and delusions of grandeur. 

Every department from Sales to Partnerships to Relationship Management to Marketing act like they're in high school. Everyone is somehow related or old friends.

The way to get in is through a referral. If you're referred, you're automatically hired 9 out of 10 times. 

The receptionist as well as the Admins are the ringleaders within the company. Chase runs on pettiness and gossip which is stirred by the Admins. Keep your enemies closer... 

Good people have left for competitors or any other available opportunity as toxic people have joined and replaced them.  You are discouraged from applying internally and developing yourself professionally. 

Competitors will pay you double or more for the same work you do at Chase and they are lightyears ahead of Chase. 

Save yourself the stress and heartache and go where you'll truly be appreciated for your talents and ideas."

Example:  Foreclosed on a house in Essex, Vermont 3 years ago.  House still empty as the elements destroy it.  It's not available to solve the serious housing shortage we have up here.  Who loses?  The owner of the house who was kicked out,  The community, the firm because the house is being decimated by the elements and finally the stockholders because a perfectly good house is becoming a ruin and the community because a perfectly good house is not available. (customers, community, and stockholders)

A viable solid secure data center in Salem New Hampshire.  closing for god only knows what reason.  I guess to serve the egos of some facilities manager.  This operation has been in place for over 20 years.  Over that time it has expanded and served the customer base well.  who wins? Nobody! Who Loses? Employees at the center, the community because of the loss of 800+ good jobs. The firm, because it will lose some good reliable employees. The customers, to a point here, because the dedicated employees of the firm will work hard to minimize disruptions. The firm, because of the expense involved and finally the stockholders.  Who gains?  I can't see anyone gaining from this except for the egos of the management that made this boneheaded decision.

Foreclosed house in Underhill Vermont.  It's been sitting empty for 5 years.  Why?  Because some lazy good for nothing managers won't get off their collective rear ends to do something.  It's been plowed out of the heavy snow every winter at a cost of over $1500, although the vendor isn't getting paid. The real estate taxes run over $6000 per year and they have to be paid of the town would sell the house for back taxes.  The house is slowly being eaten by the elements.  In good shape it might get between $300,000 -$400,000.  Now, because of the deterioration possibly $150,000.  But it's not available to anyone.  Who loses?  The firm,the community, the former owner and the stockholders.  Who gains?  No one."

At busier branches, the walk-in traffic is sufficient to generate decent bonuses. If you get assigned to a slower branch, there will be an expectation to make a lot of calls to customers, book appointments for the financial advisor or the private banker. My branch was in a neighborhood with lots of retirees. They weren't interested in meeting with the FA or private client banker.

At slower branches, expect to do a lot of mundane work with ordering checks and debit cards, resetting PIN numbers, reprinting statements, etc. Private banker, branch manager, it doesn't matter. It will be part of the job. 

Your breaks and lunches are usually dependant on lobby flow, and co-workers bad time management, so don't bother making lunch plans. As a full-grown adult, it grated on me to be told when I could take breaks & lunches.

For upward mobility, expect to be in your position for YEARS before even being considered for another position, regardless of qualifications or experience.

I was contacted by a district manager with Chase & I did like what he had to say. The majority of it was true, however I asked him about a non-compete I had with my previous employer & he said those things are not enforced and if there was an issue with it that Chase has the best attorneys and they will have my back & it would not be an issue. I made the mistake of taking that gentleman for his word because he had a similar background to me, and I figured he was a straight shooter. 6 months later I was well into my job and doing well, than I received that nice letter from my previous employer stating that I was in violation of a non-compete. I informed Chase, and a week later they told me that they would not help me & I should hire my own attorney and basically good luck. I previously had a good relationship with my manager and after this I was treated like a ""black sheep"".  It was almost as if she was looking to get me in trouble, and I did not get that feeling before the letter came in. I saw the writing on the wall, and the potential lawsuit coming my way, so I put in my 2 weeks notice, and the manager probably spoke to me once a day while I was sitting next to her during that awkward 2 week period.

3936,,Good experience,2017-06-04,3.0,Licensed Relationship Banker- Small Business Specialist,"Proper training for the position, monthly online training and tip sheets. The bank has a good reputation compared to competitors, good back office support on questions you might know the answers to. Good health benefits and tuition assistance, plenty of vacation and sick days. Monthly incentives can be lucrative but they are always to the plan.","Very long hours, very little work/life balance. Staffing in branches have been cut. The salary is the lowest compared to competitors, rarely ever get a raise "" produce more and you'll get paid more"". 401k is a nice match but they don't match it until February, that is the most disappointing part of this large bank. They hold your match hostage and make money from it themselves. Branch environment is tired and stressed concerned with hitting numbers and customer service scores (customer survey system is a flaw). Every quarter company is reporting billion dollars in growth on the back of employees that don't get rewarded. Profit sharing can make your employees happier, $600 towards their 401k is an embarrassment."
3937,,Something to be proud of,2017-06-03,5.0,Bank Teller,"I love working for a company who cares about their customers, bottom line and their employees equally.

3938,,Relationship Banker,2017-06-03,4.0,Relationship Banker,Incentive plan gives opportunity to easily double your salary.  Good retirement plan with five percent matching contribution. 4 weeks vacation after 5 years.,The changing of the commission structure every year can be frustrating.  Management can make your job easier or more difficult.  Much like any other job.
3939,,LTOS,2017-06-02,3.0,Lead Teller Operations Specialist,"Innovative technologies advancing the way customers do banking, customer service driven--no sales goals (unless an RB), unbeatable benefits,  networking opportunities through resource groups. The position requires knowledge from both teller and platform operations, so there is always room for growth and expanding knowledge (plus there's monthly training to keep employees fresh)
Pay is decent (could be a little more but not too bad) and incentive opportunities are always a plus.","As an LTOS you are the backbone of your branch, however you might find yourself branded by colleagues as the lowest man on the totem pole. Your workload consists of teller and platform duties, yet because the word ""teller"" is in your title that is all you're worth. And forget about explaining your position to employees who have been with the company for a long time as they are stuck in their ways. Not worth the frustration. You're not in management, however your teller team will look to you as a leader so it can be tough to differentiate the two. You have to let them know you are there almost as a support system or else you may wind up taking on more than the position entails. Working 8:30-6:30 is just not that great either, but it could be worse..."

No raise the last 10 years with them and I was a high rated associate.  Managers work 10-12 hours a day six days a week and they continue to cut branch staffing.

Short term gains in experience and salary.,"If you don't intend on making finance a career, just stay clear of banking jobs in general. And even if you want to make finance your career, do some research on the future of the industry before taking that leap. Yes, it's decent money while you work there and yes you wear a suit and tie so it feels very professional. However, your jobs will slowly start to tell a story on your resume and you do not want your story to be that you worked at the bank for a long time. Most employed in retail banking at Chase hate their job or don't plan on climbing up the ladder into roles like advisor or mortgage banker. Most employed just want to make decent money in the present and stay consistent for a long time. Don't let your resume get crowded with bank roles just to make some decent cash in the present. On top of that, it's increasingly harder for banks to make money. That's why you see banks like Wells Fargo getting in trouble for creating fake accounts. Not only are incentives shrinking every year, but the real risk of AI and automation have a ""high risk"" rating of 30%+ for all US jobs in the near future, but retail banking is disproportionately higher at number 1 on the list around 60%+ jobs at risk of being replaced. From tellers, to telemarketing bankers, to even advisors. They will transition into advanced ATMs, AI/BOTS, and robo advisors.

Not that education equates to performance, but it's shocking the lack of qualified management and staff. Apathy is one of the most insidious problems permeating the entire company although if you just want to clock in and out, this is the place to be.  You will unfortunately gain zero portable skill sets so if you choose to stay realize you do so at your own expense - competitors in the marketplace are flying by you.  Entire compensation is ok (pension etc), but the actual salary is verging on pathetic and they are aware of this.  This folly is the primary reason they cannot retain talent which is also a direct contradiction in them claiming they value people and talent.  Every competent person has left - I mean this seriously! I cannot emphasize this enough: if you have any ambition, it's literally impossible to stay here...the environment and pay will force you out the door as it did me.  Management, while generally incompetent and unqualified, will get paid competitively so if you can snag a role like that, you've hit the jackpot...but these are hard to come by (like many companies)...and you can't fault people for not wanting to leave a good gig. 

My review of course is from my specific experience as a Senior Analyst, but I did work here for 5+ years and had several roles so this granted me a holistic perspective.

How is it possible to say that if you take 4,000 calls in 1 month, that just to pass, to avoid being written up, you can only make, even the smallest mistake on 1 call?

Seriously I heard a senior manager tell academy kids (college program) that now that they made it in the rest of their career will be about who they know and the relationships they build. I appreciate his honesty at least. If you are a woman or a minority here you will get preferential promotions above those more qualified. The good training they provide is internally certified only and has little to no marketability outside of chase. You will need all that time off to keep from having a nervous breakdown. If you are marked as a no fit (enraged a VIP or made them look stupid) you will never be promoted or allowed to leave your role.

I was a Lending Risk Analyst (I reviewed people's credit card limits and lowered them or left them where they were). I got 11 weeks of paid training so I felt very comfortable once it was time to perform my job. Every week we had team huddles and apcal sessions where we would hear what we were doing right and wrong and how to improve. We also had monthly meetings with our Manager to go over our numbers/goals. I did sometimes feel overwhelmed with the numbers/goals they were trying to have me reach, but it wasn't anything unattainable. I loved coming to work everyday. I felt appreciated, respected and cared for as an overall employee and human being. Management is respectful and they care about you and your career. I was sometimes bored and would ask for more work to do and I got to work with the Executive Administrator and do side jobs/work which I really enjoyed. I was also able to work closely with my Manager to learn their position as well. The pay is fantastic and so are the overall benefits. I really miss working here.

-Not enough staff to cover so that lunches and breaks could be taken at reasonable times.  Breaks were never given.  Lunch was rarely before 2 pm and most days closer to 3 pm.
-No coverage when staff members were on vacation or sick leave which left other employees overworked.  This was not the fault of the branch.  An employee could have been brought in from another branch to cover but was not allowed by corporate. 
-Very long shifts!  Most of my shifts were nine hours (10 on Fridays) with only a 30 minute break for lunch.  This was not only physically draining, but left it impossible to manage a home life.

4489,,Would never recommend a friend to get a job here,2016-10-22,1.0,Licensed Relationship Banker,"I loved working with my customers, that was the hardest thing about leaving when I finally decided to get away from this place. Being a Banker, you discuss pretty personal things with people (finances, hardships, retirement, family) so you honestly make very personal connections with people. 

I met Jamie Dimon several times, and he is a really interesting and dynamic speaker. 

The products Chase offers are great: online-banking, access to ATMs and branches, account benefits, etc.","Endless amounts of sales pressure while they continued to make changes that made it harder for people to get paid (cutting commissions in half, doubling the number of bankers in one branch so everyone was fighting over the same accounts and making less, etc). Having that kind of structure motivates people to be shady... pushing clients to do things like submit credit card applications even when it's not the financially responsible thing to do for them (recent bankruptcy, etc.). Because I cared about the well-being of my own clients, it was really gross seeing other bankers do things like this. Clients are supposed to be able to trust their bankers.

I will note that this wasn't company policy. Nobody at Chase was openly instructing people to do things like this. But the compensation structure incentivized this behavior. And even when customers complained about this behavior--several times!--the accused bankers never seemed to get in trouble or fired.

If the branch didn't perform, we were given almost no money for team-building or celebratory events, like holiday dinners for all employees. I can understand giving more to the top performing branches, but taking it away from those that aren't performing just breaks down morale even more. We felt under-appreciated, making us less motivated.

The office culture was also pretty bad, it always felt very cliquey. People often talked about others behind their backs, mad about compensation stuff or just gossiping. Not fun to come to work when you don't know who you can trust."

Product solutions are now behind in the industry and any new products are are not up to par and lack good quality control. Customers are frustrated with how they can't get resolutions to probelms. Poor Management Decisions to switch out people who are SMEs in what they have been doing for years, to other jobs that they are not qualified for and then letting the new people try and just figure it out.

Internal mobility is encouraged.,"The culture is still very corporate. The dress code (at least where I was) was business casual. This is pretty minor, but it is annoying as a developer since most tech companies are a lot more casual. Pay is tied to end-of-year performance reviews. In my case, this meant I spent a year with much lower pay than what I should have been getting, since I was not given meaningful assignments until early in my second year. There is a lot of bureaucracy standing in the way of getting anything done. This can lead to not enough work to go around, and you end up doing side-projects and busy work. There are a lot of 'town halls' and other corporate rah-rah sessions that you are pressured to attend and are largely a waste of time.

This team is not consistent as one individual says you received a perfect score and another says you failed. They will immediately put you on a performance improvement plan and than write you up.

4566,,"Stable company, but behind the times",2016-09-30,2.0,Business Systems Analyst Lead,"JPMorgan Chase is the most stable of the big banks and looks good on a resume. It is an enormous company and there are outstanding mobility opportunities for those who are eager. Leadership genuinely gets behind mobility. 

Vacation is generous from the start for most professional level positions. In addition to a 5% 401k match, there is a pension of 3-5%. Pensions are almost unheard of these days.","Flexibility is a DIRTY WORD at Chase. Policies were put into place in 2015 that eliminated all flexible scheduling and telecommuting. Even working remotely one day a week is strictly prohibited. While work life balance is touted, the company doesn't walk that talk. Having worked here for many years during which flexibility was embraced, the change is very disappointing. 

Working 1-2 weekends a quarter is expected for releases without ever being given comp time. Managers also candidly admit you are expected to work more than 40 hours to be considered for high ratings or promotions. Working smarter rather than harder isn't recognized appropriately. 

People are packed into the tech hub like sardines in a bench desk environment. There is a ton of quiet and collaborative space in the building; however, this doesn't work for our non-laptop culture. The environment is loud and it is difficult to concentrate.

There is a ton of beaurocracy. With all the regulations of the financial industry, this is understandable to a degree; however, we pile process on top of process. If you want an environment where you can quickly affect change, Chase is not the place for you!"

You now longer work ""Regular"" weeks and on weeks when you have a federal holiday your boss will often tell you that is your day off. The branches have become dangerously understaffed and the manager is expected to make up the shortfall in any area. Many managers are being worked until they burn out and simply leave or go out on leave. Pay is static and rarely goes up anymore and your bonus potential is held as a hostage the entire year with very few people ever acutally reaching the supposed upper limits that are possible."

- 15 weeks paid training for collections/ 6 Weeks for Inbound customer service.

If you are not good with adhering to a set schedule with very strict efficiency expectations, this is not the gig for you.

- Chase does not aspire to be the top payer in the industry. While the pay is competitive, all comparable positions at other firms tend to pay more. Evening shifts (50% of shift after 5 pm or on weekend days) pay an additional 10% shift differential on the full 40 hours. Average starting salary is around 13 to 15 dollars hourly for entry level positions. Collections positions pay up to 700 dollars in monthly bonuses that are paid out quarterly.

4748,,Branch Manager Review,2016-08-03,1.0,Branch Manager,Chase has a great footprint in Chicago making it an easy product to sell to customers.,"This is by far and away the worst company you could ever work for.   Not one employee is valued as a person by their boss.   They are literally breeding robots and will remove anybody who displays any type of self sufficient thinking or has any kind of unique personality, even if those traits lead to great performance and feedback from their customers.   Employees are so undervalued that literally every conference call, meeting greeting, or ""recogition"" not only is scripted but is so fake that management sounds like they are in pain and being forced to try and make employees feel good with the same 10 words.  Employees are beyond underpaid and because of that all of the talented people have left the company.   Leaving management with the bottom 20% and no ability to replace them so performance management does not exist.  Therefore calling in sick, tardiness, and lazy behavior is an every day thing in retail Chase locations.  Upper management's solutions is to have branch managers recruit employees since they can't do it but of course no additional compensation will be given for that.   Meaning any manager who wants to be successful has to do the work of not only their job but the employees who have left and not been replaced and the ones who do not want to work hard.  Now hard work is a part of professional culture but the problem is management doesn't care which managers are the ones doing everything they can to be successful.  Instead they play favorites and those managers can then work 40 hours, leave early, well the ones actually owning their business receive no appreciation or support because they are not ""in with upper management""  Further more upper management will do things behind your back to ""push you out"" if you are not one of the managers they like.   Also the company does nothing to support talented employees looking to go out of retail.  There are so many divisions at Chase and retail is its own island where you are left to suffer with the only hope of advancement is a bigger branch once that manager realizes how bad the company is and quits.  Even if you are a top performer your manager decides your bonus, your employees, and pretty much your career.  And none of them care about anyone but themselves and the select few they have decided to favor.   I urge anybody in this role to truly reflect on their career and ask themselves if they have seen any sincerity or compassion since they joined this company."

4751,,Metrics Goals Trump Quality Customer Service,2016-08-02,2.0,"Card Member Services, Senior Specialist I","Chase offers some of the best employee benefits you could wish for, at prices you'd only dream of- several are even 100% company paid. You can even insure your children as dependents up to age 26.
     With multiple sites located throughout the U.S., employees are able to request relocation to a different site where there are internal opportunities in their line of business.","All call centers have metrics goals for thier customer service specialists, including Average Handle Time, due to cost & to prevent long hold times for customers.
      However, Chase places an EMPHASIS on that particular metric, to the point of write-ups and even termination of employment for not meeting the average time goal of 236 seconds per call. 
      I can understand taking disciplinary action if there is unnecessary use of hold, excessive chit chat, or some other avoidable behavior pattern creating high call handle times. But if a specialist has high handle times because they address all issues that they notice, even if the customer is not yet aware of them, I do NOT believe the specialist should be penalized for not meeting the 236 second metric goal. Handling all of the account issues at once eliminates the need for the customer to call back later. If every representative did this on every call, the call volume would decrease, reducing the customer hold time- which is the objective of having handle time goals in the first place -and would place the emphasis where it belongs... on customer service.
      The current expectations and repercussions force customer service specialists to be ""stopwatch service specialists"", ignoring account issues not addressed by the customer to end the call quickly. Customers often call right back and state that they forgot to do or ask something because they felt rushed by the last representative.

      CUSTOMER SERVICE REPRESENTATIVES SHOULD NEVER SACRIFICE PROVIDING THE BEST CUSTOMER SERVICE POSSIBLE!!! Especially just to meet an unrealistic time limit."

The pay is very low compared to other companies and the management/ upper leadership only look out for themselves. The current division leader I work for has no experience in the field I work in an has very little knowledge of the business itself, she is living proof of ""it's who you know, now what you know"". She has hired other managers to work along side her due to the fact that she worked with them in prior departments and not their knowledge of the field. Employees are treated like small children with little to no respect on a daily basis. Departments are understaffed, overworked, underpaid and just a sea of people are burnt out. Transfer freezes have been placed by this woman because so many people try to leave at once. This apparently is not a red flag and the leadership only gets rewarded.

There is an adopter role now, where you have to stand your whole shift at the front door and greet people and try to convince every one to use the new ATM. I stand usually 10 hours a day straight and do this. My feet ache even several hours after work. Management reminds us that we have an actual limit on the amount of teller transactions we can perform each quarter, and they should be reducing all of the time because of these new ATMS. I have gotten sick of standing at the front door all day, I talked to my manager about it and he wanted to create a solution but things quickly drifted back into me standing at the door. I am the newest person (started in January 2016) so I am pushed to do the job no one else wants to do. I hear several times a day from customers that other branches have one teller and a line almost out the door. I've had times where there was one teller and 7 people in line, so I went to help the line and my manager actually comes over to me after I've helped one person and says ""I know it's long, but can you come back out?"" So I helped one more person and went out in the lobby and stood there while the line piled up. Genuinely embarrassing to have customers watch me leave the teller line to go and stand in a lobby and do nothing. Someone has to be out there every split second, regardless of the circumstance. Additionally, my manager has also informed me that our hours are going to be cut next quarter. All in all, I receive several customer complaints about the lack of tellers and the ATMS taking over.

Their job is to uncover as much information as possible about customers needs and refer them to partner's (mortgage, jpmorgan investments, etc..) so they can close business. Pay is definitely not adequate considering the role of the banker. I was at a slower branch where bankers made about 55-75k. Partners were making $100-120k. As a banker you deal with much of the maintenance and day to day grind whereas partners come and go as they please, and almost wait for bankers to send business. That was displeasing, since as a banker you could spend months or years building relationships just to refer it to a partner for a solution and close.

4973,,Short term profits trump customer's needs; Innovative ideas discouraged.,2016-05-06,2.0,Personal Banker,"Chase offers a competitive benefits package, dependable hours, and reasonable vacation/PTO policies. At the corporate level, they are vocal supporters of social causes like LGBT equality and affordable housing.","I know Chase is a for-profit company, so I don't blame them for focusing on sales, but when the sales goals come down from on-high, and they have no recognizable basis in reality, it forces the branch employees to choose between meeting their goals and helping clients select the best products and services for their financial wellbeing. The reason I left the company is because I was tired of having to wake up in the morning and decide whether I was going to be a decent person, or make money that day.

When bankers are told to call a pre-generated list of names and phone numbers for a particular product or service, such as a pre-approval for a credit card or HELOC, the official policy is NOT to look up the customers they're calling in the system first before dialing. The official reasoning is that it slows down the calling process. But in reality, whatever algorithm they're using to pre-screen the people on these lists is frequently very wrong, and if the banker doesn't screen each client before they dial the number, they'll often end up trying to sell a credit card to a customer who already has 4 or 5, or a HELOC to a customer who already has one. This just makes the banker, the branch, and the company look inept to the customer, which makes it much harder to sell any products or services that they might actually need. 

Chase has a mechanism for retail level employees to submit feedback to upper management regarding issues they frequently encounter, ideas for how to improve the company's efficiency/competitive position, problems with the technology platforms, etc. The people responsible for reading those suggestions and forwarding them to the right folks are great, issues are frequently addressed swiftly, and suggestions that make sense are frequently implemented within a couple quarters. But the middle management (District and Market Managers) will frequently discourage bankers from submitting feedback through this mechanism, because they feel that it takes away from time that the bankers should be cold-calling for new business. 

All of these problems contribute to the overall disenfranchisement of branch employees, and the alienation of the company's existing and potential client base, which is largely responsible for unnecessarily high levels of turnover in both the company's employees and its account portfolio."

Most employees leave and go to another bank get a higher position and then Chase will rehire them with that title and pay them more because they left and came back with a higher salary. They treat the tellers like crap they are considered the bottom of the food chain even though they are the ones who do most of the work in retail. Personal bankers get paid a lot more and work a lot less. Yet, if that is not enough to deter you guess what? now they are replacing tellers with machines and they are using the tellers to get rid of their own jobs.

Branch teams were pretty autonomous so if you liked your coworkers, particularly your Branch Manager then you probably have a good work environment.",Constantly pushing customers to online and digital accessibility but bankers make their commissions on sales that have to be done in person.  Chase also prides itself on building relationships but by pushing people to online and mobile banking they are taking the relationship out of the business.  Compensation is base  salary plus commission and the standard for commission seems to change every year depending on the sales directives of corporate often times cutting commission points in half even though you still have to do the same amount of work for that commission.

Benefits include MRA funds (that can be cut off at the drop of a hat) and Starbucks gift cards that you are expected to pay taxes on.

As compared to other megabanks it is definitely the best and so you can speak confidently about the bank.  There is opportunity to move if you do well.  They are very willing to promote, but you do have to be willing to move around to different branches.","For the last 2-3 years the bank has been cutting back on its incentives programs and ""capping"" bankers as to how much they can make on a particular sale, i.e. bringing over investments or balances.  However, they have not raised salaries in turn.  I know from what I hear from those who have worked at Wells that you are capped there as well but their salaries are almost twice as high from what I have heard.  At Chase, when someone asked recently on an incentives conference call nation-wide a banker pipped up and asked about the fact that people do not often receive a raise and high level upper management replied that you are in charge of your own raise through your continued hard work each year through our incentives program.  Only they have significantly reduced the incentives and capped them in a way that they have never capped them before.  As well, on the mobility piece within Chase, at least right now, you can move and be promoted if you hustle.  But because of the low caps on what you can make, you really really have to hustle.  On top of that, the company keeps going back and forth with hiring.  18 months ago there was almost a hiring freeze (or at least it seemed like that) to the point where every branch was short staffed.  That is a very difficult environment to hustle in.  Now they are back to hiring more but from what I have heard from those who have been with the bank for a long time this seems to be a cycle they go through every few years or so but I really cannot speak to that at length because this is the first I have seen it."

Great people, great environment, non pushy sales goals and we actually cared about each other.","The past 2 years, 7 our of 10 district managers were let go in each district (300+ districts for the whole nation.)

Management for retail branches is only interested in corporate profits to the detriment of employees and customers. Very high low and mid level management turnover. If you have a bad boss, you are not going to advance."
5118,,Horrible place to work,2016-03-23,1.0,Licensed Relationship Banker,Pros are limited. Offer medical insurance. May have free coffee.,"Theres a reason chase is always hiring. Recruiters will claim you will make over $75 per year when in fact most licensed bankers average closer to $50k per year. This is in  California btw. 

Chase has been cost cutting at the expense of employees for the last 3 years. No annual raises coupled with  the  fact the commission /incentive is lower every year. Half of the products you can earn incentive on are arbitrary. A 3rd of your sales should come from lending but it's nearly impossible to get a loan approved through chase. Average 45 days to close a helicopter and 60 days to close a refi. Purchases average 35 days. Basically chase has opted to make lending very difficult as it is not profitable to the bank. Sadly, your pay was contingent upon you closing ""x"" amount of loans. Get paid on checking or savings accounts, but only if it's the first for the household and they have to fund it with $1k minimum. If you don't earn at least $1k in monthly incentives, they only give you a small portion of what you earned. Assistant managers were laid off last year. Tellers are part time only and have been downsized through attrition. Don't get me started on the fact that Chase doesn't believe in bad PR. Rather than have a round of layoffs, chase's M.O. is to push people to quit on their own accord. Thus avoiding layoffs in the news or having to deal with unemployment benefits. 

You must refer your loans and investments to your financial advisor or loan officer in hopes they close the deal. Most districts which consist of 10 to 15 branches share 1 or 2 financial advisors (because they keep quitting) and 1 or 2 loan officers (again because the keep quitting). How do you make.money on referrals when there is no one to refer to? 

Only match 3% of your 401k which takes 5 years to vest. Offers a stock purchase plan with so much red tape, it doesn't make financial sense. Medical insurance has high premiums with a $2500 deductible at the lowest. A tuition reimbursement plan where no one in 7 years of my time at chase has anyone successfully received.

One of the lowest base salaries around, roughly $36k annually. Uncapped incentive is an outright lie. For example, by some miracle you bring in $1M of new money you only get paid on $500k  of it. It's all lies. 

Another example, for half your sales, you have to track it, then request to get credit for it, then make sure you actually did get credit for it. On the flip side, if you got paid on something and  lets say it closes out or balance drops to a lower threshold, chase's system conveniently knows to deduct this from your pay. Even several months later the system knows to take money from you yet can't credit you automatically for the sales you make.

Back office support is horrible. The bulk of it is based overseas. Good luck trying to get technical support from the Phillipines or HR support.from India. Nothing against those countries, but it would be nice to have support from someone with English as a first language. Have I mentioned yet that most the equipment in the branches are over 20 years old. Trying to put Windows 7 on a 20 year old pc may not work out to well. Sending faxes from a 20 year old machine may prove futile.

Don't take my word for it. Call a few branches, see how many financial advisors, business bankers, or loan officers are available in the area. These are the partners you must refer to to make money, yet they are few and far between. Go meet your licensed bankers, ask how long they've been there (average is less than 13 months due to high turnover). Ask where they worked prior to chase. Many came from best buy and selling mobile phones, not the finance industry."

In many IT groups, you can keep your job for years and can possibly excel if you simply work the hours and do what you are told.  If that is your goal, then this company may be a good fit.","Annual evaluations (and the resulting annual bonuses) for years were openly given using the 20-70-10 Vitality Curve model, also called ""forced ranking"" or ""rank and yank"".  They are still performed this way, but the approach is now more secretive since this model is so widely criticized for creating perverse incentives and lowering productivity.  (Feel free to research those topics yourself.)

Upper management is quite disconnected from how their IT departments and teams actually operate and what they need to succeed.  As a result, incorrect assumptions or a simple lack of understanding often leads to incorrect conclusions and poor decisions made by leadership.

I personally saw the following a few times...  Occasionally, an IT leader is hired from some other large corporation.  He decides to change operations, business flow, vendors, etc. for a couple years.  After a coupe years of enforcing those changes, he claims success with some unproven cost-savings or profit increase.  After collecting a big salary and bonuses, he leaves and does the same thing at some other financial services giant or other large corporation.  Sometimes, the next guy comes in and essentially reverses all the changes in order to do business the same way it was done previously before the last guy made his changes.  This cycle then continues in some fashion with subsequent leaders, with each one claiming success based on some creative metrics.  These folks are sometimes getting rich for adding no net value to the business.  Meanwhile, rest of the employees stay busy trying to interpret new processes and rules, usually for very similar pay year after year, regardless of their successes (or even failures).

The east coast boys that are in charge do not reward, but rather punish, the questioning of their decisions or questioning of any non-value-added activities, along with many suggestions for true improvement.  Many see themselves as very wise, and if you ask questions or suggest alternatives, you must therefore be unwise.

The nature of IT work at JPMC has also become more stale (dull, repetitive) over time, as more and more of the projects become about meeting government regulations and reporting mandates, responding to legal actions, trying to avoid current or future penalties and fines.  And as the legacy systems grow larger, it becomes more difficult and time-consuming to change them.

People in IT are typically expected to work overtime, because IT budgets are cut thinner and thinner as the desire to increase profits and increase ""shareholder value"" remains insatiable.  People are told to work harder in order to compensate for staff reductions.  Working ""smarter"" is often not possible due to poor support structure, approval processes that are extremely hard to navigate, and a variety of other factors, some of which I mentioned above."

As a company, they offer great benefits and seem to have something to help with within any aspect of your life.","If you're bilingual like myself, be cautious. IF the going gets tough for them, they will take advantage of your skill. On New Years Eve, we had originally been told we would be leaving at 6pm EST. A day or two prior, they stated we'd be closing regular time and actually let me as the only bilingual collections rep for the entire department until 9pm EST because every other bilingual was either off that day or got to leave early anyways. The entire Texas region left at the planned 6pm EST even though a supervisor called over and told them the change and how we were slammed that day. Also, if they decide to close early on a particular day but you're schedule ends after the time they want to close (Example the 6pm EST early closure vs my 9pm end time) you have to use your time off to make up those hours if you want to get paid for them.

From my experience the managers got their jobs based on who they knew.  Their ""track records"" are based o them being put in great situation, which is again about who you know.  The smartest people there usually leave after getting resume experience.  Lastly, the can change your commission pay whenever they want.  Once they see employees succeeding at one commission structure, they change it to save the company money and keep you from gaining any real traction.  Whenever there is a bank robbery, they have their media team come in and sweep it under the rug.  I would prefer to be homeless before working there again.  No loyalty!"

You can't edit the spreadsheets because they are locked. Somehow, the role is still that of an Analyst. The analytics get about as deep as a microlending shop. I didn't find any values of the bank at the commercial bank. The work is 60% data entry and 40% gathering information from colleagues. Growth is not expected unless you truly want to be an underwriter who would generate a report that takes a month to complete, similar to about the most basic report say, in a position of Equity research, who spent about 2 hours doing. Boredom is typical, and with the KYC team, the environment is a joke. Don't expect performance compensation. None of the employees know what they'll earn and nor is it expected to be performance based. The company machine is efficient but if you're looking for growth, look elsewhere. No transferable skills but reviewing financial documents and data entry and no financial modeling as advertised. What a joke! Avoid commercial term lending at all costs! It is not representative of JP Morgan and no - don't even think about exit opportunities. Lastly compensation is comparable to an IT technician, loan processor, operations analyst, etc. at tech companies or startups, which is pretty bad to endure mindless work.

It seems that they are also working to get rid of tellers and other positions in the branch, so I questioned my job security. I watched at least 2 positions be eliminated entirely, putting employees of 15+ years out of work. No loyalty whatsoever.

It is no coincidence that you always see their postings on job boards more than any other bank.  Most of the department is run by micro managers.  Their are a few good managers out of the bunch, but you will change managers at least every 6-12 months if you are with Chase.  They set an expectation of 7 minutes of personal time every day.  So if you have to use the restroom outside of your scheduled break, you are likely to fail adherence for the day.  That can count for as much as 20% of your monthly scorecard.  I could go on a lot longer, but it only requires 20 words in the review to access the site features.  Switching departments is like changing companies due to the different polices in each one.

Chase is by far my favorite one. I worked as a Personal Banker and it was great. I always met my sales goals so I guess my answer may be different if I did not meet that goal each month. The compensation on top of salary was the highest of all banks I worked at and the benefits are great. The training was awesome and they give you time to get into your position and learn the system before they give you sales goals. Almost every single person I worked with ended up being a good friend but that obvious differs from branch to branch. They do seem to hire smart people with good attitudes so the bad seeds are few and far. Everyone is very supportive and helpful and Chase is the most technologically advanced bank I've ever been in. It seems most banks are trying to copy or catch up with Chase.,Sales goals are a pro because of the compensation but also a con. It's pretty stressful when you're having a bad month and they will definitely get on you about it. They do have cold calling nights from time to time depending on your branch sales totals and that is probably the least fun thing about the job. If you have a bad manager than good luck to you but as previously stated their recruitment team does a pretty good job of hiring good people.

Frequent changes in company policies (legal reqs, efficiency, etc.) are often burdensome. Cost-cutting measures have left many branches understaffed, and job roles result in Personal Bankers missing out on many commission opportunities.

No overtime given even when working long 11 hour days (AZ rule apparently). There is constant downsizing, we lost a banker and teller and the position was not re-hired for forcing employees to work that much more for positions that should have been refilled. Also was extremely inconvenient and annoying that we were forced to notify literally every single customer to use the atm and would be penalized by corporate if we did not increase atm % usage"

You will learn whatever you will need in your later career as a sales position in banking.,"Low pay. High sales pressure. Poor working hrs/schedules. Since it is a sales position, your number will go back to ZERO when the new month starts. No matter how well you did last month, you are all over again...."
5425,,Private Client Banker,2015-12-20,3.0,Private Client Banker,"With 4 weeks of vacation, you shouldn't find yourself feeling you don't have enough days off to request. Good work/life balance. You work hard while you're on the floor but take none of that work with you beyond your 8 hour workday. 5% 401k match with Traditional or Roth options. Chase also offers flexibility because they have so many locations, you can usually have a transfer opportunity if you were to move. Moving up the ladder is definitely attainable. The PCB role specifically exposes you to good sales methods and cross-functionality between partners (mortgages/refi, business, and investment advising). Although the sales incentive plan has been getting worse year-over-year for the past three years, they are starting 2016 with an ""improved incentive plan"" which just puts it closer to what it was three years ago. Bankers are given more responsibilities as other roles get cut or fade away (such as the assistant manager role).","Despite the pros, working for Chase is an overall con. I've worked here long enough, through multiple roles, to know the bigger picture. Chase, like many traditional brick & mortar retail businesses, are being threatened by technology. Chase's big goal for the past couple of years has been to push customers out of the branch and for those customers to become self-reliant, like most millennials, and use online, mobile and ATMs. These types of transactions are much cheaper than hiring tellers or paying a  lease on branch building. So why would anyone come to the bank? For advice on investments, business, home loans and refinances. Chase isn't trying to fight the future but embrace it. In the near future, Chase probably only needs one responsible teller who takes on some assistant manager and lead teller duties. The rest can be done with advanced ATM's. Chase won't need Personal Bankers soon either. Personal Banker roles have diminished year-over-year not only in hiring but in sales incentive because their role is more transactional which is exactly what Chase is distancing themselves from.  What is a Chase Private Client Banker? It's a banker who connects customers to the investment advisor primarily (also the mortgage banker and business banker) and assists the customer on the consumer side of banking (transactional side). You are basically a professional referring employee. You don't specifically sell investments, mortgages, refi's, or high-level business accounts. You ""sell"" customers your partners and sell them the idea that they need to get assistance from your partners. Partners do the heavy lifting. There in lies the problem with this role and the future of being in this role. Because fewer and fewer customer go to the bank and the bank does not want to be a transaction-based bank, the Private Client Banker role will be obsolete. It will most likely evolve into a call center type position. If customers don't come into the branch, you need to get them in the branch. The role already focuses on calls and getting good over the phone. A lot of bankers they hire, from what I've seen, have been between the ages of 21-35. Why would anyone in this age range begin a career in a dying/phasing out system? Unless you just want a little exposure to banking before becoming an advisor yourself, I can't imagine how this would be a good career move. A lot of Relationship Bankers and Private Client Bankers just want to make some decent money now but aren't thinking about later. Most of them don't have what it takes to become an advisor and that's really the only direction left to go after PCB."

Everything you do has a compliance and security related procedure and they control everything down to the verbiage in emails you send out.  You really aren't required to think.  This is great for not very smart people, which abound.

The place is the most secure place ever, but it takes forever to get work done.

Benefits are decent.","The company I worked for was absorbed by Chase so I got to see a dramatic change in culture as we slowly became ""blue"".  Everything you do is micromanaged by corporate.  They were in the process. Of incorporating call monitoring for everyone, even non-call center focused areas.  There is literally NO decision that you can make, even in an executive level, that isn't second guessed and reviewed by security and compliance.  I was previously allowed to run the department as I needed to, and did so for 15 years (4 years is how long I held the title). 

They do not value longevity and experience.  They do not value people who know the industry.  They only want people who they can mold into a blue robot.  Oh, and they believe working for the name is a substitute for pay - you should be grateful to put them on your resume.  

Career mobility is difficult internally.  Every job posting wants experience you may not have.  It's very hard even internally to get an interview in another line of business.  Nearly all postings already have someone in mind.

Upper level executives hide things from the C level execs.  As they shrunk the workforce and implemented stifling regulatory procedures, the morale shrunk to terrible levels.  I witnessed in multiple executive meetings the CEO of our LOB ask for details as to why the morale is so low, which everyone on the floor knew."

5512,,Honest and Fair Review,2015-11-12,3.0,Licensed Relationship Banker,"Chase is a large company with a laundry list of benefits, competitive pay, commission packages and room for advancement.  All the pros of working for a company of  their size are a given.  As an employee, I felt encouraged and supported.  Even when considering leaving the bank.  With few exceptions, the HR department does a nice job of hiring good people and protecting them with fair policies.  Chase has a full spectrum of products, services and technology available for their staff to meet the needs of their clients and encourages teamwork.  Though my review does include some cons, I did enjoy my time at Chase and left on my own accord.","My cons list is subjective and just because I found something to be undesirable, someone else may disagree.  Depending on your needs and outlook, working for a company as large as Chase can have it's challenges.  

In my experience, the higher you go up the ladder in a large bank, the more out of touch they can be with what it is actually like in the branch for employees and customers.  I think this can be true of any large company.  Bottom line and policy sometimes govern where common sense and compassion should prevail.  Hands get tied and people don't want to rock boats.  More people, departments and regulation can mean more miscommunication and disconnect.  That being said, I can't recall any major injustices.  If I felt strongly about something and fought hard enough, I did feel supported by my direct managers overall. That is the big picture.  I don't want to whine too much and be negative, because you will make your experience what you want it to be and different things bother different people.  Most of the negative reviews I see on here may tell of true experiences but they are one sided and surrounded by lots of excuses and blame.  In my experience, people who are that unhappy are partly to blame by not being realistic about why they took the job and if it was really for them.  

In my opinion, anyone can learn to be a banker or a teller.  However, if you do not posses some key intrinsic qualities... you will struggle on a daily basis.  Do not fool yourself into being qualified for a retail banking job.  Burn out is a real thing and many branch employees experience it.

One specific tip I will give you is that being a banker is a sales job.  It may be needs based selling, but you will be expected to make cold calls, approach customers in the lobby, offer additional products to existing clients.  You will have sales goals, and you can be let go for not hitting them. Branch staffing models are getting leaner as banking moves toward technology.  You will be expected to push change a bit to clients who are resistant and it will be uncomfortable when they are standing in line for long periods of time and all they want is another teller (trust me, all you will want is another teller too, haha).  You will also have to follow new regulatory procedures.  Customers are also uncomfortable with some of the new questions, disclosures and longer times it may take to do their banking when sitting with you.  This all ties into sales, and I can't stress enough that is the word sales makes you think twice...trust your gut.  Most unhappy bankers I know are unhappy  because of the factors I just listed.

I know bankers that do and have worked at all of the major banks and knowing what I know, I would still work at Chase over any of the major banks."
5513,,VP Branch Manager,2015-11-11,1.0,Branch Manager,"Not much. Chase has changed so much that there is nothing positive to say. It stinks and if you are considering working there, I'd run away.","Chase is horrible to work for. Work you like a slave, no regard for employees as humans, they are only a number, everything is about making the bank more money to please shareholders.  Everything is one sided and they tell every employee they are replaceable. No raises or bonuses for employees but 75% raise for upper management=deplorable. Don't believe their bs."

Big name in banking loans and investments easy to sell great products.,Upper management is a joke. All about profit. Like to pretend they care about employees but politics are horrible. It's all about profit at the end of the day customers or customer service don't matter and is getting worst with many new changes. Very impersonal no work life balance. All about sales high sales pressure. Very low pay compared to other big banks and even credit unions. No incentives accept annually which after taxes are a joke and hard goals to reach. Not a whole lot of support from anybody. No advancement from branch manager they have eliminated the next step for a branch manager and have recommended looking for lateral moves verse vertical. Upper management hasn't worked a day in the branch and the ones that have haven't been in the branch for years but somehow think they could run a branch. Place is pretty much a joke everyone hates it and I have worked in dill several different branches in different states and it's all the same. 99 percent of the employees are building resumes to leave at the first chance.

They were originally pitched by the CPC banker, and had a bad experience. He ended up as a private client because of the rapport I created, and I was told that I get no credit for the referral because the CPC banker talked to him about CPC first, even though I created the relationship. It wouldn't have made a difference to the CPC banker's compensation wether or not she got the referral from me. My branch has a blanket referral mentality, so the longer you're there to put notes on every customer you sit with, the more money you'll make. Building relationships mean nothing at my branch, so unless you cold call all your customers, it's difficult to hit your bonus plan. Assume regular customers are already off limits.

They could've just been honest right from the beginning and saved everyone a year of misery. There were lots of mixed messages and inconsistency, crazy operational practices put into place after government crackdowns, always a fear of losing your job with the smallest mistake. Would extend work hours out of no where and for no reason and management was expected to stay on for hours later without extra pay. Never closed for snowstorms.

There is a high degree of stress and management uses usually negative reinforcement and scare tactics for motivation.  In the last year they have been making more of an effort to improve morale with a ""Culture Club"" that has been trying to come up with ways to make employees happier.

2) Raises are insultingly low, they don't keep up with the cost of living or inflation, ranging from 0-2% (in the last 5 years I've only heard of one person who received over 2%). We routinely receive emails from corporate about how great the company is doing, how profitable it is, how we increased our market coverage, etc. yet the low raises persist.  The result is we actually earn less each year because our spending power decreases due to the raises not keeping up with raising costs.

I don't find it fair that people that don't know how to do their jobs, got to keep them, and talented people with great work ethic are being left in the dust. I've had to assist several people in different departments on how to do their job on a daily basis, because they were unsure.

I was a relationship banker which requires getting your series 6 & 63 which you use 0% of the time so it is useless. Be prepared to work almost every Saturday of your life, to try and convince people to bring there money that is earing a higher interest rate at another bank to chase and get them to invest (not gonna happen). You will waste your day cold calling people trying to convince them to get products don't need (this doesn't work). You wear a suit, but barely make enough to get by (oh yeah you have to buy your suits too). Bonuses are great if you can actually get them. If you are at a slower branch you are doomed. Technology is changing how people bank thus brining less people into the bank which means less opportunity to earn bonuses (think ATM's, online, phone apps, E-ATM's, etc). Once you get licensed you have to stay at Chase for 1 year from that date...not your hire date, or you will owe chase $2000 to pay them back for the licensing fees. I had to pay them the full $2000 because I was only licensed for 10 months. I earned that company tens of thousands of dollars and if I didn't pay they were going to send me to collections. My college degree went to waste in the anxiety inducing environment.

Also a very strong and stable bank. Good benefits.,"Lacking in the person to person feel as an employee. This is due largely to the ""big bank"" feel and management lack of being helpful in helping you grow. Also comp plan is designed for high volume locations like Chicago, New York, LA, etc. Being in a smaller lower loan size city, it can really hurt on what you can take home in pay. Constant changing of the comp plan was also irritating. Chase has an overall bad relationship with realtors...ie. late closings, too many requested documents from customers.

Management doesn't pay equal attention to all areas.The experience of entry-level workers, as well as those in departments that don't generate as much revenue is totally different of people in other areas. There is a class system at Chase.  Don't believe that if you work hard you can move up and into other departments. If you come in as a teller, as a customer service person-you are not moving up to wealth management! Where I worked had food-stained carpet, walls and bathroms and sinks that didn't regularly work, in addition to 10 -year old computers and systems that constantly went out. Sometimes there were problems with bedbugs. Entry-level workers were on food stamps. $15.00 minimum wage-management doesn't approve. They don't like unions. HR is outsourced. They are moving a lot of call centers to the Phillipines. Who knows how they are treated. In a building with 10,000 Chase employees, there is no one you can meet with in person from HR. Chase will always win any dispute. They do not care if there are problems with your paycheck, benefits, etc.-that they caused. Their HR people do not take notes-literally there is no documentation done when you call. Lots of problems with administrative issues. There is retaliation for seeking help to deal with personnel issues from their incompetent management. They take a line from Amazon on that, and say there is none. It's not true. Nothing is anonymous.The pay and raises are low unless you work in a commission-based job. The benefits and time-off are so-so and good. But they give you the time off because they will burn you out. High employee turnover in a lot of departments, even for mid-level. They hire lots of foreign workers because they are used to long hours and unreasonable demands. Questionable ethics at every turn."

Also processors are supposed to do a welcome call and keep in communication with the customer, yeah that never happens. I was emotionally drained by being beat down by customers and realtors due to not closing on time, I had to leave for my own health and my family. They stopped doing FHA loans, so you will only get cookie cutter conventional loans because they don't want to deal with ""troubled borrowers"". Understand that they are getting out of mortgage unless its a perfect mortgage and getting more in depth with investments, they are a firm first and foremost so your just a body to fill in a chair and take orders when they come your way. The branches will eventually get upset when you make their clients angry with the whole institution when the process goes really bad, very quickly. You will make money here, but at what cost?

As a Relationship Banker the objective is to build long-term relationships with clients through consultative conversations and regular followup.  The goal is to uncover client needs and provide product recommendations and referrals to partners such as financial advisors and mortgage loan officers.

They will try to tell you that all of the service work you don't get commission on is translated into your base salary but when you spend almost two or three weeks fixing one issue, you find it isn't worth it. Banking is changing, there is less foot traffic and more phone calls. 

The infamous, ""you won't get paid on everything."" That should be expected in your everyday life at chase. If you work with a client for a year and they finally decide to do that big investment you've been waiting for, don't expect to get paid on it. Chances are, chase will come up with a reason not to pay you.

Timing is everything!!!!!  Career opportunities abound for Diverse Candidates.,"Very political and decisions to promote or hire are not always tied to performance.  The company feels like it has become too big to manage.  For experienced hires, make sure you negotiate your salary upfront, because you may never get another raise due to timing.  From my experience once every 3-5 years if you are a top performer. The company will stop at nothing to increase profits even when revenues are declining."

The company also offers an extensive amount of training for all positions and assistance transitioning into new roles.","Chase is going through organizational changes that, while ultimately beneficial, have increased the amount of uncertainty for its employees throughout the company.

By that I mean reviewing the Complaint, preparing pleadings, discovery, motions, briefs, and settlement agreements. Also, I was able to actively participate in the interaction with outside counsel, clients, and expert witnesses.",Time management was challenging sometimes with respect to the number of attorneys versus the number of paralegals. At any given moment an attorney would need something done while I was working on a task for another attorney and they needed this task to be done as soon as possible.

They had awesome computer systems and technology and the training was great.,"I was an assistant manager. The pay was terrible and they worked us all so hard and long hours. At times when my branch had no manager I was expected to work open to close, 6 days a week which ended up being 56 hours in my instore branch (even in my last trimester of pregnancy). They do not understand work/life balance. I'm an incredibly hard worker but making me feel bad for staying home when my child is sick when I never miss work was pretty consistent with all the higher ups i worked with the whole 7 years I worked there. They didn't care about customer service at all towards the end of my time there, which was sad for me who loves helping people and keeping people happy."
5810,,"Great Company, Known Issues",2015-08-15,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"The organization culture is phenomenal. At the corporate offices in Manhattan, I work with mostly MBA and Master's graduates who are some of the most professional and intelligent individuals that I've ever worked with. Nearly everyone exhibits excellent integrity and a willingness to go above and beyond what is expected.

The benefits and pay are above average for the industry: excellent health coverage, pension, 401k matching contribution, employee stock purchasing program, and paternity and maternity leave along with an unusually generous amount of free daycare days.

The opportunities to explore within the company are many and it is encouraged by every manager.

The work/life balance is ideal. Of course, there will be days you will need to stay late. But for the most part, you can expect to be home at a reasonable time to be with your family every night. I've worked on the weekends, late evenings, and holidays, but it's only because I put the pressure on myself-not because my manager demanded it.",Technology. It's a big company so there's a patchwork of technology that causes delays in getting things done.

It was a good place to work at before they went crazy over technology,"The technology movement has made it a horrible place to work at! No more room for growing. All the positions are being eliminated and new ones ""created"" to move ppl around or get rid of them.

5813,,Some pros some cons,2015-08-14,3.0,Anonymous Employee,Ability to assist in sales opportunities for both lending and investments,"The retail bank side can be brutal; from customers with overdrawn accounts complaining in your office ,causing you to miss sales opportunities with quality customers coming in and out of the branch while your stuck with a irate service issue that a non sales associate at the bank should be handling instead. Also The compensation structure is made to where bankers are forced to work in a dog eat dog environment which often led to bankers helping other bankers clients and getting paid on sales the initial banker had been discussing with them already. This lead to a lot of tension in many branches that I witnessed"

Large company so there is opportunity to transfer just about anywhere.,"District and Branch managers often do not want to work with employees. Not very good at helping, only looking for numbers. Not very family friendly at the branch level. Pay is equal regardless of area in which you live and work. Detrimental if you are working on commissions based on customer balances and home values and live in a smaller community. If you want to move up in the company you must work in New York or Chicago."
5818,,Good starting career job,2015-08-14,4.0,Personal Banker,"Lots of training, good health benefits, 401k and pension benefits too. Incentive plan (commission) may be great if you work hard and are in a good area. Lots of opportunities for promotions and lateral moves.","Incentive plan changes often, and changes can hurt or help your incentive. Commission can be extremely varied month to month. Max 40 hour work week, but hours can be VERY varied weekly because of the bank's long open hours. Performance, promotions and raises are based on your incentive plan results."
5819,,Salesperson in a suit,2015-08-13,2.0,Licensed Relationship Banker,"If you are passionate and driven by sales, being a licensed banker will make you a lot of money. The company still has the best incentive plan out of the other major banks. Banking hours usually end at 6 pm and most branches are closed on weekends like most financial jobs. The bank as brand has a lot of weight on your resume if you plan to stay in sales.","No opportunity for growth. The whole retail banking structure is micromanaged from top to bottom. Very little chance to move to any other position in the company. The other divisions of the bank look down on you. The base salaries are below market and the health plans are horrible. Employees will usually go broke paying their medical deductibles. The year end bonuses are cheap and quarterly bonuses are a joke. If you plan to stay as a sales person for your entire career with a suit on, this is your kind of job. Employee turnover at Chase is usually very high since most employees come and go quickly. There is really no motivation to work here unless you are driven to sell sell and sell. Your work and personal life will have no balance. Bankers are considered hourly employees so most managers track you minute by minute. You are docked for being late or have to use up your time when you leave early. This isn't the dream Wall Street job that brings in money. It's very much the opposite. It's like working at BestBuy with nice attire."

5823,,Relationship Banker,2015-08-13,1.0,Relationship Banker,"This company by far has great benefits available for its employees. Ranging from matching contributions for 401k's, pensions, and employee stock purchase options.","Employee retention is the last priority Chase has, or it may make it seem that way. Over a 3 year period they reduced the entire incentive plan for bankers, changed business bankers incentive pay from monthly to bi annual, Completely cut out the base pay from mortgage bankers and made them incentive only, cut out positions such as: front lobby associates, assistant managers (sales and ops) and district managers forcing those to look for other positions or other jobs. In addition to that over a 3 year period I've remained consistently as a top banker in our district and I have never received a raise. They base it off your annual review where you have to make a 5 out 5 stars and conveniently I've made a 4 out of 5 every year causing me not to get a raise. The excuse I've continued to hear is that we can make our salary increase through our incentive but yet it's harder to do that when they continue to decrease the incentive plan. I've never had a company try so hard not to give raises to those that bring in production for the company but yet you still see million dollar bonuses for executives. I've also been promoted to a small business specialist to a private banker but all though you move in positions and take in more responsibilites you aren't compensated for it. In addition Chase continues to drill us on doing the right thing but they've been caught in 2 schemes, one dealing with mortgages and the other london whale scheme causing a settlement pay of a hefty amount, and then they invest in all these promotions ( around 750,000 in the previous tap snap and win promotion) for updated technology but can't take the time to invest in there employees. For these reason I am leaving Chase and looking for a company that is willing to invest in there employees not only themselves."

It felt like I worked with family which is awesome","The company has changed a lot. It shifted its focus from customer service to now electronic adaption. Eventually what is going to happen is there will be only the lead teller and that will be it. Which will be great for the company since they save a lot of money that way but it will be terrible for the employees because after all the years you put in the company your hours will be cut drastically. Depending on who your manager is, it is difficult to move up but if you know enough people it is doable (networking is everything). Even if you are a 20 hours a week teller, you expected to be available anytime before 6. Some days you will work 2 hours a day but its ok because in the end you will get your 20 hours a week or less.

There is a perpetual lack of resources for completing a project, despite $22 billion in profits annually -- we all need to ""tighten our belts"" to get things done.

They pay less than competing firms; look elsewhere first.

If you must take a BM job with JPMC, use it as a spring board into another line of business.

Recognizable brand","Branch banking is changing. Encouraging people to use digital ways to bank, which gives clients less reason to come into branch, and out of sight out of mind. That makes the role more phone focused and harder to hit payout levels. And they seems to cut incentives each year little by little. They will add small incentives to make up for it. However, if you're not an established banker, the sales cycle is long and you will starve early on because of low base. Theoretically, a good position, but CPC banking benefits are garbage for 90% of clients. There is no benefit for clients to bring over assets, except maybe an investment strategy or two. However, more and more people are going the discount, low cost route. Branches are becoming short staffed, which leads to taking on responsibilities outside of your job description. All for teamwork, but base is too low for moral to remain high for very long. There used to be room for upward mobility, but they seem to be hiring from the outside more frequently and other job families are very unattractive (ie branch managers, loan officers).

As many others have said you will consistently miss your closing dates and close 30% or less of your business when your competitors will close it all.  Fha loans are basically a thing of the past with us.  If your loan amount is under $150k forget having competitive pricing.  Chase is centralizing there operations to be run more like quicken loans so from the looks of it in bank mortgage lenders will be a thing of the past for them anyways.  Management for the most part has not worked as a mortgage banker they truly have no idea what getting a mortgage is all about nor do they care not even a little they are very skilled talkers is all.  They have reduced so much processing staff and underwriting staff I am surprised any loan under $500k closes.  Now if you only do loans over $500,000 consistently you will have no issues and chase will love you.  Also I am not some new mortgage guy I have been doing this for 15 years and honestly it used to do so much better and they would work so much harder at getting the loans closed and insuring customer satisfaction.

Bonuses and raises at the end of the year (slightly pitiful but at least it's something)","Corporate keeps cutting our incentives (used to get $500 a quarter as a teller if we met requirements...now it's $100).

Corporate keeps cutting employee positions so now almost every location is cripplingly understaffed.

Corporate will not hire tellers for more than 20 hours a week (used to have 30 and 40 hour positions) so it is incredibly hard to make end meet as a teller.

6038,,Associate Business Manager,2015-06-08,2.0,Associate Business Manager,The company has vast resources and there are plenty of opportunities for internal movement.,"Based on my personal experience and the experiences of my coworkers it is very hard to earn a significant raise, even if you're just asking to be compensated at ""market value"" for your position.  Executive management and the Auditing Committee review raises as a percentage increase over current base salary.  Anything over 9% will raise red flags and will usually require your direct manager to justify the raise.  All departments are allocated specific salary pools based the budget with minimal to no consideration given to the talent and performance of the employees.  Giving one individual a substantial raise will require pulling funds from other high performing individuals.  A co-worker and I were both promoted in title and pay grade yet neither of received a raise due to ""budget restrictions"".  Both of us were promised the lack of raise would be made up the next year and that did not happen.  You literally have to fight with senior management to get a raise and, even then, there's definitely no guarantee.  Chase is willing to pay to get you in the door but earning raises after that is very very difficult.  Management will constantly tell you how much they value and appreciate you and how indispensable you are; unfortunately, these sentiments are very rarely reflected in your compensation."

6077,,Mortgage Banker Review--Read Before Applying,2015-05-27,1.0,Mortgage Banker,"401k Matching, Retirement, Health Benefits, Vacation and Sick Days","Chase has a very high attrition rate in the Manhattan mortgage industry. Rest assured, there's a reason for this. Their top producing mortgage bankers left them years ago to work at Wells Fargo, Citibank, etc. Chase has a branch on virtually every corner. Wells has very few branches. Wells outproduces Chase year after year in mortgage originations. I rest my case.

As a mortgage banker, be prepared to do the job of three people with no base salary (only a forgivable draw). Chase does not support mortgage salespeople whatsoever. They absolutely refuse to hire adequate operational support. Their processors do NOT work the loans because they are overwhelmed. The mortgage banker does the entire job of a processor. Chase's senior management prefers to save money by forcing all of the work on their mortgage bankers. By savings money on operational costs, their greedy, self-serving senior management can reap huge, undeserved bonuses while their mortgage bankers have no work/life balance.  Also, they refuse to authorize overtime although they are very aware that everyone works more than 40 hours per week. Their mortgage bankers class action sued them for this a few years ago and won. Feel free to look it up online. 

In Manhattan, many of their sales managers have never been mortgage loan officers. This is a “right of passage” which many of them lack. It shows in the way they are entirely aloof to the lack of support that their employees' receive from ops. Actually, their sales managers are fully aware of the lack of support but they simply don't care. Their sales managers have no problem with this because they are compensated on many factors that have nothing to do with mortgage closings--i.e., new hires, attrition, etc. If they were paid strictly on mortgage closings, you would see a major difference in how they treat the business at hand. The perception is that certain of their sales managers are ""out to lunch"" or stuck in one of their ""all-day meetings”. Meanwhile, their mortgage bankers are in constant need of their assistance while they twiddle their thumbs in their endless meetings.  This is a running joke in Manhattan. 

There is absolutely no upward mobility at Chase as a mortgage banker. It is a 100% dead-end job. Unless, of course, you fill a 'race' or 'gender' quota. In which case, you may be promoted despite the fact that you may have little to no experience and, certainly, no skills to speak of. Race, gender and sexuality politics have no place in the workforce. But at Chase, a day doesn't pass without corporate pushing and force feeding their liberal propaganda down their employees' throats via the company’s internal intranet portal. Articles run the gamut from “ethnicity"" to ""gay pride"", etc. etc.   I am surprised that they haven't appointed Al Sharpton to their board of directors yet. People don't come to work to be politically indoctrinated by their employers. While these corporate, bleeding-heart executives are wasting money on this nonsensical hogwash, they could be hiring additional mortgage processors. This way, their mortgage bankers don't wind up doing the job of three people.  This way, they don’t wind up being subject to another class action lawsuit for violating federal wage laws and illegally refusing to pay their employees' overtime.

Meanwhile, JPMorgan Chase just plead guilty to a felony charge for their part in manipulating the foreign exchange market.  While Chase is busy abusing their mortgage bankers in New York, it is also ripping off unassuming customers all over the world.  Chase is the epitome of corporate greed and unprofessionalism. They are entirely motivated by profits at the expense of the people who work for them and the unassuming customers who do business with them. Their management needs a major overhaul starting with Jamie Dimon. If this company were split up by the government tomorrow, the world would be a better place for it."

I was the fourth person in my role in a six year period. Poor client driven relationship practices with this level of turnover.

The ""core values"" on every login screen of every computer are completely dismissed if they are inconvenient to pushing the bottom line up for the quarter.

Micromanagement.

Efficient staffing (e.g: there may be only two tellers, and one banker in the branch, so that other team members (such as Mortgage or Financial Advisor partners) are unable to solicit bankers for information on shared clients to be prepared or to help the client from havfing to tell their story over and over, provide duplicate documents, etc - let alone update one another on how the pipeline is going, or make joint time together for coaching, outbound calling, etc.

Fear of reprisal:  if anyone actually says what's impacting business outcomes; extreme denial by Management when the subject is broached. Starts with ""no... I'm sure that's not the case, and ends with ""Well, that's the direction of things... it looks like"".

Lack of communication across silos.

6219,,Teller,2015-04-06,4.0,Teller,Pretty simple job. Handling transactions and customer service. Selling seems to be optional for a teller but you do get incentives to suggest products to customers. Some branches are a lot slower than others.,Chase branches are often understaffed. Polices changes too often which makes it confusing.

There is rarely a single solution on which everyone will agree.   To often the work/life balance is tilted heavily toward work."

No clear plan to get you anywhere. They tell you that doors are open, but when your in retail, your in retail.

They even worked with me when I had attendance issues due to personal reasons! They make you feel welcome from day 1. Pay is better than any call centers in the area and great vacation benefits!,They need to work on the overall culture in the center. Employee moral is low. Cafeteria charges way too much for the poor food they serve. Hard to move up since everyone stays in their position.

Adequate Benefits.
I get to work with very smart people, it can be a great place to learn and grow.","They tend to look outside for new talent and to fill management positions. Actual promotion from within is almost non existent; unless of course they are trying to meet numbers for women and minorities in certain positions. Promotions, when they do come, don’t usually include a salary increase. They also have a tendency to “eliminate positions” to get rid of people. This isn’t exclusive to Chase, since I live in Delaware I have a number of friends who work at Barclays, discover and Bank of America and they have shared similar experiences. There appears to be a tendency to eliminate the positions of employees over the age of 50. Again this is not exclusive to Chase. As I approach that period in my life I can’t help but wonder how long they will keep me around. I've never met anyone at Chase who has retired of their own free will and accord. 
Additionally the work environment has changed dramatically. The standard cubicles have been replaced with low wall desks in “open” settings. The noise is untenable and it has reduced productivity across the board. Of course they would disagree because they will never admit to being wrong.
Salary and Bonuses are inconsistent from one line of business to the next."
6244,,Company not loyal to employees,2015-03-26,1.0,,Dealing with a diverse group of customers.,"It's all business, management like you when things are going good for their branch and P&L don't fail an audit. The ABM's are always the blame. And they will find every way to demote or fire you."

Secure company that likes to promote from within.,Pay is very low compared to most other banks-very few raises. Most of the management is terrible all the way from district to assistant branch managers. Most have no management experience before Chase and have just moved up the ranks. Chase's vision is to just find people that bleed blue and forget their morals to be supportive of the company. There is no clear vision in the company from week to week-it is exhausting and stressful keeping up with what their new focus is (which never seems to be the customer)

At the time I was employed with Chase, investment and life insurance licensing was being offered- This allowed for good commission..","I do not have any real cons. More of an opinion: At the end of the day, this is retail banking. If looking to break into other areas of finance (corporate banking, IB, etc.) this may not be the best route"
6271,,Chase is an okay company to work for. Compensation is decent but the incentives are weak.,2015-03-10,3.0,Licensed Personal Banker,"Chase offers great benefits. This is probably the only reason why I stayed with company as long as I did. For the most part, Chase wasn't terrible. Compared to what I heard other bankers from competing banks were made to do, Chase was probably a decent place to work.","It is quite apparent that Chase is ONLY focused on the bottom line. This is no surprise however, when they keep finding ways to nickle and dime their customers AND their employees, there comes a point where enough is enough.

I started when it was EMC and it was customer service.  When Chase took over customer service moved to Ohio.  I transferred to another department and lost my 10% shift differential while being promised that I would have a raise to what every one else in the department was making at 40k per year.  This was for the people in that department to do a new function and for those being hired from outside.  I, however, did not receive this although I discussed it with my supervisors and VP several times.  They could not receive an answer from upper management at a different location.  It was completely wrong and unfair and it was not just me.  After a couple of years here there wasn't enough work to keep us busy.  Eventually I was laid off and still looking for work.  There was no place to move up to as again, there were too many supervisors.  Several supervisors were laid off when I was due to no employees to manage. Also the raises for the last several years (I am supposing this to be due to the economy where there are more people looking for work than employers) the raises were about 1%.  Chase would brag in emails about the biggest quarterly profits ever but not pass that on to their employees."

There is absolutely NO Work-Life balance, even though they talk about it consistently, and if they're in the process of phasing out your position, they'll use any and every excuse they can to get you fired. If you're salaried, expect to work 45 to 60 hour weeks, and expect to have your schedules constantly changed. Conflicts of interest are often overlooked, as are blatant ""Code of Conduct"" violations, if the branch manager is producing. If you're a teller, expect to adhere to the letter of the law, with no grey areas. If you're a Banker who's producing? You pretty much get carte blanche."

I am a member of the Mortgage Credit Banking Program, which is a program designed for college graduates who wish to get a proverbial, ""foot-in-the-door"" to the finance industry. I have developed a great deal of camaraderie with my fellow co-workers and could not ask for a better direct and site level manager.","In terms of the culture, I personally feel that their is a significant disconnect between the strategic planning/goals and communication of policy as designed by upper management and the ground level employees tasked with implementation. In the mortgage bank, communication and overall understanding of corresponding responsibilities needed to complete tasks effectively for the benefit of our customers is atrocious.
 Pertaining specifically too the Mortgage Credit Banking Program, I must say that Chase is either the most indecisive or dishonest company to attempt such a program. The program was originally marketed as some sort of, ""leadership development program"" where the, ""graduates"" would be given leadership opportunities or opportunities in other areas of the bank upon completion. However, the length of the program has been changed at least three times since I have been a member. The overall sentiment is that it appears that the program was merely a guise to obtain cheap labor in the underwriting department, i.e. program underwriters are paid significantly less than non-program underwriters for doing the exact same job. It also seems significantly more difficult for program underwriters to get actual promotions or even make lateral moves. I know of only a handful of individuals that were able to make lateral moves, no promotions. I am not sure if this is due to indecisiveness as to what the program is supposed to be, or if it is truly just a ploy to obtain cheap labor, but regardless, morale is extremely low."

6390,,The most soul-crushing job that I have ever had!!!,2015-01-21,1.0,Vault Teller,I learned how banks operate and I learned how to better manage my own personal finances. I also learned that yelling at bank employees is pointless because they have no control over bank policies.,"As a teller, I was the lowest man on the totem pole with a great deal of responsibility. It was very stressful and I often felt unappreciated. It was the only job that I've had where everyone developed a drinking problem to cope with the stress of working for a company that often made one feel like their best was never good enough."

6393,,Not for me,2015-01-20,1.0,Client Service Professional,Nice offices with decent starting salary. I think the overall hands on training was good when you start on at Chase.,So much structure that you don't feel like a normal person when talking to a client.

Their reputation is one of the best for banks. They focus a lot on customer service.,"Being such a big corporation, it's all about who you know more so than what you know. Every year incentives are lowered and salary stays the same. You're thereby making less and less every year. The company's main concern is their bottom line. They faze out positions like no other by consolidating and giving more responsibilities to individuals without any additional pay."

6412,,Very Easy To Work For,2015-01-13,5.0,Teller and Banker,"Chase has the best systems which makes it easier to focus on the customer rather than fumbling with the system. They offer great benefits and the branch I worked at was very accommodating to my schedule. I work for another bank now and I miss having the easy streamlined systems, products, etc.","Like all big banks, the business hours are long and they are open Saturday.

6416,,It's wonderful if you want to settle for a secure and stable job.,2015-01-10,3.0,Personal Banker II,"Benefits are great, 3 weeks of paid vacation, almost additional week paid for sick days and personal days. Schedule is flexible, able to excuse myself with early arrival or early departure (or i guess depends on your managers). Paid for national holidays. I like the commissions taste on top of the fixed salary base. Even though the base is one of the lowest among the banking industry (compared with friends that work at other banks), however the commission part is definitely a lot higher than other banks. 
Suggestion on getting promotion: work smart (sometimes also leads to unethical decisions) and getting browned nose on all of the top managers.","Coworkers sometimes become your enemies due to the competition. A lot of drama at my branch, which i dislike the most. And two of the reasons I want to leave is because of the lack of management and work environment. It's definitely NOT a team effort environment. I said lack of the management is because your voice won't' be heard, because if other people who has the seniority says otherwise, your voice won't matter at ALL. 
Company is reducing employee incentives. So compare with other companies before diving in. Make sure to talk to the employees at the specific branch that you apply to. Read their personalities and work ethic. Some of my other coworkers from other branch LOVES their work, their managers and their coworkers, but some also HATES their work, managers and colleagues. 
It's very hard to get transfered out to a different branch. And remember, if you don't want anyone to know anything, DON""T SAY ANYTHING TO ANYONE. Words will spread like a wild fire, because NO ONE is professional, including branch managers, and assistant branch managers. They have nothing to talk and gossip about, so they will use whatever they hear at the branch and make you a target."

Team works together very closely, and often a branch's success is determined by how well 8 or 10 people can work together.","Branch banking is a changing industry, in the next few years far fewer customers will mean far fewer employees in branches.
Assistant branch manager position eliminated from all but a few branches.

6429,,Great door opener but limited,2015-01-04,3.0,Licensed Relationship Banker,"The branch atmosphere is a team atmosphere which I found to be fun. Management in my branch never acted like dictators. If you show interest in your position, have a positive attitude, and show that you care to learn from your mistakes, management will try to reward you. Managers try to work with you to accommodate time off or emergencies. They are willing to make last minute schedule changes to try to help. There is an employee benefits website where you gain points and ultimately cash back for making purchases through the site. Understanding your benefits like time off, health and wellness benefits, retirement options and employee stock options are all easy through the internal site. If this is your entryway to a career in finance, it is a good place to start. Great for college graduates who are trying to find a place for themselves in the workforce. You can learn a lot about personal finance, business banking, mortgages and some investment knowledge within the branch environment. Different types of daily interactions will help foster communication skills.","As a Relationship Banker, you don't get to pick the clients you work with. You are assigned a book of business, many of which are not even in your area. Cold-calling is part of the job. The base salary isn't much and if you get promoted from Personal Banker to Relationship Banker, your base does not change. Only your incentive plan changes. While the incentive for Relationship Bankers is decent, because the branches are overstaffed with bankers, it will be harder for you to make sales. Ultimately, you will never make as much as they claim you can from the incentive. Training courses are redundant. Incentive plans change year to year. Salaries have not increased in the last 2 years. It is a sales position so it can get stressful when you don't meet goals. It is almost impossible to make the cross from the Chase side of things to JP Morgan."

The upper level managers think that by berating employees in front of others, expecting them to work long hours without pay or thanks, having conference calls during lunch hour and insufficient staff to get the job done, that they will get the results that they need or want.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  High performers get the message early and bale.   Chase turnover has to be well over the average in the industry, it was a revolving door.

Upper level management  is the worst at making decisions. Every time they make a change to improve the process, it consist of firing employees and get less employes to do more work.

Your pay is based on the overloaded employees in the back office to get your file closed in a timely manner. So don't get too excited about submitting applications.

Anytime there is an issue it gets swept under the rug, and management finds ways to point the finger at you, so always document everything. 

The process is very inconsistent, and that is due to the high attrition rate, and lack of communication.

6474,,Learned a lot from this job,2014-12-08,4.0,Senior Risk Analyst,Management is nice and friendly. Have a lot of learning opportunities. work life balance.,"compensation is OK, but not great."
6475,,"Easy, but at what cost?",2014-12-08,3.0,Teller,"I was a teller. That is, the lowest of the low. Of course, one of the best perks of working at a bank is the hours. Never open past 6pm during the week, and pretty easy Saturday hours (9am-2pm). And, for part-time tellers, the hours are very flexible, which is great for students. Depending on what your management team is like, you may or may not have a lot of pressure to refer. You're not required to know much to make referrals; the key is to convince the customer to sit with a banker. Once you do that, it's the banker's job to ""tag"" you on whatever service they end up signing the customer up for in order for you to get paid. It's nice; if you're good about it, you can add an extra $50 to your paycheck each month. 
The job is ridiculously easy. Because of the push toward online banking and kiosks/ATMs that do most of what customers need to do, your day will probably consist of a lot of sitting around, another perk for students who need to study).","While the referral incentives can add a little extra cash to your paycheck, the amount paid keeps getting lowered every year. If you refer someone who ends up opening a new account, you get $3. It was $5 when I started at the company in 2011. For employees who haven't been with the company long, they might not know how the customer service incentive works. In 2012, the first year a customer service incentive was offered, it was FANTASTIC. Every quarter, you work toward the highest possible customer satisfaction score (determined by random phone surveys given to customers who do teller transactions). The top 10% of branches per district would get Gold. For tellers, that's a $500 payout, for a maximum of $2000 over the year if your branch reached gold status each quarter. Those amounts were higher for bankers and managers. Silver status (next 10%) got you $250, and bronze (next 10%) got you $100. It was motivating. 
Those payouts and metrics lasted one year. Now, the metrics include customer service, product knowledge (determined by ""secret shoppers""), up-to-date customer information, and number of new accounts opened. The ONLY metric that tellers have any control over is customer service. The rest deals with bankers. Each quarter, if every metric is fulfilled (75% customer service, 100% on everything else), tellers get $150. Bankers (who used to get $800 for gold customer service) get the same $150. Among the Chase employees I still keep in contact with, there is no motivation anymore. After taxes, that $150 ends up being roughly $100. After offering one year of fantastic incentives, only to gut the program and decimate payouts, employees don't really see the point. 
Another big con is the dress code. Your shirts must bear the Chase name and logo, and the shirts are purchased through an employee clothing site furnished by Land's End. For tellers, their hire anniversary gives them 3 free shirts, chosen from a limited selection. The shirts are ill-fitting, and typically end up looking shabby by the time you can get more for free. Of course, you can purchase more with your own money. Prepare to spend at least $25 for the basic shirts (the same ones you can get for free), and upwards of $50 for the nicer ones. Tellers are the only ones who get free clothing each year. I know many people who buy Chase knit vests and simply wear cheap shirts that are similar in color to the ones they sell you. You're not supposed to do this, but if they really want people to abide by their dress code, their clothes need to be affordable. 
And, as with most banks, balances are the driving factor, especially if you end up working for a branch that has Chase Private Client (for customers with $250,000+ in assets). High-balance customers get waited on hand and foot."

Technology in place is good, when it comes to Customer Assist, Contact Manager etc. Easy to use interface for employees.","Well. Where do I start. This is a little intro: I began my career with Chase Bank as a Personal Banker, when the role still existed, a few months into my job I was performing pretty well and I was asked to gain my Investment Licenses (which you cannot use anyway because per company policy you cannot sell investments, or really even talk about it, so why do you need it? whatever), after becoming a national achiever, I believe I was number 66 in the country, I was promoted to Business Relationship Manager. 

Throughout my whole time at Chase (about 4 years) I covered different positions and I can tell you that there are political issues - if you don't know someone or are loved by someone you will not advance -, the amount of sales pressure is is incredible and pretty much not achievable by most - you really have to be in a super affluent area, play dirty and be the only banker to rank up those PVCs-, the compensation plan is a joke (for bankers) - every year they eliminate something you could get paid on, the managers are puppets and the company keeps opening up new roles up there in the higher management for they're friends and family. If I could sum it up I would say it's like the Mafia, only with lower compensation. 

On another note I can say that this only applies to Chase Retail (or branch banking), the JPMorgan side is a lot different and a lot better when it comes down to compensation, expectations and management. 

My suggestion apply elsewhere, maybe Wells, or Citi - they have much better salaries and are a lot less stressed out about achieving impossible targets. 

P.S. their keys to success that are drilled into everybody's heads do not apply to senior management."

Don't even think about going to HR or reporting anything to the Code of Conduct hotline as they will make it their mission to get you fired. They will fire you and have a smile on their face while they tell you. They will make up some phony reason why they are firing you and not give you any documentation explaining the official reason. You will then find out later from HR that you were fired for other reports management has submitted against you. The sales incentive plans are flawed and designed to make sure the PB's don't get paid and to manipulate the system to give them more responsibility without compensation. Your told not to open accounts for new households and refer them to the RB's but yet you are required to open a minimum of 3 each month to get any incentive. So make up your mind do you want just 3? Then allowing the manager to decide if you ""deserve"" a discretionary incentive of a max of 500 when they haven't seen the hard work that you do because they are busy browsing the internet or shopping or not showing up for a week is unfair and petty.

I was also regulated to standing in my ""box"" for four to eight hours a day. The big rule at the branch is ""Customers come first,"" but that rule is only meant for you.

There's a ton of opportunities to grow, get promoted or move to another position; it all just depends on you.

Very slow to get promoted unless you kiss butt to the District manager. I asked to be promoted to a banker and then lead teller but never happened.

You have to bring in hundreds of thousands of new money each month to make decent incentive. The incentive plan is capped in several ways to screw you over as well. It also changes constantly, so once you start making good incentive they lower it or cap it. 

Most branch managers are a joke and only care about your incentive because it makes them look good and gets then a bonus. They say it is all about building relationships and doing what's right for the customer, but truly it is all about how much you can sell. 

Chase products are not as competitive as other banks either. Customers need near perfect credit to get approved for anything (which makes it hard to sell anything) and they have streamlined their product offerings so much that their isn't much to sell either.

If you are in an area that is middle class and higher with a fair amount of traffic. I have made $5184 is one months incentive check and other only once have I not made anything. Average monthly incentive is usually $1000 to $1400. Again that is in a decent area. Areas with lots of money you will make tons of money.

Relocation, chase is everywhere so you have the chance to move almost anywhere if positions are open.

Advancement - I started as a teller and within 6 months I was a banker (very rare) but it can happen if you try hard and do your best.","Salary is pretty garbage. $33k is what I make and raises are maxed at $1000 a year if any. I started at $29k. Most seem to start at $32, I was very inexperienced at the time. No raise last year and I had my best year in sales for my location $58k.

They tend to hire people in their 20s so expect drama around you. Several promises to promote you but when the time came they gave it to someone else.Hours were reduced from 40 hrs a week to 20 for most tellers. Dangerous, robberies are possible I went through 2. Fraudsters are always approaching. Reduced team members and hours. Can be extremely stressful(anxiety was a new issue that resulted for me personally towards the last month of employment) its a business, there's competition, angry impatient customers, managers that were hired into a job that they are not good at & a monkey would be better or equally suited for.

Bonuses are promised but only paid out to the management cronies and favorites.  They always find ways NOT to pay you what is promised.

I think everyone's experience is based on their specific branch my branch was really close and family oriented so we had fun at work, but every Branch Manager may not be as lenient. Its a great place to start in sales good training and mentoring.","When I first got there the commission structure was great a lot of opportunity to make money then throughout the years they put a lot of caps and made it very hard to make a decent commission check especially if you are an ""unlicensed banker"". Licensed bankers still have a good opportunity to make a good chunk of money but of course not like before.

6576,,Very professional,2014-10-06,3.0,Bank Teller,"Great benefits, great opportunities to learn and grow in communication skills, and helps you gain lots of experience on how to deal with all types of customers. Like what other reviews have said, if you want to move up in the company it's all about who you know. Holiday pay, flexible hours, as a part-time teller i get 60 hrs a year for time off. If you have great managers they will make your experience at Chase a greater experience.","If you work in a busy branch like I do then things like the training get very frustrating because customers are our first priority so we end up helping customers all day and don't have enough time to finish training. Dress code is very strict and as a part-time teller it sucks when your coming to work from school and it's a hot day and have to change into a button up shirt and your sleeves can't be rolled up. I feel like Chase a very cheap as far as giving their employees ties for tellers because you can only wear Chase ties and every year they give you like 2 ties and they're the same ties every year. The other ties they offer you have to buy from the Chase store and they are VERY expensive. Same goes for Chase shirts, they give you 3 shirts free but you will need more than that and they are very pricey shirts. In my experience as a teller in a busy branch I hate my branch because for some reason Chase won't allow our branch to hire more tellers and we desperately need them. We have the numbers of transactions to prove it we need more tellers. Chase focuses on great customer experiences and monitor our customer service by having ""mystery shoppers"" go in the branch and besides that Chase randomly calls customers to rate their experience when they went to the branch. The customers rating affects our branch score and on a scale from 1-10, anything lower than a 9 Chase considers it as a bad score. Because we are short staffed and cannot hire more tellers, we get low customer experience scores because we get long lines and customers wait too long for their transactions and makes them unhappy."

While the CEO tries to pass along positive messages about valuing employees, the message is often lost in translation.
A new scheduling system which is 100% abusive of employees' time.
Every office/branch can be completely different, depending on management and the demographic of the clients in the area.
The bonus compensations drop tremendously every year, and really only benefit those lucky enough to be in a 'rich' location.
In times of layoff, mobility between opportunities can be completely shut down."

6580,,Absolutely the worst job experience of my life,2014-10-04,1.0,Senior IT Architect,"In the beginning when it was still Bank One it was pretty good.  Then when Chase bought us out.. the JPMC culture slowly infected the B1 culture and thats when things went all bad.  Opportunities were good, was a key contributor in a world-class team.  Chase legitimately used to attract the best and brightest IT folks in the industry.","Despite having the best and brightest, Chase fostered a culture of mining their human resources until they are dry instead of cultivating them.  It was literally a corporate policy to have the attitude that you're lucky to have a job.  There were a few excellent leaders that made staying worth it for a time... but in my organization of 500 people, in 2010 around 40-50% of them left.  For 7 years prior turnover was 1% or less.

Was told in the same review that because I was 2 days late turning in a development project that I was getting the lowest review rating, but then was told in the next breath that he didn't know anyone who could have gotten it done as fast as I did.  Working in that environment was like being blindfolded, stuck in a room with electrified walls that moved around, and then you're whipped every time you got shocked.

Needless to say, that after years of putting in 80 hour weeks I got out of there.  I seriously believe I may have a slight amount of PTSD from that place as even writing this review is making me anxious.

STAY AWAY!!!"

The compensation is also good if you are a student. I got paid 11.88 an hour plus quarterly bonuses and incentives on sales. It is good experience for a business major and the company name looks good on a resume once you begin to search for internships and an actual job.","It's extremely hard to get promoted within the company which is why I left. You would think that a big bank like this has opportunities for career development but it doesn't, they just tell you what you want to hear during your yearly review and drag you along. Also, do not work at a big/busy branch. It is hell on earth if you are teller. As a banker it is good because you are making money and sales but as teller it is an awful experience."

If you are hired at an affluent location your commissions are good and you can make some good connections within the company. But if you land at an average branch you have to work a lot harder than other bankers at better locations and that is not recognized by upper management. They just look at the numbers (or who you know) when promoting dismissing other factors."

Generous paid time off - if you are new to the company, you start off with 3 weeks paid time off (it used to be 2 weeks), if you are with the company 5 years then you get an additional week and so on every 5 year increment if I remember correctly, then it caps after a long while.

Everyone isn't equal or on the same wages or playing field !,2014-09-23,2.0,Help Desk Tech,Lot of paid time off (Which is needed to handle stress)  and a good manager the whole time I was there .,"Chase doesn't like to promote from within unless you know someone or your numbers are perfect. They never look at your resume to see what you are more qualfied for. People stay in the same position for 4 or 5 years without any explanation (Good workers) while they hire people off the street they barley know anything about. Also they add more duties to your job with out extra pay. Everyones wages are different but everyone performs the same duties or more.  I know people who make more or the same as me but do less work. And the work load ends up coming my way and noone does anything about it. I know people that come in making the same as me or more and nothing is adjusted for this. The department I was in was very under paid for all the different things we had to do and the stress level of the job. While other departments were paid decently and some even did less work. There is a department in the back all they do is reset passwords all day and make a good salary. We do that and more and make two to three dollars less? 

 Chase is also very focused on professional appearance even when your not dealing with the public and very judgemental about tattoos, Hairstyles and piercings ? I work in a cubicle and noone every comes in to see me so why should we have to wear business attire? The training is minimal after the 6 weeks its emails and crash courses from there and the company doesn't care if you know your coworkers or not ? They rarely do anything for the employees that is free without it being at your own expense other than employee appreaciation week. Even then you have to participate on your breaks and lunches. No time on company time for meetings or christmas parties or business meetings. So unless you read up on chase or go to there website you are out of the know on alot of things .

Many people are willing to walk over to your desk and talk about an issue with a file to get it resolved ASAP.  All of the managers were great.  I had (in my opinion) the best manager on the floor who was very flexible with my work schedule.,"There was too much work for the number of employees they had.  The last year I was there they kept saying they were working on hiring more people to reduce the workload but even after hiring new people the work load was unmanageable.  Ideally each loan processor would 40-50 files max, and for a while most people were working in the high 60s and low 70s (sometimes more).  This means less time to call customers back and keep an eye on all files.  Management understood the high volume and wouldn't criticize you for not making as much progress, but it still felt overwhelming and stressful.  You could not miss a day, even if planned in advance, without falling behind for the week's work."

6635,,Very Stressful Workplace-SWEATSHOP!!!,2014-09-05,1.0,Not Disclosed,"Pay and benefits were very good because this is a very large corporation. Monthly performance bonus' were eliminated and company instead took an average bonus and gave this to us in our department as a permanent salary increase. Everyone in my group benefited greatly from this. New employees came in at a much lower salary though. Location good, off major highways.","Upper management did not inform employees about changes they were going to make. Instead, you could be moved to a completely different job at a moments notice and given little training and be expected to perform and meet a required monthly goal. The first time I was moved, I was taken from an exempt position, which is what I was hired for, and made non-exempt. We were told this was temporary...but it was really permanent. Most of my department left the company at this time. I was moved 4 times in my last year, with 4 different managers. I always made goals, but the job stress was unbelieveable! At any one time 1/3 of a very large department was out on leaves of absence for stress relief! This was common knowledge. Management knew and still did nothing to improve conditions. After one move, I figured out I was actually doing 2 jobs! One entire department was laid off and all their calls were moved to my new department. Calls took our entire day, while at the same time we were given other new job duties to perform and a goal to be met!! The overtime was unlimited of course-I worked 14 hour days to do what was expected. So much for any personal life! I made very good money in overtime-but money is not everything!!! Then, once moved yet again, there would be no more overtime-workloads were just compressed- extremely heavy amount of work and we were expected to do it all in 7.5 hours. If you took time off, you likely could not meet your monthly goal, since it would not be adjusted accordingly. So, many people went on working in these conditions without taking vacations for fear of not making goal and being fired. We were given paid time off, but penalized for using it, and lost it at the end of the year if we did not take it. Catch 22!!! You could not win.
    Our customers actually came last in this work scenario. They had to be dealt with, but the work production and meeting government audit requirements came first. I experienced many management decisions that actually hurt our customers. When I pointed this out, I was just told the decisions had been made and would not be changed. We, in all things, really worked for the government, making sure they stayed off our backs and we passed audits and avoided huge fines.
   Feedback to management was highly discouraged. They expected employees to sit, do their job and keep their mouths shut. No idea was a good idea, unless management dictated it to be done. Instead, we were considered to be overpaid, (our increased pay was the company's decision) so were given excessive workloads and expected to produce, produce, produce! Very much a sweat shop mentality!!!!!!
   Then, the layoffs began. More stress!!!  If you did not meet your goal even one time, you were sure to be a target. If you ever took a leave of absence, spoke up about conditions, or had any other perceived imperfections, you were on the layoff list! Employees began to wish they WOULD be laid off, to get out of the oppressive environment. The longer you had worked there the more your severance pay would be. Chase used us, mentally and physically exhausted us, then kicked us out the door at the end when the amount of work began to decline."
6636,,Very corporate,2014-09-04,2.0,Bank Teller,"Chase puts a lot of focus into the customer experience but management also takes time to worry about the employee experience. They give quarterly bonuses when your branch meets the requirements plus a bonus at the end of the year. Vacation time is also nice, for a starting employee they give you three weeks plus you can earn floating holidays and you get sick time and a few personal days. They also pay for all the expenses related to the training they send you to, including time you spend in class, travel time, hotels, and food expenses.","That said I was really never able to take sick time because we were always understaffed. Higher ups were constantly asking employees to travel to other branches that had higher production numbers even if it meant that they left a branch with 2-3 people while the branch getting help had 5-7 people there. 
They don't have sales quotas but management will tell you every day that you need to be bringing in more accounts, even if you are just a teller. They want you to get any friends and family you have to come in and open accounts. 
They also do daily huddles where they go over the same numbers over and over again, comparing you to where you were last year and how easy it would be to improve on those numbers. 
You also have to wear Chase brand clothing. They pay for five items when you start but after that you pay for your own clothes. For women shirts average around $30, and everything you order takes at least three weeks to get to you because they embroider the chase logo on after you order."
6637,,Personal Banker,2014-09-04,3.0,Personal Banker,"Pay is OK considering you don't NEED a degree.. Nice time off -  I have been here 2 years and  3 months and I have 3 weeks paid vacation, along with sick and holiday pay. Chase is very supportive of many things including marriage equality which I highly value. They also give you incentives if you get healthier and work out etc.  I love my coworkers. My direct management is fabulous.

I actually REALLY like the CEO, Jamie Dimon. I think he is brilliant and I would love to meet him. The culture within Chase is great.","Too much external hiring without focusing on current employees. Too much negativity from the way that their customer service is scored. Everyday we bust our butts in my branch and our scores drop weekly. It is disheartening. We try and try. We get 1 average customer review and boom, there goes our customer service score - which we rely on to bonus.You only do well on your customer service scores if the customers give you a 9 or a 10. Anything below that and your customer service score DROPS. ALSO you are the FACE of the company! You can have someone come in and they LOVE you, but if they are mad at something that the company is in charge of and you have no score, well tough luck, you're getting a poor score. 

NO room to move up for me. From where I am at, I can either go to be a branch manager or maybe a financial adviser but I don't want either. Too stressful. Branch manager is too salesy, so is F.A. and F.A. is all commission. If you live in a city where there is a corporate office like maybe Chicago or NYC I am sure you can move up easier among back office. But in branches, you're pretty limited. 


 Too much moving around. In my time with the company I have been stationed  at  4 different branches. I have had 5 different branch managers. Each branch is ran differently. Each manager has a different style. I have gone from being the top banker in my district to the bottom banker, all because I switched branches. Involuntarily. Too many eyes are on Chase - everyone is waiting for us to screw up. Customers get mad at us daily for things we can't control - for instance, federal regulations. Customers get mad or offended if you don't remember them and you ask for their ID to withdraw money from their accounts ( which I find ABSURD! I would not want someone just coming in and taking money out of my account - you must verify it is that particular person!!!)

Very sales oriented! Numbers numbers numbers! Cold calls! Your production isn't high enough? Then get on the phones and try to get customers in and make a sale. A customer at your desk? Try to make a sale. I HATE SALES. I didn't know what I was getting in to. There are times when I am so stressed I just don't know what to do. I have lost all ambition to even TRY in this company. The only I care about anymore is just being nice to the customers and helping as much as I can. I have no desire to make sales anymore. Ever.  I am not competitive at all anymore. 

Typically, with annual reviews you get an hourly increase. I am still making the same as when I was first hired which I am dissatisfied with. I have found out newer people in my position being hired on and I find it very unfair that they make more hourly than I do. I feel like I have been tossed on the back burner and over looked many times."

You will be miserable, and the pay doesn't match the amount of work you'll be doing.  Those who have been in the busy for several years are struggling right now.  Also, you literally have to fight even those in the company for sales.  Everyone is a shark.   If you want to have a career where you'll learn a great deal and want to climb the ladder, so to speak, you'll be miserable here.  No opportunities to move up without getting lucky, and of course, knowing the right people.  Company seems to look for ""yes"" people, in regards to upper management.

These people would intentionally give bad information and then try to get me fired. Their training is so bad that it cannot be counted upon for the daily tasks. To be honest there really isn't any training. You are expected to learn the daily tasks from your coworkers that flunked out of college. Ohh!

All things considered, it was an okay company to work for.","I was in a sales position that I felt should have been a customer service position. All my life I have had great experiences with the credit union I am a member of. When I started working at Chase, I was trained to be a salesperson.

Great medical, vision and dental benefits.  Vacation weeks are determined by years of service, 3-4 a year, 3 personal days a year, 1 floating holiday, sick pay and holiday pay.  Some holidays worked but branches close early.  Great career to meet many people and make long lasting friendships, both co-workers and customers included.  Perfect opportunity to network with all types of business professionals, local small and large business owners, other financial institution employees and much more.  Company training is thorough and people friendly.  Computer systems used by employees and online services offered to customers is extremely innovative.","Extremely stressful, exhausting, overwhelming and deteriorating for all positions. Non supportive, non compassionate towards employees or customers, do not provide motivation or excitement for staff.  Too goal and numbers driven.  Always raising the bar for employees but lowering the incentive pay outs.  Change, alter, modify compensation plans all the time, whenever they want and to their benefit.  Do not acknowledge or value good, loyal and consistent employees.  Instead, encourage, tolerate and promote the liars, cheaters and unethical ones.  Hold yearly award pep rallies where they reward .... you guessed it, the cheaters.  They love to toot their own horn.  If you work here, you'll be on your own because only a few will be a friend.  You can not trust anyone because they are only around to betray you, cheat you, use you and spit you out at the end."
6685,,"Could be better, Could be worse",2014-08-14,3.0,Personal Banker,"The Pay is decent. You have the option of becoming a Licensed banker where you can make more money, but you have to commit to staying with the company for at least 1 year. I have learned a lot in the role as a Banker here and have learned how to deal with difficult people. People like to see Chase on my resume because it is such a reputable company and it's such a large company that the possibilities internally are vast.","You have to deal with people and their money which is one of the hardest things to do. They will blame you for everything even if it wasn't your fault, so you definitely have to have or grow a thick skin. There's a high demand for the sales portion, but at the same time you're expected to follow policies and have an extremely high level of customer service while dealing with upset customers in an understaffed branch (we're ALL understaffed!) It gets tough sometimes, especially with upper management demanding so much and not being very understanding, but it could be worse I suppose."
6686,,Mundane,2014-08-14,3.0,Anonymous Employee,"Good pay, The people that made up our teams were fun which made a very mundane job full of red tape easy to joke about which kept spirits up.","Brutal Management, You are a robot, You have no say."

6691,,Shady Promotion Promises,2014-08-12,2.0,Personal Banker,I learned a lot while working for Chase and experienced multiple aspects of the business. I learned what I like and don't like in a career and a company I work for.,"They are almost always under staffed for 2 major reasons. (1) They don't fill positions at all or take forever to do it when someone leaves, because they decided it is better to hire someone with banking experience and their licenses already and (2) they hire the wrong people for teller positions because they only offer part time work.

If you are looking to advance within the organization what you will likely experience is the pile more and more responsibility on you without any pay raises. I was told for 2 years I was being prepared to be moved into the branch manager trainee program and it kept being postponed with the promise of it being within the next 6 months. I then relocated for another position and after 3 weeks in the position was forced into my old position (great bait and switch.)

High expectation for outbound calls to set appointments with customers assigned to your branch to come in for account reviews to try to get additional sales. The calls themselves aren't bad, but they aren't a productive use of company time when the results from them are so minimal."

Lateral moves within the company are pretty easy, but promotional opportunities are extremely difficult. Even getting an interview through the internal job site is next to impossible even if you have connections in the department."
6693,,Wonder Place To Work,2014-08-12,4.0,Assistant Branch Manager,Chase gives you the tools to make you successful.  They are always looking to help you find the right balance between work and personal life.,For moving up with in the company you must be in cahoots with hiring manager.

Mine was new and did not know how to mot motivating.,2014-08-11,4.0,Senior Personal Banker,I really liked how professional they are with their clients and actually do put the customer first. I liked being part of business family there. Their regional manager treated me with respect and like family.

If you are good at your job - then good stability (barring scenarios like financial meltdown). Several perks at NYC museums - useful if you are visiting NYC","The conservative culture makes it difficult to provide diverse opinions. Projects typically run over time due to several levels of management, especially when it is corporate or multiple lines of business level projects.Slow in adopting to new changes and technology. Your manager can make or break your time here (mine was awful). The company provides framework for good work life balance and flexibility, but depending on your manager it can vary vastly from very poor to very good."

6706,,Too Big for ME to succeed!!!!,2014-08-06,2.0,Mortgage Banker,"The best thing about my time here at Chase is the name recognition with clients, referral partners, family, friends and future employers. Due to the LACK of cohesiveness with Sales, processing and underwriting.... I have gain an unmeasurable amount of critical thinking skills.  I'm trying really hard to find more things that are good about Chase...BUT...there are no more.","The company is TOO BIG!  Management doesn't ACTUALLY care about you/us.  Maybe your immediate manager, but their manger(s) look at them as ""nothing"" also.  The company's focus is on the Shareholders and media and affluent clients ONLY.  Its a bank, I get that...BUT IF they were to treat their employees with more respect and tried harder to PRETEND to care.....this would be a great place to work.  If you want to do mortgages DO NOT APPLY HERE...PERIOD.  This is a bank that does mortgages, because they have to.  THey definately don't WANT to.  70-80% of the operations dept is literally incompetant.  The Lo's hate the processors and UW""s.  The UW's hate the LO's and proc's..etc.  No one works together..at all.... and Sales starves because of it."
6707,,I wouldn't recommend it.,2014-08-06,2.0,,"Good pay, excellent bonuses, okay benefits.","Company only cares about sales. They claim that they are dedicated to customer service, but to them that means cramming more products down customer's throats. They want you to call customers all day long and try to get them to come in to review their accounts, what you're really doing is finding things to sell them. Management doesn't care about the employees only sales. When I worked there, I was hospitalized, when I got out after about a week, My sector manager's first words to me were, ""how many appointments do you have?"" She never asked me what happened or how I was feeling, she couldn't care less. The YouTube videos about this place are completely accurate. You'll do well there if you have no problem bothering people over the phone while they are at work trying to get whatever you can out of them. If you have no conscious you'll make money."

Lateral moves to different jobs within the same line of business are available.  Great use of technology with many areas phasing out paper and information available now online.  Managers and culture laid back for banking.  They make a great effort in recognizing employees that do excellent work.,"Not much diveristy in any management in the back offices, more on the retail side I guess.  Difficult to change from one line of business to another.  Salaries and job classifications codes are not assessible. In other words hard to find out if one job pays more then another."

They give you a great way to start out in the company and build your way up. There are benefits for part time employees and they want it to be a friendly work environment.,"The job is stressful, and you do the same thing all day long. They are all about procedure to a fault sometimes. It can over run customer service and  making your branch have a hometown feel. The hours are some of the longest out there. I was hired for 30 and worked forty because they couldn't get approved for another teller. There was no overtime and they were not forgiving when I had conflicts with the number of ours I had to work extra."
6714,,Great Starter Job,2014-08-02,3.0,Assistant Branch Manager,Working in the branch feels like a family.  I was able to hire my own staff and develop them accordingly. Annual bonuses and incentives for customer service and sales,Like all jobs when changes happen in the industry there is a sudden shift.  Managers were not always equipped with the proper knowledge and training to lead a team.  Employee development was not consistent from branch to branch and manager to manager.  Many manager changes made it difficult to move up after a certain point.

They basically make you believe that by taking on so much responsibility you can easily get promoted. which i must say is not the case I've tried to apply to multiple positions and I didn't get an interview. why? because I haven't worked long enough with the company."
6721,,Had a good run as a Mortgage Banker in DFW.,2014-07-30,1.0,Mortgage Banker,"I made a good living there. Good benefits, good work life balance, nice 401k match and pension.",Terrible local management in DFW East. I was a top producer in the market and wasn't allowed an assistant while colleagues in other markets with less production got assistants. I had 4 lending managers in my last18 months as a Mortgage Banker all of which hated working for their Manager. Her poor leadership and toxic management style trickled down to make Chase a bad place to be a mortgage banker. I put up with this until Chase announced they were reducing their compensation for Mortgage Bankers. I know this was upper management's calculated attrition plan which backfired on them since recently they gave an additional bonus to MBs to keep them from leaving. Chase shouldn't be in the mortgage business since although the bank is over 200 years old they still haven't figured out a way to effectively process or underwrite a home loan. Now that I am at a competitor I appreciate all of chase's deficiencies since it has resulted in additional business for me.

The Brand is strong and well respected throughout the U.S.A. They have tuition reimbursement. This is a great job to help pay for rent, car and tuition.","The call center does not promote very often.  In the years 6 years I've worked here, there has been maybe one promotion for every 100 lateral moves.  The site has two popular temporary positions they use to develop your skills for leadership.  Many employees are successful in the temporary position, but when a permanent leadership position opens, a lateral move is made from existing management to fill the vacancy.  The member that was in the temporary position must go back to their original job. So this is not a place to make a career."

Most were promoted for they ""know"" the right people (Office politics)These are the very people that employees are suppose to approach for guidance and  knowledge.  Often times makes very poor judgement and ultimately affects customer service and employees job satisfaction. Yes I am speaking of, Market Managers, District Managers, Business Area Managers, Branch Managers, and Asst. Branch Managers.  Lack of experience, knowledge and most of all people skills. I often say, policies and procedures are there for guidelines to follow so one can execute the proper process, however, critical thinking and common sense need to exist.
There is no leadership, no training provided for the right employees(management often picks employees they like not because they are talented) therefore no growth for the right employees left behind. I have worked for the company for 10 years and worked at different positions such as mortgage, business banking and personal banking. I have taken 6, 63, and Life and Health licensing training under so much stress to better myself and be an asset to the company. I am a consistent producer and have had exceeds in my reviews.  However, currently experiencing dissatisfaction because of the management I am under.  I feel that I am completely alone.

6752,,Not a place to grow,2014-07-15,3.0,Senior Loan Processor,Work life balance is good as long as you do not abuse it. When every a situation comes up with my children I can take time off with no questions asked.,No job security. There is always a feeling that any moment you maybe laid off with no explanation even if you have been with the company for years. The company does not promote based of skill it truly is a culture based off who you know and how much you can sweet talk into your new roll.
6753,,Good starting ground,2014-07-14,4.0,Licensed Relationship Banker,Licensing process is fantastic. Opportunity to make good money if you can refer business to your partners.,Strict policies and regulations limit freedom and independence as an employeee

6756,,Some great benefits but overall lacking,2014-07-11,3.0,Relationship Banker,"The benefits are nice. 401k, company paid retirement plan, and all the insurances. You also get great discounts on a variety of things from cars to museums.",Pay is bad. My pay plan has gotten worse each year. Less commission for same work.  If you're not in one of the big metro areas where there are corporate offices there isn't much chance of advancement or of getting outside retail banking.

Great benefits and bonuses, 
Tons of learning opportunities through their online learning portal & sponsored training, 
A lot of executive management is actually pretty open to hearing ideas and issues
Technology teams are phenomenal - best in the industry.","Bureaucracy / political red tape... almost every bad decision that's still in place probably has a backer somewhere in executive management - and because of that - you are not able to change the process / systems used. 
Re-Orgs - they happen at least 3-4 times a year
Don't listen to all internal stakeholders on project teams - the only voice that matters is the one holding the purse strings... even though they're not the ones who do the day-to-day work and are familiar w/ systems
Most upper level executives are pretty good, but there are also some that are not so good. 
Work / Life balance may be compromised at times when you need to get a job done or handle escalated incidents - but this is the same anywhere. 
Mobility is also not too good... it's very easy to pigeon-hole your career into one LOB or role - be smart and try to switch it up every few years if you can."

Chase also has a solid rewards and recognition program for those employees that excel to the to echelon within their positions.",Chase's current sales model is intense and extremely high pressure to perform to avoid being put on disciplinary action.  This was NOT the environment just a few years ago and I think is the result of an entirely new senior leadership team.
6764,,Good place to start,2014-07-06,4.0,Relationship Banker,"Access to industry leading research, CRM software, great back end support for bankers. Products to offer are highly competitive.","Depending on which branch you get, and which manager you end up with , it will make or break your experience at Chase.

In the interview, you will be told that this is a ""Manager-Training Position."" It is not. Dedication, knowledge, and teamwork are not rewarded. Individual achievement is the only way to impress management even though corporate preaches teamwork and selflessness."
6767,,It was a great place to start my banking career.,2014-07-05,4.0,Bank Teller,Good training program and lots of opportunity to advance. Flexible hours and a good way to get experiance with cash management and customer service.,They pressure you to upsell products and accounts.

There is a good training website, but it typically might not deal with your department. However, it is accessible away from work, and it is a great way to beef up your skills in a lot of different areas. I wish I had used it more.","Training can be sparse and bonuses or raises can be hard to come by. Advancement can be hard to come by and layoffs are easy to come by. They shut down our site, and are trying to streamline the new process in a drastically different manner. It was a complex process and may need a complete overhaul, however, they had better be meticulous in creating a new process that works, as there is a ton of potential to simply make it worse, as well as a huge potential for mistreating customers in difficult situations."

6774,,Private Client Banker,2014-07-01,3.0,Private Client Banker,"Great role, Potential to make a lot of money depending on your location. Depending on branch, you might have your own glass office. Good benefits in respect to accounts in other banks in regards to balance minimums. Fancy title and business cards.",No work life balance. Huge pressure from managers to meet quota (new money/investment sales) Extreme micromanagement. Extremely difficult to get time off. Sometimes you find yourself working 80+ hours in two weeks.
6775,,"Enjoyed working there, but turnover in the branches was tough.",2014-07-01,4.0,Mortgage Banker,Wearing a uniform.  Really.  I liked not having to wonder if I wore a black suit with a blue shirt the last time I met someone or went to an event.  The answer is YES.  I did and it's OK.,Commissions were cut dramatically while I was there.  My line of business was not their main business so I found it difficult to say we always tried our hardest to get the job done.
6776,,Okay but...,2014-06-30,3.0,Bank Teller,"The things I love are the hours, the benefits and (for the most part) the employees. Chase also offers a lot of discounts on a wide variety of things",Managers only care about making money

Most employees are really great.
Customer service is very important to the company.","When you do over time you don't get paid for it they just adjust your time for the next day.
if your late you have to put it in and can't make up for it during lunch or anything you have to lose out on money basically.
They are taking a lot of positions out so there isn't really any room anymore to promote to a position you would like and get a really good pay raise. 
have to ask a month in advance for a saturday off."
6779,,Good,2014-06-30,4.0,Licensed Relationship Banker,Good opportunity for growth and networking.,Hours can be long and they like to limit the number of employees to save money. Work load at times can be a pain.

Very good work life balance, as of right now not open on Sundays in Peoria and all non salaried positions start with 3 weeks vacation.",They change their incentive plan every year so in 2014 I will actually make less money that in 2013 but hopefully in 2015 it will go back up.
6783,,Learning Experience,2014-06-28,4.0,Bank Teller,Great Banker hours. Meet a lot of different people,"Unless you want a career with the bank, its not for you, Teller is a great position for someone in college."

6785,,A lot of work and never enough pay.,2014-06-28,3.0,Teller,"The best reasons to work here are the benefits. Even as a part time employee you do receive full benefits which is pretty awesome. I also happened to make some life long friends at Chase not to say that is a guarantee, but no matter what branch I worked at there always seemed to be amazing employees.","The pay rate is extremely low for what you are expected to be do. There is not much of a chance of the rate getting higher as the years go by if you intend to stay within the teller role. The only advantage is that there are bonuses given ,but these bonuses are solely based on the branch as a team. The chances for transitioning from part time to full time are very slim unless you plan on moving branches or in my case states. Some branches are very micro managed and everyday you will hear a manage say ""let's get those sales up!"" It can become a little frustrating so just make sure to always keep your sales numbers up. They will expect you to stay late or come in early without much notice and if you don't you will suffer the consequences."
6786,,Too much work and low pay,2014-06-28,1.0,Personal Banker,I enjoyed my monthly commission pay although the base salary is not so great.,You will have to work almost every Saturday until 3 but will actually leave the building until 4pm.

Customer is put first and management supports doing the right thing, what ever that may be, for the customer.  Technology is top notch and opportunity to do many different roles is there if you excel at current position.",Always are chasing the carrot.... Lofty bonus and quarterly incentives string you along to get the most out of you but rarely are attainable on a consistent basis.  Base salaries low and internal promotions get the short end of the stick compared to outside hires.
6788,,Financial Service Advisor,2014-06-26,2.0,,Great pay and benefits. I had a wonderful Team Manager.,"Mentally taxing, monotonous,  PPC, no real organization in the company, really rude customers who degrade you for doing your job."

Competitive products.","Upper management constantly hovering or overseeing for more sales even in a small branch is very nerve racking. An example: Worked in a small bank that saw the same customer base every week, if upper management was around would all but force us to pull from the none existing line and try to sell more services to customers that had already been seen several times (making customer experience less than pleasant)."
6796,,Not a bad place to work if you like sales.,2014-06-23,3.0,Licnesed Personal Banker,"No over time, colleagues are friendly, two weeks vacation and one week paid sick day, paid vacation time increases after working more than 3 yrs.

6797,,Honest review,2014-06-23,4.0,Telephone Banker,"This is my way of saying thank you to Chase Contact Center in Stone Oak San Antonio, TX. I left the company very sudden without even expressing my gratitude and admiration. I only left Chase because of my real passion in medical field. But I have to say Chase is very good in training new people, very fun and respectful managers, peers are very educated and respectful as well, well groomed people works at this location, management is flexible with employees as far as schedule is concern, It can get busy but they always have something for employees to make them feel better. It can get crazy in any call centers nowadays. I am a fan of how they trained us, very outlined and understandable even slow employees can keep up. Pay is great compare to other companies. Lots of help available from all departments.",I can't think of any. Except it can get really busy.

6800,,Great career mobility opportunities. Poor work life balance policies in IT.,2014-06-20,3.0,Technology Business Analyst,"Salary and benefits are good. 4 weeks of vacation for all salaried FTE is nice.

There is also tremendous growth and mobility opportunities within the company. Internal moves are strongly encouraged. There are great career development training resources available to employees of all levels.

The work is fast paced and interesting. Lots of smart people.","If you are looking for a technology job in a progressive environment, this is not the place for you.  There is a ton of bureaucracy. In fairness, the financial regulatory environment drives much of that, but getting even small things done is challenging.

The biggest con in Chase IT is the new CIO is a male who has worked for the company for 30 years and has no concept of what environment is neccessary to recruit young talent and women. Flexible arrangements are frowned upon, and there is a very strict NO TELECOMMUTING policy. (Even one day a week.)  The irony is, we are a global company, and the vast majority of collaborative work is done via online meetings and conference calls. A phone is a phone whether it is in a 6x6 no walled cubicle or a home office."

Good benefits and career growth if you work hard at creating your own path and networking internally.,"Bureaucracy, changes in management, very ""report driven"" with # of calls / week, appointments / week, joint appointments / week, etc...  Management quality is lacking at times due to high inexperience."
6805,,Pleanty of opportunity,2014-06-19,4.0,Relationship Banker,Chase is great when departments are shutting down.  They give plenty of notice and look to tranfer you to other departments to keep you employed.  They are also big on re-hiring past employees that leave on good terms.,Like other big companies changes happen very slow.  Chase also like to keep your salary you start with even on promotions and job changes.  Very hard to have your salary readjusted if your promoted.
6806,,Steady Employment,2014-06-18,3.0,Senior Underwriter,"Steady employment, Great CEO, good on site health care and cafe","not much room for growth, lots of politics in getting ahead"

Supplies great tools to assist in your job and to help customers (job aids, policies and procedures, on-line training).  I have experience some good managers or great strong leaders, but it's a hit-or-miss.","There is absolutely NO Growth in the retail sector of the company.  I have been wait patiently for 3 years as an ""Exceeds Expectation"" employee to grow and be developed.  I have literally been swept under the rug in regards to growth.  My branch Manager does not care on coaching and developing her employees, she cares to sit down in her office and play on her iPhone, she only helps out when her manager visits the branch which is not often.  
In regards to working us to the CORE, they tend to have tellers work alone in the drive-thru and ignore the fact that we are ULTRA Multi-tasking and expect us to conduct Great Customer service, which is at times impossible while juggling 3-5 customers at a time.  In a personal note, I have gotten a UTI to the fact that I am alone and have to hold my urine.  (thanks for the great medical benefits).
The company has this great weekly grading on our branch's customer service overall rating of the week, and I ultimately blame the company taking away the important part of leadership and motivating employees - there NEVER any feedback for IMPROVEMENT, our morale is so low and I believe the company has won on have barely any employees wanting to stay and have no hope."
6811,,So much accomplishment for little recognition,2014-06-17,2.0,Business Analyst,"Given the size of the corporation there is ample opportunities to grow (as long as your boss isn't possessive, they have lots of tricks to prevent you from leaving their teams), pretty good benefits.","Painful bureaucracy despite their claims otherwise. Very difficult approval system to get the resources you need to do your job. Pay system is structured to make you move up in title and responsibility many times faster than your pay. They consider everything a ""lateral move"" even when you go several steps up the employee level. They are extremely strict with not allowing employees to discuss compensation with the fears that you may find out that you are getting paid half as much as the rest of your team after several promotions. Even if your manager wants to give you fair pay after a promotion, it is very difficult to move it up on their part more than 3-5%. They are very good at lying about pending layoffs for over a year insisting it isn't happening. This is so they can use you up to the last few months instead of you being able to move on ahead of time. Extremely predatory cruel supervisors have free reign to make their employees miserable and not be detected for several years."

Great benifits","The banker role is changing, spent 10-15 hrs a week on the teller line running transactions which equals less time selling products and making money. Chase changes your incentive plan every year, and by change I mean decreases, then they try and spin the pay cut as an opportunity to prove yourself and make more money. Branch level management is usually decided by who has been there the longest, typically not the best way to promote talent."
6817,,Strong employer with focus on clients,2014-06-17,4.0,Analyst,Solid company with fair pay and historically strong benefits.,"Due to government regulations, the company has developed a trend of over-analysis of client credit risk, which can create a negative client experience and cause exits of key client relationships."

Bank is turning into over managed under lead call center. 
Attrition is high due to the lack of good management. 
Managers lack the integrity to lead. 
Trainers are below qualified for the job, as a result new employees get limited tools to be successful or efficient.

Nice building with in cafeteria. Good salary.","Very disorganized Call Center. The calls are not distributed evenly between the groups. Bilingual advisors have double the job compared to other groups. I expected more professionalism and courtesy, specially from  Managers. Employees are numbers and Robots. Some Managers are so stuck up that wont even look or say hello to the employee. 

Very stressful job to begin with, adding stupid scripts for transferring calls that are not followed by other employees and only add to the handle time make it worst. You can have an employee that is rude to the customer but if the employee has a low handle time, he/she is good. The Call Center is open always!!!!! You have to work Holidays. Getting the vacation days you want is almost impossible."
6824,,Recently truly dissatisfied,2014-06-13,2.0,Assistant Branch Manager,"Good benefits, employee discount website.  Chase has the best products and services and customer service is top priority.  Bankers are not required to be product pushers.","Branch management teams are exempt employees, sometimes working 50+ hours per week, open to close.  Recently branch staffing has taken a turn for the worse.  The branches just aren't staffed efficiently to where management has been forced to be tellers, devaluing the manager title."

- They teach selling skills
- Some good managers

- If you have a poor manager then your life at work will be pure torture
- Salary Pay is low

- Saturdays were mandatory so you had to take vacation days to get off a weekend"

Always looking to do the right thing for customers and protect their interest.  Benefits are great.  Not only insurance and 401k, but offers other perks for employees.",Since it is a large company sometimes getting things done takes more time and effort than should.

They were always changing the managers and tellers where always leaving. At one point there were not enough tellers. This one manager we had didn't let us sit down, so I would be standing for hours. I would go to other Banks and the tellers were always sitting."
6839,,Assistant Branch manager,2014-06-03,3.0,,Love the people I work with,"No work life balance
Raises are very minimal
Difficult to advance"
6840,,Opportunity advancement,2014-06-02,5.0,Licensed Relationship Banker,"Technology support and convenience products , lots of opportunity and incentives make this job worth while. One of the few banks that I have worked for the values and truly cares about customers waivers on fees instant issue etc etc","Sometimes not enough time to deepen relationship, not know for best rates but then again not everyone is paying at this time. Not all offices practice what they preach leads to transfers and employees leaving the company"

6844,,"If you value work/life balance and fair performance reviews, stay away from GTI",2014-06-01,3.0,Vice President,"Overall, company is very good to work for - during natural disasters, they offered their employees small grants, above and beyond their normal salary, and allowed other employees to donate time off, money, etc. In addition, the retail people really connect with the community and come in to help the community during natural disasters - without being forced or pressured.","Working in the Corporate group (non-customer facing) can be challenging, especially in the IT group. You have some Managers who have a chip on their shoulders, don't stick up for their people during rank and rating, and don't care about your work/life balance (especially if the reporting structure goes up to NYC)."
6845,,good starting job,2014-06-01,3.0,Loan Servicing Specialist,"Benefits, easy to get hired.",The company values new employees more than keeping existing. They kept my pay the same when I transferred to a new position within the group. But the new employees were hired in making 14k more a year than me...very unfair to have employees within the same job bracket pay so different.
6846,,Private client banker,2014-05-31,3.0,,Uncapped incentive system makes this a nice option for banker or private banker roles.,Management was very aloof and scripted (impersonal).  Feels like you're just a cog in the wheel and always replaceable.

They set up awkward situations with normal customers that are trying to get in and out of the bank in a hurry.  I talked with many people that refused to go into the bank due to getting badgered by bankers every time they just wanted to make a deposit.
6850,,It great in training in benefits except for romotion and raises it is not great.,2014-05-28,3.0,Lead Teller,"Benefits, compensation, flexible schedules, and great office","Bad Raises, non promotional, non diverse"
6851,,Constantly Changing,2014-05-28,3.0,,"Benefits are great, pension, vacation time etc, General direction of the company ok. Good incentives when constant. Expectations are clear but are constantly changing. Ability to adapt to changing environment.",Highly regulated environment is creating tremendous pressure on management and employees to get it right coupled with micromanagement of performance can create a bad employee experience. Directives can become unclear when too many changes come ahead.
6852,,"Branch manager who oversaw daily activities of tellers, bankers, and partners",2014-05-28,3.0,,"Great place to learn retail banking and get management experience. A leader in technology, but failling behind in product offering and not very competitive when it came to rates with other banks.","Locked down to the branch daily, struggled to take time off, FTE was not appropriate for goals. No authority to make decisions on loans or rates, everything had to pass through multiple levels of approval even for the smallest changes."
6853,,"They make a good effort to keep their employees happy, but its still a bank...",2014-05-28,4.0,Personal Banker,"3% pension, 5% 401k match, incentive plan that with hustle can make you a ton of cash, feedback ratings on everything and everyone you work with in back offices.",Hours are terrible compared to other banks.

Coworkers are generally enjoyable as well as management.","Working with customers and their borrowed money can be very stressful, and ever expanding policy or procedure updates don't help the situation. Management tries to help, but is ultimately disorganized and powerless against the big bank standards."

6859,,"If you have a soul, keep it.",2014-05-24,2.0,Personal Banker II,"Products and Services are easy to sell. Benefits are typical, Vacations extended to 3wks/year.","The amount to pressure compared to incentive compensation is a COMPLETE discouragement borderline joke. Bankers are a mix of Car Salesman/Vulture preying on the ""Lobby Traffic"" and customers can feel it. The more time away, the better. Vacations allow you time to buy back that soul you sold to get a ""star"" next to your name on the weekly commitments to the DMs."
6860,,Banking yes.  But mortgages... Not so much!,2014-05-23,2.0,Mortgage Banker,"I went to work for Chase, because many lenders were going under, and I knew Chase wouldn't be closing their doors anytime soon. The poeple I worked with were great!  I made a lot of great relationships that will last forever!","Chase as a bank seems to believe that successful management from one division can be transplanted to another division.  Their mortgage division is a mess!  When I started, I had more experience in mortgages than my manager, her manager, her manager's manager, put together.  So did anyone who had ever originated a single loan.  They were intellegent, and a pleasure to work for, but were totally out of their element!  None of them had an idea what it takes to process and close loans, and they were the ones given direction.  Turn time were horrendous.  At times weren't allowed to accept files that needed to close in under 45 days (industry average was 15-30 days for closings!).  Probably a good thing!  They couldn't close them in 60 to 90 days!  I had simple transactions that took over 120 days to close.  I lost most of the Realtors I had done business with for years!  The underwriting, processing, and closing staff were good poeple, just terrible organizational and communications problems overall!   Everyone internally was overworked because the system was broken!  It took 3 times the work to get things done!  Finally, the compensation was pretty poor!  You know it"
6861,,Great!,2014-05-22,4.0,Personal Banker,"The branch where I worked at had the greatest employees. Chase worked hard to make us work as a team, and share the rewards, which was awesome. As a Personal Banker, the pay was good. Its a sales job, so you have your moments of stress when trying to meet and exceed your goals.","The only thing that I didn't like where the hectic scheduling we were put through sometimes, our branch was understaffed, and upper management did not seem to care that we were getting a bit frustrated, but all we kept on hearing was keeping down costs and raising revenue....but we managed."

The amount of vacation time given was nice.","It was nearly impossible to get a day off when I needed it because of how they do the bids for time off. I dont know what days I might need off 6 months from now. Management as someone else said, often seemed disorganized and not willing to work of speak with you unless they were disciplining you. They were more emotionless robots than human beings with no empathy or sympathy. The managers above them-no help either. I felt out of the loop often when it came to changes and updates.  Payroll doesn't know how to keep their stuff straight- they overpaid my boyfriend on his final check after he left (their error) and now he has to pay Chase back months after he left."

6876,,Frustrating,2014-05-15,1.0,Customer Service Representative,Most of the people working there are good people.,"The benefits used to be great, but in the last few years they have started cutting back slowly. They push a healthy lifestyle but when they claim to be rewarding their employees they hand out candy, cookies & ice cream instead of raises. The CEO gets millions of dollars in bonuses every year while saying he doesn't believe in giving out bonuses to the employees. Pay is ok if you don't have a family to support, but could & should be better for such a large bank."
6877,,Great place to learn banking and get your licenses,2014-05-15,3.0,RB SBS,Secure job if you please your manager. stock options and few retirement savings program. pre tax spending account.,Management seems to be blind as of promoting long time employees but in reverse heavily promoting new up comers and literally kids instead of wise seasoned bankers.

The benefits are amazing my insurance covered IVF and they give you a lot of time off. However it's a trade off.","My salary was capped after 3 years at $34k and they cut the amount you can potentially make each month from PVC production every year. I was a long time employee. (6 years) Moving up is extremely political and branch managers have too much control over your development, and that's what eventually convinced me to leave.

Large company yields numerous potential career paths.  Recognition is provided for significant successes.,Lack of technology usage can be frustrating; large company equals lots of red tape and politics; salary increases do not match promotion growth; middle level management tends not to display ability to be strategic with changing environment
6888,,Personal Banker at Chase,2014-05-08,2.0,Personal Banker,Employees get free Premier checking and savings accounts. Potential for earnings dependent on performance.,"Unfortunately, the incentives really are capped depending on which branch you land--land in a busy branch with high profile clients, you will certainly get a bigger cut; land in a slow one with low-income households and your incentives might pay for transportation costs to get to and from work.

Upper management listens and response to feed back from both customers and employees.  Many changes have been implemented due to employee and customer feedback.  Good monthly incentive for sales staff.,Considerably low compensation for managers. Impossible to achieve top end of annual incentive for managers.  Management does not value experienced employees and prefers new and young inexperienced managers in the branches as well as district level.  With not so distant exit of Consumer Bank CEO the culture is noticeably changing.
6914,,Great!,2014-04-24,4.0,Bank Teller,I've been lucky where I've worked with supportive managers who supports my growth and motivate me to succeed.

Longevity and loyalty are rewarded which is rare these days. Management is overall well trained, meetings were well organized and productive and I felt things were very well run.

My department offered flexible schedules and was accommodating as long as you proved through the quality of your work you deserved those privileges. I left only because I wanted to do something different and the types of jobs offered in my department were limited. I would has loved to find an opportunity elsewhere in the bank and have stayed.",There were some inconsistencies in work from home privileges that were unfair in my department. In certain ways my department was behind the times and absolutely needed to do more to appeal to younger employees. I felt discriminated against at times for being young despite working hard and asking for nothing special. Just because someone hasn't worked there for 15 years doesn't mean they don't have a lot of things to bring to the table.

Training was good.,Little opportunity to advance.  How much you earn based on location.  Can be highly stressful to produce at a slow branch.

They give you three weeks of vacation right off the bat which sounds great! But at times you have to cancel or move your vacation time because you won’t be able to hit your goal for that month with a week off. If you do not hit your goal then your incentive is cut by 50%!!!"

Repeated inconsistencies with management direction and compensation packages
Often managers and partners are those who were promoted to pad a middle level managers stats, not a result of quality work or extremely strong sales. This leads to most smart or talented employees moving to other companies because they know the difference. This in turn leaves most quality employees surrounded by those who are unqualified; lack the proper attitude and work ethic for a positive work environment."

Chase is big on career development, so there is no shortage of soures to help you advance your career. I have also had some of the best teachers and managers I have ever worked for at Chase.","If you do not like retail sales, then look elsewhere. While Chase has changed its focus to be more customer friendly, it is still in the business of selling banking products. If you do not like sales, then this is not the job for you. Also, you may find your sales being compared to people who have an environmental advantage over you. For example, you may work in a tiny one horse town where there isn't much business, but you will still be compared to a person who works in upper eastside manhattan with the millionaires."

You really have to take control of your career carefully to succeed.  It can be done for a few.","If you speak your mind you will not last long.  Management asks your opinion but may not be ready to hear it.  Always a lot of changes and not always for the better.  They talk about life/work balance but really do not care about your life or family.  When you do get the chance to move up they do not pay you what they would someone else from the outside that would have gotten that position, they pay you less.

Time-off sometimes was hard but that was dependent on management.","Management was definitely not the best. High expectations, with low realistic truth.

While I worked there flex schedules, always made it possible for good work/home balance","Excellent salary and benefits, not knowing Chase's MO, I thought this would be a lifetime career.  I was not aware that Chase is notorious for ramping up and overstaffing when times are good, and the minute things get slow entire offices are closed.  My issue with their compensation is that they make it so attractive that it makes it impossible to leave if you are sucked into thinking this will be a career stop.   I and several peers were approached by several companies to leave, but due to the compensation and benefits you are sucked into staying.  Part of our severance was potential placement within the ""firm"" and career counseling.  This was window dressing for the media as less than 10 out of 400+ displaced employees were offered other positions within Chase.  Although hundreds of jobs were posted most of my peers could not apply for the majority, even when they wanted to based on the salary range- an example:  an underwriter who made $65K wanted to work as a personal banker, issue was since that position's base was $32K, this employee was dissuaded from pursuing.  That is one of many examples as employees could not gain interviews for other positions.  The bottom line is if you are going on board, think of them like any other company in the mortgage industry, be prepared to find a new job in 3-4 years, just like a great roller coaster- enjoy the ride while you can because it ends really soon....."

The team I worked with specifically, lacked both professional and personal maturity in addition to managerial competence. I was hired externally to do instructional design (permanent position).  There were other designers who came from the call-center, but nobody had actual technical skill or qualifications. There is very much a hire-now-train-and-coach later attitude, although after being hired, little to no training or coaching is given. 

The type of work itself was standard for ID, however lack of/resistance to standards and processes made the job unnecessarily difficult.  The overall turnover rate for the company was quite high.  Over a year and half, 3 instructional designers (myself included) left to look for jobs externally.  I stayed for a little over a year.  I personally found the work environment on my specific team to be extremely toxic.  Be prepared to deal with egos, insecurity, dishonesty and lack of work ethic on a daily basis.

7132,,It All Depends on Your Manager... Hopefully you have a good one.,2014-02-07,2.0,Relationship Banker,"Great overall company, nice CEO, nice products and services, nice employees. No matter how much certain managers get on your nerve, Chase is the ""Big Dog"" of everything banking. 

Try your best to get into corporate.","If you are promoted within the company, say for example from teller to banker, your salary is lower than someone who is in the same position as you are in, that was hired off the street. Do you understand that? This means that even though you are more knowledgeable about the company's products, services and culture, you will be paid less than someone who doesn't know the first thing about Chase. And this make sense how exactly???

Also if your manager is older in their role, and has been in the same position for 80 years, this isn't good. They haven't advanced in their careers so how can they help you do the same in yours? Impossible. They are usually stuck in their ways and they don't adapt to change. At least this was the case with me. 

And be careful if you are in a slow branch. Because if you are, you're better off becoming a PB instead of an RB. Too much is required for RB's now, and for you to be expected to produce the same numbers as someone in a busy branch is unrealistic. At least with PB's there is a guaranteed payout. 

Whatever sick time you don't use get rolled over into the following year, however, if you actually get sick and use the time, your manager rights you up for it. Then why bother giving it to me in the first place? 

Lastly, there wasn't any increase in our salaries this year, and, although I have nothing against the man, why does Jamie Dimon, walk away with $20 million for his work in 2013, despite what was reported as the bank’s worst year under Dimon’s reign? The award was a 74% raise, which included over $18 million in restricted stock. 

Pretty much, anything in the retail branches are what you want to avoid. (Tellers, Bankers, Managers, etc.)"

Goals and incentive plan is horrible. Unless you are willing to give up your personal life and integrity you wont advance. Uniform allowance sucks.

Commissions for bankers can be very lucrative. Technology is amazing, and the brand recognition of Chase is very helpful","Once you get into management it's difficult for you to operate your own business because you're bogged down by processes that hinder you from being the best sales coach and performer you can be. There shoud be a more friendly quarterly/monthly incentive for Branch Managers as well vs the difficult to comprehend or measure annual scorecard that sometimes no matter how good your month to month numbers are, it seems your scorecard isn't impacted by them.

The pay and benefits were awesome, you could also go online and change things around whenever you wanted to, such as 401k. Very easy to get a job with them if you are prepared for the interview.",The ONLY con I can remotely come up with is that you have to work there for 1 year before you can change shifts. And that isn't even really bad. I accepted a 2nd shift position which was 4pm-12:30am. I got home around 1 every morning and it got harder and harder since I had a baby that didn't sleep good at night and also a stepson that I had to take to school and pick up. I worked for 2 months and asked about a different shift. My supervisor tried to help me but there was no way around it unless someone from another shift agreed to swap with me.

7162,,Substandard earning potential.,2014-01-28,2.0,Relationship Banker,Decent health insurance. Brand recognition. Good job if you don't need to support a family or have a low cost of living.,"Poor pay structure. Large responsibilities for little pay. Micromanaged. It's difficult to find something positive to say about an employer when the board of directors has just given the CEO a 77% raise when the employees just took a pay cut! My Branch Manager (BM) had favorites and if you didn't kiss up enough you would work several Saturdays in a row not be allowed to go to lunch until very late in the afternoon. Made it a very hostile work environment. HR was non-responsive and when the District Manager came out to talk to a sampling of employees the BM retaliated! Just a horrible experience all around! The uniforms are very expensive and Chase does not offer any help with clothing expense for something you can only wear to work there, unless you're a teller."

They give great benefits and branch from branch most of the managers are very caring.  The reward structure is based off the amount of work you put in which can be helpful.,In the district and regional management levels it seems you have to play politics to get anywhere.  I have seen a great Branch Manager mistreated as she was going on leave because the upper management wanted to place new people in the positions and needed to vacate current ones.  I have seen hard workers get overlooked while those who don't put forth as much effort get promoted because they play along.  It can be dissapointing.
7165,,No longer a professional.,2014-01-28,2.0,Assistant Branch Manager,Really can't think of anything.,Average work week for Branch management is 55 hrs.  Constantly under fire to make goals. Super stressful.  Under staffed branches.

Good training if you are starting out. Credit folks/underwriters are consistent and fair. average benefits,"Chase does not really understand true relationship building. CA. retail/business banking management is young, inexperience, needs credit training, and are pushing ""solutions"" and cash management products just like the other CA big players. They prefer 2 hire outside sales people versus promote experience/seasoned bankers, a true testament of dismal market penetration after 4 years in the west coast in retail/business banking/commercial lending. Credit Adm/policy is too conservative and sometimes limited."
7167,,It was a very bad experience for me.,2014-01-27,2.0,Licensed Personal Banker,"They pay for your securities license. However, the manager has to recommend you. 
Possible to get promoted with right connections","Promotions are based on right connections then merit. There is no such thing as ‘lunch break;’ you are being called to serve customers in the middle of lunch. Legally they are supposed to pay over time, but managers adjust the schedule so no over time is paid. Management does not want to pay overtime but employees are expected to stay overtime to serve clients. Often managers lack management skills and have no idea how to motivate employees. They lack professionalism and emotional intelligence, which makes it very hard for employees to perform their jobs.Also, many managers often bully their employees but employees are too scared to complain. 

Low base salary and they keep on changing the commission structure and every year they find new ways to make it harder for Bankers to earn commission. There are so many issues; this list can go on."
7168,,Commercial Credit Analyst,2014-01-27,5.0,Commercial Credit Analyst,Friendly work environment where everyone is encouraged to grow in new roles.  All team members are treated with respect and valued for the experience they bring to the table.,"When you first start, there is minimal formal training.  It's pretty much hands on experience.  But since everyone on the team is highly knowledgeable, one can only blame them self if they don't ask questions to the answers they don't know."

They require more and more all the time but will not only deprive managers of a raise, but they're cutting bonuses to make up for losses. The P&L is impossible to move in most cases depending on location and small branches with whom you compete.

The training was sufficient and I learned an incredible amount of the years because the amount of business that was required to be done. I became an expert in the field.,"The management went down the tubes with the insertion of  an IT Manager as the leader of a sales division.  They purchased the operating system used by Quicken and never implemented it because they in the end didn't care about growing sales.  I understand the decline in income with tightening margins in a poor market but we were promised time after time that we would be held on to and compensated fairly when other employers were laying people off. This was told to us when they constantly were diverting the queries about our ridiculously high interest rates and costs.  They actually started trimming the fat by paying us next to nothing and forcing us to leave rather than shutting down any sites simply to save face in the media and not have to declare any mass layoffs.  They were making upwards of 7k per transaction I was completing and paying less than a $100 in commission on each one towards the end. Stock price went up, profits were up and income was down.  Seems like the typical story of corporate greed.  How long can a company treat its employees so poorly for the sake of the share holders and continue to prosper.  The answer is indefinitely when you are in the banking sector.   The government will continue to assist in propping them up since they need there political donations.  Vote Libertarian and work for small to mid cap companies if you want a better existence and any hope for pride in your accomplishments."

You experience the quintessential ""corporate"" culture, i.e. lots of rules, you learn what it is like to work under pressure with no tolerance for error, and the environment can be high stress at time - that is a pro because it is good to know what that is like.","For starters, we were enticed by the possibility of rotational opportunities. Unfortunately that was never stated in writing and was completely anecdotal. Many of us became completely disappointed and felt misled. I was told this in the final interview, then later we were told about having informational interviews set up for us with other lines of businesses, that was never spoken of again shortly thereafter, and then about a year and a half into the program, and discussion of transferring became, ""Well, you have to do that on your own since we trained you for this job."" That is very true, many of us just would have appreciated knowing that upfront, which may have resulted in some of us passing on the job.

We were hired way below market. Their argument, which is arguable, was that we were taken right out of school with no experience in mortgage and were trained. Market salary is about $65K, we were hired at $45K. When we found out about this gap, many people quit, which is a personal choice. I didn't because I saw the benefits of staying put. I eventually go a raise but am paid below market still. Considering the current job market, the employer has the upper hand.

We're hourly employees, specifically salary-exempt, which means we're guaranteed 40 hours. That being said, that results in less flexibility. If you have a doctor's appointment, be ready to make up the time by staying late/coming in early, or using sick time.

The sales people sometimes don't know bank policy well, so they can get pretty sleazy at times, trying to convince you to bend the rules for their client so they can get paid. You just have to stand your ground when it comes to that."

One person could be hired on with experience and be making 30k while another hired on without experience is making 50k, they just new upper management so are paid more. A friend of mine interviewed for a position that would start pay at 60k for entry level positions with a bachelors degree out of college. They told him during the interview that they would start him at 30k because his college wasn't prestige enough even though he has his bachelors degree and has some experience. But in the same breath would hire a college student with no experience at 60k. The company over hires so they can keep up with their numbers, but will do massive layoffs in December and payout severance in bulk instead of in pay periods and then its taxed at 40%. If you looking for a job here, make sure you don't get too comfortable because tomorrow could be your last day."
7254,,This is the best company I have ever worked for.,2013-12-15,5.0,Relationship Banker I,"My coworkers are amazing! Management is very understanding. Relationship based selling, which allows me to get to know my customers without having to cram worthless products down their throats. I love the culture here.","Any outside business activities are required to be pre-cleared with management. However, I understand why they do this."
7255,,Great Company Lots of Oportunity,2013-12-13,4.0,Relationship Banker,"Amazing Institution, If you are a top producer you are rewarded better than at any other major bank. At least in the retail banking side they make sure you are compensated for closing business.",retail banking managers are not the best in the business hard to express your opinions without being afraid of retaliation.
7256,,Business Banker,2013-12-13,4.0,Business Banker,"Easy to move up if you are the top performer. Co-workers are great in the retail bank, most Managers, Financial Advisors, and Mortgage Officers are great to work with. Benefits and 401k match. Employee discounts from other venders (AT&T etc.)","Once you move up so much, the chances of getting promoted again are far less. All business bankers report to one regional manager for business banking. They aren't leaving and it is a very competitive position to get, competing against the best of the best (or those who got lucky). Some branch managers think you are an employee, they also know you have it easier and make more money so some tend to hold grudges. I had one BM that sucked and everyone hated her, even all the partners (Bus, MTG, FA, etc). Over the years bonuses and commissions kept going down. All the improvements meant just keeping up with last year versus getting more money since we are closing more loans and accounts. Went from a 6 figure job to a lot less. Eventually it became a burn out job. 

Personal Banker Turnover is high, once you train effective Personal bankers to help you, they get promoted and it starts all over again."
7257,,I would rather jump in front of the 6 train then ever go back,2013-12-13,1.0,Personal Banker,It was a job and a paycheck.,"My managers were completely incompetent.
Absolutely no room for advancement. Their idea of advancement was to tell you they would move you and have you take on more responsibilities.  Send you to go on a ridiculous amount of interviews, just to say you’re not ready.  So unless you blow your managers good luck moving around.

They change the incentive plan every year lowing the value of products you sell and make it harder to reach the goals.
If you want to make money you better lose your ethics real quick. Be prepared to offer products to people who don't need them or want them.  An example would be giving anyone with enough money in their personal account a business account even if they don't have a business.
 
I was invited to two focus groups to help make employees happier and see what works and what doesn't.  I was told speak your mind because they want to hear the good, the bad, and the ugly.  Was also told your management won’t hear about anything that is said or who said it.  Prior to me going to the meeting my branch manager told me ""If you don't have anything nice to say don't say anything at all"".  At this point in my time there, I didn't care anymore.  I said what I thought and brought up all the things that were going on in my branch that bothered me.  My manager knew what I said before I even got back to the branch. I put a target on my back.

I called HR to report my manager because of a comment she made to me that was really inappropriate and degrading.  During this call I was asked all my information: standard id and name when I asked why the HR person said so they can contact the DM and let them know what was going on.  As well as set up a meeting with me the DM and BM. I said no thank you and hung up.  A few days later my manager brought up in the morning huddle that the DM was upset with her because someone on her team had called HR.  Making that target on my back even bigger. She was definitely told without a doubt in my mind by the DM. Going forward from there I was treated completely different. 

I was treated like garbage, was told that if I didn't make sales I wouldn't have a job.  “We can get anyone off the street to do your job” – My Branch manager.  Thanks for the confidence 
Let’s not forget the managers will always try and make you sign documents that they write up.  Oh and if you don’t sign be ready for some repercussions.  The purpose of this is so they can fire you for breaking some rule they make up and not allow you to file for unemployment.  
If you going to work here good luck, my only recommendation would be never sign anything that management forces you to sign."

They are a well known company and are easily recognized, making a sales job easier.","It is a large company and very hard to move around in. Once you are in a specific line of business, it is hard to move to another line of business within. Because the company is so large it is hard to get noticed and have a voice heard."
7260,,"Not bad, not great",2013-12-12,3.0,Licensed Personal Banker,"Good entry level job for a personal banker.  You can make more money there than you would at any other bank if you're motivated.  Salary is a bit meager which can be frustrating when trying to budget for a house/wedding etc. but if you work hard it's best in class for money.  

Technology at the bank is second to none which is great for the employees.  

With the extended hours and it being a sales job, management expects you to work until at least 6 almost every night and most Saturdays which can put a major strain on work/life balance.","Taking a vacation will hurt your incentive badly which makes you think twice about taking time off since the salary isn't enough to live off of typically and while the monthly bonuses can be nice, when your salary is so low it doesn't quite make up for it.  There's very little career development if you want to be something other than a branch manager position and even fewer tools to help you find a job that's a good fit.   They typically treat external candidates much better than proven in-house ones which shows very little loyalty."

Professional environment that's competitive. Culture has changed to be more customer service focused and you get bonuses from good ratings. Bonuses can increase your overall pay significantly. Plenty of training to ensure you're successful and opportunity to get licensed. Plenty of technology development to make your job easier.",Sometimes there's management turnover which can leave you without help and leadership. A timeline for upward mobility is hard to see at the beginning. Base pay isn't the greatest and neither is commission unless you're a relationship banker and perform well. Very large corporation so at times things are very political.
7264,,Great experience to work in Downtown Los Angeles because you have a chance to learn everything there is know.,2013-12-11,3.0,Teller,Lots of opportunity within the company.,Staff not so great. Managers don't want to teach you much. You have to push yourself and ask questions in order to move forward.
7265,,Dog eat dog sales environment with good commission structure,2013-12-10,3.0,Relationship Banker,"Pay for investment licenses series 6, 63, life and health, Healthcare, 401k, stock purchase plan, etc, The commissions are paid monthly and you make money on investment referrals,  Your experience will depend a lot on which branch you are at and the staff you work with. Most of the bankers I have worked with have been pretty cool. They have done a pretty good job of weeding out the bankers from the washington mutual era that can't sell or build relationships with clients. If you are willing to bust your butt and you're in good situation (a branch with a good staff, financial advisor, business banker, loan officer, high net worth location, tellers that refer you business) you can do really well. However, for the most part this is out of your control. You can still succeed without all those components, but it's more challenging. They have also given more freedom to bankers recently and are not having us rely on cheesy scripts and forced awkward customer interactions. Most of the cons I will mention are improving in my area. Chase is pretty new to San Diego, so there is still work to do.","You get really burned out on dealing with customers, unless you are a type A personality with a lot of energy and patience. Especially if you are not at a good branch and you're making lousy money. Lower base salary than other banks. About 80% of the job is menial work such as printing bank statements, replacing lost debit cards, refunding fees, and listening to customer complaints. This is a RETAIL bank, so you deal with homeless people, and all sorts of drugged out crazies (depending on location). You could also be dealing with pretentious snobs if you are in a wealthy area. There is high turnover among financial advisors and loan officers. Chase promotes building deep relationships with clients, but it's difficult to gain trust when turnover is high. Also, many of the advisors and loan officers are only interested in a quick buck, and will cut corners. Not to mention they steal clients when they leave the company. Retail hours (working more Saturdays than not). Many managers micromanage as well. I don't think many of them actually want to, but the district managers do the same to them, so I think they are just covering their butts for the most part. There has been a good amount of gossiping from tellers and bankers as well. The vast majority of tellers are unhappy because they feel they do all the work, but don't get recognition.  Also, there is a lot of politics that go on. Many long term employees get preferential treatment from managers and tellers will only refer to certain bankers."
7266,,Too many cooks in the kitchen,2013-12-10,4.0,Senior Underwriter,Excellent salary and decent benefits. Generous vacation for new hires. If you are high performing and show talents outside of current role it should be easy to move around/up. The company is soo big that there are transfer opportunities all over the world and if my interests change Chase likely has a department that will match them. Chase is also huge on training and while not all training here is super effective it is at least being offered.,"Decision makers are fanatical about controls. They attempt to dummy proof every process which sends a message to employees that we aren't capable of thinking for ourselves and completing our jobs correctly. It sends a message of lack of faith. Employees are not empowered to use their heads and make decisions. They are instructed to follow processes to a T. Most top companies to work for (think Amazon, Google) encourage their employees to use their brains to make decisions. This empowers and uplifts employees. I think it's crazy that I am at the top of my pay for my position and was fairly aggressively recruited but now that I'm here get the feeling that I can't be trusted to do the right thing. My advice to Sr Mgmt... 1) You guys are great.. the culture you preach is not filtering down through the middle men. Cut out all these mid level mgrs. (Mgrs who manage mgrs who mgr mgrs... oh my!). 2) Trust us!!! For non-customer facing employees that can perform their jobs from home, let us. If my mgr can't monitor my performance from inside or outside the office, there is something wrong in their process. 3) Loosen up.. in sites that are non-customer facing give us some casual time. Even if it's only when we're meeting performance requirements. 4) Re-evalutate where you can loosen up on compliance issues. Are these fanatical controls all really necessary? Other institutions allow their underwriters to use their heads to make exceptions and evaluate credit worthiness while force folks into a box with nearly no options to get out. 5) Try yes a little more than no. Practical solutions on the floor are frequently shot down just as quickly as they are brought up. I've heard the same results occur for mgrs pitching ideas to their managers. The Chase way is synonymous with ""NO!"" as a part answer to new ideas, convoluted processes and rigid inflexibility."

I also enjoyed working with Chase's financial products. That experience has helped me understand banking long-term.,Being a personal banker was much more of a sales job than I expected it to be. I anticipate working with people and finding solutions more than experiencing sales pressure. But this was definitely a sales job and may bankers are micro-managed.

Also, I have seen my share of time sheet fraud and not everyone is held to the same standard; most would get fired, but not all. Also, their anonymous surveys, well lets just say the better you rate the company on those surveys, the more you get picked for special projects.

They give you a lot of training and support before cutting you loose on the phones. It is a lot of information, but you HAVE to give yourself time to learn it. Don't give up so easily and sell yourself short.

So many perks! Free Premier Plus acct with free checks! You get fed all the time! Merchant discounts

They are always trying to change things like the scorecard to make things better and fairer to the employees. People want to complain about it being difficult to get a decent score, but all you have to do is be knowledgeable, on time to work, and friendly to customers.","The managers tend to walk around and socialize with each other. They are never at their desk when you need them to be. This can be frustrating if you have a question or have a customer requesting to speak to a manager. 

The pay could be a little bit better. Yes, we are judged on a lot and I think it would be great if we could get compensated a bit more fairly.

They don't really empower you to make certain decisions to improve the customer experience. There is a lot of set procedures you have to follow without any wiggle room."

7358,,I would not recommend the teller position at Chase.,2013-11-01,2.0,Teller,The company offers health benefits to all employees including part-time.,The hourly pay rate for a teller is fairly low. The reasoning behind a low pay rate is the potential for bonuses contingent upon providing branch-wide excellent customer service.

7378,,Pushy Incompetent Robot-Like Management,2013-10-21,1.0,Personal Banker Small Business Specialist,The salary as a Personal Banker Small Business Specialist was very good and the benefits were the best I have had so far.,Management never thinks outside of the box. The morning huddles made me want to shake a baby and the Branch Manager position is a joke. They are paid baby sitters who sit and watch your every move and do not understand making relationships with clientele. I worked in a very affuelent branch with cutomers who held millions in their checking accoutns and my manager wanted me to call them 3Xs a week to sell them something.

7385,,Great company! Different channels have different cultures,2013-10-15,3.0,Mortgage Sales Consultant,"Chase is an excellent place to learn and to develop/hone your knowledge and skills. Training is superior to other companies for any new hire. Like any company, this is all dependent on what channel you're working in, and your management team. For me, I felt like the goals set by the company were achievable, and you were rewarded for your successes with compensation and promotion. I felt like we had superior tools and we had leaders with the right amount of business acumen to help in tough situations.","The company sometimes was too big and immobile. At times, management had too many fish to fry, and you weren't always given the attention you needed to maintain a pleasant experience for your clients. Chase right now is focused on customer satisfaction but doesn't seem to grasp that the only way to do this to support your employees and give them the tools to provide this experience."

Great for someone that is a people person","The bonus structure is filled with stipulations that change depending on the sales campaign.  The over all focus of the bank at the branch level is brining in balances and new accounts, which is understandable.  So if your considering this job do not get tricked into working at a branch located in a low income area.  The highest paid personal bankers are located in the higher income communities.  The consistency of your work schedule depends on the competency of you direct manager.  Its very hard to plan a saturday without having to ask your other daddy (bank manager) or you have no idea.  This is something that is very inconsiderate of people that have a life outside of the bank. Just like any other big corporation, who you know versus what you know applies.  How else can you explain a good looking 27 year old female teller becoming district manager over night."

First off  the hours are aweful 9-6 M-F and 9-3 Saturday this is a joke.The upper managment in San Antonio is aweful which leads to branch managers hatting their jobs and passes on to branch employees. The company is also going though a change and inside the branch they tell you dont push sales, but you cant get promoted without having huge sales. The training here is a joke, you go to a class for four days and thats it. They license you but dont allow you to do any type of investing by yourself in the branch or even over the phone at the branch. You have to have an FA so good luck with that as the turnover is very high with them because their products are garbage. Get in get your licenses and move on just make sure you dont leave until your get your bonus."

So if you quit or get fired before working there 3 years, you're screwed out of the matched portion. A banker in Newport Beach makes easily 2x compared to Santa Ana, without much effort. The same banker in NY makes 3x as much! Company is structured to benefit the shareholders, not employees so even though they are the biggest bank, employees compensations keep getting cut; and they may change comp structure every 6 months!! Banker salary have dropped quite a bit. It's a sales environment so if you don't hit 100% of your goal, your bonus pay is pretty miserable."
7402,,Disappointing,2013-10-06,3.0,Financial Advisor,Co-workers in branch and peers were great to work with. Flexible hours for my position was a benefit. This is one reason I stayed so long.,"The bottom line quite often was the only concern with management. It was seldom about the employees, and not always about what was best for the customer."
7403,,JP Morgan Teller at West Portal,2013-10-05,3.0,Bank Teller,Great manager and co workers.,Pay is probably at the lower range for tellers.
7404,,"It's a good place to work, but management needs to get it together!",2013-10-05,3.0,Bank Teller,"I like the fact when I go in I work with really great people, you can always move up if you work hard, and the pay is pretty decent with decent benefits.","It takes a long time to move up, little to no team work, and the work load for my position specifically is pretty heavy."
7405,,"Demanding, yet had its perks.",2013-10-04,3.0,Loan Processor,"Vacation/Sick time is easily obtainable, and you are not too micro-managed as is with other cubicle jobs. You are simply expected to do your job until it's done, even if it means working overtime some days, or coming in on off days.","Management is sub-par (very disorganized and non-communicative). The ""team leads"" are so bogged down with their own workload that they are not as accessible as the position is designed for."
7406,,"A strong company to work for, but you definately feel like you are at the bottom of a giant corporate latter.",2013-10-04,3.0,Senior Loan Processor,"The first few years I had great earning potential.  It was worth the long hours and high pressure performance based atmosphere because the income was quite good.  Working for this company gave me a ""thick skin,"" which I believe will allow me to excel above other employees when I enter a new position with a new firm.  I also gained excellent customer service and communication skills to boost the resume.  There is also plenty of opportunity to move within the company and get promoted to lower level management.  If you are competitive, independent and a problem solver, then you can excel with this company in any deparment.","-I can only speak for the Consumer Direct (home lending) department within Chase on this note...  but the past year or so they have made several adjustments to our compensation for the worse, while at the same time increasing the expectations of production and performance.  I understand the company may need to make cuts in certain areas, but personally this is the primary reason for MY departure from this company.  
-There was a lot of miscommunication between departments in regards to operational procedures.  This caused most of the daily stress and confusion.
-You should consider yourself lucky if you had a direct supervisor who understood the job well and instilled confidence and motivation in you.   
-As an employee, you are a number within the corporation and your performance is tracked by numbers, and the numbers don't lie.  It doesn't matter how long you have worked here or how good you used to perform.  If you under perform you will be fired.  Also, to get promoted you MUST have the highest numbers. 
-Its no secret employees will now be hired in at much less compensation than what the position used to pay.  This job used to pay operations employees $70k - $90k.  Now it seems to be more like $45 - $50k."
7407,,Risk / Credit Group needs revamp,2013-10-03,3.0,Credit Analyst,"Decent office location, slowly progressing to work from home (for select employees only), parent company JPMC is pushing life balance and employee transfers to different divisions.","Rapidly declining benefits, very limited advancement opportunities, favoritism is rampant (but where is it not?).

7409,,Pretty Good for a Large Corporation,2013-10-02,4.0,Data Key Entry Specialist,"The benefits are amazing.  Lots of earned paid time off, decent health care plans, nice 401k incentives.  Overall the management on site was very accommodating, and just in general, this was probably the best company I've worked for thus far. JPM is active in the community doing charities, and getting their employees involved. The work was monotonous, but other than that I felt taken care of while I was there.","Unfortunately, in the position I was in, there really wasn't any opportunity for advancement. Relocating to another state would be the only way to advance in a career with them."

They give off a lot of holidays.  They do pay a severance.  Had a great management team that is going to be really hard to replace.,Many of the loan officers and processors here are not trained properly and some have little to no experience.   Transfers with mortgage exp do not get salary increases.  We have to come in everyday with no work to do and watch the few people that were lucky enough to get trans to another u/w dept have so much work they are working OT if we don't come in we lose our severance.  They say they want to help us transition into another dept but tell us we cannot apply for jobs above our current pay grade which was promised would be fixed but never was.  They send emails out of how many billions we make but close entire depts because its not profitible yet VP's still get huge bonuses.  They say they care about employees but really don't.

Great name on the resume.
Great pay, commission and benefits.
Management listens, great communication.","Competitive environment (like any sales position), but gets too bad sometimes with a big number of people in districts competing, and the branch manager would almost not care about anything else other than the numbers.

7439,,"demeaning management, shameful work",2013-09-15,1.0,Licensed Personal Banker,The incentive program is good- you can make a lot of money in sales.,"As with all banks, the bottom line is all that matters. I worked in an in-store branch, and management wanted us to go out into Fry's Grocery Store and solicit customers to come open accounts with Chase. I can't think of anything less appealing than trying to pull somebody away from their grocery shopping so they can give you money. I worked in insurance prior to this job and had always felt like I was helping people by selling them insurance. There were no such qualifiers in banking. Even if someone had just emerged from bankruptcy, you were required to try to sell them a credit card or a mortgage. I understand that sales are often like this- get the sale, no matter how it hurts the customer- but it just wasn't something I could handle on my conscience. To make matters worse, the management was terrible and the backstabbing was unbelievable. Employees tried to throw other employees under the bus to cause drama. Our district manager used to call people stupid and criticize their clothing. I became so embittered while employed with this company that I didn't recognize myself anymore. Resigning was the best decision I ever made."

7443,,Great company with career growth opportunities and focus on customer service,2013-09-14,4.0,Relationship Banker,"There are numerous resources for career growth. Great health benefits, wellness, and retirement benefits. Base pay is on the low end but monthly incentive is based on your willingness to be proactive and self-motivated.","Hours are not flexible in this industry, working all week and saturdays as well. Base salaries range dependent on experience and proven success. There is not a clear range of base salaries per position so it is hard to figure out where you are on the spectrum."

7454,,Great progressive company,2013-09-09,5.0,Licensed Relationship Banker,Room for growth and career advancement. Also the chance to shift careers when you want to. A lot of room for career diversification.,Only con I can think of is if your not driven and interested in your current role you should voice that out or you will not be content with your current circumstance and work stress will seep in slowly but surely.

7456,,Employee almost a year,2013-09-08,5.0,Bank Teller,"This company has the best culture. I read some of these reviews and I was a little scared when I was applying. However, people act like a family. The company is very customer experience oriented and hopes to achieve success by doing the right thing and not pushing sales down everyone's throats. They donate and contribute to multiple charities and try to do right by their employees as well. They promote quickly from within if you are a very hard worker and show your value. They love employee feedback and do a great job of supporting and telling their staff that they are appreciated.",I can't think of any now... Maybe that they can get short staffed. Try hiring for positions before they open up.

Loan modifications as ugly as they were to complete probably helped some people.  Convenience is good for consumer, despite branch staff's having all types of experience.",Capped commission.  Inexperienced management team.  Recruiting poor talent just to fill a position.  Shuffling internal candidates to avoid downtime.  Comfortably numb atmosphere and not stimulating.  High turnover in all job families.

7463,,My experience with Chase was great.  They are very professional.,2013-09-05,5.0,Bank Teller,There are excellent opportunities to advance regardless of background or education.,The only con to working with Chase is that it is a very corporate environment.

At the local level, I've never been more micro-managed in my life. Senior management is no better, and they show a complete disregard for Work-Life balance.

Easier with dress choices since the company limits you to their uniforms and ties. Incentive was great since sale was the goal. Sky is the limit if you work on a busy location.,"Not the right employer if you are not a motivated salesperson. Working hours vary daily, so expect to wake up early on some days for branch opening while sometimes don't have to be there until 10am. This can create problem if you want a second job."

They attempt to place you elsewhere instead of letting you go when they need to downsize a department (however, see ""Cons"").","It is near impossible to move within the company if you are having difficulties where you currently are assigned. If you are at a ""meets minus"" or below, they will not let you transfer to another area. For some departments this becomes near impossible since they believe in stack ranking. This means you can be doing well per the standards, but if you aren't in the top 50%, you are at a ""meets minus"" or below. 
Incredibly, departments have different standards, even teams within the same department tend to have different standards. There is no set standard or format for Methods and Procedures (M&Ps). 
They utilize too many systems.
HR has no teeth when it comes to discipline and conversely, they do not seem able to help much when management is out of line."

I was in the Personal Banker program back in '07 and was in the ""self guided"" class to get my licences and... 1) there was no one there capable of answering questions my ""class"" had 2) ""managers"" would evaluate your practice test scores and could remove you and fire you 3) Would not give you the right tools to succeed. Need less to say I was ""evaluated"" to be not a good fit for the program after a couple of weeks and was released from the program with no one able to give me a legitimate reason. I was passing my practice exams, doing well on my own, but one day to the next it was decided to release me. To this day when I call HR to get a reason why I was let go (which apparently in my profile it does not say i was fired... odd huh?) all it states was due to performance issues. NOTHING ELSE! I applied a while back before moving Austin, TX and was offered a position with Chase after going through the 3 interviews and starting my background check to only have a phone call stating that I was marked ""non re-hire-able"". When I ask to state the reason, the HR rep couldn't and she stated that was no reason on my file.

Good benefits and competitive pay.,"Management does not take an active role in learning the career objectives of employees. Building is old and run down. It's not incommon to have equipment down for weeks at a time. The company HR site shows a variety of flex options for work such as telecommuting, 10 hours shifts, etc. but the business does not allow it. It doesn't matter that my department can work 100% remotely as we are not cusotmer facing but management refuses even the best performing employees the option. We are given a slight choice in schedule but again not overly flexible considering we should be able to do our jobs day or night, split shift or straight hours or working from home. Allowing this flexibility to folks who are meeting performance objectives would substantially increase job satisfaction and also drive underperforming underwriters to meeting goals so they can have the same options."

They are also very willing to promote from within; this is usually based on your sales performance. Managers are generally willing to work with you to find a career path for you. Also, they do a great job of training employees and providing resources to keep employees knowledgable.","The corporate culture is incredibly cutthroat. Management provides incentive for employees to steal accounts from each other. While they claim that teamwork is important, they also train you to be the first one to take a customer as they walk in, even if a co-worker is already going to talk to them. Additionally, upper management preaches that their system works but change everything in a panic if sales are not as high as they want them. They also have a hard time hearing someone say no or that something isn't working. As such, they don't show much respect to their employees, especially when things are bad. There were also issues with cultural sensitivity. And finally, management was way too pushy about getting a sale. There were several times where it was obvious from what a customer was saying that they would not open an account; forcing us to try a hard sell just builds up bad will and makes sure that customer will avoid coming in later on."

Senior management can vary greatly - some departments are well run, others have leadership that puts their own survival above the success of the overall team.  Resources are often shifted in ways that work for the short term bottom line, but alienate customers and those that have to deal with them."

7546,,Personal Banker with more than a year of experience,2013-07-15,5.0,Personal Banker,"Strong company, great culture. The company exercises tremendous integrity. They work hard to give back to the community when they can. Senior management takes ownership for their mistakes. They really have everyone's best interest in mind (economy, government, charity, customers, employees, and the company itself). 

Great sales culture. Personal bankers are often pushed to sell, sell, sell with no regard for how that pressure on employees affects the customer experience. I think this company strikes a nice balance between production and the customer experience.

For a large corporate company, there's a lot of resources and support for personal bankers. It's not perfect, but I've learned a lot about how a large company can be effective. One of my favorite features is the ""send us feedback"" button on the intranet network. Whenever an employee submits an idea for improvement or a customer complaint, a physical person responds usually within that day. It's apparent that some of Chase's best ideas come from the bottom up.","The pay structure (base pay plus incentive) is pretty good if you're in a busy branch, but if you're not, you'll be paid below industry average. They take the attitude that your production depends on you, not on the size of your branch or the economy of your community. I get that they're trying to get us to be productive, but there's only so much you can do when people in the community just don't have money. That being said, they take care of you in terms of benefits."

Staff was micro-managed to the point where employees and managers were required to follow scripts when talking to customers. 

Open 6 days a week, 91/2 hours a day (staff working up to 11 hours/day). There is only one manager and one assistant manager on staff and at least one is required to be present at all times. As salaried employees,  we frequently worked 45-50 hours/week without overtime pay; longer if covering for another branch supervisor.  There was no expectation for relief to cover vacations. AM's were also tellers, expected to run a window 80% of the time. Hiring was done at a central location and never at sufficient levels to fill vacancies in a timely manner. Most branches had 1-2 FTE requisitions always open. Many did not have 2 supervisors on the staff, requiring other supervisors in other branches to work overtime. When I resigned in 2009 I gave more than a month's notice. On my last day my replacement had not been hired."

Bankers at higher traffic locations tend to have better sales numbers.  Not enough movement - would have been nice to experience a busy branch, but bankers seldom went on to different branches.

Prior to that I worked in one of the call centers and the pay was much lower and very stressful so I have to say that organizing mortgage documents all day and not having to be on the phone is very refreshing!,You need to be on very friendly terms with upper management to ever get the chance to advance but the only problem is you don't typically have the same manager for more than a few months at a time so being on top of your tasks and always exceeding management expectations is critical to being selected for new position openings!

It offers competitive pay and excellent benefits. Ambitious employees may be able to move vertically or horizontally, providing opportunities for growth and change. Also, there are many locations so it's possible to work close to home.","The only downside to working at Chase was the push to get Texas clients to end their dependence on the branches. We went from a small, client-friendly environment to a New York corporate bank overnight which caused major culture shock for bank employees and clients.

Example: ups, fed ex, drycleaner/tailor, balloons, gift wrap station, Starbucks, sandwich shop, conveinence store, personal bankers, in building atms, nurse station with free immunizations available during flu season.... Basically set up so you never have to leave.","Bank shoves products down your throat, they offer you car loans, student loans, credit card, mortgages, make you open bank accounts with them. Managers are subversive. They offer bonuses knowing full well this structure of pay causes desparity within every department they are offered. They also attack anyone who keeps getting bonuses and look for any reason to take them from you. Eventually they will write you up until you get fired for something ridiculous. Example : 1 minute late 10 times in 365 days. Not too bad? Unless they hire more people for your shift than there are parking spots. Then when you want to change shifts they refuse to allow you to. Even after requesting every week for an entire year, even though they are still hiring for the shift with parking spots available. Then it causes you to lose your bonus all the time and eventually your job. They treat you as if you should come to work an hour early but they don't want to pay you for it. Also pay attention to the tracking of dollars you have collected manually. You would he amazed by how often they're wrong. It would seem any month's more than 10% or so of the department starts hitting bonus early in the month people start getting dollars that don't count or they say something happened to the computer and things you have collected start to disappear. Either way it happens too often to be coincidence. When the new reports come out they always have significantly lower department averages. Which is great for the company but bad for the employee. Computers tracking collection information do not miscalculated dollars collected all of a sudden when to many people hit bonus early."

There is also college tuition funding, maternity leave, etc. like most companies should have.","There is not enough time to properly address the many issues that I have encountered here at Chase but these are the most obvious.  First off, management that lacks empathy and is always in reactive mode, not proactive mode.  There seems to be no sense of accountabiity for their decision making process.  

Second, all communication is done by email, not face to face.  This would only make sense if the people you were dealing with were in another building or state, not in the same building or floor!  I have been there over a year and still have never met 90% of the people who email me on a daily basis.  Do to my position, I cannot leave my desk except on breaks.

Third, training is highly lacking.  While there are classes for underwriters, processors, etc., there is no training on how everyday things are done.  Maybe because it changes daily since management will not stick with one process.  

Fourth, HR has been outsourced to ANOTHER COUNTRY!  Yes, when you have an issue about payroll or have a co-worker dispute, you have to either go online and research the topic or call the HR line; there is no office to walk to.  When calling, be prepared to talk to someone who does not understand the English language at all and will say that's an IT issue and throw you back to the Help desk.  

As I have said before, there isn't enough time to discuss all the troubles I have seen in this company.  I guess you can't fix stupid."

Seems to be a really good company that truly cares about there employees.","Not the highest paying job as a teller. But hopefully if promoted a banker or manager gets paid more. Not sure what they make. Schedule is made sometimes less than a week ahead of time and it changes frequently and without much notice. No full time tellers at my branch, only part time."

Another reason is the benefits that they give to their employees. The atmosphere is great as well.

7639,,"Great company, but could be improved.",2013-04-20,4.0,Deposit Account Collections Collector,Excellent starting pay if you're coming with no college experience and minimum wage. Most retail jobs have additional incentive programs and it is relatively simple to go part-time to full-time and apply for benefits.,"Customer is always right policy works well with some businesses, not necessarily with banks. Working any job relating to debts owed by customers is a nightmare, get treated like dirt and a lot of customers have figured out how to ""work the system"" when it comes to fee reversals, making any incentive program more about luck than skillful negotiation."

Excellent exposure to all aspects within banking
Benefits are great; 401k and health benefits.
Depending on location, commission can be great.
Handful of genuine and great managers that seek to help and mentor their subordinates into the right direction and growth.","Promotion guidelines - This is solely based upon someone elses opinion. As a banker, you can be number one in your branch and you may consistently bring in great business and close on your deals (whether being retail, investment, mortgage, or business banking), but ultimately this does not allow you to apply and seek growth within the company. You will not move from your position easily because the manager will not want to lose your production, therefore if you approach this in a way he/she does not approve, you can pretty much focus on making commission but you can kiss your hope of going anywhere within your market goodbye. 
Retail Management - While this statement cannot be generalized to most managers, it may apply to a vast majority of them. There are too many managers that have been promoted to this position simply because of their gross exploitation of a certain demographic within a market. Many managers are in this position and they would not be successful bankers themselves, yet they are there to manage and improve a bankers performance, What goes to say that the same banker they are criticizing would do a much better job when put on the same playing field?. It can be simply stated that while there are many successful bankers that will never be good/decent manager, there are also managers that will never be great bankers. Managing cannot be earned by selling; selling is one thing, management of adults is another. Many managers have mastered the art of managing people and make their workplace a pleasurable experience but most have a sweat shop mentality and fail to treat people with dignity and respect."

7652,,Helping or Selling?,2013-04-09,2.0,Bank Teller,With its investment in software CHASE makes much of the paperwork a lot easier than most banks.,It culture for selling products and services can bee seen as diservices to customers. Unless you're under the age of 25 it is very hard to change the mentality of those who are older and educated.
7653,,Personal Banker turned robot,2013-04-09,1.0,Licensed Personal Banker,The coworkers I origninally worked with were great until upper management moved in and made drastic changes to the way they treated their employees. We all eventually left.,Hiring more bankers in the branch and expecting unrealistic results. Extreme micromanaging of employees. Scripted sales techniques and basically harrassing customers to get them to sit at your desk.
7654,,"When it comes to employee appreciation, management style, and style this company is horrible",2013-04-09,1.0,Teller,"High pay, competitive salary and good hours to work.","Micro management, too many managers, high pressure sales, lack of appreciation, and you will be forgotten.  I worked for WAMU and then applied at Chase in 2011.  Worked for 2 years and was a huge fan of the product but not the management.  I lead my branch in customer service, was told by my hiring manager and regional manager that I was ""a keeper"" and that "" I display characteristics that cannot be taught."" That being said, they liked me so much that when the PB position wasn't working out for me (I was at a cut throat branch, mind you I came in with 10+ years of proven sales success) they allowed me to step down to a teller position with my same pay rate of $17.31 an hour. This was after not getting a fair chance.  After 2 months in the position they told me I had to take 5 consecutive days off per federal regulations, so I did.  I also had multiple weeks of training and was out of the office more than I was there.  My supervisor criticized me for production that month and began to say that, ""I don't think you have what it takes.""  Are you kidding me? I was gone for more than half the month and her answer, ""some of my best months were when I was on vacation...  Unbelievable. I was also criticized for respecting a client that was a cameraman for the NFL that had to fly from OC to Seattle for the next days football game.  I was familiar with the schedule and as a seasoned sales professional I know there is a time and a place for a sales pitch.  No matter what I said to that guy, his thoughts were on the game and meeting his flight that was leaving in 3 hours.  According to management I didn't do what was right for the sale.  According to me I did what was right for the customer and told him there was much more to benefit at Chase, could I follow up with him at a better time, to which he agreed.

My pay far exceeded the average teller pay by at least $2 an hour. My hiring manager was so good he was promoted and trained to be a regional in another region within the first year.  So he was gone. The next manager came in and was thoroughly impressed with my style and said he would sign off on any advancement into any other field I wanted to get into, however I had an outage that was high enough for corrective action so he told me to wait out that period and then we would apply for another position and promote me. 

2 months prior to that warning expire a HUGE HR issue came up and 2 of the top performing bankers were fired and escorted out.  It was by no fault of the Manager directly, but because he was the manager he had to go.  He was laterally promoted and out of the branch fast. A new manager came in and during this time my original regional manager was promoted to a position in Florida. So now I had a new Regional and new Manager, both who didn't know me or my history.  All they knew was that I was getting paid too much for my position.  So all of a sudden I have managers standing behind me timing my transactions, breathing down my neck and applying large amounts of pressure on me.  I felt like I was being harassed and targeted for termination.  

Well I was right, they targeted me and randomly terminated me to transfer another part time teller to replace me (I'm sure at a much lower pay). I was not told why I was being terminated, the Manager just said there is no room for discussion we are terminating your employment with Chase immediately. No consideration for the fact that I'm literally homeless without a job.  And to top it off, I filed unemployment was approved for it and they appealed it and won. During the appeals process they presented my termination papers, of which were drafted (according to fax and signature dates) after I was terminated.  the judge sided with Chase and barely even let me get a word or statement in.  I was pinned up against my old threatening supervisor and Chase's attorney.  All so I wouldn't get the coverage I was in desperate need for.  It is so hard to find a job when there is a gap or you are currently unemployed it is like the Scarlet Letter.  They lied under oath about coaching me and writing me up. I asked them to show evidence of the write, to which they couldn't however the judge ruled that hearsay is acceptable.  

I left a decent job to work at Chase and now my life is upside down. Beware before you work here, if it were not for the competition this company would treat their customers like crap.  As they clearly treat their non-management employees. 

My advice to you, work here for the money but when they kick on the pressure get another job fast!"
7655,,East coast culture,2013-04-07,3.0,Senior Compliance Officer,"They pay is great, flexible hours, very supportive of work life balance.","Management is top heavy, not enough anonymity, little to no room for advancement.

worst health benefits
worst HR department

Management works less hours than full time staff

Management is given priority for every scheduling need, then seniority.  So you could go 3-4 years and never get Christmas off.  And if you have a manager like I had, she wouldn't have the guts to correct the situation.  She'd just make you work every holiday for the whole year.

Work every single Saturday with 2 other bankers, doing nothing all day, hardly making any money or meeting with any clients.  There was a time that I worked 12 Saturdays in a row before I could get a single on off, but my manager only worked two per month."

I enjoyed being a personal banker for the most part. If you are good at sales and are able to obtain referrals from your clients you should do just fine.,Not for the faint of heart!! Chase is huge in the sales dept. and if you are not an outgoing and energetic person you will not succeed. The sales environment can be tough especially with Chase's high pressure sales operations.

The call center was really good to me, there were politics but I never got involved. My absolute worst experience was at the branch.

There is plenty of opportunity to move up in positions.,Some branches want to keep you where your at. I know a lot of people who tried to move up but don't because they don't get coached or trained to do so. Customer service incentives are earned on how the branch as a whole gets scored. It seems like the people who work the hardest are the tellers to try to get the line moving but get paid out on the incentive the least. If its team work then they should all get the same payout. Personal Bankers seem to just wait around for the next New Account to be opened instead. If there happens to be a long line they disappear to make phone calls but refuse to help with getting customers in and out during rush time.

Although I realize it was my fault for accepting the branch, I simply did not realize the 10 mile commute would equate to an hour each way.

Of course, not all customers were friendly, but hey, it's retail. I actually started my teller position with WaMu which became Chase after about 6 months.  One of the best things about having worked at Chase was their great benefits (including 401k match and yearly bonus into 401k!). If you ever had questions regarding HR related issues, HR employees were more than willing to help.  I think after all the lawsuits, Chase has grown to be a better bank, especially in the west coast (CA mainly....)

The high executive level keep trying to keep people motivated with career mobility messages but it doesn't works equally, worst if you are a diversity employee most likely doors will be closed for you in terms of internal opportunities for advancement.

 If you are a diversity candidate  with great experience but no MBA or Bachelor's degree, you may get the job at Chase,  however this opportunity may be the begin of the end of your  career. The internal career mobility process is very critical and superficial.The HR will consider anything as an excuse to lack your internal advancement, for example;  the level of your English if it is a second language, degree level, your PVCs since it's a strong sales oriented company,  finally 
the support of your manager or district manager which is a pathetic situation, they will hold back the best employees so they can accomplish the campaign goals. It's a very poor and selfish management system where you only can advance if your management decides to offer you a  position that is part of their sales strategy or a position they think you should take. The internal mobility plan is not designed to protect from this system  or support you acquire the skills you need to develop your career.

Generous employee banking discounts offered.,Pay not always based on performance.  Technology is very old and lacks updates.  Parking not included in downtown Milwaukee office .
7817,,One of the best experiences working in retail banking.,2012-11-28,4.0,Licensed Personal Banker,"Decent benefits and decent pay (if you include commissions - if you're successful). In the retail banking positions, this is as good as it gets in terms of stress level (but that's also dependent on branch management). Sales pressure is not as high as the other banks that I have worked at but places more emphasis in commissions to survive.","As a banker, there is too much emphasis in following a certain script for an initial conversation with a customer. This can make you feel like a robot at times if management is strict in following protocol. Base salary has too low of a threshold compared to other institutions."
7818,,Not the best company to work for.,2012-11-27,2.0,Part-time Teller,"Health insurance and 401 K.  Discounts on products and services like Sprint, Disney etc are pretty good. No Sundays, retail branches aren't opened on Sundays yet.   People are generally nice.",There are hardly any employees who stay after a year.  Lots of pressure to refer accts and get accts opened. Very difficult to advance.  Especially for Customer Service Reps and tellers. Virtually no raises or advancement there. You have to wear a uniform every day and they are very strict as to how the uniform is worn.  You have to pay for anything over 1 - 2 clothing pieces per year. .
7819,,Ok,2012-11-27,4.0,Small Business Specialist,Better commission compensation than other banks.,Possible longer hours and more rigid role play
7820,,Tellers are under-appreciated,2012-11-27,2.0,Bank Teller,"Paid time off, holiday pay, sick time, personal days even for part time employees; job duties are easy and straight-forward; no real pressure to meet referral goals","I'm not sure if it this is true for all branch locations however, the managers at my branch do not develop the tellers whatsoever. This is a dead-end job with little (if any) opportunity for upward mobility. Banks are all about making sales which tends to drive their main focus on personal bankers. Tellers are overlooked and under-appreciated--made to feel like robots working for towards absolutely nothing."

All employees are thoroughly trained and consistently coached and supported. Chase's corporate leaders continually ask for feedback from ALL employees in ALL areas of our jobs.

7828,,Personal Banker,2012-11-18,2.0,Licensed Personal Banker,"Was a decent company to work for. The bank wants to continue to beat analyst and market expectations for its stock value, and is cutting down on commissions for a majority of bankers. Management thinks the bank will suffer in the future, or at least the stock price has reached a threshold, so are selling their positions, tells you of how much they trust the firm's future.","Management is looking to cut costs. So they are cutting commissions. They are also changing roles for the position. A Personal Banker will no longer be needing an Investment Licence. That will be only for Relationship Bankers - a new position. This change means, the personal banker is now a glorified teller, who gets a service bonus of 4-6 hundred after a base pay, of 950 every two weeks after taxes.  We have already had 4-6 bankers leave from our district after the change. From the people I originally started working with a team of 7 bankers: 2 left before I was on boarded, 1 was fired, 2 additional quit, and 2 moved to other branches. That is a turnover rate of 100%.   

Although they would not like to admit it, your chances of being placed in positions that will lead you to further success within the firm will increase if you are, young, white and male. This is true from the analysts they hire for training in Chitown, to the branch managers they hire and place in branches with Good P&L. Employees from women, to minorities have pointed this out to me."

Managers will say ANYTHING to get you to ""perform"" better.  
Career opportunities are zero if you do not hit the numbers management wants.  Even if your skills would be best suited in a non sales role.

There is a lot of micromanaging and politics.  Also, commissions could be good but it all depends on location...do not let anyone tell you otherwise.  If you're in a high income neighborhood you'll do well. It's more customer service than it is a sales position.  Terrible upper management.  They only see numbers and don't take everything into consideration and will treat you like a number, not a person."

No control over who you work with or where. They can move you or change your hours without giving you an option. They take advantage of all the employees. Horrible, so called, “New & Better” health insurance for employees to save money for the company. A lot or pressure. No respect. No acknowledgment.

You may get stressed out enough to go on disability - as many at this site have, due to anxiety, stress and lack of sleep.","unrealistic audit scores of 0% or 100% per file - every file audited, no morale whatsoever.  Company has no work life balance at all...you have to schedule 24 hrs in advance for sick time or get ""dinged"" for calling in sick (referenced as an occurance).  I've worked for them a number of years and only had this experience most recently - poor treatment of staff, unrealistic expectations, no human factor at all and silence all day every day.  If you talk at all you will be under the radar and Manager will tell your sup to reprimand you.  You are to talk only on break and lunch.  Weekly changes to expectations.  No career ops in San Diego due to focus is Default - ie: Loss Mit, BK and FC.  Pay is decent now that they did pay adjustments - but now expectations are beyond reasonable.  Cost of benefits offered takes that pay adjustment and leaves you with less take home pay.  Raising concerns of atmosphere, training and expectations puts you in the spotlight and next in line for termination.  No culture, no values, bullying of staff to perform and be perfect.  CEO is very knowledgable - I'm sure has no clue what goes on at the branch level.  ""Too Big to Fail"" .  Need for counseling and medication, disability or workman's comp leave due to stress and anxiety."

They are selling crazy and will teach you every which way to sell in the banking world. They are very aggressive and you will learn a ton.

There is alot of pressure from upper management and direct manager to sell sell sell. If a client has 3 credit cards but is approved for another, they want you to sell it, even if you dont feel its right for the client because they are drowning in debt. Whatever it takes to get the sell, they dont care.

The training process is good with the in class training sessions. The payouts on commission is one of the best I have seen for retail banking since it is paid out monthly. The technology backing you in the process of banking is better than any bank out there.",The constant noticeable favoritism with the money making bankers versus the up and coming bankers is sickening. Not giving the new guys and girls to make a decent living and put up the numbers they as for since they are always to busy up the senior bankers butts. They say they want to focus on raltionship banking but when you do that and are praised by customers for your superior service it pails in comparison to management if you don't sell that customer their fifth credit card from Chase that they don't need. Hopefully if you do apply and get an offer you get a good branch with a manager that is a human being and not a robot.

Questionable client call procedure; if a client is on a no-call list we still call them and try to induce them to mention anything that we can use to open the sales process. That way we didn't actually start the ""sales call"" we just called for service.

The sign that something is not going well is that the turnover for bankers is approx 33%!!  That is a huge deal, people are taking your training and going to other banks to get paid and treated better."

Hassle to travel though there are 3 options that you can choose. You are highly paid because you're expected not only to do your job but to perform excellently.

The benefits are  remarkable but it comes with so much pressure.,The work is very stressful. You are responsible for so many things and so many things are expected of you. You'll burn out easily with the kinds of tasks to do.
7899,,Teller Motivated to Learn but with little support,2012-09-19,3.0,Teller,Availability to add extra hours. Ability to find coverage from others if needing to adjust schedule.,"Lack of concern for employees, more concern for bottom line & referrals. There was definite and clear favoritism in the bank.

7900,,Good place to build a career,2012-09-19,5.0,Process Manager,"Company invests in technology, new product development and isn't afraid to change with the industry. The managers I have worked for have been positive influences and have given me the tools needed to develop my career and advance within the company.",Many processes can get drawn out because of all the sign-offs.

Great benefits and perks. decent pay.company still offers pension, stock option and 401k",Management tends to create own rules at some locations. commission can be taken back if account or product is not used by customer for 6 months in retail branches.

7910,,It was ok,2012-09-13,2.0,Bank Teller,"Good benefits, good training for tellers. If you are lucky, you will get a good manager that will push you to become better.","Turnover rate is ridiculously high and not just with tellers, but with management as well.

Comparable salary and incentives to other banks.,"It's very easy to get stuck in the personal banker role. You can become a victim of your own success.

It's those surrounding you that make the time go by faster. There are many incentives for Tellers and they're paid out monthly and quarterly, so it isn't too bad. Thankfully, I've been surrounded by supportive management and great coworkers, so I enjoy being there.","You feel like a very replaceable cog in a huge machine.

You can easily spend years here and it doesn't bring you down, for a call center that's really uncommon.  The Management is always asking for ways to improve.",QA testing is too gray with how you are able to pass and it mostly depends on the opinion of the person grading it.

Get your license/experience and get out! Branch Manager and employees great to work with. Senior Management is good but I have heard of bad experiences. Overall they agree that we should be compensated more. 

I should note that I was not fired, have never been discriminated against and have no ill will towards and of my co-workers. This review is solely based on JPM Chase's compensation structure.","Base Salary is $32k. No raises. Bankers with Chase for 10+ yrs making $32k. If you get promoted you get a PAY CUT! Commissions are a JOKE. The ONLY bankers that are making good money are in NY City. Some making $20k month in commissions alone. They are the example to the rest of the country, when there is absolutely NO WAY to make that kind of money in 98% of the rest of the country. PVC system is a joke. Lots of disgruntled banker's expected to provide a Great Customer experience....it's not happening!

15 PVC's to open account
you get 80% dollar value when you hit 400 PVC's and 100% when you hit 1000 PVC's. Hardly any bankers make 1000 PVC's in a month to be able to get a $1000 commission check."

After working there you will hate envelopes, checks, pens, and paper! Management is beyond bad. You have people who constantly tell you to work faster when they sit around smoking, eating, reading books, etc. NO Chance of career advancement. Worked there for 4 years and never got a promotion. I was an ""Elite Employee"", Received dozens of awards, trained new employees, and was a back-up team lead(No raise). People are happy when people escape as we called it because it was like a mental institute. And the rules were so mindless, No ipods even without a cord but, cd players and radios are ok, you must schedule your sick days 48 hrs in advance,  and that's just the beginning."

Annual allowance for Chase apparrel (has to be worn).,Training is ok but has a shelf-life. The organization is going nuts about customer service right now so we live under a microscope. People take out personal frustrations on you even when it is their fault. You are placed in a branch in a certain district- DMgr can block you from transferring out of their district.
7944,,Just ok so far...,2012-08-29,4.0,Customer Service Representative,There is a lot of information available with their training resources.

Even though my direct managers are wonderful, hard working people are taken for granted while lazy people get special treatment because of who they may know or how well they suck up. 
LAY-OFFS!!!! Upper management does not care about the employees. They care about the bottom line. Some people in my department have been laid off more than 3 times. Some are having trouble finding another poisition within the company now that we are being laid-off (even though we are told that we'd have priority).

Not required to log into phone depending on manager.
Low call volume.
Coworkers intelligent and hard working.
Contests with prizes.","Job performance fully depends on sources that cannot be controlled:
bank branch loan originators, the computer system and underwriters. 

The bank branch loan originators have high turn over, are paid on commission by loan closing, aggressive and under-trained, some with no prior knowledge of the mortgage industry. The computer systems are unreliable and error-prone. The underwriters have more work volume than they can manage.

Bank branch loan originators often originate loans that cannot ultimately be approved by underwriting and they will frequently withhold pertinent customer loan processing information for their personal agendas in effort to get the loan approved by underwriting without a complete loan scenario. 

Bank branch loan originators are often uncooperative towards working with the loan officer for the mutual goal of closing loans for fear that their own loan origination errors will be discovered and reported to their branch manager. 

Loans not final approved by underwriting when received by loan officer. 

Branch loan originators misinform customers often due to lack of training which causes major customer service issues and cost company money to retain customer business. Loan officers are often responsible for this cost regardless of their role in the issue which effects your performance reviews and eligibility for bonus.

Almost every update in the computer system triggers underwriting to re-review and approve the loan which causes weeks of processing delays and customer service issues. 

Very slow computer systems: freezes, doesn't save data inputs, incorrectly transfers data from one location to another. Not enough space to enter user comments for calls in computer system. Difficult to review prior call log because of system setup. More work-arounds than correctly operating computer functions. Poor computer system and system errors doesn't allow employees to work at their full potential and causes customer service issues that cost company money while employees get blamed. 

Bathrooms not regularly cleaned: bathroom trashcans usually overflowing with trash; bathroom stalls have trash on floor; bathroom stall doors broken and wont' lock; toilet plumbing broken; bathroom soap and hand paper towels often out of stock and not quickly refilled. Not enough bathrooms for building. Bathroom usually closed for cleaning.

Building facility old, dusty, unpleasant musty odor; staircase carpet old and dirty; staircase walls scratched and very dirty.


Office supplies insufficient. 

Most desk chairs are very old and not ergonomic or adjustable. Not enough new chairs.

Not enough parking. 

Cafeteria is old and no catering available for employees.
Department meetings held in cafeteria do not have enough chairs or space to accommodate amount of employees. Employees have to stand in hallway to attend meeting and they cannot hear the meeting from the hallway. 
 
Training is too short and inadequate-not enough creative teaching methods used. 

Very high employee turn over. Very negative work environment due to unhappiness and stress of coworkers. 

Overtime is permanent, at least 10 hours a week, but most work almost 70 hours a week and still cannot meet unrealistic loan closing goals. 

Work-life balance is non existent. Regardless of your schedule most employees work nights and weekends consistently to try to meet goals.  

Building too small for employees; desk sharing (two employees share same desk on different shifts). Some employees don't have desks with their team due to space issues.  

Lack of communication between managers and employees.

Management is not proactive, they are reactive and only try to improve processes after the problems threaten their jobs. 

Very bureaucratic. 

A lot of unproductive meetings. 

Two old leaky coffee pots for an entire floor."

This division of the company LOVES role-playing.  Your manager will encourage you to try to help the branch increase profit (I use the term ""encourage"" loosely, they actually will question, cajole, and berate) by offering whatever makes the branch the most money to the customer.  When you go for a meeting with your manager during an account opening, expect the conversation to go like this - ""So, did you offer Mr. Customer a credit card?""  No.... ""Well, why not?""  Well, remember when I told you that they filed for bankruptcy last week and they got their car repossessed last month?  ""Well, you can't assume anything....why don't I go over there with you and tell Mr. Customer about the benefits of our Freedom Card?""  Seriously, it's like that.  Oh, and you know how they LOVE to have Bankers greet you at the branch?  It's so the banker can get the customer's cheeks in the seat so that bankers can try and sell every product available.  Thought you were just gonna cash a check real quick?  yeah, good luck with that....the Banker will be harassed to pull the customer out of the lobby to do the ""1-2-3 Drill"" to sell products.

This is more of a job for either a single person with  no dependents. Put simply, it is not ideal for the average sole bread earner with a family to support. I work in the telephone consumer banking side and what joke. Talk about micro-managing. Also, I must hear, ""don't do this or say this or you may get a red alert"" almost a zillion times a day. Oh, besides the pathetic pay, they cram as much as they can on you. Example,  you might be earning just $12 a hour doing both consumer and online support calls. What's more, right next door there are some really nice apartment complexes. Guess what? You're not earn enough to pay the $1,300+ a month rent, let alone, make the 3x's the rent to qualify with your Chase ""wealth"".  Advancment? Well, if you're lucky to get one, they make you jump through hoops and add even more BS.

Working for Chase drains your soul. You are constantly forced to make phone calls to sell products (they say invite in to review accounts). Have to sell checking, savings and credit cards to every single customer if not your manager will ask you why you did not submitted a credit card application. Have to call customers to bring more balances, or open account or to use bill pay or some other crap the bank offers!
 Every morning you have to listen to the same crap from you manager in the morning huddles, like you are 5 years old, totally brain washing your head! repeating, and repeating and repeating the same thing, like a broken record. 
I've been in many other jobs and I will not recommend this company to anybody. I talked to people in other branches and they feel the same way. Even if you make good money, the pressure you have to deal with every day is not worth it.

Management can be rather flexible when time off is needed as long as its reasonable.  There are some nice discounts and perks tied with employment.,Many aim for promotions but very few will get them.  It depends on who you know.  I know managers that rose through the ranks in a couple years while I know others with nearly 20 years with the company who are deserving but ignored.  And these are not people that are complacent with their position; very hardworking people who's contribution are often ignored.  Salaries are not competitive with competitors.  I know several former coworkers that have found better salaries elsewhere.  Tellers often take the blame for drops in customer experience rankings.

The pay is okay for a base salary, but Chase doesn't believe in raises, they believe if you want to make more money, you have to make more money to earn more commission, which is fine, except they take so much out of your commission checks with taxes that in the end all the work you put in is not worth the payout you receive."

Instead of congratulating for making sales goals, they would give condescending remarks about how poor of a job you did if you weren't the best in the market. I worked in a branch that had about 100 transactions a day, and I still made my goal. Because I didn't make the same numbers that a branch with 1000 transactions a day, I was a failure.

The monthly incentive is not capped unlike almost every other bank.  Your ability to earn those monthly incentives is easy to obtain, and the base is also very competitive.  You are able to tell people you work for the largest and strongest bank around.  In addition to the sales incentive, you also have an annual bonus based on P&L, and a quarterly bonus based on customer service scores.","Some of the more local management (Branch Managers & District Managers) can have a different approach to  management can be convoluted at times.  Believing that a banker should talk to a branch manager, and a branch manager should talk to the district manager because that is the chain of command.  And some branch managers can be more hands off, and others are more micro managers.  The reason this is an issue is because you move around a lot at Chase.  There are always new opportunities, but also at the end of the year, they review everything and see if you deserve a promotion, or should just be moved to another branch."

8109,,"Good company, must be willing to fend for your self.",2012-04-28,4.0,Small Business Specialist,"Strong company. Senior leadership is very good. One of the best things is that Chase puts a lot of time and money into making technology available to the customer. There are also specialists for almost anything you can think of that will either know the answer, or will be able to find it and get back to you. Recently, Chase has begun moving back toward a customer service/relationship model, and if you can build relationships with customers that have larger portfolios it will benefit you.","As will most all very large companies, you are just another cog in the wheel. If you don't eat, drink, breath and sleep Chase, it can be difficult to be recognized and move up. In a smaller market you must be willing to play company politics to move quickly. There is very much a ""what have you  done lately"" attitude by mid-management. There always seems to be the new ""shinny object"". There hasn't been much of a focus on long term client relationship building if you aren't working with affluent clients."

8111,,Surprisingly pleasant workplace,2012-04-25,5.0,Personal Banker,"Comprehensive and thourough training program--This has been the most surprising thing to me, Chase has invested a lot of money in making sure I can do my job well and learn the industry well before I have even been here a year. 
Meritocracy--My disctrict manager told me this during my interview. This job pays a base and commission, so you are rewarded for excelling not only with money but with praise and job growth opportunities. 
Great place for young professionals--I have a sales background but being here has really made my resume legitimate, I feel like I have many options and Chase doesn't treat me like a second class citizen because I'm under 30.
Excellent Support--From on-call phone assistance to useful unline tools to management I felt able to do my job effectively even if I was not in my element.","Accountability--Not of the company, but its employees. Competition is great to drive up numbers but you end up defending the work you have done a lot if some skeevy person somewhere else takes credit for something he or she didn't do.
Base Pay--Some of the best incentives in the industry but not the best base. If you work hard it will bring you to about equal with similar companies.
Ladder-Climbing--There are lots of opportunities at Chase, but you have to really remind your superiors to pay attention to your exploits. Don't be afraid of bragging and share any customer compliments with your bosses."
8112,,Chase card services is a good starter career that enables you to learn about the various credit options in the industry.,2012-04-24,2.0,Financial Advisor,"With Chase Card Services, you are guaranteed 40 hours per week and are fronted vacation hours.  This helps if you are looking to plan vacation outside of the training sessions.  Working here gives you a great insight into credit services offered at Chase.",The lack of flexibility and the lack of the ability to grow within the company are just a couple of the pitfalls that Chase possesses.  Growth is painted as simple and relatively quick but is rather arduous and time consuming.  I know personally several team members aiming to grow but have been in the same position for 5+ years.

Management is usually incompetent and every position you can get promoted too there's a 50/50 chance you'll make more money than you would as a banker unless you make it to Branch manager. Many people that get promoted do NOT succeed and either go back to being a banker or get fired for underperformance. Full of backstabbers too.

The ""In-Store"" program moves you around A LOT. As soon as you get to know your customers and gain their trust, you are re-located without any say in the matter.
""In-Store"" Bankers have to run transactions, leaving little office time to expand your book of business.
Promotions are based on numbers without any consideration of other factors (such as customer service).   If you aren't producing numbers your manager is happy with, you will not be promoted, even if you have policies and procedures memorized.

There was nothing quite like being out of work at a reasonable hour and having weekends off.,"When they mess up, they mess up BAD. Offered me a certain amount to transfer to the West Coast, then when I got here and was comfortable, said that there was some sort of ""clerical error"" and cut my pay annually by $2000. This, by the way, was after messing up my transfer in the first place, which meant that potential apartment buildings could not verify my correct income. I ended up having to live in a hotel for 4 weeks as a result, and the firm refused to give me any compensation for their mistakes. Terrible!"

The back up child care where Chase pays for two weeks a year was a great benefit for working parents.,"Hostile work enviroment, mandatory overtime, mirco managed employees, changed compensation (took away incentive) which reduced my income by $1,000 per month or $12,000 peryear.

The incentive package is misrepresented to look so easy and amazing (to me it was anyway) and then later to find there are many stipulations before being paid.
While I was there the incentive for quite a few items either cut in half or went away all together.
The sales focus is morally wrong!! Making an 89 yr old man sign up for a credit card just bc the mgr says so when he has 5 already he doesnt use and or may be on a fixed income is not ""whats best for the customer"" in my opinion its whats best for the Mgmt bonus and the company and I dont work like that!"

They will try the best they can to get you in a branch that is close to home. That, of course, means you must be there even if the world is coming to an end.","You will find that you are more educated than the majority of your managers. If you start in the branches, the chances of getting out are almost impossible. You will also find some old employees are still stuck in the old 'Chase Way' and can't seem to evolve into what the bank is trying to do...which is be more customer minded. Majority of management 'bleeds blue' and believes that this bank is the end all be all of any other company in the universe. You will feel like your being baby sat vs being in a professional position. You can only take as many Mondays and Fridays off during the year as weeks you have for vacations. For example; if you have two weeks vacation then you can only have two Mondays and two Fridays off in the entire year (some exceptions are available). Once you work for Chase Bank, a lot of places do not want to hire you because there is a stigma attached..."

Their training courses are very good and the support to succeed in your role is second to none.,"They always find a reason to take away or lower your bonus. They don't care if you have a family, the company comes first. They take advantage of the fact that management is exempt employees and have you work the maximum hours. They refused to make WAMU Branch Manager salaries compatible to Chase employees (20k-30k difference). They expect maxium effort with minimum pay. Unfair :("

Chase is really focused on making their customers happy.,"Very little cons. The pay could be better, but once you become a BM, you are fairly compensated for your work. ABMs are over worked and underpaid. But still a fantastic company."
8150,,Ok,2012-03-16,3.0,Licensed Personal Banker,Benefits are great. They match up to 5% in your 401k and are one of the few companies that still contribute to a pension for the employees. The incentive program can be lucrative if you are at the right branch.,"There is a high amount of turnover in Branch Managers because of the high sales pressure that is placed upon them. So you will have a lot of different managers, some who are good to work for and others who are very pushy and make the sales process very push. If you are at a smaller branch who doesn't do much business it will also make you look like your not a good sales rep when you are compared to the branches that do a higher volume. Making it hard for promotion if not placed in a good branch.  I was a branch manager at one time for the company but the intense pressure that was placed by my district manager in regards to sales made it a very unenjoyable experience."

*One will gain an exorbinent amount of transferrable skills if you keep your nose to the grindstone, absorb all that the firm associates its brand with relative to inner-workings and outside interests.
*Ambassadorship - and its value - can not help but be learned, attained and gained if one embraces JPM's core business model(s).","*It VERY MUCH feels as though the inmates are running the assylum.
*JPM is so far from understanding what it literally takes to manage relationships both internally as well externally -- while ""banking"" the money is important it is even more pressing to develop genuine relationships.
*It would behoove the firm to adopt a Jim Collins attitude as he gets it right in his book Good to Great, “People are not your greatest asset; the right people are!”
*If JPM went from ""good to great"", clients would be exempt from the burden of the firms high turnover rate; meaning, client's would not have to experience insurmountable turnover of bankers/investors/wealth advisors/trust officers, etc. relative to their accounts and they would not have to feel/experience uncertainitity with ""who"" is managing their assets."

Salaries are the worst in the industry. Branch managers are not professional leaders. They discuss customer info with staff and make fun of customers and take photos of customers who are less fortunate to make fun of them.,Daily pressure to sell every customer everything even if they don't need or want it.  They make every associate sound like a robot and tell you that you must see 20 customers per day and then critique each interaction as to why you weren't able to sell them the kitchen sink.

Great technology.  Pretty good training.,"Branch managers are a joke.  Their entire role is to ""babysit"" their bankers.  The company needs to rework their BMs entire job description-- they should be driving sales, building moral, and training their staff-- instead of micromanaging everything from my posture to my tone of voice.  Micromanaging puts your team on edge, it does NO good at all.
Working the lobby is not customer service friendly and frankly DOES NOT WORK.
DMs play the political game.  This needs to be cut out, it is very annoying and not effective.

This will give you time to meet the customers, but the customer (98% of the time) will be pissed because their 2 minutes in line turned into 10 at your desk. You really have to be a ""Tool"" to succeed here. If you are a seasoned professional sales person, this is not the place for you. The average age of sales people (PB's) seems to be early 20's.

The products and technology are leader of the pack. Good leadership in management. Clear objectives. There is sales pressure, but not to any degree where you question your job security - with underperformance comes more coaching, that's all (you have to do very poorly for a long time for it to affect your job security). The incentives are very generous in my opinion.","The banking rates are average so people who shop for rates all over town can usually find something better at a very small bank or a credit union so we get some opposition from that.

The base salary is very low compared to other bank and they'll tell you with the incentive plan you can make six figures. True for very few, location or luck will decide if you do (don't be fooled). You'll max out on your salary at 42K and max bonus is usually about 1K for the year. Chase will be your life and you are required to bleed blue and put the company first above all. It's a high pressure role in an higher stress sales environment with unrealistic goals with overbearing managers.  Employee turn over is vey high and unless you're a top producer/seller,  your shelve life is about 6 months to a year. If you can sell water to the well, have  no morals or ethics,  this job is for you and don't worry about wants best for the customers, think about how you can get paid off them....sell sell sell!!!

There are monthly bonuses for the customers you refer over to a banker and who get something (like a new checking account, or credit card application--the banker does all the work, all you have to do is get the customer over to see one). If my co-workers and managers weren't so awful, I would probably still be working there.","I worked as a teller, and though no where in the job description or interview process do they mention teller referrals, they are mandatory. Of course you get paid monthly bonuses for your successes, but the manager gets really pushy about them, which I disliked. The management team makes such an impact on the bank, if you have a crappy team you will not enjoy your job. Also, it's very taxing working with the public all day. Customers take out their frustration about Chase on you, yelling at you because their check cant be cashed or their account was charged a fee. You need a lot of patience for this job. I left because the team I was with didnt carry their own weight (and I received a better job offer elsewhere).

8204,,Great job opportunities,2012-01-15,5.0,,"Work with your school schedule if you're a part time employee. Great health benefits, you get discounts with phone companies",If you're a full time employee and want to go to school 5 and on it will be hard because it's a 9-6 job
8205,,Decline and Decline every year.,2012-01-15,4.0,Business Banker,Reward the more productive and hard working employees. Started with 4 weeks of Vacation and ended with 6 weeks. Upper management treated employees with respect. Good position if you have a good branch and good personal bankers.,"Commissions began to drop year after year. They paid more commissions but were more difficult to obtain. Went from a 6 figure income job to a lot less. Gets redundant after some time, eventually leads to a burn out job. Your best personal bankers get promoted/recruited and the revolving door of new personal bankers never ends. No more raises!"
8206,,It is overall a good solid company to work for.,2012-01-13,4.0,Licensed Personal Banker,The company has a great sales incentive program to promote sales.  They also have flexible hours and are able to work around employees schedules. Their benefits package is one of the best that I've seen,"Management delegates minimally, or not at all. Customer service issues are put back on the sales force. Company is very aggressive."
8207,,It's a good job.,2012-01-12,3.0,Personal Banker,"The benefits package is great.  The commission structure is uncapped.  The firm is strong financially.  Looks great on a resume.  Can relocate fairly easily.  Best pay structure of the large banks. Overall, a fairly prestigious firm to work for.","Managers have absolutely no imagination.  Politics runs rampant.  In my experience, management did not recognize employees often enough.  Being that it is a sales position, there is a ""what have you done for me lately"" attitude from management.  Bankers are said to be the most important position for the branch, but they are not treated as such.  Managers expect Bankers to work the lobby all the time; something that most Bankers hate.  Some managers love to micromanage. Overall, it is a sales job, and if you are not comfortable with sales and getting up to pull people from the line, DO NOT APPLY."
8208,,"I learned a lot, but didn't get paid enough for all the responsibilities I had.",2012-01-12,3.0,Senior Teller,A lot of promotional opportunities.,"Horrible management, and sucky pay. Favoritism makes this company not a pleasant environment."
8209,,"Management always changing, focus of team always changing.",2012-01-12,1.0,Banker,Decent pay for decent work,"Management always wants more...it is hard to make the bonuses they tell you about when you get hired. If you don't start producing right away, and always have a better month than the last, you will get sidelined, and made to feel as if you don't matter. Soon you will start to believe it. Management is trained to break their employees...not build them up. You are not a ""team"" with your fellow coworkers. Do not make friends with co-workers, management does not like!"
8210,,I hate my job,2012-01-11,1.0,Teller,"I enjoy helping the customers and getting to know them.  I enjoy working in retail banking and hope to soon be able to move up if not at Chase, else where.",The location that I work has a lot of HR issues that are not addressed which makes for a very bad work environment.
8211,,Good,2012-01-11,3.0,,"Benefits
Back up child care
Work culture","Business model
Senior managment style
growth oppurtunites"
8212,,Commission lowered throughout the years,2012-01-05,2.0,Licensed Personal Banker,Good benefits at some point,"Poor management, I went thru 5 managers in 5 years.  Their commission structure has been lowered, I went from making 60k my first year to making 38k my 5th and last year.  My branch went from having 5 bankers to having 11 bankers so obviously commission was harder to hit at goal but we were micro managed to hit even though economy is really bad and they keep hiring bankers.  You are literally followed around my your manager the whole day.  My manager would hide behind my cubicle to listen to what I spoke about with my customers."
8213,,Interesting,2012-01-05,3.0,Licensed Personal Banker,the pay and the benefits are excellent the vacation time is awesome the pay for your shirts and ties which is also a bonus the insurance is great and also the job security,the black suits everyday makes you feel like you work in a funeral home management not very receptive to feedback lack of management skills no room for job growth or oppurtunity no raises and very hard goals to reach especially in the slower locations
8214,,"Worked at the call centre, awful place to work",2012-01-04,1.0,Service to Sales,"If you are sales driven then their commission strategy is pretty decent but other than that there aren't many pros. Free coffee, perhaps?","Timed to the second, everything beyond a second off the phone is questioned. 
Expected to sell products to irate customers with tough quotas to meet. 
If you didn't meet these quotas you were not prodiving good ""customer service""
No feedback or support from management.
Personal attacks from cardmembers that literally leave you in tears."
8215,,Great company to work for!,2011-12-31,4.0,,Good incentive plan and opportunity to grow in company. Chase gives good guidance on how to be successful but allows you to make it your own. I would recommend for anyone to work here that desires to be in banking,Length of training was long and odd scheduling in training hours
8216,,Best comp plan low base,2011-12-30,4.0,Licensed Personal Banker,"Very high comp had months I made 4k in comp on top of base. You can make six figures here.
Fast promotions
Just produce and no micro management","No outside business activites I got let go cause I had a business on the side
Political and senior management are hyrocritics."
8217,,Definition of Micro Management,2011-12-28,1.0,Licensed Personal Banker,"A good place to start your career, having JP morgan chase on your resume is a plus.  However, JP Morgan and Chase are 2 very different organizations. Those who work for JP morgan always state they work for JP morgan, never for Chase. They are always hiring, however, there is a very high turn over rate for this position.","Major Micro-management, impossible to promote into any other departments from retail banking center.  Management is not concerned with your career, however, there own, and you will be replaced if you do not meet the requirements they require.  You can make decent money as long as you worry about your own pockets, and your own future, and less of that of management.  Management will promote those they like, as oppose to those who work hard, and get the job done."
8218,,I'm proud to work for the industry leader in banking.,2011-12-27,5.0,,"JP Morgan has the best technology, training, and opportunity to grow with a company. I have the highest respect for the company as a whole.","If you are in a sales position and not in a major market, good luck getting full payout, good reviews, and a promotion. Obviously any company is going to promote those who excel in their position, however, Chase promotes top producers in to low producing markets, virtually eliminating the possibility to move up if you don't live in, or move to a major market."
8219,,Good place to work!,2011-12-22,4.0,Bank Teller,Good family like atmosphere very encouraging.,You don't get paid maternity leave.
