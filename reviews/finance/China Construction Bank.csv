93,China Construction Bank,Dont join in,2021-02-09,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"cant really think of any pros when compared to the other banks I worked at.

Perhaps less pressure since the management does not have a mature rating mechanism. This apparently causes problem and I would rather be rated fairly based on well-established system and careful cooperate planning.","Incapable management who fully depend on micro-management. They rate you based on things like your response speed to emails (needs to be instantly like in 15 min) and if you make to the meeting they scheduled 30 min ago during the middle of the day. The management have no idea of the actual workload and how many people they need to hire. Basically they cannot plan. 

Some manager ignores your email 90% of the time from day 1 and only responds when feel like to. A lot business as usual things need to be pushed from this kind of manager, which are expected to be streamlined and effortless in other banks I worked at. 

Required to travel to NYC office during COVID in 2020 when it was completely unnecessary. Management dont give a damn about employee safety, but like to claim they do all the time in group emails and announcement.  

Clock in clock out for all full time employees. HR patrol around to see if you work at your desk and follow all rules. 

HR ignore your emails if they want to. Their responses and questions can be highly inappropriate. You experience this during interviews prob slightly and dont ignore the red flags right there. They are totally OK with playing dirty on the back when they need to while pretending to be caring. 

Culture shocks on many aspects (compared to US or European banks). Definitely not diversified staffs and culture. 

Some people were forced to work long hours for a significant period of time."
