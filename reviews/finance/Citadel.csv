0,,amazing company but wish culture was just a tad better,2022-04-08,5.0,Trader,"incredible ambition, energy, sky is the limit. Nothing would stop people to get things done. I learnt an incredible amount and felt I was pushed beyond what I thought I could ever do. Whilst I decided to leave to pursue an opportunity elsewhere I do miss the determination I had there. I am a diverse individual and I never felt discriminated against or heard of anything like that. However, it is mostly white males around, I would recommend the diverse folks to look past this because you will end up seeing the entire differently after you work there!","People are incentivised to work for themselves only and not as part of a team in general. Some people at the top could do with learning how to communicate politely and to control their own emotions. I also found a lot of people tried to discourage new joiners I suppose to make them scared or something like that, pretty poor of those people, but I now know who they are and will make sure to warn people I know against them wherever they go as I don't think this is what Ken Griffin wants his people to do. It is still worth working for Citadel for the sheer amount of abilities you discover you had untapped.
the other downside is that don't even think about moving internally...it s a lot easier to get the next job you want elsewhere with the citadel on your cv than to waste your time trying to move internally."

147,,Competitive place with every opportunity to succeed,2020-11-01,5.0,Current Employee,"Citadel has a competitive and fast-paced environment where you are given a large degree of autonomy, a chance to do things well and the opportunity to challenge the status quo with every decision you take. You get to experience a lot of different areas and get involved in things that are not strictly part of your job description. Wearing ""multiple hats"" in this way is something that I have enjoyed quite a bit as it has significantly sped up my learning and exposure to various areas in business and engineering. 

The company offers all types of resources and technologies for you to succeed in your role. This is not only limited to tools you find on your desktop but opportunities for personal advancement, training and academic advancement as well. People are receptive to new ideas and are willing to collaborate. Internal mobility is fostered and management understands the need for providing new challenges to those who seek it and have a proven track record. 

Teams runs lean here because of a very selective hiring process that focuses on getting talented and genuine people through the door. Culture is changing for the better (still lots to improve) and management is regularly thinking about ways for making things better for the people who work here. These things are not easy to do and take time, but the important thing is to realize that certain changes should be made and then doing something about it.","These are not necessarily cons, but a few comments on things that you generally tend to hear when looking up company reviews: 


You should not expect to find a well thought out roadmap on how to do things handed to you. If it was that easy, the firm would not spend significant time and resources finding top talent who are comfortable with some sound autonomous decision making. You are fully expected to run into scenarios where you don't have a clear answer or a lot of information and then come up with creative ways to get through. 

Expectations are high, pace is fast and there are many problems to solve in the business, engineering and the strategy space. So do not expect a 9-5 work culture."
148,,Good salary,2020-10-14,4.0,Executive Assistant,Supportive coworkers and smart people,A lot of turnover per year
149,,I used to be proud to say I worked here. It's just toxic now.,2020-10-08,1.0,Treasury,"-Free breakfast, lunch, and dinner. (You pay taxes on this BTW).

-The name still means something but less than what it used to.","-Almost the entire Treasury function has turned over, including the Treasurer, in the last 18 months. People from 1-15+ years experience have resigned just to get their non-compete started, not because they found another role. The entire culture has deteriorated. 

-The culture is NOT a meritocracy anymore. It is extremely toxic with horrible morale. Having people THINK it’s a meritocracy might be Citadel’s best asset. In reality it operates more like a cult; once you realize you are underpaid for the work you are doing, ask for and do not get a raise, and leave, they will get a 22 year old to do your job for 50-60k and smother that guy until he realizes the same thing. They overpay for some big names here and there and make splash hires and they quietly exit and onto the next.

-In line with above, management frequently gaslights you. All your problems are your own fault. Full stop. Two examples, with a manager on vacation I got buy-in from all involved teams to move a project up the priority list into the top 5 because of the potential risks to capital and regulatory reporting. When the manager came back it was moved to 31 and I was asked why it was taking so long. In another instance a developer thought a project was beneath him so I wrote the code myself and handed him the solution. Feedback from management was negative because it took too long and said I should drive more accountability into others.

-Management has favorites and untouchables. Mistakes happen, but owning them and working on a solution is only a rule for some. Others never have to clean up their own mess or smell their own manure.

-Citadel used to scale through technology and not headcount, but at some point in the last few years a layer of bureaucratic oafs have been installed that lack a rudimentary understanding of hedge funds, finance, markets, and internal workflows. They add no value and just assign blame to lower level employees and teams. Their inflated comp would be better served rewarding employees or hiring more developers. There is no longer any collaboration, just a lot of “That’s not my job” you would find in a bank, which makes sense because almost every director/manager level hire comes from Goldman.

-Regarding technology, you’ll hear people say Citadel is a tech/data company that specializes in finance. This is not the case. IT/Dev groups are constantly gutted and turned over resulting in a bottleneck that management refuses to acknowledge. Then they gaslight you. Again, any problem you had was entirely your own; there’s no bottleneck or lack of resources, “You just aren’t pushing hard enough.”

-Lack of IT resources results in numerous fire drills for mid level employees. Little can be planned or accomplished when you are playing Russian roulette with 4 in the cylinder (yes, better than a coin flip something breaks!). Employees are encouraged to come up with solutions to eliminate risks and redundancies but the project is never prioritized and then it happens again and the question of why it wasn't fixed will be asked.

-Good ideas are passed up for things that are new and sexy, only to be later abandoned because they over-promise/under-deliver or just flat out suck and then they’ll revisit the solution proposed by the SME. 

-Work/Life balance is non-existent and makes the comp not worth it. There is no expectation of being out of office. There are alerts and texts and emails at all hours that require addressing or else. Hours were normally 7-7 on a day when nothing went wrong, which happened rarely. 2-4 times a week you’ll exceed 14 hours without any acknowledgement whatsoever.

-There is little room for advancement. Initially this was okay as long as comp and responsibility kept increasing, but there is a moving invisible target. Management will pay as little as possible to keep you and keep changing the criteria for why you aren’t getting a bigger bonus. The goalpost is constantly moved to suit stiffing you.

-Citadel has a decent “Comp Trap” set up where next year’s comp and bonus are communicated in November/early Dec but not paid till March. By the time March rolls around it’s only ~8 months to the next one and maybe that one will be better."

172,,Worth the Read - The Grass Is Pretty Brown in Treasury Department,2020-07-05,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"-You get to put Citadel on your resume, which has to be losing some value as time goes on. A simple linkedin search for ""non-compete Citadel"" will show you the vast number of ex Citadel employees currently sitting out their non-compete's.  

-As others have mentioned you get ""free"" breakfast & lunch... if you've studied finance, you've probably heard the phrase ""there is no such thing as a free lunch"" this absolutely rings true here.

-The feeling of freedom after you leave.","-Working at Citadel as an associate is equivalent to being a vice-president (or higher) at a bank while getting paid as if you are an analyst. Have also heard the joke that Citadel's biggest arbitrage is actually underpaying employees for the level of responsibility/work.

-As others have mentioned, the culture over the past five months has deteriorated at a shocking pace with the exit of the prior treasurer and entrance of the new treasurer. Departures have been rampant and many that have been here for some time are currently just waiting for an opportune time to exit. 

-Witnessed the new treasurer state: ""if you are infected with coronavirus and give it to someone else at the firm you will be fired."" 

-The firm has done a great job at attracting talent by fooling the public with a deteriorating brand name and a false meritocracy. Unfortunately, it doesn't take long for this sad reality to set in once you are in the door and have most likely signed a 6-18 month non-compete. It's not unheard-of to see employment tenor's less than 5 months. Multiple big name hires have started during the past 3 years and left the firm in less than 7 months. If you google search this phrase: ""executive leaves citadel months""  you can find plenty of examples.

-Looking for work life balance? Stay away, multiple teams are now down to skeleton crews where they are barely keeping above water, some are now fully underwater and are holding massive amounts of key man risk. Operations teams average 15-16 hour days plus weekends with counterparts constantly escalating to managers due to the excessive number of issues. Currently, there are numerous teams where individuals are unable to take one single day of vacation until more hires are made. One team specifically needed an individual to work everyday while he had coronavirus due to the abysmal amount of coverage.

 -One of the ops teams specifically has turned over almost 300% in the last 3.5 years. An already abnormally lean team consisting of eight full time, experienced, employees is now running at three full time employees plus a couple interns. 

-Politics have approached that of working at a bank, especially since every single new hire now comes from Goldman. It's surprising that the firm hasn't been sued yet for the egregious amount of people that have come in directly from GS. Working in treasury under these conditions now provides you with the opportunity to participate in most, if not all, of the firms downside and little to none of the firms upside. Additionally, this situation has created a ""too many chiefs and not enough indians"" scenario and has created a culture of passing blame and work around to any other team except your own.

-The number of driven and highly skilled individuals that have left in the past 6 months and more specifically, during coronavirus with no role lined up should tell you everything you need to know about working here see linkedin comment above ^.

-The firm has figured out the exact minimum compensation formula to keep most from quitting immediately after bonuses are released. Furthermore, bonuses are strategically paid out later than almost all other firms on the street. This delay, advantageously places you behind the other finance professionals looking to leave at competing firms that have been interviewing since Nov, Dec, Jan, & Feb. By the time you start looking elsewhere and get serious on exiting, the recruiting market is saturated, and months have passed. After enough time you begin to have a glimmer of hope that maybe, just maybe, next year's bonus they will truly take care of you for your efforts and that you should just stick it out another 6 months or so to find out. Unfortunately, this cycle will continue year after year until you give up all hope and realized you've been underpaid the whole time.

-For a firm that prides itself on being a front runner when it comes to IT, this idea seems to have been lost some years ago. As others have mentioned just getting through the day requires significant levels of manual effort on simple tasks that should've been automated long ago but have not due to lack of resources. IT resources for valuable projects are highly strained and are often passed over to be applied to wasteful projects that are applicable to banks, not hedge funds."

You will find that top-tier talent is easily approachable, willing to collaborate, and often within arms-reach of you. The work you produce is valued and your opinions on implementation will be heard if you can sufficiently support your view. Employees who reach a point where they feel stuck in their career, or have a desire to seek out new challenges, have options. Those who have proven they can exceed expectations are given every opportunity to explore other areas of the firm where they may add value.  Management recognizes this and is fully supportive of internal moves that better align employees with their core skills and interests. It is also a firm where your work has an immediate and tangible impact and you can quickly become the owner of a high-value process. This extends to work that may on the surface appear to be somewhat trivial but supports a critical function at the firm. Front-office colleagues and investment teams take pride in the hard work being done at every level and will often go out of their way to recognize individuals who continually deliver. There is constant focus on finding and working with cutting edge (not bleeding edge) technology that better positions the firm to succeed, and there is an underlying expectation that you will scrutinize and review prior implementations. There are endless complex problems to be solved and this seems to really foster a culture of innovation.","While the resources and opportunities are endless, it is ultimately up to you to determine how to best leverage them.  No one is going to give you a full roadmap on how to navigate your role and grow your skillset. This can often be a challenge for those who thrive on structure or have a more traditional view of how their career should progress. Citadel is also constantly evolving and pushing the limits at all levels and this can be daunting for people who might not enjoy changing requirements, context-shifting or re-engineering recently completed work.  Expectations are accordingly high, and this can sometime be overwhelming for employees who aren’t deeply invested in the task or problem at hand. Lastly, for central or common roles where there is no PnL tied directly to your name, finding ways to add value that can be quantified is always challenge, particularly for those that don’t have an interest in finance or fully appreciate what the main function of the firm it (or have a desire to learn it)."

200,,"Fast Paced, Lots of Responsibilities",2019-10-03,5.0,Software Engineer,"Citadel is a great place to work for someone without too much experience in the industry. You can make an impact right away and have ownership over your projects. This comes with more responsibilities and you get to interact with the stakeholders of your work. Having ownership means that you can see your project from initial design through to production. Since the people that use the software that you build are internal clients, you get feedback constantly, resulting in a fast paced iteration process. You will be learning alot really quickly and get to develop not only technical skills, but also communication, leadership, and financial skills. teams are generally pretty small and generally collaborative. The company has a very flat sturcture and results oriented. As a junior developer, quant, or trader, you have many opportunities to interact with leaders in management across different functions.","Citadel is split among different businesses. As an engineer, you will be supporting traders and researchers who generate money for those businesses. Not all the businesses have the same culture and thus team experiences could differ. This also means that there will be a team with a business need and culture that you will find compelling. Some teams' work life balance isn't too great and do work very long hours. Usually it is because the projects they work on are very time sensitive and high margin. Turnover is relatively high as some new people may not fit in well with the team and/or business."

202,,True meritocracy and great place to learn,2019-09-29,5.0,Software Engineer,"* Citadel is a true meritocracy with a strong culture of ownership and ""getting stuff done"".
* There is a lot of autonomy given to developers. You are encouraged to diversify your skillset by constantly learning on and off the job. On different projects, I have not only been the software developer but also a product manager, quant researcher or product evangelist based on what aspect of the project interested me. Talented peers from different backgrounds are always willing to help you learn new skills.
* As someone who joined through the new grad program, a lot of support and guidance was provided in terms of classes, tech talks, speaker series, and various mentorship programs. The rotational program also allows you to find a team that is a perfect fit for you. 
* Titles mean very little at Citadel and the organization structure is very flat. Junior people who show promise are encouraged to take on more responsibility and are pulled into mission-critical projects. 
* Portfolio Managers, traders, and analysts appreciate the importance of technology and quant research and are constantly trying to incorporate it into their investment process. Citadel is especially rewarding for those engineers who are willing to put the effort to understand financial markets. Software developers are constantly reminded that they are there to solve problems and not just write code.","* Citadel demands 100% from its teams and individual members every year. This leads to a cycle of a multiyear period of stability (4-5 years) followed by a short period of turnover (6-8 months). This cycle has it's obvious cons but for ambitious team members, the period of turnover actually creates a lot of opportunities. 
* Software developers are encouraged to understand and solve problems. Sometimes these problems are ambiguous and the specs provided are loose. If you are scared by ambiguity, then this may not be the best place for you. 60-40% split of long term vs short term projects. Engineers, especially in the front office, may be required to context switch based on market conditions.
* Citadel is a big consumer of open source projects but doesn't have a strong culture of contributing back to them."
203,,Company that emphasizes growth,2019-09-24,5.0,Quantitative Developer,"- Peers - highly intelligent people with different roles and backgrounds sitting right next you - culture is dynamic and cooperative

Ownership is encouraged and rewarded and there are a lot on interesting projects going on in the company which allows everyone to own important pieces of work and contribute in more than one areas.

Citadel is strictly meritocracy driven and rewards people with talent.",There can be some pressure at times because market events play a role in your workflow.
205,,"A place for technologists to do their best work, grow, and be rewarded",2019-09-04,5.0,Software Engineer,"Citadel is a company that strives to have every employee be their best professional self, and is absolutely true to its values - integrity, winning, meritocracy, learning, and extraordinary colleagues. 

The culture is centered around performance - there is an obvious, stated mandate that everyone perform at their peak capability 100% of the time, while constantly stretching that peak as much as possible. This is not your traditional finance company culture of ""facetime"" whereby those who are visible at their desk 24/7 are promoted and praised. Instead, those who contribute, exceed their goals, and bring the whole team forward are considered the top performers. And, of course, top performers are rewarded accordingly - not with badges of pride or soft praise, but with concrete results. If that's what you're looking for, Citadel is the place to be. 

From a technologist's perspective, there are infinite opportunities to learn from your peers, many of whom have different backgrounds, or completely different skillsets to offer. You may find yourself working with former nuclear physicists, or former fed chairmen; each interaction is a chance to level-up each other, and to learn something new. 

Of course, there are the perks: breakfast and lunch available in the office, stipends for teams to hold events, frequent company-wide outings (read: sporting events, broadway shows, etc.), and top-notch comp.","As with any company in an expansion phase, there are some growing pains. That said, those at Citadel have been less than at companies in similar phases. There are active efforts to mitigate bureaucracy, but occasionally they fall a little short. 

Given the performance oriented culture, if you don't make the cut, there is no time wasted before you are shown the door. Though depending on your perspective, this may not be a con."

Working here has many of the good qualities of working at a startup or a small company, combined with the scale and clout of a major player:

·        you will have the ability to interact directly with leaders and hands-on people at all levels—not just intermediaries but the actual deciders and doers.
·        there is room to make a difference; decisions are made swiftly and your ideas can go from concept to reality rapidly
·        what you deliver can move the needle for the business and influence the success of Citadel and the direction of technology in the industry","Delivery is a must. You have to be excellent at balancing quality and customers' needs while making sustained, measurable progress towards your goals.

For all that intensity people are generally personable and good human beings. A lot will be demanded of you and nearly everything you do will have a clear and immediate impact on your teammates, if not the firm. Work is intensely collaborative. Even on your worst day you will feel tremendously accomplished. If you like pressure, you will be constantly stretching and growing. The hype is that Citadel is the place to work with the best and be the best, and the reality lives up to it.","Being the best and being surrounded by the best can be exhausting. Discussions are impassioned, heated, and sometimes combative - it’s great that everyone is so engaged but nothing is ever easy. Management is very top-down; I’ve never had a job where so much time and energy was expended reporting to and justifying plans and decisions to the various layers of management above, or managing their curiosities and apprehensions. Leadership changes are frequent and each time a lot of effort goes into bringing the new management up to speed. It seems sometimes that each day brings a new “top” priority."
212,,Fast-paced environment with great co-workers,2019-08-08,5.0,Software Engineer,"* Fast-paced - expectations are high, and there is always plenty of work to be done
* Autonomous - developers have the opportunity and responsibility to prioritize and make decisions without micromanagement
* Team members - coworkers are driven, reliable, skilled, and flexible/understanding
* Interesting business - working in finance presents interesting problems to solve","* Difficulty of working remote - work station is a desktop, not a laptop, so working remotely requires RDP onto Windows machine, even though primary development machine is a Mac
* High turnover - bad for morale and leads to being understaffed at times"
213,,The challenges of a startup with unlimited resources,2019-08-08,5.0,Data Engineering Manager,"Citadel provides a challenging fast-paced environment that combines the best features of a startup and a larger player. There is a large degree of autonomy in technical decision-making and architecture choices, and there is an emphasis on being able to contribute as widely and cross-functionally as possible, typical of startup environments where you have to ""wear many hats."" This always leaves one feeling like there is never a shortage of learning opportunities. At the same time, there are a large amount of resources to lean on, spanning compute infrastructure, data ingestion, infosec, etc. 

It is very straightforward to feel your impact on and stay connected to the business, as projects require direct and ongoing communication with stakeholders and are designed from the onset to be quantitatively measurable. I highly recommend the company for any self-motivated engineer or analyst who cares about being able to assess the effect of their contributions all the way to alpha generation and P&L.","The amount of knowledge within the organization is staggering and sometimes makes you feel like you are drinking from an information firehose. Nevertheless, finance is at a stage where this assimilation of information is a necessary precondition for success, so being able to acclimate to this environment leaves one more resilient and versatile in the end, and acts as a career amplifier at Citadel and in the industry as a whole.

There is some need for information barriers that is inherent to the industry, but despite these necessities management is always transparent and keeps you informed about the broader picture and organization-wide initiatives."

Lots of technical debt that will not be addressed even when the debt threatens the success of the company.

Technologists would face a problem and work together to craft solutions for the firm. The company truly felt like one unit moving towards a common goal. As things changed, Ken unfortunately let in the belief that only persons with certain educational backgrounds or experience would lead to the next leg of success. I have seen definite growth in the business over the years, but the work environment has become cut-throat, toxic, and good ideas are often consumed by others not innovative enough to craft their own. Friendships have quickly been lost, people vanish constantly, giving a constant fear in the air of who is next on the chopping block, and process abounds as the firm grows, delaying project rollouts.

In general, there are some reviews about how terrible of a working environment Citadel is, but I highly disagree. There is, if anything, a much more collaborative environment than I have seen at other companies.  Also, work-life balance is not nearly as bad as people would seem. Especially out of New York, the workday is nothing more than other finance companies and very similar to what you would see at similar positions in the most competitive tech companies.","- Since everyone is very talented and ambitious at Citadel, upward mobility is a little harder than at smaller hedgefunds or at less reputable companies.

Citadel is a place where you can stand out and rapidly grow your career. It's small enough that interaction with senior management and investment professionals is the norm as a software engineer. Every day there are opportunities to demonstrate technical prowess and business acumen, and build a reputation among important people in the firm. This inevitably results in bigger projects and more responsibility. 

It's also entrepreneurial. Many of the proprietary tools I use on a daily basis came from an engineer that thought ""wouldn't it be cool/useful if we built ,"" built it, and sold it to their colleagues and other stakeholders in the firm. Citadel has a strong culture of innovation and corporate entrepreneurship, and little bureaucracy. As an engineer, this is empowering.","* Turnover is high, even in the technology organization. Eighty percent of the people that I started with two years ago are no longer with the firm.
* Recruiting and hiring managers aren't always on the same page. As a hiring manager, I've had a few instances where a candidate has interviewed well, has the right technical and soft skillset to excel in the role and we were excited to bring them on, yet the candidate was denied by recruiting because they did not come from the right school or study the right subject in school.

Through this project I was not only an architect and engineer, but also a product manager, user support and salesman. I have learned that this is typical of the most successful engineers at Citadel. In order to succeed you need to not only design systems, but also intimately understand the problems we are solving and how they relate to making money and managing risk. If you cannot incorporate the last two components into the systems you design, you will not be successful. However if you can, there is no ceiling.

I now work in data engineering for the fundamental equities businesses working on problems that enable our investment teams to gain insights from a variety of data sources.

During earnings season or at the end of a quarter you are keenly aware that there is little room for error or missed deadlines. It does not have an academic relaxed environment that you might find at other quant funds or tech shops. However if you can keep focused in that kind of environment and work with a passion there is no ceiling to your career at Citadel.

-Back office IT professionals worked to complete burn out levels and with no apparent interest in staffing up
-Same issues above lead to rampant illness - have seen people working with everything from pneumonia to severe injuries because there is no concern for people to be healthy
-People getting transferred, slow tracked, and fired after taking time off for medical or personal reasons
-Lack of resources in IT and general reliance on third parties leads to horrible data quality issues that are barely being contained by even the most diligent employee.  Mistakes everywhere, and if it's big enough, instead of trying to fix the actual problem management will just fire someone so they can save their own butt and say ""it's been taken care of.""  I've seen so many great people get fired
-The way they fire people - it may be necessary to some extent for security reasons - but it's pretty horrible. Immediate firing and escorted out - HR comes and slams stuff in boxes with no respect for the items - family photos mangled and likely needed possessions sitting for weeks before being returned to employees.
-All hours (middle of night on weekend) phone calls/people screamed at for minor issues
-No tolerance for stuff that is pretty normal in other modern offices, like working from home occasionally or leaving a tad early to catch a train - I guess the VPN is only there so that they can make you work on vacation
-For all of the above, pay is not that much better than other comparable employers and benefits (especially to include families) are actually a lot worse than many other similar companies
-You will most certainly not get promoted in back office functions without putting in a huge number of years (10+), and even then it's not likely"

Great compensation. Your salary will be the highest that there is in the industry.

Catered breakfast/lunch/dinner.","There are two key problems with working in any BO/MO position at Citadel:

1. You have no future within the company doing anything besides what you are doing now. HR and your manager(s) may pretend like there will be opportunities, but that will never happen and you can look at the people at the firm for proof. Nobody transitions into anything desirable. Advancements are in title only. There are people that have been there for 10 years and are 'managers' and even directors that are doing the same menial work that interns will do. There is zero chance for professional growth or career development. The leadership is entrenched (if you would even want their jobs) and not leaving anytime soon. Stay far away if you are ambitious because, despite the name and compensation, it is very much a dead end for your career. Your only hope for meaningful career advancement is to leave for another firm after 3-5 years (which is all Citadel is trying to get out of you).

2. You are compensated more because you are expected to work dramatically more hours than comparable positions anywhere else. On an hourly basis, you are paid the same as people anywhere else, often even less. It is common to work >12hr days in a MO or BO role at Citadel and not uncommon to see people putting in 14 hour days and working weekends. This happens because there is consistent understaffing and a lack of respect for life outside of work. The claim from management is that you need to 'leverage technology,' which is mostly unsubstantiated rhetoric. Many things cannot (currently) be automated.  This would be tolerable if there was any future for people willing to put in such work, but there is not."

- Great compensation.
- Getting specific tech or tools to use isn't a problem (money-wise, anyway) Still, this depends on the team you're on.
- If you have a good boss (and boss's boss), you'll probably have a great experience.
- The challenges at the scale Citadel operates at are uniquely interesting and they have some awesome solutions to some of these challenges.
- Great office, food, gym, perks like that.
- Generally good hiring culture (depending again on team).","- The worst siloing I've ever seen at a company.  There are multiple bug tracking tools, code repository systems, wikis, and even chat/communication tools and it varies from department to department and team to team who uses what.  This makes collaboration nearly impossible.
- Very difficult to make an impact on the tech since it's so spread out.
- You could end up on a very silo'd team with very little access to anything and your boss expects you to work all the time (including nights and weekends).
- Lots of teams want to just buy solutions and build their own spaghetti systems instead of leveraging what's already been built elsewhere (within Citadel and from the open source community). Sometimes this isn't even really their fault - they just don't know what's out there.
- Some of the code you'll find is comically bad because of deadlines, ""not invented here"" syndrome, and simply asking quants and traders to build software.  This goes for use and abuse of databases and queuing technologies as well.
- Very little service-oriented architecture.  Lots of monoliths.  Poor understanding of basic software engineering concepts like fault tolerance, re-trying i/o, exception handling, etc."

Most people will eventually realize that this is not a good place to work and move on, as a result citadel has the highest turnover rate of any finance company.  This creates a very volatile environment.","It is very unhappy place to work. The employed are needlessly stressed, harassed and burdened with busy non-productive work. The work at citadel is a constant struggle with legacy technology and management. The primary focus is to produce a lot of mediocre work instead of building something exceptional.      

There is no work/life balance, you are expected to work at least 12 hours a day and be accessible 24/7. The technology is desperately outdated and they resist any progress with almost religious zeal. People are resigning at the alarming rates, and company frantically tries to hire just to keep up with resignations. In order to speed up hiring they resort to outright lies, deceit and dirty tricks. Make sure you carefully read what you sign at citadel (consult with a lawyer). 
Because of the high turnover no one in the company knows anything about the ""system"", you cant ask anyone anything because 1/3 of people you are working with were hired last year. The rest are completely discouraged from doing anything productive and actively looking to quit. No teamwork."

370,,Engineers AVOID this place.,2014-12-14,1.0,Engineer,"Pay & benefits were great. Free meals, but no cafeteria - they want you to work at your desk so you'll work longer hours. And so you'll stay in your little cubbyhole where you belong and not interact with anybody who ""doesn't need to know"" (a key buzzword at this paranoid firm).","Manager was horrendously insecure and micro-managed everything in a field he had no business or experience to justify doing so (if micro-managing is ever justifiable). HR and manager's boss didn't seem to care that he was doing this - even after informing them he bought an expensive board without consulting his subordinates and it was effectively useless for what he wanted to do with it - something that could have been avoided if this guy had put his ego aside and asked the people working for him with more experience & knowledge.

Company has a highly secretive culture - at least two people were hired into our group without my knowledge. Granted, I wasn't a manager myself, but I'm generally accustomed to being permitted to interview candidates I'm going to work with and at least make a recommendation. You're also not allowed to talk to ANYONE because of this whole ""need to know"" BS that permeates the whole place. If you're coming from the tech sector and are used to being allowed to talk to people in other groups to get an idea of what it is they want, forget about doing that here. The Insecure Micro-Manager is your gatekeeper here. He will dictate the specifications and how he wants you to build your design. He will not care about your feedback or warnings about his architecture because his ego is too big. Then 2 weeks after you make your delivery and move on to the next project, Micro-Manager will tell you that the requirements weren't defined right and you need to go back to the old project and fix it so the internal customers will be happy. Something that clearly could be avoided by just letting us interact directly with the internal customers rather than carry this whole ""need to know"" concept to the paranoid extreme that exists at Citadel.

I'll say two more things that sums up the company culture here. About 6 months through my one-year stint at this place, there was a company-wide meeting where a friend of CEO Ken Griffin gave a talk about something. Following the presentation, there was a reception afterward. It dawned on me that I knew NOBODY there beyond my manager and colleagues at this reception. And if you held a gun to my head today and told me to name more than 6 or 7 people who work for Citadel (never mind titles or departments or anything), I'd end up with a hole in my head.

Just stay away. This place is just not worth the trouble or the pay. Or dealing with Micro-Manager's ego."

Either through burnout or not living up to these performance standards you will not in all likelihood have more than a 10 year career at Citadel."
374,,Where do you go from here?,2014-09-02,4.0,Senior Software Engineer,"Total compensation (base + bonus + medical/dental benefits) are nearly impossible to beat. Tack on the other perks (catered meals, in-house gym, discounts on things such as cellular plans and museum memberships, commuter benefits, the sheer amount of in-house education taught by industry & academic leaders) and you won't fit better overall compensation in Chicago.

The culture of compliance (legally speaking) gives you a feeling of stability. As much as we all hate going to those meetings for ""re-education"", it's comforting to know that regulations are taken seriously and people are willing to reach out for help when they've made a mistake. Citadel proves firms can prosper regardless of the regulatory environment.","Like most hedge funds, the org chart is very flat. You will be rewarded through comp, but if you desire more than money, the upward mobility is pretty limited.

For many years, there was a saying that Citadel is a ""technology firm that happens to trade"". This is ridiculous. The technology at Citadel is very outdated and many teams spend an equal amount of time working around the limitations of the infrastructure as they do building solutions to problems for the business they serve. Of course the darling businesses are allowed to buy whatever they need to get the job done, but for the other slow-but-steady money makers, technology can be extremely frustrating. This frustration transcends both the software (compilers, tool kits, etc.) and the hardware (storage subsystems, network infrastructure, etc.).

Unless you have deferred comp (difficult to achieve) or are directly involved in a business (QR and trading), your comp is based on the overall performance of the firm and yourself,. but you have no direct way to participate in the gains (or losses) of the firm. A voluntary employee fund (or something along those lines) would be nice for those of us that are dedicated to the firm and want greater benefit from our contributions.\

The office is sterile. There is very little access to natural light (unless you happen to have an office), otherwise it's a fluorescent hell. The ""open cubicle"" concept is extremely detrimental to productivity, but I'm not sure it was done in the name of conformance and collaboration. In reality, it does nothing to foster collaboration outside of what a team is going to do naturally, with the added strikes of being noisy and disruptive.

The politics in upper IT management can be paralyzing. We often do nothing out of fear or a Congressional-like inability to compromise, rather than stepping on some toes and doing what's needed to get the job done."

Be prepared to be forced to use really old technology, and when you ask for new tech, get berated and flagged as a trouble maker.

Management don't like when people ask to do something else even relevant to what their skill set is. Especially, if you do your job very well, they just want you to stay where you. Management will promise you bright future/new opportunities to learn, in order to keep you at your assembly point as long as possible, but these promises never fullfilled.

A lot of politics. Management think they are so smart and experienced, they don't need any ideas from their subordinates/employees and just manage as they think fit with total disregard/ignorance for good ideas coming from employees. That makes a lot of efforts/new things fail, like their securities business or other efforts in fixed income. No respect for people, it is just a replaceable commodity.

Management practices that are common elsewhere are not implemented at Citadel. It feels like a tiny software shop has suddenly grown large all of a sudden, so there are no best practices that are implemented uniformly across the firm.
