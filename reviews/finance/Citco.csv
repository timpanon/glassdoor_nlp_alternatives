Month end is a perpetual fire drill and takes 3 weeks out of the month, during which you spend the largest chunk of your time giving status updates and getting blasted by emails or yelled at in Zoom meetings by people in other cities or on other continents.  Turnover is out of control. Zero-work life balance. I got called by my boss when I was putting my kids on the school bus in the morning, after six when I was taking out the trash, and after 9;00 PM when I was taking the dog out. You could be logged in 24/7 of you wanted to, the work NEVER ends."

Experienced staff were very knowledgeable and willing to assist when they had time.","Onboarding by an actual trainer doesn't happen until your second month. Never experienced something so illogical. Instead, overwhelmed staff trains you as best as they can, despite it not being their expertise.
Promised job shadowing, instead left to complete work with minimal supervision and need to beg to receive assistance.
Overtime requirements are unreasonable at times. Could work 16+ hours in one day and be told ""the work has to be done"".
Pay does not match the expectation of work load.

It could take you 5 years or more to be promoted to senior role and little to no chance of progression to managerial role after that because they limit promotions on vacancies only, even if the department is growing.

It makes me think that they apply a forced curve appraisal to their employees because only limited number of top employees can be recognized and anything less is disregarded.

Management limits the number of promoted employees. Even you have performed so well but some of your colleagues have performed only a little bit better you will not be recognized because they compare your performance against your top performing colleagues and disregard anything less. 

You will only have the chance to be promoted once there is a vacancy for a more senior role.

They put in lots of process to make promotions more fair, like monthly one on one with your manager. But these meetings does nothing. They never give me any constructive feedback even when I asked. Ultimately promotion is given to the person they favor. 
And they were starting to use time tracking system to monitor your every move which is humiliating.
The work gets repetitive after a while and there's not much room for growth.
All the overworking, repetitive work, low pay and no recognition really starts to affect my mental health after few years. Which explains the high turnover.

Benefits used to be top notch but that changed. Not much else to add. When it's not ""busy season"" there's a lot of free time.","More than I could list currently. Management is untouchable and is known to throw staff under the bus when things go wrong. Everything under senior management is grossly underpaid. We were told this was because you don't have to commute into the city. The low salaries are supposed to be made up by overtime during ""busy season"" working 70-80 hour weeks which typically ran from mid January until May and then depending on your client load could start back up in July. When working this much, overtime gets scrutinized and people were told to work the extra hours and not book them in an effort to not go over budget. Employees quit or get fired and are never replaced so teams are understaffed. This has led to more and more work being outsourced or being looked into. New offices opening overseas regularly. I wouldn't count on having positions in the states other than high level management in the near future. Upper management confirmed this theory on more than one occasion."

Reason: For a new hire, you will not start month end till probably the 2nd month. You will not need to suffer the long OT hours if you quit by the 3rd.","1) Pay raise are <200 a year. 
Management's reason: Hope this helps to curb inflation.

2) Bonus ranges from 0 to 1200 a year.
Management's reason: Your OT pay is your bonus. OT pay starts accumulating after you wrk 6 or 7 hours more in a week and resets every week.

3) Expect to work >1 hour after your end time everyday due to the inefficient structure in place.

4) No more 5 year appreciation Ipad

5) Expect to write long appraisals with no results. You will mostly get the average score no matter the amount of effort you contribute.
Reason: Your managers will not want to give a higher score as it requires more write up on their end and, they are usually swarmed due to the inefficient business structure in place.

6) Dinner allowance (If you get to go back to work), cut from 20 to 15 and you are only entitled if you work >2.5 hrs after your shift.

7) Expect to work till 3am every month end [ First 9 business day of the month]
Reason: Mostly due to waiting for other dept/ clients to reply their email and also, having to rework what you have done due to new updates.

8) HR is understaffed such that emails will only be replied a week later, hopefully.

9) No work life balance at all. Prepare to repeat the cycle of work, eat, sleep everyday. 

If you still choose to work here, just note that the company is in the process of moving their work offshore. The things you will learn in this job scope will be reduced to client service and maybe in the future, obsolete. This will not enhance your resume for future job searching.

Fulltime employment previously was 3K and 3.5K after 18 months. If you are on contract, make sure to ask for more than 3.5K. You might get it as the company urgently needs more head counts."

536,,Terrible!,2021-03-07,1.0,Investor Relations Analyst,They are constantly hiring and they offer good pay to attract you.,"POOR training structure. 
Management that does not actually care. 
Loads of discrimination and racism.
I was constantly anxious working here, my training was very poor and all over the place because my trainer was working (heavy workload) while training me. We were basically overloaded with work. Whenever I asked questions I was treated like a dummy. 
When I asked for my training structure, my manager had nothing to show me. I was basically shown stuff shabbily and based on work demands. It was not end to end like most good companies do for new hires. 

I got serious retaliation for talking to someone in management about the oppression that was going on in my team and the next week HR called me to dismiss me. Luckily I had my resignation ready as I was planning to exit anyway. 

I was racially profiled during my interview, sadly I found out after getting in. It was just a terrible and toxic place to work at. 

Please do your background checks before taking any offers they give. Many people left while I was there and I know people who are hoping to leave currently. 

Citco please do something about your training and treat people well. 

There are a few good ones in there tho, sadly I met with the bad eggs."

Fantastic people.

Good leadership even if the work is such that it’s under resourced.

Easy to communicate between groups and leadership.

Special projects and oversight is a blast and you definitely get your hands dirty on whatever you want if you’re driven ++","Very long hours depending on the department. Granted some can be related to a month end, but there’re instances where it’s months of being ground down, people will say “help is coming” usually not the case. Again, my experience may not be indicative for all.

Depending on your department, you can be sold on a project then have it shipped out to a low cost centre. This would give way to call into question the safety of ones place in the company.

Growth opportunities aren’t driven toward people with a proclivity toward the technical side, more toward the administrative group.

There are definitely underperforming individuals who drag teams back. Creates double work for those who are made to stay late and review.

Salaries lag the cost of living in the area, hard to reconcile (admin joke there) the price of an apartment close to work with the starting salaries."

some good colleagues for fun","1.) lots of reasonable OT but the VPs just rule out OT and try to remove any deserving employee on the same pretext.
2.) visible partiality to people the upper management knows or has good relations with although they sit on the chair non productively either gossiping on the phone or computers with all known colleagues. 
3.) senior staff having lots of ego and attitude that junior staff is always scared to ask any questions or they are looked and reported very much negatively which rules out any scope of learning. 
4.) lots of visible office politics, if you want to succeed here you should be good looking and shouting, because polite and good listeners are often asked to leave the company by senior management or are threatened to face the consequences.
5.) tuition reimbursement for cfa or cpa is a joke : you need to stay and satisfy certain years of employment if Tution fees are reimbursed.
6.) unhealthy OT environment. people are reasonably working but are unreasonably compensated. and if there is ot (OVERTIME) then the VPs catch managers and managers catch the down line throat and keep getting angry. first of all managers, vps, supers, seniors op analyst, please watch your mouth and stop getting irritated , as you have to answer our questions as our time is more important than yours and we care more about not doing OT but this line of business requires this and your bonuses is the least needed here.
6.) really angry seniors, only God knows why are they seniors .they actually don't respect anyone, don't know how to pass on knowledge to juniors and expect them to work fast. well fast work is necessary but that does not mean getting one frustrated. 7.) SLA thing is such a mean system that gets very absurd and so not doable. 
TIP: if you get to work for an aggressive client, trust me , get out of CFS or don't make any mistake and do everything on time, otherwise the client and the upper management will make sure to make your life so miserable that you may stop breathing naturally for a long time.
8.) this would clearly be the last company in the world which I would be applying to, please look for other options immediately and do not do the mistake of waiting for some years experience before applying elsewhere.
9.) hedge fund industry is not teaching you anything , look for some better industry (totally lost faith by how things work here) they will only teach one thing the word : Fast please.
10.) really worst upper management , not motivating only dominating
11.) really so much more, just want to leave this as is now, heartbroken but very true to the reality."

For the people who do stay, you are completely at the mercy of senior management's whims. I was reorganized to report to a new supervisor without being told--I don't mean I wasn't told prior; I mean wasn't told weeks after-the-fact until I noticed a new org chart. I had headcount included in my budget only to be told (and this was after I had interviewed several people) that my supervisor had used up that headcount to hire someone he worked with previously who was looking for work. The supervisor invented a new position for that person and never told me he had used up headcount in my budget to do so.

This is, by leaps and bounds, the biggest boys club I've ever seen. Managers would talk openly about female employees' and their looks, stare at women as they walked by, and categorize female employees into one of two categories: good looking but not good at their jobs, or not good looking but good at their jobs. Once a senior manager sent an internal email to the entire office that include a joke about a specific employee watching porn.

The hierarchy here isn't just rigid, it's practically religious. Someone with a higher job title could assign you tasks and you were expected to perform them simply because if their position on the org chart--it didn't matter if you didn't report to this person or even if he was in an entirely different org. In order to save cost, the main office was in Jersey City, but if you were senior management, you sat in an office in Midtown. So management literally sat in a different city from the people who reported to them."

Manager have their own mind set to stay late night in office will get them promoted for which they force employees to stay back late with them.
The employees who works with dedication will be given more work and the employees who got errors from clients are with no work loads take one work and sit on that whole day.
And hence no proper backup are created and dedicated employees has to suffer everytime.
They were not allowed to take proper leaves, thier leaves get cancelled everytime. And manager will decide when you have to take leaves NOT by your will.

Yes there is beer in the fridge and in some offices, soda and snacks. 
For the most part the offices operate a clean, safe and professional working environment.
Company has now begun to do staff surveys and apply suggestions.
Company makes attempts at work-life balance via various offerings.  e.g,
Remote working, Part-time employment, etc.","There is an undertone of bias.  You have to network with the right managers to get ahead (this is from observation not personal experience) - I'm not trying to climb the ladder.
Company changes (with globalisation) is causing the company to operate in silos.  With their very specialised groups it's harder to get a sense of accomplishment.
The company invests more in technology that their employees.
They have a hyper approach to risk management to the point if one person makes a mistake it could change company policy for the entire organisation, so processes and procedures are hard to keep up with and keep straight.
Due to the growth in the company employees are becoming more like a number than a person.  Some teams are managed remotely - which loses much of the personal touch.   
Performance management is regularly over shadowed by the appraisal process vs actual attempts at improving staff abilities and skills.   For instance, their attempt to keep up with the trends has lead to the appraisal process changing every other year more recently to a bell curve model where employees don't get graded on their abilities but are measured against their colleagues.  Training is generally via e-learning and with a knowledge test at the end of each one, staff are more focused on passing the test than learning the content.   
While most managers are pleasant some have God complexes and create a hostile environment, which drive high turnover rates, but the issue is overlooked.
HR is often understaffed to the point they are so focused on task related issues (admin) than being able to see and address toxic issues.
There can be a sink or swim mentality to the training culture.  I.e. there is an expectation that everyone will be a self started and will grasp a concept the first time.  To a degree if a person doesn't they fend for themselves and are assesses based on that performance.
Advancement opportunities are location dependant.  Smaller offices often get lost in the shuffle.
There is little opportunity to influence change, so if you are an engaged employee you may not get a sense of your worth."

As a result, complaining to the big boss is pointless. Reaching out to HR for improvement or complaint about your manager, good luck because they take the managers side at all times.

4) There is groupism between SVP's and VP's and the subordinates are left alone to deal with their own problems
5) Hostile to new ideas and the Super Managers (EVP and above) do not interact with anyone even if they its only to self promote or to cut down on somebody's genuine issues and make them feel embarassed
6) HR guys do not have real authority, the only department which can set things straight needs to be given more autonomy
7) Each time you try to reason out with Management Team they have standard response that we are in a migration phase, it seems weird because it appears from their approach that Migration for them is just creating chaos
8) Haphazard Migrations with no clearly defined SLA's, Risk Coverage. Its an utter surprise that their majority of client do not know that work is done out of India, leaves with a big question mark on Integrity.
9) No clarity on SLA's and no information to client has made the situation worse as people have to sit late at night just waiting for sign offs from dependent teams in USA or Canada(who either do it deliberately or are genuine) and then close the fund and get it reviewed from onshore and then leave. So if a person has logged in at 3 pm they dont know if they will leave at 6 or 7 am the next day

The system is outdated and the company refuses to invest in figuring out solutions to easy problems.  Often tasks that any other company has automated will have to be done manually here.

1109,,A tale of two companies,2018-11-25,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"Location. Free breakfast, coffee & some social events","Double standards everywhere. Penny pinching mentality for lower staff while shameless extravagance of senior staff is obvious. The travel policy summarises how some people are more important than others, if you can work out what level you are. In most areas there are clear days every month that you can't take off. But you see directors and senior managers running out early in these same times.
Many people are employed based on a story of ""management"" roles and great opportunities. Nobody is allowed do anything and this becomes very frustrating. Staff with longer service seem happier. New people are put down because they ""don't understand the Citco way"". Huge turnover of staff causing a real problem and remaining staff being expected to work longer to fill the gaps. Toxic management styles mean that appalling treatment of staff is normalised.  Huge fears as work is being migrated to Manila, Vilnius, Munbai and there are plans for another site in India. Stupid performance management process that goes on over 6 months is totally meaningless and results in paltry or no increase or bonus. HR is probably even more dysfuntional than any other department as trying to hire staff requires several of the sub departments of HR to get involved. Apparently there's a HR strategy for Glassdoor to try and make it sound better. Recent announcements that it is a great place to work don't reflect my experience. A lot of my colleauges would agree. Limited opportunities for promotion due to new policy. Morale is poor."

The problem with Citco's structure is that so many people are getting way overpaid for the amount of their skill set and/or contribution to their department. This creates a low morale for employees and at the same time help bring down what was once a good company. This is one of the reasons why Citco has been sending jobs offshore and shutting down offices. 
Management will lie, sleep, surf the internet (almost the entire day) and still act as if they are busy. It is easy to see this as you can go to any department and experience it first hand. HR is just an extension of management and are really not their to help. Anyone that is left working at Citco will throw anyone under the bus to save their high paying comfortable job. Citco is one of the most un-professional company I have ever worked for. Citco pretends to be a fund but in reality, they are not and people working at Citco has so much downtime that they are not motivated to work harder as that is the whole culture of the company.

Cereal, fruit, soft drinks and beers are provided
Free travel card for more junior staff and a car allowance for senior managers","The Bad;

No Wi-Fi, numerous websites blocked, inclusive of Glassdoor.!

The family atmosphere is no more, it's quite sad to see the way things have gone over the last 2 years especially considering it's a family run business.

The CFO is the driver of the new model, it all comes down to numbers at the end of the day, there is no negotiations or family face to the business anymore. 

Shared Service Centres - it was mentioned before on Glassdoor about the ""Thrilla in Manila"" and that review proved to be true. A lot of work is being migrated to Vilnius and watch this space, India is currently in the works.

Senior Management cannot make big decisions, if you want X or Y, it has to be approved by the EC. The responsibility has been taken away from local MD's.

Overtime at month end can be quite bad however this is in other organisations too. 

If you fancy working 24 - 26 hour days straight, join Private Equity - this is just accepted and swept under the carpet.

Salary - increments to junior staff are appalling, budgets to allocate teams were embarrassing.

If you have 10+ years in Citco you're in a good place with your salary, so sit tight when it's been decided you're no longer needed, you'll walk away with nice cheque.

Free beer after 5 (keep in mind how much this worth unless you enjoy drinking 5 bottles everyday) 
Nice working environment (depends on teams). 
Dental and health insurance are good, but just similar to other companies.","Incredible turnover, in the first had year of 2017 almost 100 new people were hired. That means 100 people left! What does that mean? Why? Given the fact, think about it. 
Repeated work everyday, but what you are doing is actually useless. 
Inefficient promotion- if you stay 2-3 years as Operations Analyst, you get promoted I promise. No matter how bad you are. They need to do this to keep people. 
However if you only stay 1 or 1.5 year, no matter how smart or how good you are, do not expect any promotions. Because there are people have been here 2 yrs ahead of you. Even though you are doing much well than others. 
Too much back and forth internal, the biggest thing I have learnt here is how to push responsible to other office, and how to convince other office: hey this is your responsibility I won't do this, you need to do this. 
As there are too many offices around the world, you are only doing a tiny part of the work. You don't know what is happening, you don't know why it happened, you just sit there and do the standard procedures, without understanding the world. 
Everybody I know here is looking for another opportunities. Fortunately I got a new job somewhere else, ironically, most of my competitors were from Citco. This is the FACT. There are many people have master degree, most of them quit after 1-2 yrs or so. They are just hire new graduates to do the repeated job, you leave? No body cares - you are replaceable many new hues are waiting out of the door. 
If you want a job, if you want feed yourself, stay here. It's just a job, not a career. Do get some experience here, and run away. 
Given the fact that citco is a good place to gain experience for new graduates, I gave 2 stars. You need some experiences anyway.

2. You do gain an understanding of how certain financial instruments work, which could serve you well if you either choose to grow at Citco, or move on to do something else in finance or accounting. 
3.  Very friendly work environment, at least in my experience of being with the company for 3-4 years. I've worked on a couple of different teams, and it's always been a culture of ""take work seriously, but not yourself too seriously"". 
4. It's a diverse and younger office, so you'll get the opportunity to work with people from all over the world, and fellow 20 somethings. 
5. There is opportunity for quick advancement, depending on your circumstances.
6. The Christmas party is always a legendary event!
7. Overall, from my experience, it's not a bad job for your first job out of university, if you are just looking to gain some easy experience early in your career.","1. Inconsistency between teams on overtime. Some teams work a minimal amount, while others are having an awful time. I do understand though that the nature of some clients makes this hard to balance. This could be due to size of clients, skill of teams, client responsiveness to queries, among many things. 
2. I do feel like pay could be a bit higher, but if it keeps the outsourcing wolves at bay, whatever, I'll take that trade off at this point in my career. It also might help to outline more often the benefits we have as well.   
3. Other teams that you have to deal with for various clients from other offices will likely drive you nuts, and may very well be responsible for late days of overtime or late work. 
4. A lot of what I listed as ""pros"" are completely dependent on what team you end up on. I have been very lucky, but if you have a mediocre or poor manager, then you obviously may have a rough time. 
5. Tasks can be a bit repetitive, and some of them feel either redundant, or the reason we do them isn't properly communicated. 
6. I think ensuring people are ready to be people leaders before being promoted is essential, and I think this gets missed sometimes. Technical skill is great, but it doesn't make you a leader. Some people just plain don't have that ability, and that's ok, if they are in the appropriate role. 
7. If you are a bit older/have family commitments, and are looking at a more entry level position such as an operations analyst, it might not be the right culture for you at this point in time."

-Work like robots for ever. (Need to be extremely talented to make time for process advancements)
-Loss of prime working hours on many daily wasteful processes. ( none in higher management are men enough to make changes in SLA or dumb enough to make an understanding of repetitive daily corrective job due to internal offices, support teams or clients)
-Hours and resources wasted on developing Manila recon team. 1. Manila failed (outcome of knowledge gap, decision making ability) 2. Halifax failed to make a complete transition.
-Halifax teams are overloaded with 1.incomplete product from Manila 2. As a part of big plan, Halifax office getting more work 3. Repetitive jobs due to internal corrections
-As middle management is facing pressure from the top due to unacceptable over time and reduced quality of work, Managers to please make frequent reshuffling of teams, roles, work stations bring a lot of confusion for analysts. 
-Attrition levels are always high, but management is ok with it. Possible reason being costs are on check as seniors give way for lower income freshers.
-Greedy higher management takes more clients without Analysing the capacity or availability of tech teams to stream line work. But easily take blame for it.
-With best of my knowledge around 100 employees quit from Jan Including technical supervisors managers and seniors 
-All of the above resulting in motivating employees to get promoted and be part of high management who has the power. Visible political dramas at each levels to achieve this."

- Mentorship system for those trying to get their accounting designations; I never took advantage of this though.

- Convenient location by Bloor-Yonge Station

- Citco throws pretty dope parties.","- You will be shamed if you leave before 6:30. During my exit interview, I brought this up with the HR Rep and she fully agreed that this is an ongoing issue with Citco. You will have very little work-life balance. At one point because of custody issues, I was regularly working  65-80 hours a week. Our VP then told us that our hours would soon be shifting to a regular 37.5-45 hour work week but even when that happened, we would be talked to for leaving on time. Had an intern, I repeat, an intern, working 50-60 hours regularly. That is absolutely ridiculous. Also had a friend (she quit) whose Managers timed her lunch breaks to the minute.

- Ridiculous turnover. I have worked for various firms in the financial services industry and I have never seen such quick turnover. People burn out or get frustrated with senior management.

- VPs and Managers don't commit to the promises that they make. When you say you're going to do something for your team like provide them with additional help/training, commit to it. Otherwise, we get frustrated. I had an amazing Manager who quit because of how frustrated he was. Team morale quickly went downhill.

- Expect to get blamed/shamed when you don't know how to do something or even when you ask for help. You WILL get blamed for something that's out of your control frequently. It happened to me. It happened to my teammates. And it certainly happened to many individuals on my floor.

- Below average pay compared to the industry but it's balanced by the benefits."

Decent Benefits","I want to start off by saying I was a good employee there. I worked crazy hours and received good reviews and promotions. My reason for leaving was the terrible work environment created there rather than the work itself. 

It doesn't matter how smart or efficient you are, if you are not happy to do a huge amount of overtime you will not get promoted. They reward the people who stay until midnight. They refer to the busy times as ""month end"" which is supposed to occur during the first few days of the month, however for some teams this can last for 2-3 weeks. 

The turnover is unlike anything I have ever seen before. People quitting without having a new job and openly saying they would leave for a job paying less money. Every person I speak to who is still there is actively looking for a new job. 

Senior mgt often makes promises to reduce overtime. However as soon as they do they take on more work without hiring the staff first, putting the employees back in the position of being overworked again. I went through this cycle a few times when I was there so learned that they had no intention of lowering the workload. 

They don't give references other than to confirm dates employed. You need to get someone who has left the company to give you a reference or hope that your manager will give you one anyway."

No clear path for upward promotion and very little to learn at Citco in FSR. You are another warm body in a seat churning out as much work as possible - you are essentially a glorified administrative assistant in FSR where you look at spreadsheets and process changes until your eyes begin to glaze over. Very poor culture stemming from management being very far removed from plebeian low level workers. Also awkward dynamic of hiring usually poor performing temps to hire and also former Big 4 employees at the same time. No camaraderie whatsoever. Extremely high turnover that management does absolutely nothing about - it's sad when a small company such as Citco has higher turnover than a big 4. Also because of the high turnover I am pretty sure they give offers to 98% of the people that show up to interview.

1356,,Very bad company,2017-04-12,1.0,,Free drinks. Good for your first real job out of school or your co-op.,"Most of the people working here are highly illiterate. They people who work here have degrees just because they were able to essentially “buy” one. Only a handful of people are actually smart. Barely any of them have any intention of enrolling in a professional program (CFA, CPA etc) and improve their skills or become competent in general. 

While diversity is encouraged, most of the people (including managers of different ethnic groups) have a hard time communicating in English and this makes it very difficult if not impossible to understand them. If your boss is not a fluent in English or a native English speaker, good luck working here.

People who work here are mostly rejects of good companies. All the good candidates are either hired by an accounting firm or by other large well known multinational institution sooner or later. So, it is the “leftovers” who end up joining, working and staying here.  

The company lied to me about my job description. Most of the work I perform are highly irrelevant with my job description. If you point it out, supervisors and managers will bring it up during performance evaluation and either fire you by bringing up other topics, or keep you in the same position. 

Working overtime throughout the year is the norm. Your boss will bombard you with questions if you dare to take time off no matter how bad your situation is.  

The workplace culture is severely toxic and getting promoted depends on both your and your supervisors/managers ethnic background. Be very aware of your coworkers and your boss as they would love to throw you under the bus anytime.

To the people who are desperate for work, plan to work here for a year or two or less. The more time you will spend here after a year, the deeper you will fall in a trap. Do not believe you will get promoted or get a raise. It will certainly never happen. You will do a lot better working somewhere else. While working here, apply for as many jobs as you possibly can in different companies. You will soon realize that working at fast food isn’t as bad as you may think if you compare working in this company. 

The firm is very unprofessional and has a very dark future in my opinion."

The inability for upper management to act on the painfully obvious issues that plague this office is the reason why turnover rates have been uncontrollable as of late.  There is absolutely no retention policy in place as Citco ultimately plans on shifting operations overseas where the labour is cheaper.  Citco has already shut down a whole department at the Toronto office in 2016 and moved its operations over to an Asian country in the western pacific.

I made a good friend or two.

Stocked up on free juices and pop.

Nice private washrooms. 

Learned how not to act as a manager.","Where do I start ? First off had no real training from my manager. Basically learned everything on my own. My team was extremely short staffed (obviously everyone wanted to leave) the manager I had was rude, he didn't know what he was doing. This manager would tell me one thing and then go back on what he said when he realized that he was doing things wrong. 

The work is highly repetitive.

Manager lacked communication skills.

The hours were extremely long, and not worth it.

NO WORK/LIFE BALANCE !!! 

I love a challenge and I do well under stress but this was something else the stress was unnecessary.

Most days I would leave at 7pm be too tired and drained, due to dealing with Unclear demands from my manager, to even enjoy spending time with my family and go to the gym. Sure they give you high hopes when you get hired making you think that they want you to have a nice balance between work and personal life but they don't even give you time to enjoy your personal life. You may get your gym membership covered but you won't be able to use it unless you want to compromise sleep. Lack of sleep is greater risk of mistakes and everyone knows that when you make even one mistake even if your work is mistake free 99% of the time they will right away come down hard on you for it. 

Managers do not show leadership they only ""guide"" you when you make a mistake and I really wouldn't call it guiding since they only give you sh*t for making that one tiny mistake. they never give you recognition for having mistake free work 99% of the time. We're humans not computers mistakes can happen that's why managers are supposed to then look over our work and SHOW us how to ensure perfection every time."

-Good benefits and pension plan
-Free drinks and renovated office
-Legendary company parties
For new grads: simple, get this job if you can't find anything else. Get a designation, get a promotion, move on to another employer
For professionals: it's not a place for true professionals - find something somewhere else","-Boy where do I begin (in no particular order)
-Repetitive work: it's fine if managers make an effort to create job rotation opportunities, but they don't
-Little recognition from management for your hard work: they take excellence as granted, but will slam you when you make a mistake. It's the office culture here.
-Chaotic management style: ask any line manager how many clients have come and go through the team, and is there ample handover and notice for client move?
-Politics: Promotions are earned based on your affinity with your boss, not your performance
-Lack of performance measurement: It's an open secret on the floor that we all take the annual performance appraisal process as a joke. Why? because they are not linked to your actual performance. It goes like this: I like you and I want to promote you. Therefore, you get 4 out of 5 on your scores so that there is 'proof' that you are ready for promotion!
-Lack of comradeship from senior management: VP's roll into the office at 10 at leave at 6, on time, even during the busiest periods of the months, when people starting at 7 work until midnight
-Jobs are being shipped to the new Asian office, uncertain future
-People who stay at Citco are those who don't have a designation and can't really land a decent job anywhere else: alright, not everyone is like that. We have quite a few great people. But there are too many less than qualified employees
-No communication from senior management: if there is good news, you will hear about it! bad or mixed news? Never heard of! Because the company is perfect right?
-No commitment to people development: How many times has Citco updated its systems over the past year? And how many times has it updated employee development plan and performance measurement criteria since the beginning of time? Anyone?
-As many others have pointed out, the culture at Halifax office is toxic long hours: note the difference between hard working and long hours."

1415,,Not for True Financial Professionals,2016-11-22,2.0,Manager,Good opportunity to gain experience in the industry,"For Manager level pay is less than acceptable when overtime is considered. Middle Office department is poorly managed (appeared at my level that senior management- SVPs-were very disorganized and we're not really capable or had not had proper prior experience in managing this type of work). Also as noted many times on other reviews here promotions (specifically in my experience with MGR and VP level) are based on doing more / extra work and an individuals technical capability not actual ability to actually lead people, motivate people and be financial professionals in management roles. It is also very hard to develop staff and motivate staff when it is very evident the office is downsizing. Especially when there is lack of leadership and very unclear communication from SVPs. Again it feels that they are a bit out of their league and in over their head. Again at the MGR /VP level very junior, green people being promoted causing lack of leadership. I understand whomever is on this site as a responder on behalf of Citco will likely respond with some sort of canned justification for what I have said here but I think it is pretty evident to everyone that the Halifax office is a sinking ship. I was there for three years.... left in the spring and was proud of the work I did building my team and had very little turnover- since I left many of my team members have quit and they have been through three Managers over a 6 month period."

IT audit can help them resolve this  problem.,"- Record Management is serious concern in Real Estate fund accounting department. They don't properly save records or attach files in Yardi System. Lot of entries don't have proper backup. This problem become even worse because they have quick layoff problem, so in most cases they just either don't find records because person who did the actual entry is not there anymore(in some instances) or spend enormous amount of time in looking for records, which cost money to investors.
- Repetitive work that don't add any value to investor reporting material or financial statements. 
- Lead Manager is not CPA or Have Masters degree, they are simply not aware about real estate standards and are working by hearing ""word of mouth"". 
- There ""to do list"" is more 4 page long (roughly 200 rows in excel). Its because senior manager don't want to take initiative in resolving problems. I guess its maybe because they don't have experienced managers or lot of clients, or not enough staff.  
- HR is not independent. They don't want to hear about problems or advise about internal controls. If you do that then they will let you go. Its because IT audits can reveal negative discussions at some point, so they layoff before further discussions.  
- No Ethics committee. If you ask HR to give you their number or website information then they will say that they don't have one. So, unbelievable."

- No opportunities to advance, change departments or roles

- Citco is not interested in retaining talent, so when experienced employees end up leaving the few remaining knowledgeable employees are burdened with more work (of course, without an increase in salary). The employees who “play dumb” are not expected to learn more to cover the loss of manpower. 

- There are managers/VPs who have superiority complexes and consider anyone who isn’t a manager/VP or fund accountant as beneath them. They are not as important to the company as they believe they are (as I’ve seen many top level managers get the axe over the past year), so who knows why they think that they can walk all over people… This attitude extends to interdepartmental politics, as traders and accountants view custody as indentured servants.

- Cliquey environment especially among the large number of Asian employees who do not believe they have to listen to anyone who isn’t White or Asian (unless they need something from you, then they temporarily become your best friend). 

- You will NOT get recognition for your hard work. You can work like crazy for months and get as many “Thank yous” along the way, but come review time, your manager will nitpick your work ethic (sometimes, they make it personal… was once told that how I did something was “annoying”) like you wouldn’t believe."

Casual Dress
Good Christmas party","They will tell you it is a 37.5-hour workweek in the interview with the need for ""a bit"" of overtime at month end. This is not true for most people. Some people have hit 90 hours per WEEK and have to come in on the weekends. At the very least you are expected to do 5 hours of overtime per week- and then you are likely going to be given more work to do if that is all you are doing. A good bet is to count on working somewhere between 20-50% extra in OT per month. 

Supervisor level and above do not get paid for their overtime- so you better drink a lot of beer to make up for the extra hours you work for free. There will be a lot of them. If they tell you in the interview there won't be I would ask for an agreement where you will get paid for your OT over a certain amount. They will not give it to you- but this will show you their true intentions. 

They have recently decided to cut back on their sick leave policy so they can start deducting vacation days or pay after 3 sick days, even if you have been working 60 hours a week for them due to being short staffed. So you could work 4 months of unpaid OT in a year for them and they reserve the right to start docking you pay after 3 sick days. 

In order to be promoted you have to first do the job without the title or pay for long periods of time. There have been cases where people have been a Supervisor, managing a team without a manager for a year before the company recognizes them with the actual promotion. Makes moving up difficult. They tend to dangle the carrot of quick promotions at the time of the interview and then delay things once you are in the door. 

I have heard rumours that the official policy is to not provide references other than confirm dates employed. Have not confirmed this with HR as I do not want them to know I am looking. However if this is true it can make getting a new job difficult if it requires a reference from a current employer. 

Not accommodating to those who have children. People have been told to make other arrangements for evening childcare on a regular basis to work the required overtime (unpaid)

They are moving a lot of work to the office in the Philippines. At this point they have 6 floors in the building- however only 5 are leased long term and people are working out of meeting rooms due to over crowding. You have to assume that if they have not signed on to rent the extra floor long term they plan on cutting back on staff with the Philippine office taking on the extra work. They are also not replacing managers and supervisors in their middle office department when they leave- again suggesting they are expecting the demand for them to be falling in the future.

Generally a chaotic work environment- Seems like Senior Management are constantly changing their minds about work allocations and policies. Teams are rarely able to settle into a routine. 

Overall it is not a good environment to work in if you are not able to commit your life to them or if you are senior level staff. If you like your current place of work do not leave for this one- it will most likely be worse."

-free beer (after 5pm), coffee, tea, soda, and monthly breakfast, monthly Cake and ice cream to celebrate birthdays of the month, pizza lunches when working on Canadian holidays (Citco takes american holidays off)
-if you don't want to stay in fund accounting, can be a good stepping stone to get experience applicable to apply for a hedge fund, private equity, or investment bank (which pay fund accountants more). Can learn many aspects of hedge funds (accounting, pricing, trade strategies, tax implications, corporate actions, different financial instruments, And more if you can move around teams and reach out to right people in yours) (seen a few people take this route)
-hours are okay if you are in a good team with a fund that doesn't have insane reporting requirements (9-5:30, a bit later during month end time)","-seems to be high turnover here for one of two reasons; some teams here have funds which have very strict reporting deadlines meaning employees stay here late during month end (often 8-11pm worst case for very few funds even later) and non month end time may stay late. Keep fingers crossed you dont get put into one of those teams. Other reason maybe because some people see fund accounting as very niche form of accounting and since not as much exposure to full cycle accounting, after a few years experience may seem to be not as transferrable as some other roles outside of this industry. So maybe for younger people who dont want to stay in fund accounting should consider leaving in the earlier years of role (around 2 year mark).
-not a certified CPA training office (though they are working on that) (so they dont expense training materials and capstone modules it seems). Also since not a certified training office could be hard to get time off to study for some exams if it conflicts with month end. Though if you have a good team they will try to accommodate."

I've worked for a few various large companies and Citco is the most disfunctional, mismanaged and toxic place to work.  

They expect you to not have a personal life and work ridiculously long hours. I worked anywhere from 50 hours per week minimum to over 65 hours per week.  Some teams work even longer hours.   And this has nothing to do with tax season or end of year activity.   Since management does nothing to retain talent the office is one big revolving door.   In my first month of working there out of my team of 9 individuals 3 quit.   I was told this is normal but the red flags kept going up all around me. 

It's true they have a fridge stocked full of pop and beer after 5pm but that's only used to keep the employees numb to the reality they are working in.  

Management is the most inept group of people on the planet.   Most have no people skills and are drones reporting to their Dutch masters.   Newly promoted managers are not trained at all to deal with HR issues and how to properly manage employees. 

There are many Irish émigrés in management who are harsh and don't care about the employees.  If you don't mind being blamed for problems that are not your fault then Citco is the place for you.  I was hired knowing that I had no previous hedge fund experience but on the last day of my 6 month probation was told that I wasn't a good fit because of my lack of knowledge.   Even the HR person couldn't believe management was letting me go.   Don't waste your time or delay your career by working here.   You will be miserable in no time and regretting that you ever signed their offer letter."

This leads to the need to carry out projects and initiatives in order to adapt and to gain efficiencies.

Free beer to distract you from the fact that you're still at work at 8pm. Some good learning experiences in workshops. You will spend your time on proprietary softwares that you'll never need to use again.,"This company takes advantage of young and inexperienced staff by allowing zero opportunity to negotiate your own employment terms or salary. it is not open for discussion during the course of employment and you'll never talk to someone with any power. Your own manager will openly complain about their job/salary. Several very unprofessional managers, zero work-life balance good luck making plans during the week. No appreciation or recognition for hard work. I think I was told 'thank you' twice in 2.5 years and I had a few 70 hour work weeks making 33k. You are only paid overtime after 44 hours and will regularly work that many hours if not more. The Director openly embraces high turnover (which is extremely hard on the teams) because it means they are paying a comparably low salary versus competitors which is good for the bottom line. They literally said this in a meeting with ground level staff which was horrifying. It is almost impossible to live on a 30,000 salary many employees have to live at home with their parents.

Depending on which group you're in, it can be difficult to work with the supervisors or managers..either mean or unprofessional. Some never learn the meaning of ""respect"". They blame on your work if there are errors while neglecting they have some lousy part in doing the reviews. Almost impossible to move to other departments or groups. 

There is no work life balance. They expect you to over time. If you dont, it will reflect negative in your performance review that you dont make effort. It was a gruesome long hours and adding the last incident where they wiped the whole department and dumped the jobs to all senior/fund accountants. Workload kept increasing and they demanded you to take more responsibilities (force you to sign secondment) but nothing reflected on your compensation. 

Work hard for the company and received only 1000 bonus by end of the year despite all the long hours spent and received praised emails from internal and external clients. Manager tampered with your performance review to make sure you didnt get a good raise despite all the proven emails AGAIN from internal and external clients praising your excellent job! Manager only gave ""good"" performance (rating 3). Rating 1-5 with 1 is poor 5 is excellent. When question why the answer was like that he said he never gave more than 3. 

Politics here is pretty thick not very obvious unless you have been a while with the company. If you close to certain top people you can get promoted so it's not really based on your performance. Here maybe the reason for poor spv/mgr. 

Recent trend: BEWARE Citco is CUTTING cost everywhere. They wiped 2 departments and you can see here and there lacking. They get rid of long time employees and replace them with newer cheaper less knowledgeable employees. While I understand the strategy, it's really DIRTY how they do this. They basically questioning those employees about their work and told them they have performance issues. Yeah right after 5-7 years of work. Force them to silently quit with lots of unnecessary pressures. If you persevere and finally fired, they force you to sign a letter that basically you cant sue them. Why dont they just give a compensation package if they want them to leave rather than unpleasant doings. Disgusting!"

Irish immigrants are automatically locked in for 2 years which is good because most people quit or get fired after 6 months. I've seen people start monday morning and quit monday afternoon. One guy went for lunch and never came back. The list goes on.  I've been here for over 4 years and I only recognize maybe 15 people, everyone else is gone. 

Town Hall meetings share information about company growth and why working at Citco is the best but they never dig deep and address employee concerns."

Good people are guaranteed to leave, and this is a place where mediocrity thrives. Can't learn much from senior management, as they lack many essential skills themselves.  Work environment resembles that of a frat house. Employees often inebriated after 5, and continue to work with management turning their heads.  Do not support professional development, as you are likely to leave so investment in staff is a waste."

Up until maybe 6 months ago, the company had a notorious reputation for long, long hours but a large majority has seen significant decrease in overtime.  I can count on leaving on time at least 3 times a week with a good chance of more.  This might seem weird to note but that was unheard of in the 12 months prior to the change.  There's a really high turnover in one of the largest departments of the company, which means there are an awful lot of newbs floating around.
