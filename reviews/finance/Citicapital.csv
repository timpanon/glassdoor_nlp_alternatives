3,,Ehhh,2022-04-12,2.0,Head Concierge Banker,"Only giving it 2 stars because the team I worked with was amazing. Good benefits and paid time off. If you're lucky enough to have a good team in upper management then you're all set, but. I was one of the unfortunate.","Not sure if it was just the particular area I worked under but no upper management wanted to take ownership of policies that caused issues with customers. NO support offered if understaffed which was often because turnover rate was like 90%. Just because we were CONSTANTLY understaffed didn't mean we got more help or guidance even without a manager. A lot of it you have to figure out on your own which is fine but then upper management would still have the same expectations like if we were a fully staffed branch which was EXTREMELY stressful. I would say if your work here, do not take any lead roles. As a regular teller it is so much better. Albeit, it could've just been my area (Greater LA Area). Managers have so much on their plate, they're constantly stressed, no accountability for verbal instructions. eg. If upper management would express that certain things needed to be done, if anything went wrong they would say that if it's not on ""The Source"" then it shouldn't have been done; which is complete bollocks. Honestly, just look out for yourself. I've never been happier to leave a job. Not worth the immense stress. Lastly, they expect employees to perform duties outside of their job function with absolutely no compensation."
