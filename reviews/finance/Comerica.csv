363,,Mid-Tier Bank with Identity Crisis - Spinning in Circles,2019-11-19,1.0,"Senior Relationship Manager, Vice President","401(k) Match, Healthcare included Kaiser","By now, most Middle Market and Business Bankers in Southern California have either worked for Comerica at some point or know enough about them to stay away. This bank is stuck in the mud and when it tries to move, it just spins in circles. 

Comerica's (CMA) commercial banking credit risk appetite likes the types of low risk clients that the Big 4 commercial banks pursue and hold. The problem is that when Comerica gets an opportunity to compete for these C&I prospects with the Big 4, they are less competitive in all major areas important to a Middle Market prospect. Pricing (they are not competitive and lose to the Big 4), Structure (CMA credit people do not structure deals that are as fluid and streamlined to the client as competitors) and Turnaround time (The CMA RM has little support, Group Managers and Credit team take way too long relative get to a decision relative to the competition). The result over time? Lost deal after lost deal and a poor reputation to prospects and potential employees in the marketplace. Add to that a growing number of disgruntled ex-CMA bankers that have left and you have a bank that is growing nowhere in Southern California. 

As one of the last few regional banks that doesn't have a foreign parent (unlike MUFG Union Bank, RBC City National, BNP Paribas BOTW, etc.) it also appears that it doesn't have the desire or support it needs to invest the money in technology for its internal banking operations, commercial credit applications as well as its client interfacing platforms, etc. Thus, while the Big 4 and other Regional Banking competitors are improving and investing in streamlining technology to make things easier for clients and prospects, CMA seems stale. 

Finally, it seems that the trainees and cadets that are in the CMA training program are given better treatment and favorable perception than the experienced, seasoned, hired guns that the bank has brought in from the outside. Bizzaro world, my friends!

Stay away from this regional bank that is stuck in Neutral. The bank historically couldn't move fast enough or price deals reasonably enough to win the deals it wants. The end result is a bank that is not moving forward, just stuck in the past."

Can bid out in one year, however depending on your manager it may be difficult move on
Can purchase one week of PTO, but its 120% of your pay, deducted per pay period over the calendar year","Where do I begin, the list is long:

Extremely slow hiring process
Very difficult to bid out for a new position
High turnover 
Management hires same type of people, no diversity
PTO is combined (sick, vacation, and personal time all in one bank) go over it and you get written up
Management makes it where you can't leave if you're trying to transfer to another department
Nepotism is alive and well 
Not enough employee engagement
The core values are ignored on a daily basis
Work/life balance is non-exstient
Does not promote nor encourage continuing education
Management has a ""do as I say, not as I do"" policy
Hostile work environment=low morale
No concrete training for specific department, you just ""wing it""
No matter how well you do, you will not get above an average score on annual reviews
Scorecard goal scores are unrealistic 
Monthly one-on-one's are non-existent, so you don't know what you need to improve until interim/annual review
Manager ""manages"" team from different location
Management has poor communication skills
A lot of ""conflict of interest"" situations, and unethical behavior between management and employees
Lastly, if there is any type of grievance  against the family member or friend of management, don't even bother voicing your concerns, they will be ignored. The incident will somehow end up on your review implying you are the issue/problem and not them."

If you work here, don't plan on moving up unless you hear that many people will be retiring.

You are required to use a Comerica Bank account to receive your direct deposit or a horrible pay card that is littered with fees. Overdrafts and returned fees count negatively on you. Once you hit 5 total (any mix of categories) your debit card is cancelled without warning. Keep doing it and your employment can be terminated. Comerica processes debits before deposits, even on the same day. If you deposit a check (I worked a second job without direct deposit for a while there) only your first $200 is made available for use, I have waited up to 5 days for the checks to clear.

They offer great benefits, but don't jump on the stock option. Look at their stock history and you'll see why. As of October 2015, their stock is still within a $10 range of how it has moved over the past decade, but it used to be valued much higher. Even as much as a year ago, the stock was generally flatlining about $7 higher than it is now.

The entire company is decaying. They hire young kids right out of school in an attempt to revive the company, but the smart kids stay away or leave almost immediately. They use outdated software and make questionable loans. The lending centers are essentially portable buildings tacked onto the backs of branches. As a new hire, I was teaching a man 12 years my senior how to do basic accounting. There was always a ton of paperwork - loan packages would be upwards of 80 pages and no one would really read them. I spent most of my time there doodling in my day planner... and no one noticed. The pay and the people also suck."

I was informed recently that being I hired in part time I was most likely not eligible for a full time position.  I was floored as I was never informed of this ""policy"" when I hired in.  Basically they would probably hire someone off the street for a full time position rather than allowing part timers to have a chance for a full time position.  I was told that they would interview me for any full time positions but it would be unlikely that I would get an offer because of my part time status.  Really???  You spent all this time and money training me and I am not allowed to feel comfortable seeking full time work with you?  I actually love my job and love working at Comerica but this bit of news really set me back.  The initial training is great, however once you are on your own the sales aspect of it is hard to grasp if you don't have people willing to school you on it.  Its a kind of ""on your own""  concept, and you have to really pay attention and listen to your co workers to figure it out, especially if you have never been employed in the banking industry."

Two thumbs down."
874,,"If I could give 0 stars, I would",2015-02-27,1.0,Wealth Management,There are no absolutely no Pros,"This is the worst company to work for. Management does not support employees. Management actively bullies employees and allows lower level employees to bully each other. When there are no sales or a mistake, Management looks for scapegoats to point the finger at and openly criticizes the employee in front of other employees - basically tells everyone that they are incompetent. Management will also openly berate you in front of other employees.

If the management in the department and management does not like you for whatever reason, they will find a way to get rid of you. High turnover rate for employee dissatisfaction. If you complain to HR about the bullying you, HR will say, ""That sounds like you have a performance issue"" For every single person that I have known that has complained about upper management to HR, they always say ""You have a performance issue.""

The only way you won't lose your job is if you suck-up to any of upper management and the bankers. There is definitely favoritism. It's an every man for himself environment.

Collaboration between the different departments is easy. Compensation seems to be very fair, but nothing that goes above and beyond.","The retail banking department is simply too sales and goals oriented. Everyone at each branch is required to cold call customers to see if there is any other product that we can offer them. The company seemed to be much more customer service based in the past.

Finally starting to get onboard with updating some old legacy technologies so some interesting projects to work on.  Base pay is not horrible but it is generally below market.  Because things get done soooooo slowly in the organization, it is an easy place to just put in your 8 and go home.  It is not a place to get much professional satisfaction from, it is a good place to go to ride out your remaining years.","EXTREMELY myopic management.  It is hard to understand the rational behind decisions being made in the organization.  There is so much bureaucracy in the organization, it is nearly impossible to get things done.  60% of the people in the organization have been there for 20+ years so there is a very entrenched ""good ole boy"" network as well as a mentality of ""we've always done it this way"" that is almost insurmountable.   There are little to no real processes within the company, the process is mostly “go talk to that guy”.  Even in performance reviews one of the measurements is how well you use your informal network, basically, going outside of process to get things done.  There is a VERY distinct separation between management and everyone else and that is made abundantly clear in skip level meetings.  They use vendors for almost all technology implementations, company engineers are left to do little more than attend meetings and take notes.  There is no empowerment to change or make anything better."

When I have called on certain occasions the people who work in that department are usually rude and make you feel like you are disturbing them, even though its their job.

Always short-staffed, being the only CSR in a busy city branch and the personal bankers and management never want to come back and help; apparently it must be degrading to be behind the teller line, even when a load of customers are waiting and two drive-thru tubes and sitting there too. Technology sucks and is way outdated. The focus is too much on sales and hitting numbers just so the upper management can get their bonus. They pressure the teller to bring in the sales and referrals when I have loads of operational stuff to do that goes unnoticed and unappreciated because I can't cold call customers since we don't have time because no one helps! For the amount of work I do, I should AT LEAST be getting full-time benefits. The bankers and management are lazy and sit around gossiping while I run the entire bank.

There is an emphasis on sales, but the goals are very manageable.  For the most part, you can excel as long as you are motivated and consistent (as with a majority of sales positions).
Relative to other banks, base pay is also above average, however it is harder to increase your salary via commission.","It is too safe and stale of an organization for me.   As you work your way up in management you will begin to inherit many workers that have been in the same job for 20 years.  It is full of very nice people, however very mediocre professionally and can even be very immature.

Comerica ties performance reviews to sales goals, even for tellers. No incentive to make sales only punitive measures if an employee doesn't make their goals.
Company is very much an ""old boy's club"" with select employees given preferential treatment.
Human Resources department in Northern California very gossipy and it is not safe to report grievances to this department.
Headquarters in Texas and Detroit are out of touch with modern banking. No remote capture deposit capability; no card swipe for in bank transactions; no transferring between accounts unless it is with same SS#; mobile banking often inaccessible.

Great company to gain experience out of college. They hire bankers with no experience, which is rare for most banks.","No one gets promoted, they always hire from outside of the company. A few CSR employees I knew have been there for 12+ years and still haven't been promoted, yet all the BM and ABCMs call them all the time for help. The DM likes to micromanage, he's constantly down your neck wanting to get new DDAs, and ALWAYS contradicts himself.

Systems are terrible! It's embarrassing when it takes 3 min. just to get a customers balance. You have to go back and fourth between three or four different systems to get ANYTHING done. 

Loan department never knows what they're doing. If you call the loan department for an update or for a question about a loan, then everyone you talk to will give you a different answer. 

The training is terrible. All you learn is what to do/how to sell when a customer is in front of you. You don't learn anything about lending or how to work the systems. 

They have ""call nights"" where you have to try and sell a DDA or have a referral for wealth mgmt. Everytime I had to endure one I opened the bank at 7:15... the ""call night"" started around 5:30 or 6 PM, and you couldn't leave till you made a sale. Some employees had to stay at the bank from 7:15 AM to 7 PM on these days. Luckily for the short time I was there I only had to do two call nights.

Retail bank employees are completely overworked & under compensated.

984,,Overall good company with some drawbacks.,2013-09-12,3.0,Credit,Company has good culture for taking care of employees and has an excellent credit culture.  Opportunities are available for advancement.  They seem to do well in areas that they are good at and do not try to be the bank for every niche in the market.,"Technology is about 3 generations behind.  They will not spend a dollar for upgrades and instead will have people leave over this issue.  Many executives have been there for so long that they do not realize this and keep thinking that ""if it works, don't fix it"".  They have instituted overreaching goals trying to be a ""big bank"".  Turnover seems to be the result as with many banks."

Pay increases fail to even keep up with inflation despite strong annual reviews, woefully lackluster systems rolled out in perpetual motion even after ""pilot"" locations report major problems.  A hodgepodge of antiquated computer systems that every single employee-without exception-acknowledges are inferior-yet they continue to be relied upon and even expanded.  IT failures that would result in terminations at other companies are allowed to occur regularly and seemingly without repercussion.  An acceptance and embrace of the status quo that is leaving Comerica ill prepared for increasingly strong competition from peer banks.  Standards of service to customers that are woefully poor.  A corporate culture that says ""we always have and always will----fill in the blank"" which punishes innovation and embraces behaviors that may not be as efficient as today's available alternatives.  In short-imagine trying to jog over quick sand without falling in-and that is the feeling one gets from working at Comerica.  it is just plain difficult-each day every day all day."

You also must keep count of your phone calls, the items you file, and how many items you keyed in the system. You also must use your user id to use the photo copier!

Core Midwestern values are still quite evident in the corporate culture.  If you find the right person, they can be very helpful.","Company has underinvested in systems in recent years.  Training is not a strength of the corporation.  Not a sales culture.  Corporate lending still drives the organization's bottom line.  Holistic wealth management is an aspirational goal for most offices, not a reality.  Actions speak louder than words, and ""cutting our way to prosperity"" has been a running joke for several years."
1003,,24 years at Comerica,2013-01-10,4.0,IT Manager,"Comerica generally cares about their employees. The is resistance against outsourcing.  Working conditions and environments are good to excellent.  The company put a lot of focus and training into improving employee behaviors.

Very low employee turnover in IT.","Process improvement has been identified as a benefit so a lot of work has been done to improve processes.  However, we have processed ourselves to death in several areas.  Too many processes and controls when they aren't needed just to say the process has been changed with little real measurement of if the change was positive.  

Staff is aging in IT.  Many of the key resources are either already at retirement age or very close.  Key people have been retiring at an alarming rate as the economy has been improving.  industry pressure to do more with less staff have worked against bringing in replacement staff in time to get them trained and up to speed.  It also causes problems because some of the senior are twice as productive as junior staff that hasn't completely developed making a one to one replacement not equivalent.."

1006,,You can be what you want to be,2012-12-03,4.0,Vice President,Opportunity for advancement is only limited by your ability to look for it.,Limited openings sometimes if you want to stay in the came career track.
1007,,Personal Banker,2012-11-27,2.0,Personal Banker,Company is smaller so you get to know everyone. In addition very slow in a branch you might go the entire day without seeing a customer.,"There are a number of serious cons when working for Comerica. I will start by saying I worked in San Diego California and other places like Michigan where the company has the most branches are better. Turnover is extremely high it almost caused me not to except my job regrettably I did which turned out to be a mistake. The Technology is horrible and I have no other way to put it. It’s like taking a time machine back to the 80’s. For the employees and the customers it’s hard. In addition the region has no clear direction at one point it’s all about cross sells and checking accounts.  Another point it’s about DDA dollars. Sales goals change and they have no way of tracking because the technology is so bad. In fact everything takes so long to reflect in your sales you could really just make up numbers for 6 months it would take them that long to notice. In addition lending is impossible more conservative than most banks and I came from Wells Fargo which is known for being a conservative lender. The loan process is so disorganized you can’t give people timely updates.  Most of the time it’s a decline and the customer goes to any other bank where they can get approved. In a nut shell this is a company stuck in the past and unable to embrace the future if you’re from a major bank I recommend looking somewhere else. Everything that has to do with HR is outsourced so even the hiring process is lengthy, like everything else with this company it moves extremely slow took 3 months.  Job and bank turned out being so dysfunctional I left within 2 months and accepted another offer. Sadly I literally know about 4 people including managers that have been with Comerica more than 1 year the longest was 3 years. Again this is in San Diego which may be the most dysfunctional region."

Depending on your manager, you can do a lot of outside sales","If you don't like your manager/location you will not be able to change. Firing is usually their way of accommodating any problems. 
They used to be a good mid-size bank that felt like a small bank but management has all come from the big 3 (BofA, Compass, Wells) the love is gone and numbers is the game. be ready to feel like a used car salesman.
Even though they tell you that not having a college degree won't hold you back from moving up.... it will!!!!!"

Benefits are expensive but very good.  Higher than industry standard base pay.","Incentive plan is a complete joke.  What's worse is that upper management portrays it as if it's really great.  Basically, you can destroy all of your goals and get about 400-600 a quarter.  Systems are completely archaic.  You need about 10 different passwords and 3-4 systems to accomplish the most basic of tasks like telling a customer their balance and most recent transactions.  The entire focus is to get customers to put as much money as possible into a checking account.  This almost never makes sense for the customer and is therefore terrible advice to give as a banker.  But if you don't do it you will lose your job.  Bank partners are completely invisible, unavailable, unconnected and not incentivised to work with retail, but even if they do you will get basically nothing out of it."

1040,,Career purgatory,2012-03-07,2.0,,"The best reason to work at Comerica is actually a result of all the worst reasons to work at Comerica.  Namely, banker's hours.  They do exist here!  People can stroll in seemingly whenever they feel like it, take a hour or two lunch, and leave early.  Or alternatively, they can stay at the office all day hanging out in someone else's cubicle and not getting any real work done.","1. Culture of control and risk aversion.  Every negative situation has resulted in a new rule for the rulebook or new checkpoint that has been built into the system.  This has resulted in complete gridlock in the organization, not to mention a vertical org chart with more levels than you can imagine  Getting something done takes at least 3 levels of approval, but usually more.  Very frustrating for anyone who is a go-getter or has a creative spirit.  This is the slowest moving company I have ever been a part of, by a long shot.
2. Leadership in certain areas is non-existent.  The vision isn't ever something you would consider visionary.  The execution of the strategy is slow, burdensome, and inefficient.  And don't get me started on employee engagement.  Comerica has plenty of managers, some who know how to actually manage costs, customer service, etc.; but most don't know how to lead people.  This is largely due to #1, all the rules in the rulebook.  A bad manager can actually thrive in this environment because whenever a situation with an employee pops up, they can simply defer judgement to the rulebook.  Most managers aren't actively managing employees -- they let HR do that for them with the rulebook.  So they get used to this style of management, and thus there's now very little constructive feedbabck, employee engagement activity, or any other positive thing going on.  I could go into more detail but I'm not going to.  Finally, career mobility only exists in the lending areas of the bank."
