~Decent benefits (comprehensive health plans were very costly)
~Decent schedule (option to choose from 3 options if you rank high enough in your training class, which I did, so I cannot speak to the schedule satisfaction of those that weren't able to choose for themselves)
~No weekends or holidays 
~Friendly team leads
~Company provided equipment 
~100% remote job opportunities for those interested, and office opportunities in Louisville, KY for US based roles (headquarters are in Australia)
~Paid downtime if that downtime is not your fault (company servers/equipment issues are paid, your own internet going down is obviously not) 
~Fun company games and activities remotely","~Not much room for growth (raises/promotions are hard to come by regardless of what they promise)
~Low employee retention rates (which they lie about during interviews)
~Group interviews with 20+ candidates where you do not get to ask many questions or highlight your personal experience/skills
~PTO/sick leave come from the same bank, are slowly accrued and are essentially a joke overall
~Company equipment is absolute trash and will give you problems at every turn
~Drama within teams (did not involve me but was hard to ignore)
~Team chats with up to 20+ members via your personal cell phone that are always ongoing and cannot be ignored less you miss important info about downtime, schedule changes etc. and no other option like Slack, Teams etc. off the clock
~You must utilize your personal cell phone (via an app on the company computer) for all phone calls and this is an 8 hour a day, back to back phone call center position 
~No room for taking time off for things like being hospitalized, being sick for more than a day or two and you are forced to utilize your PTO for sick leave"

The colleagues are great, the company works with the latest and easy-to-use tools and platforms and if help is needed across any facets, someone is there to assist! 

Internal transfers and mobility is encouraged and supported across the business too.

The business is open to ideas and in parallel, feedback. They are always looking for ways to continuously improve whether it be process, experience etc. I can easily see why a lot of the employees tend to stay here for a very long time.

- Open to working from home","- Lower than market pay, impossible to get a raise, no pay progression once you start.
- Managers are out of touch. They ask for feedback but do not act on it.
- Massive issues with manager cover. Vicious cycle of not having managers available for questions, you then taking longer to complete the work, you then get reprimanded for not hitting target. If you raise this the standard response is “just ask a senior, they can help”. They can’t, as generally there’s no one available or take a long time to get back to you.

Even though I have come into this not knowing anything substantial about stocks the training program is very thorough. Benefits are great and working from home has been amazing. Training was rocky at first because there were some trainees who were very distracting, but that was taken care of immediately. Suffice it to say, if you come with the eagerness to learn you will like it. And don't be scared about the amount of information there is... the emphasis isn't so much about retaining everything there is to know; it's about how to find the information. We have an extensive backend that gives you all of the information you need to know.

I'm not sure why there are reviews saying the system is outdated. From what I've seen so far it's very user friendly and takes you where you need to go.","At this point while being with the company for one month, I don't have anything that I have seen yet that has been concerning."

117,,Lacks authenticity and heart,2021-12-04,1.0,Anonymous Employee,Plenty of work to be done,"Systematically disorganised, behind the times and heavily reliant on manual workarounds and labour.

Reward and obsene retention bonuses given to those relying on the manual labour to keep them in jobs. Constantly claim too cash strapped to embed a fair and consistent reward strategy for those on the ground who are regularly expected to work long and unsociable hours and are therefore leaving in droves creating even more pressure on those that remain.

Purely grow through acquisition, constantly crippling the organisation through poorly planned integration work.

Poor investment in development. Advancement opportunities entirely dependent on who you are friends with. Regional bias in how you are treated depending on whether the relevant Head is based in your office.

Significant numbers of over promoted people who purely push pieces of paper from one place to another and design over engineered processes to satisfy their own sense of self importance.

Lack of authenticity with a high focus on cascading good news stories rather than interest in developing understanding of and acknowledging real issues

A culture of using HR teams as a partner in ill treating employees who are not in favour. Sycophantic HR Business partners are used to manipulate employees in line with business managers wishes with no interest in embedding a fair and equitable culture.

I’ve been there for a good while now and I can safely say that (apart from being sometimes understaffed as of late) I adore this job! I feel bad for the call centre departments because they do seem to have it tight with calls and things but my job is majority admin based and maybe a few inbound or outbound calls a day. The work is hard, yes, but I have never felt like I wasn’t supported or couldn’t ask for help. 
My colleagues are wonderful and all extremely helpful. I’ve experience NO office politics that have worried or concerned me in any way….it’s a dream job lol this sounds too good to be true but I swear it’s all true. 
I don’t feel like I’m ever asked to do something I can’t, the regular training and refreshers for my department are impeccably put together, the pay (we got a pay rise recently too in order too and it’s very nice I must say) is more than enough to live on, no questions asked. Maybe not for those who live beyond their means quite a bit? But it’s a good fair generous wage for what we do and we’re offered so much support. We’re actually offered a lot of perks while working for computershare, they are very employee-satisfaction driven employers, 100%.

If we want to work without having to pay to park, we are forced to walk over a half mile between the parking garage and location where we work. We have to pass dark alleys and a strip bar to get to work. Our building was shut down March 2020. Now in August 2021 after countless surveys asking if we prefer to stay working at home...although the majority has continued to request WFH permanent...CPU has decided it is in our best interest to return to work. AND because they know it is still unsafe and, due to the Meliodosis and West Nile, we are now also required to wear a mask all day during our shift for the unknown future. Masks wont help in that crowd of people, masks wont protect against vigilantes still very active in that area.","Decisions that are made with the company are constant high stress. Although the company has plenty of money and operates in multiple locations/multiple countries, the starting pay is low. Even in a remote environment, we were multi managed and micro managed. It didnt matter how much over time we put in, or how often we offered to help others. It didnt matter that we were always on time and didnt call into work sick. Our department and various others felt the stress flooding down.

The company is a collection of different businesses with different processes, different leaders with different goals and little regard for the overall state of the company as long as their little piece of Computershare is in good standing.

All decisions are centralized meaning that the opportunity for a quick decision on anything is just not feasible. Departments are rarely aligned and trying to find the right person in the organization to help or solve a problem requires a treasure map."

If you don't believe me just check the Trustpilot reviews for this company. I did the 4 weeks of training which was pretty easy, not interesting but easy money for a month. I then could only face 2 days of working on the phones as I could not morally work for a company that would lose this much money, one client I spoke to had lost £15,000 with this company.

The paid time off is solid as well as the holidays make it even better. The environment in the office is wonderful and very open and welcoming to everyone. They try and make it as comfortable as possible and treat you as family. Overall I would give it a 10/10 in terms of the environment and makes the job itself more tolerable. Even with the issues I would still recommend this company to others because of the environment and incentives as well as events they hold.,The cons of the job varies in some cases the management seems to be very helpful in a lot of cases but can also leave you hanging in other issues you may have. The main issue I have with the company is the lack of communication and proper training in certain information some of the goals you can work to are demolished because of the knowledge of some information that’s given out I’ve had plenty of times where one manager will tell me one thing and another manger something else so in most cases people are not on the same level and if you bring it up there isn’t much that’s done. The major problem I have is you need to lookout for your own self because the information given as tool is not always accurate and other bits are focused on more then others. The overall score I give it is that 4/5 because of the issues internally.

Avoiding the dole, maybe.","The management ethos seems to be one of micromanaging the ground level staff, i.e. the ones actually *doing the work*, to such an intense degree that many of them go off sick and/or leave. Staff turnover & retention must be appalling. All work is subject to random quality checks, which must be 100% right, or disciplinary measures are taken. In addition, staff are required to keep above a certain work speed or they are disciplined. No talking is allowed. No breaks are allowed outside of your scheduled time - staff are on software which logs all actions, all of the time. They know if you cease working, even for a minute. This is absolutely the most appalling place to work. Sickness absence is not tolerated & disciplinary measures are taken against ""offenders"", even for verified illness. There is very little opportunity for career progression if your face doesn't fit, often the top staff are imported from outside the company. I was honestly glad when I lost my job."

I hate to say it, but this company is an absolute joke. Management refuses to own up to mistakes. Even if you have hard proof it wasn't your mistake. I have been thrown under the bus so many times here and they will play mental gymnastics to say it was your problem. I got chewed out for not being ""direct"" enough. What kind of chit is that? Other departments won't answer emails and GFL if you have something urgent. My manager in particular is very condescending and difficult to work with. If you need help with anything, the manager made it seem like I was taking up their time. The help I did received was rushed. They expect you to know everything. That's why they don't like it when you ask questions. There are tech issues everyday, which is ironic considering the company's name is called ""Computershare."" This company is the poster child of what's wrong with Corporate America. Backstabbing, terrible training, cold management, high turnover, etc.

If you are competent AVOID this company. Even if you are desperate, just don't do it. Delivering pizza is better than this job."
473,,A 'Status-Quo' company,2020-10-13,3.0,Business Analyst,"Flexible working
Great community to work alongside
Work/life balance is great and the management accommodate this","Old systems meaning less time to develop on 'newer' applications and the upper management are really really reluctant to change this. 

Salaries are fairly low compared to other companies.

There is a massive 'it is what it is' mentality where the development teams, especially in Edinburgh, and they don't really control business demand or help shape the community you're in. It's a put up or shut up status quo environment from the Bristol and Melbourne offices which essentially makes working here a reactive environment rather than proactive."

Issues with bullying and other issues within colleagues were dealt with swiftly in my experience.
Working in Quality there was some flexibility with work times and there was no shift work involved.
Good benefits package - discounts website, holidays for starting employees 25 daya rising to 27 after 1 or 2 years","My tenure made it an okay place to work for as my salary reflected that. However my salary was what it was only due to being an employee of UKAR before bought by Computershare.
Starting salaries are not good for the work expected from you.
As QA we were expected to move around and pick up various activities with little guidance unless it was telephony.
Management seemed clueless half of the time.
Communications on changes to policies and general knowledge stuff was poor.
Always expected to do more than skill set.
Recognition was only ever given to people who made their achievements well known.
No career progression opportunities within QA."

484,,Look somewhere else.,2020-09-25,1.0,High Risk Analyst,Some of the people I worked with. And their 401k,"I was with the high risk department and it was just a terrible experience overall. Management is rude and treat people below them poorly.  They give everyone a nickname and talk crap about former employees that have been working there.  The turnover is something I have never seen. During the 7 months I was there 18+ people left the high risk department.  Their PTO is a joke. Vacation and sick hours come from the same source, meaning if you get sick you won’t be able to use the hours you were saving to go on vacation because you used them to feel better. 

A lot of the people who work there only have  high school degrees, including the managers. If you are a respected professional look somewhere else. Their attendance policy is also a joke.  Let me put it this way, if you are with a department that has to talk about who is leaving and who is getting hired  EVERY week, you know you are in the wrong place."

Only allow you 8 minutes per day for making coffee, going to the bathroom. If you are over the 8 minutes you get told of. Nothing surrounded by the building. If you miss the free company bus which you most likely will do if you work in the call centre the only other option is the airport bus which is more expensive. Too much favouritism going on especially if you are interested in applying for other positions within the company. High staff turnover."
502,,"Penny wise, pound foolish - A company that will never grow, only barely survive",2020-08-17,1.0,Software Developer,Large customers in the financial industry make this a good stepping stone if you want to work for one of the many publicly traded companies or financial institutions that are their customers. It's a good way to get in contact with leadership teams at these companies.,"There are no set hiring practices except for those required by employment legislation or other regulations. This means that management often hires underqualified individuals. They don't like spending money on anything so don't expect to get training. Their technical debt is SUPER high and even the products they build for customers are built using very out of date programming languages. If you're a developer/engineer, avoid this place like the plague as you'll only ever work on 1) licensed technology, 2) fixing existing tech that can't keep up, or 3) tech that is inherited from acquiring competitors. You'll never actually get to create new tech here. Acquiring competitors is the only way they know how to grow. They say they invest in R&D, but most of that goes into systems security and rarely if ever into client-facing features. There are only two kinds of employees who work here at any given time - lifers who are just waiting to cash out their pension (they do the minimal amount of work like government employees) and new hires who leave within a year of working here because they realize that place has no future and is entirely a circus.. There are also zero growth opportunities here, so don't expect any sort of promotion. Ever. This is where devs who don't want to keep up with the changing pace of technology come to slow down and take it easy."

Trainers are great, many of the employees are really nice people.","Very difficult to get time off when needed, even for doctor appointments. Attendance policy makes any unscheduled absence count against you for corrective action even if you bring in a doctor note because it was a true emergency. In addition, calling out on a Monday regardless of the reason counts as two absences. Being more than 5 minutes late even if you call ahead counts the same as as an absence. Not enough breaks, get a 30 min lunch and a 15 min break for an 8.5 hour shift. There is no room for growth unless you are buddies with senior management. Sick and vacation time come from the same allotment so you can easily use all of your vacation time if you have an illness that lasts more than a few days. No PTO can roll over to the next year. PTO accrues throughout the course of the year and cannot be drawn upon in advance which means if you get really sick in February but you haven’t earned the time yet, you may not get paid for all your time off. Not worth the time I put into it. I loved the company until I took this position and it was not what I expected. The company does not care about providing good service, all they care about is wrapping up every call in 6 minutes or less and then they wonder why there are so many complaints."

* Temp staffing at MA location (now closed, moved to KY and TX last I heard) was laughable. Some of the people seemed like they were pulled in off the street, and had no business working the phones.
* Training for new employees seemed to be getting worse and worse as time went on. Sometimes I heard from callers who'd been given blatant misinformation in interactions with other call centers. Even my own team were yanked out of training for specialized European employee stock clients, as call volume had skyrocketed and we were needed on the floor- for those clients, we had to stumble through and figure out for ourselves.
* Hopeless decentralization. Almost zero direct interaction with departments other than my own. The sense of scale between the people that you work with, and people that you hear from answering calls is sobering.
* Zero regard for long-term. I came to answer calls for employee stock programs where management was scrambling to get things working correctly, months after going live.

There is an unnecessary amount of OT, supervisors micromanage you like you wouldn't believe, if you do not comply to your schedule, i.e going to the bathroom, taking an important phone call, a family emergency -- you will be treated like a horrible person and your employment will be threatened.  They do not care if you have an extreme or tragic life event outside of the job, they will hold it against you and attempt to exterminate you any chance they can get.  Also, their phone system has an outage every other week which results into an absurd amount of OT. Due to the high turn over rate, the extreme over load of clients and the poor support from management , the job more or less is strictly based off of OT and harassment for being a human being and not a robot chained to a desk all day and answering calls to irate customers..

595,,"a horrible, horrible, horrible place to work",2019-10-08,1.0,Transfer Agent,every good thing about Computershare is overshadowed by how badly management and the callers treat you,"if a caller asks for a supervisor, brace yourself - supervisors do NOT like to take calls at Computershare and they will fight you tooth and nail to avoid it.  They call this 'pushing back to make sure you're doing your job', but really, they are just call avoiding.  If you do that, you get written up.  But they do it constantly.

Beyond that, the QA system is ridiculously, I mean, absurdly subjective, inconsistent, and capricious.  No two QA coaches grade the same things the same way, and there is no accountability for an undeservedly low grade.  

The attendance policies are idiotic, too - no partial occurrences, so if you're going to be ten minutes late, or have to go to an appointment during your shift, you may as well just call in, because you're getting a full occurrence anyway.  

They also promise career opportunities over and over again during recruitment and training, but once you're on the call center floor, they will force you to take 'promotions' you don't want so they can keep you trapped there.  These 'promotions' count as 'new jobs', so the 9 months you are told you have to stay on the call center floor until you can bid on another job resets when you are given one of these 'promotions'.  And you CAN'T TURN THEM DOWN."

Lately They've also been more demanding of overtime than what was originally communicated when hired.

I've noticed that this job has caused other employees around me to become more anxious and frustrated because the company seems to mess up on people's mortgages.  I've worked other customer service jobs that has taken better care of their employees and their mental health."

620,,The Best Company I've Ever Seen (Just Kidding),2019-07-17,1.0,Office Employee,"*The managers are super insightful. They care tremendously about their own job outlook, making themselves a top priority, and looking good to all the right people.

*The culture is a special land of holograms and mirages. It's sort of like traveling to a distant galaxy where awful things are fun. (Children look under their beds at night to make sure monsters aren't there, but adults look under their beds at night to make sure Computerhsare isn't there. Yikes!)

*The purple color is so amazing to wear. Just when you thought people forgot about Barney the dinosaur from the '90s, you'll work here and then remember him once again. You may even begin to hum ""I love you, you love me, we're a happy family..."" 

*Are you a thrill seeker? Yes? Guess what? No more spending money on theme parks because walking through the parking garage is a bigger scare than any rollercoaster ride ever could be.

*Going to the doctor is really great because the Computershare health plan administrator is so organized, they don't even have a record that you are a member of the plan. But that is fun. Everyone enjoys playing a little game of ""I do really have a health plan with you, please provide coverage for me"" when you are ill.

*The water in the water cooler of the break room tastes salt, so you won't ever miss going to the beach.""

*You'll learn how to become very resourceful yourself because IT will never do anything to help you.

You'll learn to appreciate formal business attire when the office has one of those uncomfortably casual wear ""shorts and flip flop days."" Some people should not wear shorts.","I'm going to do something different here. Instead of listing cons, I'm going to make a CLS/Computershare survival list for any prospective employee. Trust me, you'll want all the help you can get. Ready for success at Computershare? Here we go!

Tip 1: Wear a gas mask to work. You will need this to maintain your health when you are inhaling all of the bad fumes from the toxic environment.

Tip 2: Consider utilizing the Employee Assistance counseling benefit before the workplace anxiety sets in --so you have the tools to cope just in time when you realize that taking this job was a huge mistake.

Tip 3: Consider investing in a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor to reduce being depressed over the fact that you have to go here Monday - Friday.

Tip 4: If you don't have a piece of purple clothing, invest in one. You'll get called out for not wearing purple on employee engagement days.

Tip 5: Second thought, don't buy any purple clothing; that is one unattractive shade of purple. Save your money. Throw yourself under the purple bus and just get called out. Who cares. Just remember, you get paid to do a specific job, not to participate in annoying work activities.

Tip 6: Create a rule in your Outlook email to block any employee engagement emails. That way you can legitimately say that you didn't get the email-- which is why you didn't bring a ridiculous purple hat to wear.

Tip 7: If you do not have unlimited data on your cellphone, get it now. This place is so boring, you'll need all the distractions you can get to make the day pass. Plus, it's satisfying to know that you can still be on all the websites they block. I dedicate a portion of my day to instagram, youtube, pinterest, and hulu. You'll want to do the same. You’re welcome.

*Tip 8: Practice your fake smile.

*Tip 9: Eat as many bananas as you can. You will need to build up your potassium for all the stairs-climbing you will need to do because the elevators are really scary here. 

*Tip 10: If you do not feel like taking your break in your car or desk (because there is no breakroom) go sit outside at Pussers. Yes, I said Pussers. It's a Caribbean place. They have outdoor seating. 

*Tip 11: Don't even try to understand all the different intranets. Your brain may explode if you do.

* Tip 12: Buy a ton of throat lozenges. You will need them to soothe your sore throat from the over abundance of ""diversity pride"" that they will jam down it. Seriously, there is a difference between recognizing diversity in a professional manner and recognizing diversity in an over the top way.

I have been at Computershare (this location was previously Specialized Loan Servicing) for 6 months, and I am extremely happy with my decision to join the company. I work within Business Process/Operations/Change Management, and am exposed to most other departments at this location as part of my role.

- Culture/Work-Life Balance: The culture here is wonderful. It's fast paced, but nothing abnormal for the industry. Everyone seems to enjoy coming in, and working long hours is fairly rare (unless you have something big going on, like a new product/project deployment or issue that came up). -Working from home isn't really built into the culture, but if you have a reason you need to WFH once in awhile it's definitely understood.  It does make it easy to pop into someone's office to get answers when most employees are in the office every day. Quite a few departments are like this, but this is not true in all departments - I would specifically ask your interviewer what their views on work/life balance are at the company and how they (as management) support it. 

- Management: Management is dependent on your particular manager or department (as it is everywhere). The management within Operations is fantastic. Our management doesn't hesitate to restructure to ensure the department is working the way it should, and considers all existing employees in that restructure to ensure everyone is satisfied. I can say my management is extremely supportive of my professional growth goals, and I think this sentiment is true for most departments. 

- Workplace (Highlands Ranch): The building itself isn't perfect (built '99 - '00), but the setup and size works very well to run the business easily. It's easy to get here off 470, parking is easy, and I feel safe with the security the building provides. There's also a gym you can access for free... it's not great (hasn't ever been updated), but it's there! 

-  Benefits: The healthcare benefits aren't very well subsidized, but they have 6 plan options (2 plans, 3 choices within each) which gives each employee the flexibility to choose what they need. I haven't had any trouble with my healthcare plan. The PTO plan is standard - 3 weeks to start, incrementally raised with tenure. We have MLK & Presidents Day off as a company, which is nice.","The company is growing, and with it come a few growing pains. Some well-tenured employees are a bit adverse to the (in my opinion positive) changes, which can make implementing the changes more challenging than it should be. 
This ""con"" is dying down, as the Loan Servicing sector of Computershare as a whole  seems to be very open to updating and progressing."

In 5 years I made various attempts to broaden my knowledge in other departments, but had my ambitions dashed because I was only working part time, kind of prejudice if you ask me. I witnessed someone else on my team get an opportunity to work in another department, which I requested prior but to no avail. I guess it was because the girl helped to progress was a friend of the manager, which helps, but again kind of prejudice. 

There are huge patterns of double standards within the organisation, not least due to the practices of mobile phone use, where I’ve seen a staff member get sacked for having there phone out at their desk, yet managers sit at their desks parading their family or holidays pics and giggling with pride while doing so, just to rub it in.

Another member of staff was bullied into handing in their notice or getting sacked, simply due to a minor mistake of accidentally using the wrong break code, yet the staff member never had as much as tiny blemish on their record in 4 years, and it seems there was just one manager involved in dealing with the scenario, wouldn’t surprise me if it was just personal rather than company practice.

Staff are treated like less than a number, so much so that the decent managers who did try to play fair, either left because they refused to treat their staff like dirt or were forced out for being a little bit human."

That I'm not the only one who hates this place.
My fellow comrades feel the same, and as such, we band together
Uniting through headset headaches, cranky callers and end-of-day fatigue
Only to do it all again tomorrow,
Journeying to hell and back on the cramped yet free bus.
But still, I have made friends, and at least this means
That I am not alone.","Yet this second part is yet much bleaker
Although we are coached, we barely learn
How to deal with aggressive, angry callers
Because some people have real problems.
And we get stuck on the phones at two minutes to five,
And pay the price of sunlight for money, literally
And get marked down on calls for such foolish things
That don't even make sense.

Hark, 'tis this I hear? 
The glorious sound of a promotion bonus?
Ha! Of course not, this is folly
They are screwing with our heads, I fear.
After all, we are human answering machines
And machines are mechanical, lifeless things.
I wonder to myself, is this is what I would have become
Had I stayed a week longer there."

762,,One Happy Employee,2018-08-15,5.0,Product Specialist,"Not sure where to start here so let me just dive in...

My experience in 1.5 years of being with the company has been great. The management in my department is fantastic, I've never felt like I couldn't come to them with an issue that they didn't take seriously. I've received two promotions in this time and continue to feel like a valued employee. I've received plenty of opportunities to learn new things that don't always apply to what I do, but helps in promoting myself as a valued employee. 

This is the first company I've ever worked for that holds all kinds of different events from raising money for charities to opportunities to meet & greet other departments during and outside of work hours which I find pretty awesome.

With this company moving from NJ, I feel like we had & continue to have the opportunity to come up with new processes that work for our department, giving us the kind of flexibility that allows for a desirable work environment & not just rules that are put into place because that's how management thinks it should work that don't actually make sense for someone who is actually doing the job day in and day out.

In my department, there is some flexibility to work from home once a month and IF there's a reason you can't physically make it to work due to weather or if the company is having technical issues they may send you home to work & that is a nice little bonus in my opion (I've never had the opportunity to WFH before).

Overall, I believe if you work hard, network, & take even the smallest opportunities to learn, there's a chance to grow & move into different roles. I see myself being here for a long time and I truly hope this company only gets better with time.",An annual raise that makes a difference would be much appreciated!

When I started in 2015, we had great health insurance through Blue Cross Blue Shield with Wellness Benefits. First, they basically eliminated the wellness benefit refund and replaced it with a quarterly ""raffle"" which just gets taxed and isn't even worth winning.  The next year, they kept our BCBS benefits but increased the premiums and co pays. Then, they changed from BCBS to PHCS which no doctor's office has ever heard of and is rarely accepted - but we were still paying the exact same high premiums and co pays for far subpar health insurance.

805,,Hard work is rewarded here,2018-07-20,5.0,Analyst,"If you're not just here for a paycheck and really put in the effort, you WILL succeed! I started with Specialized Loan Servicing(now absorbed into Computershare) as  a CR Phone rep about 6 years ago and have been promoted at least 6 times and only one of those times  where I had pursued it myself. Management has repeatedly recognized the contributions I have made over the years and I have been well rewarded for my efforts, including being chosen for a training trip to India. I am extremely humbled that a corporation as big as Computershare would recognize individuals such as myself. I do want to say up front that I am not being paid for this review, this is all true and factual. I will say that it did take about 2 years of being here before it all started to happen for me, but once it did, the moves I made were rapid and have been very fulfilling. People come and go but those that truly put themselves out there will reap huge benefits over the great benefits the company already provides to everyone here. The movement to other departments has become more fluid and transparent and is easily obtained once you have met the pre-requisites. There are always exceptions to the rules if you happen to be what I call a ""mutant"" and just wow them with your abilities. You don't have to be a robot either. Get your work done and get it done right and you wont hear much backlash if youre having a small conversation with a coworker. Mainly, don't take advantage. If you put in 110%+, you will be less likely to hear anything negative when you do take that extra break or miss the odd day. They take accountability seriously and as long as you are completely honest and transparent about everything you do, you will have little to no issues. I'm not going to lie, it hasn't been perfect as there were harder times a few years back and I'm sure there are others here that may not agree with me. Those who don't agree could be those who don't put in the effort and expect everything to be handed to them. The company does many things to reward their employees including company summer and winter parties, company branded money is rewarded to individuals to buy items including time off and gift cards or even RTD Bus passes, pizza parties, and various other items just to let you know you are appreciated. They sincerely listen to our feedback, both bad and good, and make a concerted effort to improve those items that are not so great. The also have special functions to get everyone involved. Recently, we had a walkabout, where we were able to go to any department we were curious about and learn all about it and each department had brought food in, so we could fill our stomachs, as well as, our minds. I highly recommend Computershare and have no plans in leaving anytime soon myself. They would have to chase me away. My biggest advice to new employees: Don't get caught up in gossip and employees who have nothing good to say. If you hear something that is concerning, seek out answers from management, they are usually transparent about most things and will be up front about any rumors being spread around. If you see something wrong, speak up. If you're not heard the first time, speak up again. They will take notice and if needed, they will take the necessary action.","If I had to name any cons now, it would be hard to do, as this company has made great strides in improving the general environment here. I do know that if you are a phone rep and are eligible to receive a bonus that they have made several cuts to it over the years and have made it harder to attain... that is the biggest complaint I hear from people that I know in those areas. Other than that, I do hear some people are overworked and some bear more of the brunt of the work than others, so sometimes burnout can be a factor. At times, there can be too many chiefs making the decisions and not taking into consideration the regular employees feedback. That also has improved over the years, as well.  I don't know if its a con but the hours are pretty much set and are expected to be adhered to. They don't have any 4 X 10 shifts or anything like that, which could contribute to a better work/life balance. Oh yeah, another con I just thought of, there has not been a cost of living adjustments in our paychecks for the past few years and it is a lot tougher to get a yearly raise unless you are making a better than just an average contribution."

They let go of  their temp. employees for any reason which is why they are always hiring.

Be aware that they will not have the decency of firing you in person nor allowing you to pick up any of your belongings left behind in your cubicle. 
Their is no room for growth or salary raise and you will remain a temp employee for as long as they like. There is no HR so you can't reach out to anyone with any problems and if you go to upper management it will only circle back and cause more gossip. 
Stay away from the PH team. They are the only team that has two weeks of training which sounds awesome at first but they will use any mistakes you made training against you. Training is suppose to teach and prepare you but they use it to criticize you harder and get rid of employees they do not like. They will smile in your face but talk about you behind your back.

There were issues with my payment, upon entering and leaving the company, any queries made were ignored. The management team didn’t feel approachable at all; being rude and unfriendly. If you’re not part of their currently existing system; you will struggle to fit in as the old staff and management don’t make the slightest effort to make the working atmosphere a welcoming environment.
The company is rapidly expanding in the UK, and their old staff are rapidly jumping ship. This means that Computershare are pushing their new starts to perform tasks that would have previously required 1 year experience. This undulating pressure is not supported by peers as you aren’t allowed to ask any questions, however reasonable. 

The hours were longer than a normal contract and the pay was actually less than the market average, meaning the hourly pay is a lot less than in other companies.

Overall, I find the treatment of the company to not be on par with what is considered a healthy working environment."

Multiple occasions where people in senior roles were being openly slandering other team members (which was only acknowledged in the last month I was there by a new manager) this caused bad energy in the office and not a good working environment. I also remember when I had first joined the team and hearing my manager at the time openly cursing and moaning about a colleagues mistake. Probably one of the worst working environments I have ever been in, felt like I was back at school with a bunch of teenagers. In terms of career development its pretty impossible, it's been made clear that they already know who they're going to pick before the interview process has even started, not giving everyone a proper chance. Every single person on the team is on a different wage, even someone who started a month after I joined the company is being paid more which doesn't make any sense since we are doing the same job and have had exactly the same amount of admin experience before joining ComputerShare, I've even had to train new comers on the team who are more than me PA.

The company also runs its own free bus service and offers discounts for other services, so even though it is not based in the centre, they have made it very convenient to get to work. 

Working in the contact centre is also a great first step into other roles in finance. 

Computershare always takes frequent steps for improving customer service. 

Hear nothing but nice things about other areas of the business.","Keep in mind that the following only reflects my experience in the contact centre and not the wider business: 

- The hours are reasonable, however, staff are often pressured into working a lot of overtime and rarely show gratitude for staff working overtime. 

- The job title and salary do not reflect the level and quality of work, which really damages your chances of finding work outside of the company. On top of customer service, members of staff like myself have to deal with complex issues, research, perform a lot of administration,  handle complaints and have to educate ourselves with data that changes daily.  

- Most of the management in the communications centre are not open to new ideas and ignore suggestions for improvement. 

- Most of the contact centre management are unsupportive and on occasion, hostile. 

- Annual leave is always a struggle to book, there is a requirement to book 4 weeks in advance (minimum), making it very difficult to maintain a healthy work/life balance. 

- Will frequently block or delay members of staff from leaving the contact centre to other areas of the business. 

- The QA team who monitor calls and outbound communications are inexperienced and will often make errors when grading a call or communication. Management in the contact centre are often unsupportive of this, making each wrong grading difficult to overturn. Which can affect your eligibility to receive bonus. 

- I understand all companies have to be wary of abuse of sick leave, but this company have a very strict and often insensitive approach to sick leave.

- Unhealthily obsessed with time management. The way in which time management is monitored doesn't account for any additional work added to your role and daily tasks.

-Very high staff turnover.  If you want to work a customer service role, you may want to look elsewhere."

The pay if you become a direct hire is $20/hour but a good 60% of Intake Specialists are working through an agency.  I became a direct hire after 8 months of working here.

2) A lot of work needs to be put towards recognition of team members especially the ones who have put in a lot of work over the years. These are employees who are hoping to see personal growth also when it comes to recognition.

2. Decent share scheme and pension. 
3. Some lovely people. 
4. The gym is quite good. 
5. Useful stepping-stone for some e.g. school or uni leavers.","1. Pay is bad and when I say bad, I mean, really bad (often well below market rate)

2. All the best staff leave and no effort is made to keep them (often the same guys who should have been the next generation of management and have given the company everything for years)

3. Innovation is frowned upon and innovators are sidelined. Management are frightened of change. Good ideas are ignored and then introduced when it's too late (or after a competitor has introduced them). Managers can't think outside the box. 

4. Staff turnover is huge which tells its own story (they don't expect people to stick around). 

5. If you go the extra mile, don't expect any gratitude or reward (the bonus system is dodgy i.e. the only criteria is if your boss 'likes' you and not how well you've done). 

6. They exploit the young and enthusiastic with rubbish salaries but impressive sounding titles. There's been some shocking cases of nepotism recently and its been brushed under the carpet. They’ve made a lot of noise about diversity recently but it’s all a sham, it’s a ‘boys club’ through and through and if you don’t know the right people, you won’t progress no matter how talented you are or how hard you’ve worked. 

7. Some, but not all, of the managers are, quite frankly, crap and/or are counting the days until retirement, gave up caring years ago, serial delegators. I don’t mean to be blunt but it’s the truth. Many are managers simply because they’ve been there the longest. It’s a shame because so many talented, innovative and hard working people come and go without progressing."

The overall benefits are great including 401k matching, plenty of PTO, ESPP, Vision, Medical, Dental, Life and more. Best of all, you get these benefits right away in the US.  Some roles offer work from home which is great for work/life balance. In my personal experience managers are helpful and understanding as long as you keep them informed. Global opportunities are available to those open. We have offices all over the globe.","Communication is improving from the top, but many groups state that there is a breakdown at lower levels. There have also been quite a few years of salary freezes in the past which hurts employee morale for those that do not move to new roles within the company. This past year we did have an increase, however each year you miss a raise, it is like you are taking an annual pay cut of 2-3% when you account for inflation.  Although the benefits are great, the medical coverage has gone down in quality. We paid a premium in the past for BCBS but now pay the same rate for a bargain company the doctor's offices have never heard of to keep the rates from going up."

909,,Awful Experience,2017-12-05,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"-Decent Pay for job ($17.50 an hour) - I was a temp employee 
-Guy who trained new employees was nice.","- Lousy organization within my superiors who were known as team leaders. I was a temp employee and once I was trained and went out onto the call floor it was very hectic and confusing. Nobody seemed to be able to tell me where my desk was for starters.  I would ask where my desk was sometimes daily because I was moved around and the team leader would say ""let me go find out."" It would take 20 minutes for me to get an answer. The supervisors were very disorganized which I found to be stressful. They were often running around like chickens with no heads. 
-MOST of the team leaders were very clueless and unprofessional. The temp employees are often full of questions and almost every time the team leader would be an absolute rude and make me feel stupid for asking. 
-Awful experience to get screamed at by irate customers for 10 hours. The customers were the worst part. 
-Lack of autonomy and independence in making decisions led to real demoralizing experience; calls were recorded and reviewed by management and then picked apart by quality assurance. 
-There was a real lack of empathy from team leaders about taking a day off. You had to fill out a piece of paper like 2 weeks in advance or it would be an unexcused absence. It also might not be approved.
-Extremely monotonous work. Thought I could stomach it for the pay - I was wrong.
-Your job is basically to make calls for 6 hours or 10 hours (if it's a Saturday) to people who most often get mad at you for calling and unfortunately would use profanity from time to time.
-only 8 minutes a day allowed for personal time which is ridiculous.
-only a 15 lunch in a gross lunch room that was the size of a broom closet. There was often thirty or so people packed into it with not even enough seats for everyone.
-One supervisor in particular was very unprofessional and led to me quitting- he was mean and rude and would reprimand people in front of the entire group during team meetings for barely objectionable behavior every day. He was very unprofessional and once discussed a health issue I was having with the entire staff publicly during a team meeting which is against the law.
-Overall, a real lack of appreciation conveyed to employees. You just feel like you're the punching bag for the irate customers on the phone and that the team leaders don't care about you. Yes, they were attentive to any questions. But, they also were rude and irritated most of the time.  This made me feel like I had no autonomy at all.
-The team leaders were also absolutely ruthless about making sure you didn't go over your break time or lunch time or that you didn't clock out early.
-Just an honest piece of advice: this is a highly stressful job. I couldn't handle the long hours with little break in the monotony, the lack of autonomy and the constant verbal abuse from customers as well as the irritated attitude of the team leaders. Just know what you're in for.
-Also, if you are a college student looking for an easy job to supplement your income, this is not a good fit. It's exhausting - from both the long hours and the stress.
-My hours were lousy too. The management made me work too many. I tried to get them reduced because I didn't have enough time to do schoolwork but this is not the type of company with any flexibility. I had to work until 10:00PM every weekday. I really didn't have the time to balance this part time job with school - I'm a part-time student as well."

This immediately causes a bit of a physical rift despite the existence of email and Lync. Training was intermittent, slap-dash and half-baked at best. No structure at all whatsoever. After about 1 month of this we were thrown into the deep-end dealing with real customer issues and queries.  The management is absolutely atrocious with the most obvious red flags being repeated such as conflicts of interest (nepotism, bias) and constant swearing and threatening by the main manger and blame shifting. There was a complete lack of leadership and support. The rest of the team and non-support colleagues will perpetually see the London recruits as the 'newbies' even after several months which exacerbates the feeling of marginalisation. Management are two-faced. Pleasant in person but conniving and snide behind closed doors. Please note, this is a summary of issues encountered.

Please note, the support unit have been completely incapable of maintaining a long-running London team since inception. Colleagues have left or joined other teams at the earliest opportunity and this was true in the case of the predecessors ahead of me as well as myself including one colleague who left voluntarily within the probationary period."

Friendly staff (majority) 

Ability to underperform and still keep your job","Shockingly bad and out of date management techniques utilised across the business. 

There are some managers at senior positions who are left to run teams/departments despite losing large amounts of staff and having poor performance yet heads for function turn a blind eye. 

This is a very underpaid company for salaries across the board compared to industry standards.

Despite some women being in very senior roles, its still very much an ""old boys club"". 

Budgets are not utilised appropriately. Costs are spent on drunken department nights out or travel/accommodation for staff to be brought over from other countries/offices who bring absolutely no benefit to the company.  Instead this money could be used on increasing pay to industry standards, spending money of much needed development and training and improving the facilities available. 

If you ""give an inch"" in regards to motivation and commitment this company will ""take a mile"" and you'll see no thanks or recognition for it. 

People are promised things in the job advert and interview process (both internal movements and external ""new starter"" positions) which inevitably do not come to fruition. 

The values of the company are not followed and to  be honest are so wooly and overarching that they are interpreted in multiple ways by differing people in the organisation which leads to inconsistency and the ability for poor performance, poor management and lack of innovative working to be acceptable pratice."

What ends up happening is projects are executed haphazardly. They're not open to suggestions, and they're hung up on controlling the design of applications. The business tells IT what to build, not what problem needs to be solved. This results in lack of direction and clear goals. Without saying it, they basically did what Disney did: lay off the skilled US labor and brought in cheap labor from India. The guys from India are actually worse off in terms of skills, which was especially noticeable when we were forced to do the KT sessions in order for laid off workers receive the severance package. They wanted guys that wouldn't question or challenge the decisions.

Things like this end up impacting the overall business. They sell on the fact that they have state of the art technology, but under the hood it is all horribly built. I saw firsthand all the horrible code to handle requirements that made no sense. Competitors are eating up KCC and the management is at a lost of what to do next.

Whatever you do - don't ask questions unless they're good questions. If the questions you ask are redundant, have already been answered in some type of way or has nothing to do with your assignment - then don't ask for the sake of being ask. If 'leads' or managers don't feel like your up to par, you will be micromanaged. And trust me, that is very annoying. I guess another pro is that there are snacks in the kitchen but I guess you need something else to do such as eating or sipping tea when your constantly doing the same thing all day. Overtime - I would definitely take advantage of that being you don't know how long you will last. Think positively and pay attention to the signs. If your a female, do not wear make up. And don't do anything that will draw negative attention to you like decorate your desk. That's not cool lol. Take notes and ask questions when things are explained to you the first time if you do not understand because you have the leisure or access to your lead as much as you'll like. And if you do, they will be annoyed or send somebody else down to take care of it. Great job to have to get to the next level. Great resume builder but I wouldn't dedicate my life to it. Ace your interview; it will determine where you will be placed. And make sure to have a cool fact when brought up in the introduction. And professional pics only for intro of new specialist. Great job to pay off some quick debts and to save money.","They're is a lot of butt kissing. A lot of trying to impress your 'boss' but I guess that's natural at any job. Very competitive environment which means of course - only the best will last. This is great job if your into public health, medical records or want to be a lawyer. If not, just stay focused and get paid. Do your job. Some of your co-workers 'causal' clothes aren't very professional. Everyone is a temp here which means no benefits. It looks like some rolled out of bed and came to work but they probably won't last there too long either. There is a lot of passive aggression. Your leads will smile in your face and never give you the feedback you acquire. And when they do, you have to read in between the lines. You'll hear things that you mentioned privately brought up in group meetings. So be careful of what you say and to whom. You will be trained for a 'hour' and expect to get it. It's very fast paced so even if your not into it take really good notes. Everyone is trying to do stuff to make themselves look good. So if they're is a problem; make sure you have a solution. Lots of cliques. Try to stay away from PH; they change what they want every other day but every other group looks fine. And do not make any mistakes at all lol Good luck!"

First one is management - as the company is growing to a mid-size servicer, many management positions are still occupied by the old-timers who are used to running a small shop. Hence, no processes are scaleable, and their mentality doesn't support running a bigger company.

The biggest disappointment is the IT function. It fails on every possible level. Systems are outdated and don't talk to each other. They are using SQL Server 2008, and no modern BI tools. Getting Office 2010 on your machine requires putting in a ticket and getting a new machine. Office 2013 can only be installed if you get a blessing from the CIO.

Data is awful. There are multiple data sources with absolutely no data governance, documentation, or streamlined processes. Their idea of a data warehouse would be laughed at in the 90s, let alone in 2016. Historical data concept is non-existent. 
If you ask 10 people the same question about data, you are likely to get 10 different answers, all of them likely wrong.
At the same time the company management doesn't admit that IT is a complete disaster, while the entire company works around them because they know how unreliable their product is.

There was a high turnover in our department from management down to minion, it was a constant revolving door.  The current management team hasn't a clue, they spend more time on their cell phones than doing their jobs.  In fact, nobody is sure what they do behind closed doors all day.  They rarely walked the floor, there was no true support, training or even cameraderie when I left, and most everyone leaves by walking off the job or giving a minimum of 3. to 5 days notice.   Although the  Human Resources team has been made aware of the toxic environment, they have done nothinf to remedy it and continuously defend the managers who are rude, unprofessional, demeaning and lazy.   My former teammates are overworked, underpaid and constantly being dumped on by management.  The attendance guidelines are unflexible, and employees are written up for attendance for unscheduled sick day (with. Doctors notes), car issues, family emergencies and tardies.  Although they deny that they write up employees for snow days, this has happened.  Bonuses and raises were adequate the first couple years, but management waa always late in completing annual reviews, so the raises were not sufficient to cover changes in the economy, housing increases, etc.  In 2015 and 2016 no raises were given at all, and bonuses were restructured or phased out.  This job literally made me ill, and I resigned for ongoing health reasonsl.  The best decision ever!"

Motivated and hardworking performers are rewarded with meaningful responsibilities.

That being said, in today's digital world where work is always just a click away, I've always found management to respect the balance between work and life. There is an understanding here that happy employees are better employees. 

Other great benefits include:
- 15 days vacation for first year employees (20 days after 3 years)
- Numerous additional vacation days (follows NYSE calendar)
- Many positions are hired from within
- Work-life-balance. We are serious about getting work done, but not at the expense of personal happiness and satisfaction.
- Global company, spanning numerous markets and industries. If you're willing to make it happen - there is opportunity to move around internally for new challenges and environments","- Some positions lack clear career paths

I watched colleges with high end degrees get overlooked for positions for other co-workers with GED's. Don't ever ask for a raise cuz they will laugh at you. Bonuses, overtime? I don't think so. They hire the ppl they like and it's literally running this business into the ground. It's extremely incestual and it's probably because anyone with half a brain with any sort of self worth doesn't stick around. Sexual harassment and verbal abuse is perpetually swept under the rug.

1222,,Highly Combatant Environment,2015-12-15,1.0,Project Specialist,The benefits package and pay were quite nice. Plenty of over time available if you want it.,"This company harbors a very stressful culture. There is no support for learning the complexities of the position other than the manuals provided. Although well written, a book alone isn't sufficient when one gets stuck on a problem. They set people up for failure by not giving them proper goals for completion of tasks, and then reprimanding you to the bosses when things aren't done the way they want it. The place is a mill for report generation and no one has time to help when you get stuck, not too good when you're new. There's also a lot of back-biting where people are nice to your face, but emails have angry undertones, and butt covering lies.
Senior Consultants are known to scream and yell out of frustration. Loud ""F"" bombs are the norm, and there is no clear chain of command. 
My desk saw five different people in the last 12 months because they couldn't handle the stress from management. These people don't seem to care about their employees.

Call center environment is stressful and not very fulfilling...you are only as good as your last call.  Starting pay was low and was given additional training with no raises!

They promote from within, which is encouraging for certain career paths.","SLS does not offer enough Work From Home time, even though they have VPN and there is little point in coming in daily in my role. They have extremely old and slow PC hardware, and are plagued with perpetual system issues, to the point where staff is unable to work for hours on end. There is poor employee engagement, the general feeling is that everyone is replaceable and so little is done to improve morale.
In the 3.5yrs I worked here, there has been significant dysfunction. There is so much nepotism that it's sometimes amazing anything gets done as people are placed in positions they clearly aren't prepared for. 
There is a serious level of mistrust, so change is guarded until it's announced, with almost no input from stakeholders."

One under performing with  undisciplined leadership. One historically mismanaged trying to turn around. One inefficient and being severely undercut in price. One really struggling to adapt its core capabilities in a market undergoing transformation. I haven't seen any evidence of executive leadership being able to steer the business through these challenges. There's spots of talent, but I wouldn't say this is a business of high performers. With 3000 staff in Australia, that's a lot of mediocre people.
The company is in serious cost cutting mode so don't expect any perks or reward for going over and beyond in your role.
Personally, I can't stand my manager who is known for over promising and pushing everyone in the team to deliver  to unrealistic deadlines and deal with unreasonable workload.

They require(d) their employees to bill at a certain percentage each week (85%), or they would be written-up. So, when the economy bottomed-out and companies no longer filed for Chapter 11, there was no work. But, they wanted you to bill your 'hours'.

They also make changes mid month that affect the incentive pay you expect to get. Nothing is consistent from day to day on how to handle calls. The incentive is a joke because it is nearly unattainable and if you get lucky it is nowhere near what you were told to expect upon hire. You are told that a policy is a certain thing, but if a call is escalated management will cave, making you seem like a liar for upholding the policies they put in place.

I moved across to the Plan Managers department, which was technically a higher paid job, yet my salary was not increased to meet my new team mates, a very sneaky way of gaining employees on the cheap. 

The way I was treated by my manager there was disgusting. In fact id call it bullying. If you have suffered with depression as I did, working at computershare exacerbates it. I had no support whatsoever, there seems to be a big 'lad culture' there where all the management are 'mates' and stick by eachother, even when one of them is abusing their power in how they treat their employees.

Computershare is sucking every last dollar out of the place, and has gotten MUCH more strict in their policies. The recent hiring and placement of a few VP's is making me wonder who is in charge. I'm not sure who is doing the hiring for upper-level management, however I think they need to find someone else with less of an iron grip. The supervisors and VP's look down their noses at you when you past them in the hall ways, instead of treating you as a human and simply say hello. Upper management should work on THEIR people skills for those who are on the front lines of this company. The call center management should listen to the needs of the people taking the calls, instead of someone who states they ""know"" call center management and how to impliment it. The call center supervisors on up NEVER seem to be happy with the hard work people are doing, in this demanding environment. Phone reps are treated as if they are easily replaced and like a piece of meat whose lives don't matter. Dealing with people on the verge of having their homes foreclosed on, is a difficult position to be in when talking to people who are about to lose everything. I don't feel a single manager or supervisior could do this job for a month, and not realize that major changes need to be made in how call are handled. I consider my call center a ""job"" and not a ""career"" until I am recognized for my hard work, and taken out of the inbound/outbound call center. 

 I would also bring back the ROTH 401K option, the old vacation pay that tenured employees received before Computershare bought them out, and tell your recruiters & hiring managers to look at peoples resumes who have years of expirience. I am in a phone center position with many years of financial services, and a call center position is below my skill set. I took the job because I needed it, however I feel I could bring much more to the company they I currently am.
