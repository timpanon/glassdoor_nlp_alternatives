Best place for Fresh Graduates (not for MBAs or people with industry experience),"Promotion policy very Worst Politics plays high in promotion even in Development centre and promotion process is unimaginably worst.  
No respect for experienced employees or seniority.
Company does not recognise any position upto Manager level untill then the two levels do not have any Corporate title. There is no definate segregation between a fresher and a Senior Analyst."
