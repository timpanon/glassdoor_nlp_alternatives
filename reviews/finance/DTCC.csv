Good learning opportunity
Good work life balance","While the company prides itself on being a diversity champion, many departments, including, internal audit, do not exercise (through action) diversity, equality, and fair treatment of all employees. The only people who have career grown and receive promotion is only if a member of the Leadership team likes and has things in common with him/her. Leadership pretends to care about career growth of its staff, however the reality is far from the truth. Qualification is constantly overlooked during promotion, and less qualified employees are promoted just because someone in the Leadership team likes the person or has ""things"" in common. New employees are enticed to join audit with high salary and career progression, only to find out that the only way to move up is to be liked by Leadership. 
Microaggression, bias, disparaging comments, and bullying is openly exercised in team meetings. Code of Conduct violations and employee complaints are not taken seriously.

It seems that work-life balance is only enjoyed by few. As long as they get the results they want, the personal time of their employee doesn't matter to think that most teams are skeletal in terms of manpower.

In this company, rank and file employees will not have enough voice even if they collectively voice out their grievances. What matters only is the voice of senior leaders, that's all.

If you plan to grow in this company, don't even think about it. They always prefers external rather nurture the internal talents that the company have."

Company has a higher than average pay and PTO policy.,"Some people tend to think of themselves as high and mighty because they work in finance. Company lacks diversity, especially in certain areas. Work/life balance is horrendous and has only gotten worse. Company lies about amount of layoffs they’re going to have by calling them ‘budget cuts’. Only about 4000 employees so mobility is difficult, and overrelies on agencies to do most heavy-lifting. Many employees have been doing the same thing for over 5+ years and would be satisfied doing it for another 5. Meetings are rampant. The longer tenured employees tend to do things different in a more manual and time consuming way while newer more tech savvy employees have to beg for adherence to adoption of newer technologies in all parts of the firm. Creates a mismatch of processes/functions where some people do things digitally and on cloud technologies while some rely on 5 year old excel sheets."

I was blamed for a defect which was not discovered few months prior to me joining the company... As if I could've found the bug before I joined the company. Incredibly irresponsible, and unappreciative management. Worst place to start your career at.
The annual employment survey gave my management 70/100 score, and my director held a meeting to basically scare the team that they should give better rating to their managers...
A team member cried because manager scolded for 5 minutes and then immaturely hung up the phone without providing any actual feedback or suggestions - HR didn't care about it either."

- Entry level IT program (ELIT) is exceptional for those starting out in the IT profession (just don't stay more than 2-3 years)

- Keep your head down and mouth shut, make widgets the DTCC way, and stay employed as long as you want to be

- Great place to ""pre-retire"", if that's where you are in the your career path","IT is well over half of the company, so following what happens there is critical to understanding the company overall.  Recently the former CIO retired and was replaced by an internal candidate with many years of experience at DTCC.  I have worked  with the new CIO in the past, and found her to be both a competent and professional executive, but since her promotion, she has moved quickly to reorganize her executive team around other long-tenured DTCC staff.  These are not the behaviors of a board, a senior executive team, or a company interested in meaningful change, so I find it unlikely DTCC will accomplish anything other than cosmetic changes in the next few years.

- Benefits are mediocre (health insurance, PTO, etc.)

- Legacy processes and technologies used extensively throughout the company

- Diversity hires and promotions above all else...great for diversity numbers, not so good for some exceptional internal candidates that have now left the company

- No incentive to improve -- Repeatedly spends of resources lots to build modern frameworks/teams/technologies, then pulls the rug out before any actual change comes to core parts of the business

The moment management realizes that you have a life outside of DTCC and that you are not 100% dedicated to the job, they will make your life miserable. I started graduate school part-time last January, with the initial support of my manager and DTCC’s tuition reimbursement policy. However, after I began needing accommodation for my graduate school classes, my manager began being difficult and demanding. I was upfront about the time commitments initially and had I been aware that I would not have full support of the organization in my studies, I would not have gone back to school part-time. Management is very old school and has been slow to adapt work from home and flexible work hours. I never imagined needing to leave a few hours early to make it to class a few times a month would be a big deal, especially when I thought I had the support initially. Management expects that you are always connected too. Now that I’m looking to leave, I’m worried about how I am going to afford to repay the tuition assistance I received because they will make you pay it back. Furthermore, you will be penalized for calling out sick, even when you are legitimately sick. Management is backstabbing like that."

Internal Audit specifically is the worst place I have ever worked.  Management is hostile and disrespectful, the culture is horrible, and operationally, it is a disorganized disaster!  The “orientation” process is a joke, my direct manager worked remotely my first day on the job, and there is absolutely no guidance or training whatsoever.  Some individuals in management are condescending and their communication and leadership skills are non-existent.  They should lead by example and treat staff with respect in order to foster a healthy, supportive environment.  The Internal Audit staff is largely disgruntled as a result of poor management.

(Hell the guy I took over for didn't make it 5 years!) My co-workers were great to work with on my immediate team, but with in the TEAM as a whole (TRM) there was a bunch of resentment. The Directors did not get along, the director in the other group  was promoted a few years back and no one can really understand why? He does not do anything, he hardly shows up, and seems to have unlimited PTO. Even though his group is suppose to be technically part of ours.  Im pretty sure he has something hanging over someone, to still be employed there! 

*The pay is not bad, benefits are decent.

if Audit was informed on some of the things I was TOLD to do, I am pretty sure some heads would roll. 

Management is pretty much the weak link at DTCC, no backbone to stand up to other managers. Its really sad, as they CONTINUE to lose great talent!","They say the WFH program is ""Very Liberal"" until you acutely use it. Then they want you in the office.

I'm going to agree with somebody else on here and say I did not like Wrexham as a location, it was incredibly grim and some of the locals employed there had the 'redneck' feel about them.

No progression, and limited development as no experience on site to any degree. 
Poor training for level of responsibility expected from work allocated. No training manuals or qualified trainers. SME’s give you different answers every time you ask.
Antiquated systems due to lack of investment- reliant on spreadsheets and databases as sticking plasters. 
Different rules for rewards and promotions depending on who is your manager! 
Managers who work from home more than they are in the office and leave the running of their teams to TL’s as not interested in role. 
And DTC wonder why staff leave - anyone decent they get rid of!
Would not recommend working in Wrexham if you are looking for a long term career."

454,,Great place,2019-07-20,4.0,Associate,You are very much involved in every project,Too much office politics unfortunately
455,,A Dilbert Cartoon Come To Life,2019-07-19,2.0,Manager,"The company itself is rock solid - like a utility company, with no real competition.  Pay and benefits are pretty good.","Because there is no external competition, everyone focuses on competing internally, so the level of office politics and back-stabbing is off the charts.  To be a successful manager here, more than anything else, you have to be extremely cunning - know how to take more than your share of the credit and less than you share of the blame, be ready to throw people under the bus at the drop of a hat, etc.   Senior management or HR could put a stop to it, but both are completely feckless."
456,,Toxic Environment and Lack of Culture,2019-07-17,2.0,Auditor,"The company overall seems to be nice, good benefits, PTO is not bad since day 1, work/life balance is good.","The environment is extremely toxic. Senior Management openly endorses favoritism. The favorites get promotions and carte blanche to do whatever they want despite continuous complaints from other team members. Complaints in general fall on deaf ears and are used against the people who dare to speak up.  Most Managers have no soft or leadership skills. Some employees are openly arrogant, rude and unprofessional, but Management turns a blind eye to any complaints. Being a team player, polite and courteous to your co-workers are not appreciated here. 
The Management in general is not interested in people's development or growth, or hearing what people have to offer. 
Anything you read about HR - is true! They are completely useless.
They entice you with a high salary and promises of career growth/internal mobility but the reality is completely different.  In the end, you have to choose between the money and keeping your sanity."

Infrastructure resources are terrible to work especially cloud resources. They don't know anything how the infra works, just follows blindly what they think is right. You can count talented number of engineers and they lose them by not giving enough quality of work. Everybody wants to protect and save their jobs that results lack of quality people around you.

The culture is driven by the leader of the department. Sadly, a lot of good people leave Internal Audit because of the culture.

462,,Toxic Culture,2019-05-26,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"Pay is better than average, bonus, but not worth what you give up. 

More words make Glassdoor happy so here they are.","I worked here for 5 years. When I started, I got the sense that something was way off. People looked burned out and miserable, management had shifty eyes. HR orientation felt weirdly disorganized. Feedback was ""encouraged"" but then ignored. I had to ask for the employee manual 5 different times before I finally got one. 
 This is the most toxic and stale work environment I’ve ever experienced.  The technology is laughably outdated.  It had a warehouse mentality from day one, borne from lazy union workers doing their jobs manually. There are still managers from those days, and they still treat that their employees like lazy manual laborers, mainly because those are the only types of people they know how to manage.  If you work here, you’ll find yourself getting dumber by the day, just because of upper management’s self fulfilling prophecy that their employees don’t want to work, and so therefore their job and their top heavy management structure is necessary and justified. I knew one manager who’s total job responsibility was to send one weekly email. Senior Management is a club of mostly white men from the old days, who have given lip service to “diversity”,  but only at the lower levels, mainly as a buffer so that they can keep their club functioning.

There is a cruelty in the air here.  Management actively encourages employees to turn on each other, killing any sense of teamwork, while it’s a total hangout culture as you get further up the ladder into senior management. Petty games and decades old unproductive rituals rule.  They have no competition in their industry, so employees here are busy killing each other. They have met the enemy, and the enemy is them.  The longer you stay, the more your sense of fair play and teamwork at work, and in life, will be eroded. The worst part is looking around at all the nastiness and realizing how terribly unproductive it is.  Soon you’ll find yourself following management’s lead, going through the motions in order to get paid, and treating your fellow employees and your staff like absolute trash and hating yourself for it, That’s when you’ll have to make a choice between your money or your values. I chose wisely and am so happy that I had the foresight to leave before that state of mind became permanent for me.  I now get paid twice as much and am as productive as I want to be.  Yes, it’s competitive world, but teamwork, collaboration and productivity are possible.  Just not here.

You have been warned."

People management does not seem to be required of any managers.   Often multiple levels of approval are required for the simplest of things.

Men in this company can get away with everything- they can take their reportees for lunch, dinner, coffees, walks, come drunk to work and still be there but female employees are forced out by creating a bad work place. HR does not care about employees. Raising anything to HR's attention is never helpful- they will make it worse. There were several high performing female employees who were made to resign.

This company has gone from bad to worse in the past 5 years. The money they spend on technology to build nothing is ridiculous and then the fake the technology that never works. It is saddening that all this goes unnoticed. The worst HR any company can have. They have some leaders in HR who are tyrants but nothing is done about them. Completing my 7th year in the company, I feel bad to see the future. Management needs to bring in honest and dygnamic leaders to stay in the industry and change HR leadership completely.  A firm is as strong as it's human resources and with that department being the most dishonest and corrupt department you know how bad the current state is.  The employees are very well compensated to do nothing, it's surprising that all this goes unchecked by the industry.

544,,A terrible place to work!,2018-04-04,1.0,Manager,Compensation - In my opinion the company offered average to slightly above average compensation,"Management - In my opinion the management is completely out of touch with their employees.  They are either completely clueless regarding the corporate strategy or extremely poor at communicating it to their employees.  Either way, this type of disconnect between management and their underlying employees creates a tremendous amount of distrust.  And this distrust leads to employees spending an inordinate amount of time trying to fill in the blanks themselves, which is tremendously counterproductive.  Additionally, many of the people in management positions, particularly at the Sr. management level, attained those positions largely as result of their political clout and not because of any tangible management skills.  

Culture - Some of the management issues outlined above (it is by no means an exhaustive list) has led to a culture of distrust.  Many of the employees spend a good deal of their time trying to fill in the blanks left by the void in leadership.  Still other employees spend their productive time speculating what might happen to the company in the future, just plain gossiping and/or jockeying for their own political position within the organization.  This activity is polarizing and creates an environment wrought with cliques, which in turn leads to the exact opposite of an open, inclusive and productive work culture.

Technology - In my opinion the technology is extremely antiquated.  As a result, it takes significantly more resources to maintain it than it would if it were built on a more modern platform.   Additionally, the outdated and disjointed nature of the technology make it difficult, if not next to near impossible, to accommodate market driven requirement and enhancements."

There's an expectation, recently reinforced by the CEO at a town hall meeting, that you return calls and reply to emails -- no matter what level. Small enough that you can get your ideas heard by the decision makers. Big enough that what you want to get done might actually happen.  

Pay and benefits and all that stuff is good. Medical plan comes with some extra programs, and they just added a legal benefit. Generous paid vacation and just added more time off for new parents and active military.  

There's a lot of community involvement at the different offices.  Short-term volunteer activities but also working with local elementary and high schools and boys and girls clubs. The various employee networks also run a lot of events in the office -- guest speakers, chats with execs, film screenings, holiday mixers.","There's a bit of tension between long-term employees and new people coming in, but that's starting to shift.

574,,One of the worst places to work,2018-01-15,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"Career growth programs, Social events, Remote work options, Performance Bonus, Free Coffee","Bully culture is alive, thriving and encouraged. The company is grossly understaffed and employees are over worked. Upper management is either clueless or simply does not care. HR will listen but will do nothing; it will even count against you. Individual contributors are at the mercy of their managers. There are no checks on the managers however employees are heavily scrutinized.    
Career growth programs are held during working hours. Since most people are over worked participation is near impossible. Social events have a cost associated (even the Holiday party) and are held in the evenings. Since leaving on time is a luxury few have, attendance is difficult. Remote work options are an easy way to squeeze a few more hours out of an employee. Performance bonuses are simply a carrot to force over worked employees to work more. The bonus and compensation topic is brought up ad nauseam. Employees work for every penny; it just evens out the extra non-paid time spent at work.
Promotions are only awarded to those who either never sign off or those who have “friends”. Promotions are more about the prestige and less about pay. Much of the work force is overseas touted as business continuity however it is really just cheaper labor. There is no loyalty to employees since layoffs happen every single October. Layoffs are meant to save money and to open spots to be shipped overseas.  How can you trust a company where the mission statement is not being followed? “Lead with integrity” and “Develop employee potential” are two things that DTCC does not follow."

Staff needs and has requested more guidance and direction but it is too slow in coming.  In spite of working harder, and more efficiently, potential for promotions is limited and is very much based on team size and its management.  Millennials have best chance of getting ‘fast tracked’ and promoted over people with better work ethics, loyalty and experience.  Frequent layoffs (twice a year).

If you are at the sunset of your career and you want to retire there with no possibility of being let go despite demonstrating outstanding incompetency this is the place for you. 
- Management  cares more about politics and holding on to their decaying seats they have had for decades,  than caring about their staff or doing the right thing for the company.
- The prerequisite to become a manager is to have zero people skills. Most managers do not have solid knowledge of the products or their risks and only care about pushing papers, looking busy and saying yes to the man. 
- A lot of talk about diversity but no action at all. The senior management is primarily comprised of older white men.
- Whenever there is a good proposal for improving processes it moves at a frustratingly slow pace that most of the really good workers give up and either leave or go through the motions until they can leave. 
- Too many layers of management. It seems that they try to invent management titles out of the blue to keep people from leaving. However, what ends up happening is that the staff is usually devalued and can't make any decision if it doesn't go through some arbitrary, incompetent management review/approval process. 
- Very opaque performance review process. No one knows what it takes to get to the other level. No one knows what their ratings mean and what are the detailed descriptions of each rating. It's not unusual to get good feedback during the year and then at the end the final rating is not so  great so they can justify giving out a lower bonus to satisfy department politics.

- As other reviews have mentioned, there is a distinct lack of leadership and vision. Very few people could tell you what the goals are for the company moving forward. The problem is that DTCC has a monopoly on the market, so there is no incentive to innovate or do anything different than what they have been doing for years. Once competitors catch up, the company will be in for a rude awakening.
- Things move at a glacial pace and there is too much beaurorcracy. It takes forever to get anything done because it has to be approved by so many different levels of management and committees. It is like a government agency at times.
- No room for advancement at all.  There is a large percentage of people who are just coasting by and clogging up management positions while younger talented employees are leaving for better companies. The company would rather retain these people than promote and pay younger, energetic people.
- The company has been undergoing a cost cutting program they implemented about 2 years ago. They've laid off tons of people and started shifting a ton of employees to the Philippines. My department in the Jersey City office hadn't hired anyone new for a year and a half.

My team has been trying to get a new system approved (actually we have many other products from this one vendor, it will just be a new function).  It's now been 3 months and we still have to get through at least 2 more committees to get it approved.  It should not be this hard to make one change in the organization, but everything seems this way.  It also seems like they don't have a whole lot of money in the bank.  They just sold our non essential products and division.  They are also in middle of their 4 year cost cutting plan and keep moving jobs down to cheaper areas.  Problem with cheaper talent is lesser quality.  They are keeping everyone that has been here for 15+ years in management positions that get paid too much to not have a clue on how to solve the problems of today.  They are still hanging on to that one product they essentially have a monopoly on in the industry. Once someone else figures out how to provide that product, this company is sunk.  

Top management is asking for employee input on what the problems and dissatisfaction boils down to, but does not seem to have a clue on how to fix it. It seems that they are struggling to be a 2017/2018 company."

Constantly updating US employees of initiatives to save money, mostly by cutting jobs twice a year. Still use the stack-rating system, and claim that at least one employee needs an RI(bad) review. Management likes to change their approach almost yearly, introducing new industry standards, approaches and buzz words without any clear plans at implementation, and never appropriate training.  They operate in constant fear that someone will eventually figure out how to do clearing and settlement better, which isn't far off. The amount of fear, lack of proactive management, and current burocracy does not lend itself to DTCC digging itself out of a day 2 company model. And the double talk has most employees so scared they don't knowledge share or work cooperatively. Examples of double talk: ""we have an open-door policy,"" yet HR is now locked to employees unless they call first.  They constantly tell new hires they have flexible work arrangements, when that is far from true. They claim to be customer focused, but any suggestions made to make the customer experience is shot down due to budget constraints. Most departments are working with a skeleton crew, meaning one ""real"" disaster will put this aging company out of it's misery."

624,,Better than most,2017-07-30,5.0,Hard Worker,"DTCC is a company like no other. I have heard many people say the worse day at DTCC is better than the best day elsewhere. To have a great career there are a lot of factors you have to take into consideration. Sadly, many people fail to decode the unique culture which leads to a great and happy career. I hope my review will help you though I will intentionally leave out some of my secrets to what it takes to be successful. 

1. Be a team player. There are more good people than bad at DTCC and most if not all of the bad came from other companies with a cut throat culture. If you are honest, hard-working and positive, your reputation will grow to which you develop the recognition needed for a lateral move or a promotion. 

2. DO NOT BURN bridges no matter how bad a person may have been to you. 

3. Think beyond your job responsibilities and understand how they fit into the big picture. It will make you stand out and placed into the select list of candidates who are eligible for the next level. 

As for the pros here they go. 
1. Great pay- great bonuses. Even on a bad year, your merit and incentives will rarely be affected unless you broke one of the rules I mentioned above. 

2. Great work life balance and management is very receptive to family first demands pending they can trust you getting the work done on time and you are not abusing their trust. 

3. People don't want to leave because hands down, it's one of the best places to work (also a con and I will explain below). Work may be demanding, but it's fairly rewarded during compensation time. 

- All levels of management are approachable and warm. The CEO is not only genuine and funny but you can send him a direct message and he will respond to you. DTCC's open door policy is real and not just for show. 

-Company is trying to promote diversity on all levels in order to become more competitive. 

- even during layoffs, the process is fair and candidates get great severance packages. 

-401k is fully bested since day one, even though the match is lower than most companies.","-People don't want to leave. I mentioned as a pro above but it becomes a con if you are trying to get one of the few opportunities for advancement at or above Director level.  

-Any mistake you made, no matter how far back will be held as a reason for not getting a promotion. You would have to work very hard and develop sponsors in very powerful positions to overcome them and beat out other candidates with clean slates. 

-Mike Bodson's push for diversity is lost in the ranks as Middle Management is fearful of taking the risks, especially when promotions are rare and highly visible. Middle Management rather use someone who they are comfortable with,  who in most cases delineates from the DNI goal, rather than taking risks. 

-Constructive criticisms are rarely given. People will not tell you about your shortcomings but use it against you during hidden conversations about your future. Which brings me to my main point, Management needs to focus more on talent development when they see a diamond in the rough."

Company promises benefits at the time of hiring, like flexibility or WFH, that are not available later on. If flexibility is allowed, it is more done in a manner that the manager is doing you a favor (depending on their personal view on flexibility) rather than a benefit that was part of the package provided by the company. Management very limited in their ways of motivating, developing and appreciating good employees. Unprofessional demeanor of many employees is accepted on a daily basis. One team mindset won't take you far as it is not a firm wide mindset. Managers do other managers favors by engaging their emoloyees in projects that should never belong to them in a first place (totally different department and expertise) but they do it because of office politics. If you are early on/ mid in your career- you will loose your skills over years or won't gain any new ones for sure! This company does not invest in their employees... they just want to utilize the skills you already brought to the table. Integrity is not of a value as long as you get things done."

They are highly paid yet most don't seem to know what they do nor what they bring to the party.  The quality of your time at the company is very dependent on who you work for.  There are many silos and there is still the good ole boys club still exists.  From my experience, the company has gone way down hill over the last decade and beyond.  Numerous new management that has come over from the big investment firms have seriously messed up this company.  The depth of experience is gone through forced layoffs and should another 9/11 ever hit again, this management team will be ill prepared to deal with it like it was dealt with in 2001.  Good luck to us all.   Management keep wanting to generate profit through new enterprises yet they are seem to fail.    Millions and millions of dollars have  been wasted.

A good place for those back office employees no longer needed by the banks as DTCC (incorrectly) regards this as the required skills set.","An excessively political environment where the emphasis is on 'playing the game' rather than doing one's actual job.  The lack of commercial thinking at all levels has led to a litany of high-profile failed initiatives over the past decade.  The pre-eminence of Operations people at the heart of DTCC has led to a back-to-front culture whereby those closest to the clients have to justify their existence to Ops people.  Career progression is based on ingratiating oneself with management, which has led to a preponderence of weak, deferential stooges running the show.  Those with charisma, innovative ideas, and who speak the truth are invariably managed out.  DTCC makes all its meaningful decisions out of the US leading to a US-centric thinking and poor morale in other regions.

Having traveled to a few of the offices to get to know more people around the company, I can say there actually is some talent here. DTCC is actually trying to make a push forward with technology here. However you can feel the new/old blood at work here as far as company culture, company wide problem-solving methodologies, etc. Things are different from department to department. Some departments are highly bureaucratic and full of red tape, while other departments from the VP level all the way down to the trench worker, you feel the camaraderie. Overall, this is a company looking for answers, so if you plan to work here, be ready to work hard and to lead in whatever little capacity the role requires. I've been in 4 different roles at DTCC since my 4-year stead and that maybe due to all the acquisitions the company has experienced. I've seen some bad, but a lot of good because I've been proactive and I didn't come here to 'coast'. DTCC does have some problems and again I can't speak for many other departments so do your due diligence and calculate the angles so that you are not disappointed. Overall, it's a company worth giving a shot. If you don't come here to coast and you can weave the politics a tad bit and take ownership (because a lot of people just are too afraid) you can actually have an impact here, just own it and don't be afraid that your bonus is going to get hit just because you owned it and was not willing to take a risk.

The pay here is solid, its not google/facebook/netflix quality but there's a whole TON of places that pay much worse then here.

Work life balance can be tricky and personally the projects you are involved with dictate that balance. I'll be flat out honest with you and tell you that for about a full year and half when I first started, there was just a ton of work to do, but being proactive, learning how to anticipate, applying improvement, our projects became manageable and the team I was apart of experienced great work life balance up to this point now, but for me that's about to change because of the acquisitions and new projects being dumped on us.

There are some good people here, the culture is moving in the right direction. It's not yet where it needs to be, but from my perspective it's moving in a positive direction.","Health benefits here need a bit of work, there's no dodging that.
HR is not flexible at all (from a pay standpoint) but everyone VP and up seem to be on the same page about that and they're slowly addressing it. From my perspective it's hard to know what can be done to get this resolved sooner rather then later.

Transparency is still an issue here. We talk a lot about it, but it hasn't materialized to the point where your employees stop being suspicious of management all the time."

Many Directors are borderline incompetent. I only say this because numerous lack technical, managerial, and leadership skills. Many have been with the company for 20+ years and are not qualified for their position.

This is probably due to the fact that it was a joint venture between two larger companies. Due to this, sometimes it is difficult to get management to move on some things.
