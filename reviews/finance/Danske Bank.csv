Good work-life balance and flexibility.

My collogues were really good and nice people, and in general I was happy to work there. My direct manager was also a really nice guy, and I liked his people-centric approach.","Low salary comparing to competitors. 
There are 2 important aspects here:
1) - Salary raise is regulated by collective agreement and there is a hard cap of 1-3% per year in a best case scenario, unless you are in a managerial position where you can negotiate. So when you are getting in, you need to make sure that you have pushed them to the edge and squeeze as much as possible, because you will not get any raise.
2) You can still get a raise, but IF and only IF, you got a lot of responsibilities and you became a dependency which is hard to replace. In this situation you will still have to get a better offer from other company, and ask them to beat it. 

Bad upper management.
When a top manager starts a townhall meeting with words : ”I could have been relaxing on Maldivian resort now, but instead I am standing here spending my time to teach you to work properly ” – you just think “WTF??? Is it a joke??”. Extreme arrogance, “look how awesome I am” attitude from the top management, contributes to a working culture where good and sincere people don’t stay for too long. All decisions on the top are taken without considering any feedback from “peasants” at the bottom, who are supposed to blindly follow any orders from kings and dukes on the top. All the low-tier managers only care about ranking up and getting to the top. Nobody want to solve a problem at hand unless it’s a major life-threating issue. Do a nice facade, sweep garbage under the rug and make some nice power points – get promoted, repeat – that’s the success formula if you get there. No one cares about your feedback. This culture results in a low quality software with errors and major public scandals related to this."

Additional holiday (more than lawfully required) for years with company.
Pension benefits - 3rd pillar.
Remote work full time possible.","The offices are ostentatious. Needless gym, expensive buildings, many people who are ballast (wellbeing officers, PR people,). It is suprising, since the company has no customers locally, who are they trying to impress. Employees would be happier to have more money in their salary than to have such exuberance in offices and PR -- enormous amounts spent on that. 
Pay rises are capped, if you have a scaredy manager you won't get more than 10% raise, and you'll be the only one in the team getting that. Others will get raises barely matching inflation. To get a raise you need to quit, work a month elsewhere, and come back.

Younger people get stepped over by more ""senior"" employees, purely based on how long they've been here. Younger employees won't get the positions they apply for even though the feedback is ""You are great for the position"", because they will be passed over because of employees who've been here longer. So qualifications are not something looked at internally for changing positions. 

Scandal after scandal.

Haven't received any trainings for 1,5 years even though I've voiced the issue many many times.

As a bank is a relatively small comparing to other FIs present in Warsaw, often times there is a possibility to participate/support other teams and learn different processes, so there is a room for professional development and net-working with people in another countries (only if you stay pro-active and not just sitting and waiting for a miracle to happen).
Family-like atmosphere, egalitarianism etc. all the good staff :) 
Co-workers based in Denmark are professionals and very nice people.","salary - not above avarage on the market, some might say that package of benefits is a little bit worse than in another banks (but difference is not significant). In Warsaw there is a difference between the teams (some teams are just much better in terms of people, management and process). My team was amazing, as well as my manager, but i know teams where atmosphere was extremely odd. So it differs but as in any company. 
Another fact: In FCC AML/KYC hub work mostly Polish citizens, so this environment is hard to call international if someone is looking for this kind of experience.

there is no focus on personal development, you can grow if you actively transfer between departments by pursuing an internal interview process. in your area you will get more tasks only of other people would leave. 

this means that once you joined, you're just kind of there so some choose to work and some don't. I have colleagues with no tasks while the team in IN works an average of 10 hours a day (on a good month). this is, to say the least, non-respectful.

Funding for training (certificates, conferences),
Interesting colleagues","I had horrible experience working in the bank, mostly because of the management. Key points:

Abusive manager. (offensive language behind closed doors, shouting in open space environment, smearing campaign while leaving by talking lies behind the back, which later were disproved by colleagues). The manager later quit. 

Frustrating experience with HR. There were things reported to the HR. I wasn't contacted by HR for more information. No feedback, no request for more information, I wasn't involved in investigation if there was any. Was in the dark the whole time, having no idea if at least some investigation was in progress. Lack of feedback from HR was really frustrating.

Performance review is highly subjective. Skills, experience and contributions to the project do not matter. The only thing which matters is how manager sees you from his own perspective, because he is the one giving the score. The score can be easily impacted by your personal relationship with the manager. And there was no way to evaluate your direct manager, no luck talking with higher manager. 

Culture of fear. If there is a problem, ignore the problem. Report the problem, you become the problem. This is the actual philosophy used by the managers.
Managers were incompetent both in understanding and in solving team issues and people feared to do something about toxic environment inside the team and this behavior encouraged toxic people to do as they please. The stress levels at some point were simply unbearable not because of the actual work related tasks, but because of constant conflicts with particular people. Mix of Peter's principle, good relationship with the management and culture of fear were the reason toxic people were allowed in the team.  Management did nothing.

Peter principle. Quite obvious in engineering staff. People held their titles because of past accomplishments which were little related to the current technology stack, which resulted in juniors doing lion's share of work, including teaching senior members how to implement basic tasks.

Worth to mention, bureaucracy. It took time to get used to it."

A good stepping stone for your career, as Danske Bank are great at finding A level people for C level tasks.","Developing IT at Danske Bank moves at a glacial pace, and it is more often than not completely impossible to find out whether project directions are based on product interests,  or just out of strategic organisational interests.
During my time at Danske Bank, I have experienced more than once that priorities have changed in the middle of a project, to something completely different, leaving a half-finished product to wait around for weeks, or even months.

I have seen (multiple times) developers in projects for months at a time, which ends up being thrown away because the product owner stops caring about it.

A developer in Danske Bank typically spends 30% of their time doing development work. The rest is spent on things like customer support, meetings, and whatever. In all honesty, we could spend 50% less time at the office and still get the same amount of development done.

The issues in Danske Bank has lead to challenges in attracting new talent. This leads to single individuals being the only maintainers of certain parts of software, which again means that entire development processes can be blocked if these individuals have time off or are sick.

The Bank has an extremely strict software policy, which means you can only use exactly those tools that the central IT group has whitelisted.
Their decisions are opaque and made within their own group, which means they aren't up for discussion, and neither do you get to know at least who made the decisions in the first place.
You probably won't get to work with your preferred tools."
