- Not stressful at all
- Great people to work with","I honestly think that this organization is great but they have too many flaws :
- complicated system and name for everything
(so the calendar got a distinct application and a name, the list of clients got a name, everything got a name ... and the system is full of useless stuff, not straightforward. Imagine a phone coming with one App for calls, a different one for contacts, one for Voicemail, and they take time to load, don't communicate with each other = that's exactly what it feels like)
- the HIERARCHY PLS, they are so stuck with that silly hierarchy system that we do not know who does what, but lets say you want to tell your manager that you taking a break, well you need to tell your team leader 1st so that he will tell you manager.
- Last but not least, the training was Qbc focused, so I didnt learn nothing and I cannot find ressources when I need them. You need to open a basic account, remember my 1st point, it's so complicated that you will need time to remember, and only your people can help you. The system doesn't have a tutorial to help... WELP
- all basics roles are occupied by immigrants or not canadian born people, but higher role by people with less education .. Oops, I meant Canadians.
- Last but no least : Nepotism ? don't look for promotions, you will get frustrated."

I was based in Ontario, however my team was based in Quebec. Opportunities for high achievers are accessible to most, that said the challenges with politics (internal & external) are quite evident.","Generally speaking most educated and civilized people will act with professionalism and respect to those who are different. Even if they didn’t agree with the person’s views, opinions or existence, they act cordially. For the most part, the majority of my former colleagues are kind and amazing human beings. That said, there is a large population within the organization that proudly displays their xenophobic behaviour, almost to the extent it could be viewed as ‘hostile’. 

I am a visible minority and a proud Canadian. My first language is English and I was born in Ontario. Many people in this organization will make you feel inadequate because you’re “Anglo” or because of the colour of your skin. It has gotten to the point that I developed a serious phobia of travelling to QC for work. 

I have many experiences over the years but the most painful one was when a colleague refused to shake my hand or acknowledge me during my work trip to QC, they don’t hesitate to show you how they feel about you. 

No salary, benefits or perks was worth feeling like a second class citizen on a regular basis. I know this review seems harsh, but believe me, it’s the truth.  I was sad to leave the many relationships I’ve built, but at the same time was relieved that I didn’t have to subject myself to another xenophobic incident."

- Working environment: Professional and very friendly working environment, and mazing colleagues. My mentor and manager was great. As someone writing exams, it was nice to have people from work to support you. Additionally, it was nice that managers (at least mine) understood your situation and would plan your agenda accordingly. 

- Professional growth: For me, it was a good place to grow as an actuary. It is an environment where people encourage you to gain more ""tools"" in your ""toolbox"". Communication with your mentor and your manager about your professional goals and your plan on how to achieve these goals are very important. Various opportunities to explore other aspects of insurance business other than actuarial work. 

- Work-life balance: I guess this is a case-by-case scenario because it was depend on the project and the manager. For me, my experience was great. Always felt being challenged at work, but my work never asked me to sacrifice unnecessary time.

They promise to promote from within but will interview you as a formality then hire externally with no explanation
They expect you to never use sick days, and always work within the 4 weeks of vacation time given to you.

If you've been on sick leave for burnout or depression,  it can be very difficult to go back without being judged, even by manag. Depends on your manager's mentality. Desjardins has great HR policies in place, but good luck getting any support from them if your manager doesn't support these policies.  HR does nothing unless the manager does something illegal. So you can be stuck in a grey zone with a bad manager and no support from HR. Some managers, as some of us have found out, keep an Excel file with comments on each employee. The comments are subjective, sometimes mean, and contain very personal information (i.e., personal situation, illnesses, ...) When the file was sent out to everyone by a manager by mistake, they told everyone to delete it and asked IT to go on our computers and remove the file. They covered the whole incident. But employees saw the content and some were devastated. Difficult to trust management after something like that."

Once Desjardins took over they enforced their plan which includes overworking employees while telling them how great the work-life balance is, constantly having meetings about meetings, dumping non-field claims on field adjusters when they already have extremely large files to deal with, and not listening to employees. Employee morale especially former State Farmers is extremely low yet management will make you believe otherwise. I miss working for State Farm. Upper management is a disaster and don’t care about their employees wellbeing (but hey... at least their annual waste of time meetings and daily emails make it seem like we are all happy and no complaints at all!). It’s truly saddening when you hear multiple people going on stress leave or people that don’t like their jobs anymore. Most toxic workplace I’ve ever been a part of."

826,Desjardins,"Comme ci, comme ca",2018-01-09,3.0,Anonymous Employee,"- Easy work / life balance. People generally start work between 8 & 9 but by 5:00 the office is a ghost town. (Internal tech support shuts down at 5:00 as I found out when I called them late one day.)
- People are generally very nice.
- Some people have worked there for decades. I'm not sure this is necessarily a ""pro"", but it's interesting.
- Like any other large corporation, there's a focus on cost control but if you can justify an expense, there won't be any huge pushback.","- There are a bewildering number of silos in the company. Any large corporation has silos; but at Desjardins there seem to be silos for no particular reason.
- The company is solidly based in Quebec. That's actually kind of neat, but the problem is that many people speak only French and solutions tend to be French-based. If you're based in the province of Quebec, this makes sense. But Desjardins has stated that a major goal is to expand westwards. This will never be realized successfully if the company is insistently stuck in French mode. Don't get me wrong - I like the French language and I think it's neat working in a company where French is as prevalent as it is. But the language of business is English and having people (in HR for example or in tech support) who only speak French is not an advantage.
- Here and there, there are bright managers who shine and provide direction. Overall though there's very little top-down direction and hardly any ownership. HR is essentially non-existent. Building management is centred in Montreal, even for offices that are in Ontario. Want the heat raised or lowered? Fill out a form (in French) and email it to someone who sits 600km away.
- Because of this lack of ownership / accountability, it's really easy for people to not do anything and let issues fester. Creating forward momentum is something you need to dig deep and find within yourself to keep pushing forward on things."

Literally nothing else is a pro for working here. The pay, working conditions, and career opportunities are horrendous.","Salary ranges are awful as are annual ""raises"" which are in fact cost of living adjustments.
Absolutely no pay increases or rewards of any kind that reward good performance. 
Management treats staff (even very talented senior staff) like 2nd class citizens, who expects major cost cutting to all aspects of daily work life making the average day frustrating and irritating, while management attends meeting after meeting, sometimes at off site locations with 4-5 star accommodations and meals.
Subjective, useless annual performance appraisals that offer no objective measure of staff performance.
Wage suppression is a top priority with internal websites that actually outline how managers should explain to their staff why they are only average and should not get a higher raise other than the before mentioned COLA. No objective evidence is used to support their assessment of staff performance.
Micromanagement is a huge problem as you will not have nearly enough authority to do your job, even if you have decades of experience doing it. 

0 opportunity for higher education  (unless you count C.I.P.). Internal ""training"" initiatives shouldn't even be called training as the subject matter has 0 relevance to the target audience.

You will not have any chance at advancement unless you are a relative of or in a relationship with a current member of management.

Do not apply here or work here for any reason unless you are desperate.  If your current employer is a target for a takeover, get out before the deal is completed.  Staff morale is as low as one could possibly imagine. Turnover levels are significantly higher than at other companies in the industry."

No incentive to go above and beyond. Payscale lower than most financial/insurance companies in Canada. Important decisions are taking longer to make (major change in executive team in 2016); implementation of new rules/policies coming from Head Office (out of province) don't particularly bode well locally; changes take too long to implement if at all; merger with another insurer created some duplicity and difference in business cultures were more obvious."
