0,Edelweiss Financial Services,very employee friendly company,2022-04-09,5.0,Collection Manager,It will give you all support to work.,nothing as such that I have noticed in 2 years
1,Edelweiss Financial Services,Don't expect salary,2022-04-02,3.0,Associate,Great learning experience and supportive manager.,No work life balance at all.
2,Edelweiss Financial Services,Good,2022-03-31,3.0,Wealth Manager,"Good environment, nice work culture","Not much, work life balance"
3,Edelweiss Financial Services,About the Company,2022-03-30,5.0,Assistant Manager,The company is well organised and employee centric.,Looking for a Switch to another company.
4,Edelweiss Financial Services,No work life balance and No good working culture,2022-03-29,3.0,Associate,There are many things to learn here.,Doesnâ€™t have a good working culture and no work life balance.
5,Edelweiss Financial Services,No future growth,2022-03-25,1.0,Credit Risk Analyst,"1. Work will not be that difficult, so you will get job stability if you're ready to the repeatetive work for years. 
2. General pros like insurance, salary on time and total of 21 leaves a year.
3. HR's are dumb as usual, nothing new but they do listen sometimes to your problem and can solve for it, like close friend took help in claiming medical insurance and third party was not passing the claim. So, HR did some good work in that case.","1. As I mentioned, no growth can be expected as there will be repeatetive work you will doing. My boss spent 10 years in company and he was doing same work for 8 years before he left.
2. Office politics (though it depends on dept to dept) but assss-lickers do get favour over hard workers.
3. No innovative business models, just old traditional ones - "" Give loans directly to some shady builders and earn interest on it"" and then covering NPA's by making shell companies. So, if you like this work, go for Edelweiss or if you like the growth and money, staw away from this company
4. Average salary and almost no salary hikes. I didn't get any salary hike for 2 years (along with rest of the department in case you're wondering if I was even eligible for), though they were pretty generous in giving bonuses (as what I have heard from some colleagues) when business were going smooth but those days are over. So, don't join in hope for bonus or even salary hikes.
5.Strict dress code. They do make a big deal if you're wearing complete formal attire, but not what they expected and you will be getting good lecture over this!
Though girls have literally freedom to wear anything, several times it was not even formal. So, girls can chill and boys must have to wear formal as per their requirements."

- WORST EXPERIENCE of JOINING THE IT TEAM.","Note: This review is very specific to ""Edelweiss General Insurance -IT function/team"" (and not about the entire organisation )

- HIRE & FIRE mindset of newly joined ""IT CTO"". Extremely Rude, full of EGO, bully, repetitive and intentional aggressive behaviour to destroy the employees morale, mental balance by constantly insulting and pressurising in front of peers. ""My Way or High way"" attitude with Zero listening skills and No empathy. Due to Poor Leadership of the CTO, the overall IT culture is extremely TOXIC with Zero trust and team bonding among the team members. No work ethics, weak leadership, zero respect, rude dialect in meetings and extremely aggressive behaviour. 

- HR is only interested to hiring and trapping candidates to join the company to meet their targets in order to fill the resources. Post that they don't bother to take feedback and even after giving feedback, they just ""NOTE"" it down with zero assurance of having any action taken on it. 

- NO clue in what sense the IT work and whatsoever happening in the IT landscape. 

- If you join from MNC's or big organisation, be ready to be surprised in joining a STARTUP IT mindset setup of work wherein you will be greeted with non-industry process and work style and lot of shouting and foul language in the meeting by the IT CTO."

516,Edelweiss Financial Services,Sinking ship as far as Markets Division is concerned,2018-06-13,1.0,Anonymous Employee,Best reasons to work are now a matter of past,"The new management is extremely ordinary, lacks leadership qualities. Good people started leaving right after the departure of previous floor head. People who come to office for cheap politics, undisciplined chaps and non-profit generating teams are finding current atmosphere as heaven. They have been treated tightly in the past but now they are all now spreading their dirt across because there is no one to check them. Present management is too insecure about themselves.

There is not even a single senior guy on floor with whom you can talk some logical stuff. Even if there is one then you will find him too angry from the firm for obvious reasons. 

The people who actually generate profits are not paid fairly. The people who recently lost money crazily walked away with better bonuses just because they had good relationship with team head and his head (both of them I will say hopeless).

Very strict advice to Juniors - fresh grads and 1-3 years work exp. category - Do not buy their bonus story which they try to sell while making you to compromise on fixed salary hike. They want a horse at a price of donkey so that donkeys there can keep earning well and yes, they have been lucky so far. 

When you join them from college, that is how it goes:
 - You remain tensed in first year that you are at the bottom among your batch mates as far as fixed salary is concerned
- They keep showing you dream of better pay-off which they keep delaying year-on-year
- While having a dream in your mind for a big bonus, you will keep spending hours and hours in office
- Other old chaps will keep copying your stuff
- Finally, you will not get credit for whatever you do as same has already been copied and secretly presented
- Then on payment day, they will give some random story and one more dream for next year
- You come back home and you criticize why on earth have I not taken this Glassdoor review seriously
- Even by the time you realize your past mistake to join and spend time in this firm, it has been too late
- The atmosphere has already made you unemployable. Rest of the smart firms know the truth of this firm. They will never hire you. Even headhunters make fun of the interviews being conducted in Kalina office.
- Their offer letters are the biggest jokes. You tell them expected number as 11 lakhs, number offered is 4.5 lakhs after wasting so much time in long long interviews.
- Another review that I overheard while sitting on my desk is that - One reason why this firm conducts so many interviews is that they try to extract market information / trading strategies from experienced people
- Extremely unprofessional people riding the wave that previous heads set-up"

521,Edelweiss Financial Services,Dirty low level politics,2018-05-13,1.0,Anonymous Employee,There are still few really good people to work with who have made their names in Indian market.,"Lot of people who have now grown up to team head levels were hired 10-12 years back when nobody really knew the name of Edelweiss. Their colleagues moved on and they remained here as no one else in the market hired them. They are all very ordinary but expect recent grads to do some award winning research for them so that these ordinary team heads can go upstairs to present it to Senior Management and justify their existence. 
Loyalty (massaging) has more points than hard work now-a-days.
HR is extremely unprofessional and irritating - One friend of mine was interviewed by these ordinary team heads. His salary was higher than any of them. HR offered him to join with 50% cut in fixed while telling the usual false high bonus story that they tell everyone. He declined and his salary figures are now out in public - he is now facing lot of difficulties due to all this. Everything was going fine in his life until the day he appeared there for an interview.
If you take a day off, team manager gets angry.
Annual leaves are few as well.
They can call you to work on saturdays (without anything in return), they can call you to cancel your vacations in between to prove your passion for the job even for a small thing that team manager can not handle in your absence.
To get the work done, you have to interact with extremely low IQ, low-level old employees who are way too adamant to make you fail in your work. These old employees by default have grudge with new ones as they are extremely sensitive to their job security. They know this fact that no one else will hire them. Daily chit chat in the bay is way too low quality conversation and on all kind of poor jokes that team head cracks - you have to laugh at it. If you didnt  - be ready for a cut in bonus. All the money that your team head owes to you is included in Bonus number. He keeps extracting money from you in one form or the other throughout the year. Even team head sometimes pressurizes recent grads to take bet against him and then asks them to transfer money in his paytm in the next minute. Uncles at Edelweiss throughout the year are non-drinkers untill the Titans night - all of them attack on drinks like wild animals attack on flesh."

- There are enough examples of promoting people linked to you by marriages/old friendships over other deserving candidates. Overall a culture where few seniors are forming their own coterie and ensuring that pedigreed employees are looked over...
- Quality of people working in the company is quite patchy. One might have a guy from the best B school in the country and somebody who is a plain graduate in the same team at the same level. The worst part is that the mgt views both the people in the same category or in lot of cases the person working longer in the company is seen as more important than the brains of the better pedigreed employee.. 
- Majority of people in senior positions are people who were good for the company some 10 years ago.. Now since the scale of the business has changed and the employees working in the company are no longer sub par resources, you need to give them training to work with millennial  current generation employees."
