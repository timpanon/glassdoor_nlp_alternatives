6,Edenred,Nightmare to work for and a nightmare to work with,2022-03-01,1.0,Territory Account Manager,"25 Days annual leave

Access to flexible benefits (buy & sell, pension etc) and employee savings site. These are the same solutions you'll be selling into clients

£97 monthly top-up on a pre-paid Mastercard which can be spent on food & drink","Late or withheld commissions or incentives (in excess of 30 days, often much much longer). Management will often fail to provide any clear reasoning as to the delay or why payments are being withheld. This applied to currently employed or staff who had recently left. Practice is to say its delayed by ""two weeks"" and hope its forgotten. The same is done to staff who are about to leave, past their effective last day at which point management will no longer communicate with you. Sadly this is seen to the extent of £1,000s and not just £1s! DO NOT RELY ON TIMELY PAYMENT OR THESE SUMS.

Capped commission. Accelerators are in place, however your commission will not exceed over a 12 month period £10,000. 

This is a cold lead generating role, masking as account management or warm client nurturing. You'll be given up to 1,000 clients to ""manage"", however their sales database is so poorly kept, the vast majority of client contacts will not be current. An for those which are correct, engagement is so poor, clients will be unaware of who Edenred are or wouldn't of been aware of a change in their account management. You'll receive very few leads from Marketing and will be hitting targets on your own generation ability.

Poor office environment. Staff break-room / kitchen was removed in late 2020 / early 2021. This was never replaced and staff either eat at their desk or in their cars (if they have been able to park at the office, the business doesn't lease enough parking spaces for the number of staff based in the Chester office which causes friction with other tenants). You'll hear lots of plans about incoming improvements to the current office or that they are looking at moving, a lot of talk and little action.

Business is missing clear organisational process, organigram to find those responsible or who can assist and too many departments that operate inefficiently or fail to take responsibility for tasks. If you are looking to get something done to close a sale or help a client, prepare to go through a mountain of pain to potentially achieve something simple. I have never worked somewhere where its even been made difficult for a client to pay the business! This poor structure, over many many years has lead to continued tension and in-fighting between departments.

Annual employee engagement results are not shared (I suspect due to how negative they were). There needs to be more ownership of internal issues and communication on these. Silence is louder than talking."
