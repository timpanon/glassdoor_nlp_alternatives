CEO Approval
Business Outlook
Pros

work from home opportunity
safe working environment
good 401k match & benefits

Cons

constant mandatory OT
no chance to balance with family, school, hobbies, life
the volume is ridiculous
company takes on more work than can be supported by staff
bad technological initiatives which make job worse
no real chance to move up
department is understaffed with worst attrition I've seen in 4 years
employees are not a priority to employer and they will remove all tools for development like meetings with manager, team, any time for training

Advice to Management

Prioritize employees wellbeing
manage resources better with voluntary overtime and real financial incentive like double time rather than lunch coupons which are taxable income
Do not cancel meetings with managers or team. Feeling like part of a team is an essential factor in surviving the busier & more stressful times."

The upper management will constantly talk about how well the company is doing but I am struggling to pay my bills with the terrible pay. They don't take care of their employees at all. The company could be doing well or poorly and it wouldn't make any difference to me. I believe they will eventually go bankrupt, it's just a matter of time."

35,,RUN RUN RUN,2022-02-20,1.0,Systems Analyst,You can quit - not QUITE an indentured servant but they'd like that,"Managers, management, HR, coersice and tyrannical culture, and just about ever else."
36,,Stay away - should be your last option,2022-02-16,1.0,Data Analyst,"Depending on the team, you may get to work with some good and smart people.
Quality of work again depending on your team.","Providing this detailed review after working for Empower for more than 2 years. To sum up everything, this is a company that does not care about employees.

1: Constantly being bombarded with the messaging that the company is growing. Yes, this is the second largest record keeper in the US. However, employees absolutely get no benefit from it apart from more work.

2: Maintaining work life balance is extremely difficult. Stretching for 2-3 hours has become a norm and you are expected to work late hours because ""its just not you everyone is busy""

3: Empower being based out of Denver, your shift ends at 11PM. There are no flexibility around this as your calendar will be blocked with meetings you cannot push.

4: HR policies/ practices are designed to be effective against Employees' best interest.

5: Your increment cycle is from Jan to Dec. However, your new salary is only effective from March, with no arrears being paid out for the month of January and February. Therefore, effectively the increment cycle is from March to March and you loose out on payments for two months.

6: Your base salary would be below market standard and increments are also below market average- For example in a stellar year increments were in a range of 6-9%.

7: Career progression is also very difficult, people are stuck with the same designation for years. The company is also not transparent about the growth process and procedures.

8: HR recently took a decision to increase the notice period from 60 to 90 days without taking any feedback from employees. Thus, making it again extremely difficult for employees to look for better opportunities outside.

9: The company was not able to provide office equipment to employees from last 2 years. I am still working on my personal laptop for office work."
37,,Typical Corporate America,2022-02-16,2.0,Information Technology,"Good Pay
Work from Home
AWESOME Co-Workers
""ok"" Benefits - could be better
Definitely stay busy","* Understaffed teams (for YEARS) We used to have solid experienced & well staffed teams in I.T. but that fell apart about 3 years ago when new management started letting people go or driving them away with all the madness. Short staffed teams are now expected to carry the workloads that would normally require 2-3x the amount of staff with workloads constantly increasing. Be ready for ""just get it done"" instead of ""get it done right"".

* Training - this company used to be AWESOME with trainging!  They would sign you up and pay in full any class that was beneficial to your job.  As of several years ago, the training is non-existent.  If you want training, you have to train on your OWN time & on your OWN budget.  

* Lack of solid leadership. Management loves to refer to themselves as ""leaders"" but don't be fooled. This management from top-to-bottom are managers. Leaders get in the trenches and lead the teams. Management sits in the ivory towers and directs folks. It appears the biggest concern on upper management's list is bringing in more business and rushing through solutions. with ridiculous deadlines. It's certainly not the well-being of the employees. In fact, I RARELY am able to touch base with my manager. He's always wrapped up in calls/meetings/etc. that take his availability away from his team. We practically manage ourselves.  

* No one listens to concerns - including HR. I've brought up my concerns for this organization with the HR dept. but nothing fruitful ever resulted. We continue to see short staffed teams with increasing workloads."

42,,"Great Company, Alright Job",2022-02-08,5.0,Retirement Representative Call Center,"I've only titled this job as an ""alright"" job because working in a call center is not for everyone. I don't recommend it, honestly. However, it is a great way to get a foot into the company. You do get to learn ropes of retirement plans. Empower is a rapid growing company and there is a lot of room for growth here. Many of the people you interact with in training and supervisory roles have been here for years and love it. People are professional here. My manager is supportive. In my role, I enjoy that I get to help people with their retirement accounts. For now, we are working from home. There are resources and support that help me do my job. There is overtime opportunities when it gets busy.","I initially enjoyed having a set, structured schedule. But it can also feel very restrictive. Working in a role where you are repeatedly doing the same thing and interacting with all kinds of participants all day can be draining and can take a toll on your mental health. Within my first month on being on phones, I immediately wanted to do something else. Working in a call center environment is a big adjustment. Turn over is pretty high. In addition to this, it's been very busy so we are on the phone all day. There are no breaks in between calls. Calls come in right after another. You have to be in the call center role for at least a year to move within the department or 18 months to move to a different department. This is not so much a con, but I wonder how likely moving into a different role is. There is also mandatory overtime when it gets busier."

69,,I do not recommend working here unless you are desperate for a job,2022-01-24,1.0,Anonymous,"- Good culture. Most coworkers are supportive, social and just all around genuine people.
- CEO has a good vision for the future of the retirement industry
- Lots of job security--Zero layoffs while I was there and they don't fire you unless you are really bad at your job or you are not hitting your goals. 
- With Covid, everyone is working remotely. 
- Benefits coverage includes $50 wellness credit every pay period. 
- 5% 401k match.","- Lots of job security also means pay is sub par and below market average. 
- Medical (UHC), dental and vision coverage is OK, but could be much better. 
- For lower bands, annual pay bumps are small (max of 3-5%), but as you get more tenure, regardless of how well you do your job, you hit a ceiling and the max bump percentage drops because you are considered to have a ""high"" salary. 
- Also, for lower bands, annual company bonuses are $2k-3k max depending on company performance.
- Lots of people in higher roles have absolutely NO idea what they're doing and end up making everyone else's jobs much more difficult. 
- Don't expect to be making a lot at Empower unless you are in sales or a commission based role which pays ALOT more (base between $50-100k plus monthly bonuses between $5-15k). 
- Too many issues with company software/ applications. Lots of crashes/ server issues regularly every week. Calling the help desk will become an almost daily task.
- You cannot invest in company stock nor the company stock fund
- You get about 4-5+ weeks off (tenure based) and you can carry over days year to year, but there's no point when you can't use more than a few days at a time, some days are blacked out because too many people are already requesting time off, business needs prevent time from being approved, etcetera.
- Of course, no sick days. That's what vacation days are for. 
- This happened to a coworker of mine -- If you make a mistake 2 years ago and you're still within the same department (say some work you did was incorrectly quality checked before the data was sent to the client), it WILL come back to bite you in the rear and management WILL hold it against you regardless of how stellar your work has been.
- Unless your position requires series licenses or professional certifications, you can't work towards getting any at all
- Depending on the department, training can be and usually is very unstructured
- Hard to go to other departments or switch roles unless you're great in your current role and you know someone who can refer you to whatever department you want to go to
- MICROMANAGING especially in departments where you're not a high level individual contributor
- For a company that's the 2nd largest retirement services provider in the country, you'd expect a higher 401k company match (5%)."

I also believe the onboarding process was very effective. I also enjoy the flexibility on work from home/the ability to create a schedule that makes sense for you.",You are constantly being reminded of goals and being pushed to make as much money for the company. The goal should always be the best advice as opposed to what makes the most money for the company.

102,,Great place to work,2021-12-14,5.0,Senior Quality Analyst,Everything is right here and employees friendly environment,Nothing much and all is well
103,,Good first job,2021-12-13,1.0,Senior Retirement Representative,"There's not much good about this role. The benefit is that the company is willing to train new hires, which depends on the trainers. My training was in person before covid. The trainers were amazing. That may not be the case for everyone. The pay is okay for someone fresh out of college with no experience. It is stable during the pandemic, and you have the ability to work from home. The benefits are decent, nothing outstanding.","A lot of cons

Be prepared for something to go wrong with the systems at least 3 times per week. Whatever Empower uses is ancient. 

There is a rather negative energy floating around. Everyone wants to leave, and no one wants to take another call. There is very little opportunity to move in the company, even for those overly qualified to change. The call center is an 18-month commitment before you can switch. Empower tries to keep people in the call center so other roles are never advertised internally.

You'll be bombarded by emails that don't matter to you. Your important meetings will be canceled when the call volume is high so it's up to you to learn about any changes. 

Empower focuses on customers, not their employees. However, everything that is implemented doesn't actually help anyone. There is a huge disconnect between call center workers and upper management. Instead of listening to reps, reps become statistics. Empower claims to focus on the customer, but instead of giving customers the proper tools to help them better understand their accounts, Empower makes everything harder and more confusing. It's not surprising why there's a high call volume. No one can actually log in online without being locked out, which requires calling in to unlock the account or to wait 24 hours. Online access is like going to war with the app or website.

Empower is severely lacking the manpower to handle this many customers and plans. Every employee is burnt out and exhausted, but upper management keeps acquiring new plans to expand. 

The pay is not as competitive as they make it out to be. After working and being abused by rude customers, you get 2%-3% raise possibly. There are incentives, but they're mostly sending out $5 gift cards that count toward taxable income."
104,,The Interview gets you in with lies,2021-12-13,2.0,Participant Services Representative,"Pay
Work from Home
Medical, dental, vision
Equipment provided","ALL POSITIVE REVIEWS ARE DONE BECAUSE THEY ARE TOLD TO. THEY ARE NOT THE TRUTH.

I was contacted through email for an interview via zoom. Which the first time the recruiter didn't show up, which should have been my first clue, so a second one was rescheduled. During the interview, I was told all these great things and made all these promises. Unlimited PTO, Monday- Friday work schedule, overtime IF WANTED, career advancement, etc. Thats what sold me on the job but I was mistaken. 

During the first part of orientation was good, was learning a-lot and starting to like it, then it went down hill from there. The Monday- Friday schedule that was offered ended up being a lie, we were told Saturdays would be mandatory. Then as training went on, the amount of information was just piled on without giving us time to digest. Constantly being told phone calls are recorded, if you say certain words you could fail a call and be coached. Couldn't leave desk, UNLESS it was break or lunch time. If you are a minute late, you get coached, if you clock out late you get coached. You can't say work like ""y'all"" or ""ma'am or sir"" because they are now part of WOKE culture, but not because they care, only because of how it looks on them. SPENT 2 DAYS listening to a diversity and inclusion training. When we had a-lot of questions or wanted to discuss things so we understood the, we were told we couldn't because their wasn't time. Basically they wanted to train us as fast as they could to handle the call volume without adequately training us. 

The company may be great but their constant micromanaging and LACK of training made me hate it 2.5 weeks in. Even when side by sides were starting, employees who've been there a while were letting us know the scoop. You'll constantly be micromanaged and coached over the LITTLEST things. Even if you ""move up"" in the call center, you don't get a raise. You just get more call volume and a different title. This company is a joke."

Most everyone in the role had no idea about what being a good financial advisor was all about and its importance. 

They employ brand new advisors in roles that accept leads generated by significantly more experienced ones.

Their administrative fees are about 2% in addition to an account management fee of 60 bps and these clients don’t get a dedicated representative.

12 months in your role before you can apply elsewhere within the company even if you’re doing well and are more qualified than other candidates, thereby forcing you to quit if you get tired of your job.

- Brand recognition continues to grow 
- Excellent benefits (401k matching, excellent healthcare with HSA funding, unlimited PTO)
- Big enough company that you can transfer to other positions if you network well
- CEO cares about this work and the people
- Colleagues are generally nice and down to earth; employees often make lifelong friends here; most employees are older and have families, and work to live vs living to work
- Resources like LinkedIn Learning and tuition support are available for go-getters who want to learn 
- A good place to absorb and grow your skills, especially for early career professionals","- Talent management’s main concern is keeping costs (aka salaries) low rather than hiring the brightest minds and proactively retaining talented employees. Expect annual raises that are below cost of living increases and bonuses between 5-8% for levels below AVP (vs senior leaders who are bonused at 100%+ of base)
- Investment in DE&I is surface-level and has much room for improvement (like compensating ERG leaders and building out a dedicated DE&I team) 
- Promotions are often political rather than performance-based; no clear path to advancement; managers are coached around saying no during salary conversations but not coached around advancing deserving talent. Managers that do try to promote their directs are discouraged from doing so. Many managers feel stuck and/or ineffective and unable to adequately support their teams. Good managers ultimately leave. 
- Top performers don’t stay, which leaves skills gaps in important functions and impacts morale
- High turnover and an attitude of “we’ll just hire someone else” leads to burned out, overworked recruiters who don’t have bandwidth to maintain an empathetic, human-centric recruiting process 
- Tech stack is behind the curve. We were using Office 2013 in 2019. New hires expecting to use Slack and Zoom will be disappointed. General knowledge of technology among the average employee is poor."

Empower completed 4 acquisitions in 2020 and early 2021 - I don't know any other company that did this in the midst of the pandemic. Empower is growing and while this takes a lot of hard work which sometimes requires longer hours, it is exciting to be part of the momentum and many associates have been able to grow, expand and learn new skills.
Empower has a great benefits program and in many areas of the organization they will continue to offer flexible work arrangements and opportunities to work remotely even after reopening the offices.

Since Empower was formed as a combination of different companies they are really open to change or finding a best practice workflow.

Unlimited PTO for salaried associates.,too cheap for employee tech hardware (out of laptops??) and really limited on industry and travel reimbursements.

2. Onboarding experience -
People were always ready to help in case I had any questions wrt any of the employee policy or technology. In the ""Empower U"" session, which was conducted as an orientation for all new comers, relevant and much needed information was shared, and company's values were emphasized. I was really touched when i got an email recognising my active participation in the session. They walk the talk which is commendable!

Casual dress code.,"Been there for several years and multiple departments are always understaffed and that is intentional.  Understaffing means lots of stress for everyone because we’re all stretched too thin. Zero time to do any career development or training. Taking a vacation is encouraged, but when you come back you’re digging out of emails for days, really discouraging. Overall not enough focus on appreciating employees. No holiday party for example. Too much of a sweat shop mentality and working employees to the bone. This includes low level  managers. They also have way too much on their plates and have no time to focus on their teams. They’re in meetings all day. Or dealing with escalations on a daily basis, another result of multiple departments being understaffed issues arise. Empower would strongly benefit from getting mid level managers and above sig sigma certified. Decisions are made at the top with no input or consideration how it will impact all parties.  Mid to high level managers very disconnected from low level employees. 

No HR on site and no phone number is advertised to call. You have to basically open a ticket to talk to HR and wait for them to email you. Seems like they don’t want to talk to employees via phone unless they have to. Very odd. 

Benefits are not competitive. A local top competitor  in the industry does a 7% 401(k) match plus 10% profit sharing. Empower offers 4% match and 2 -5% profit sharing."

LOTS of phones and customers coming in, some clerical work. A real administrative professional is wasted here. Customers often verbally abusive and you just have to take it.

Co. doesn' describe jobs accurately in their postings. My job is nothing like I thought I was signing on for, and some coworkers have said this too. 

If you're lucky enough to be somebody's favorite you might get projects to show your stuff and move up. A lot of times it's a matter of being ""tapped on the shoulder."" They're making a big push now for diversity--gender, orientation, ethnicity. But they not age. They're more interested in opportunities and career paths for younger workers.

Bullying--if you're not ""one of the crowd"" God help you. You'll never hear the end of your mistakes. You'll be left out of information you need, people will freeze you out and talk about you negatively where you can hear them."

Communicative leadership; CEO regularly updates us far in advance about COVID plans (e.g. not returning to office until at least September 2021), and managers provide very clear expectations and reviews. There is a lot of room to climb upward in the company (I started in the call center and now work in the advisory dept). Paid time off is easy to use and anonymously call in for, e.g. no excuse needed, just report ""I cannot come in today.""","We have to meet ""Service Level Requirements"", or answer the phones within a certain amount of time, and if those fall behind, there's mandatory overtime. We're going on 2 months of 1 hour of mandatory overtime now, back to back on the phones. I wish they'd just hire more people. I'm getting burnt out even though I really love my job and this company. I feel like Empower is growing so fast but isn't keeping up by investing in hiring enough people or by investing enough in IT - there are frequent systems issues that are super frustrating to communciate to clients."

No one really talks to each other and leads definitely need more training when it comes to training others on the team.

The company is old and slow moving and most people tend to be able to get away with doing very little, as long as you are not in a production environment.

Also, the company seems to be growing pretty rapidly, and there is not a tendency for layoffs.","They are working on diversity, but it is largely still a white dominant culture and atmosphere, with very little diversity in the upper rings of the company. Minority recruitment tends to be focused on pushing the lower-paying jobs. While minority groups exist, it feels they are muzzled and must be careful about what they say.

The company also tends to value management much more than employees, to the point that even with dozens of complaints on a manager, the company is unwilling to act.

Upper level career openings are often filled from the outside. While the company is increasing revenue, they are planning to streamline and automate many functions so as to be less dependent on employees."

You can tell Empower reads these reviews and tries to improve their processes based on the feedback. The coaching system can be scary, but they push for you to find your own solutions that way you can help yourself in the future.","Also, a con is that this is a challenging job. Do not expect to come in and just rocking the whole way. There will be some growing pains. There’s been delays due to covid on getting licensed. Also, you only can get your series 6; there’s no way to get a series 7 unless you move to a different department. I hear there is a lack of training once licensed; this can cause future errors especially on difficult plans. The process of talking with HR via email can be combersome.

388,,Worst Job I've ever had.,2020-09-22,1.0,Retirement Representative,"The pay and the benefits are decent, but they're not enough to make up for the job itself.","You're constantly put in no-win situations and there's an extreme feeling of authoritarianism. 

You're not allowed to pee on company time lest it hurt your ""adherence.""

You're not allowed to say you ""can't"" do something that you literally can't do either because the system is down or because you're not allowed to do it.

You'll be told conflicting things all the time and your performance will be hurt by acting on whatever you were most recently told, even if you were told that thing on the call itself. 

Your performance will be hurt if you're on hold for too long or if your call takes too long, even though all through training, you're told that it doesn't matter how long the call is because they want you to be thorough to prevent the person from calling back (it's a lie, they want you to practically hang up on people during the ""goodbye"" to shorten your time)

The people in training will act like you can come to them with any question in the world, then will turn around and treat you like a complete idiot ""well what do you think the answer to your question is?"" if you ask them. But then they'll tell you that you never want to guess because it hurts performance if you give wrong information-- which is fine and I agree you don't want to give people bad info-- but don't tell new employees ""never guess, just check with us,"" then turn around and treat them like a dummy for doing just that.

There is ZERO downtime on the job and the constant barrage of people is mentally exhausting-- and if you make a mistake or try to make time to actually look at your reviews to see how to improve, you're also out of adherence. They won't actually say you're expected to read your emails or look at your reviews or do your online training on your own time, but they clearly want you to because they're not going to allow you to do it on theirs.

The culture is super fake. When I left, my manager texted me saying that he'd be oh so willing to help me professionally and write me a letter of recommendation, I accepted the offer, then he said ""well I can't do a professional one due to company policy, do you want a private one?"" And I said sure... Then he ghosted me. I wouldn't have even thought of this as a negative if the offer wasn't made in the first place, but it just goes to show that they only care about the appearance of being nice without the follow through of actually doing anything nice.

Speaking of fake, the interview process was also super fake. They ask you what you're looking for in a company culture or work environment and they'll just say ""oh we're like that!"" Like I said I valued flexibility, and they were like ""we're so flexible!"" (They're not). And I said I wanted a dynamic role where I wasn't boxed into doing one singular task and I could wear many hats. They said ""that's great we love that"" (the job was be a phone slave, and I wasn't allowed to do any other tasks). If you value work-life balanced, be prepared for every second of your day to be mentally at work. Even your breaks will be dominated by the fear of coming back from it late.

They also will tell you the 11am-8pm schedule is only 12-18 months if you want to move to first shift, but I talked to a lot of reps there who had been on the 2nd shift schedule for several years and were trying to move.

Your mental health will totally spiral in this job. You will dread clocking in and you'll probably dread leaving too (because you'll be worried about money, insurance, etc) but the day you finally do, you'll just be filled with relief.

People think dealing with Karens is the worst part of a customer service job, but honestly dealing with irate people is one of the LEAST stressful parts of this job because the ""everything else"" about it is terrible.

I left several months ago, so this isn't even my ""just quit and I'm angry"" review, it's just me looking back and thinking ""wow that WAS terrible!"""

- Staffing for the IT teams is inadequate for the workload- They are NOT addressing it. Leadership provides snake salesman responses to these concerns while teams outside of IT bring on new hires and contractors to help them. 

-Leadership needs a serious refresh. There are many bad leaders who treat their employees and teams terribly. There are only a few good leaders, but they constantly go up against the bad ones, and suffer just as much as their employees. 

-Fake postings to improve their ratings

-Employees have chosen to retire early or leave without jobs because the environment is so bad now."

Can see full fledged opportunity to showcase own work. Apart from this the best thing that I came across is the hiring process. The HR department makes you feel valued and if they are also happy to see you in organization. There is clear and timely communication in whole hiring process unlike few other places where instead of going through all stages of interview for everything I only needed to follow up from one side. This I didn't faced here and I hiring team is quiet responsive proactive and helping.,I don't see any cons as of now but may be they can have some project onboarding checklist.

439,,Fantastic Experience,2020-06-11,5.0,Technical Lead Operations,"This review is for Empower Bangalore office.

Recruitment:

The way HR approaches you, will give you a feel that employees are valuable to them. It has been one of the best experience since interview was scheduled. Lightening fast recruitment process, HR made sure to keep me posted for the further developments on the candidature. 

Joining: 

After joining, I have experienced one of the smoothest joining process, way better than physical induction process, kudos to HR and IT tram for the same.

Induction process was fairly comprehensive, presenters made sure to cover and answer all related questions.

Team and management seems easily approachable, no need to make appointments or hesitate, they make sure it is communicated to the associates.
So far a wonderful experience.","Once you are selected, extention of offer letter has been delayed by two weeks, but I think in this scenario (Corona epidemic), it is understandable. Apart from that none found so far."

growing company, reached ~1,000 in India a short period","Growth opportunities have been limited so far. The benefits of rapid growth seems to have benefited limited set of people.

Technology infrastructure is bad, I have seen multiple system crashes happen resulting in overtime and loss of productivity.

Still using old systems be it for communication or collaboration. The available tools are from the last decade or older. If you are promising best technology to customers, start with you employees. 
we were using same time and office 2010 till last year, Imagine that. even the upgrade is to office 2016 and Skype. I don't think even Microsoft uses Skype."

- Instant vesting of employer match.
- Growth company with long-term vision.
- Work/Life balance: WFH opportunities, on-site fitness center, PTO, etc.","- Certain individuals don't thrive in a company that is stretching and growing - for me this is a positive.
- Poor performers aren't always coached into a new role and are allowed to stay in their position, while others struggle to make up for them."

462,,I don't see why they are so proud of where they are today.,2020-03-19,1.0,Participant Services Representative,Benefits are the only reasonable thing with this company.,They do not know a thing about work life balance.

465,,"Has Potential, Good People, Bad Business Model Currently",2020-03-09,2.0,Implementation Consultant,"Decent pay, good benefits, good people, good management","They're in a tough market (core). They need to sell volume to meet their bottom line. The only problem is that their sales are outpacing their capacity to implement the plans. They are working hard to staff implementation, they just aren't there yet. As of right now the plan load per consultant is way too high so the work is stressful and unfulfilling. The pay does not meet the work being done. I left after 3 months and I've never left a job in 22 years suddenly. Management is great and the training staff even better. They will get this figured out. Right now though, sales needs to put the brakes on for a little while to let the business staff appropriately and catch up. I see great potential in their core market. They have the right people in place, there is a major imbalance right now between sales and what implementation is capable of with current staffing. I emphasize RIGHT NOW. If considering this job I would ask where they are as far as staffing for the volumes. Right around 10-12 plans per consultant would work. They're working on it, just make sure they're there before committing."

Benefits are pretty good too.","Very impersonal work place where you won't know many of your co-workers. Most of your days are spent in front of your computer taking calls. Cubicals are spead apart so you can't even get to know people sitting by you. No events like Christmas or holiday parties, which is really odd considering the campus has its own event center and on-site catering company. 

Managers are very impersonal and hardly even talk to workers. Managers claim to support career opportunities for workers but do not assist in applying or helping workers apply for internal positions. The individual support and regular one-on-one meetings dedicated to helping you apply for other jobs never happen. I have not had a one-on-one meeting with my manager in six months and we regularly go weeks without even speaking.

Customers are often rude and your days are spent getting yelled at for mistakes you had nothing to do with."

479,,More exciting now than before,2019-11-22,5.0,Talent Acquisition,"I've been with Great-West Life which became Great-West Financial which is now Empower Retirement for over ten years.  A lot has changed during this time with leadership, technology, culture, and speed to market. And change isn't always easy. But the direction of Empower and the leadership makes this an exciting place to be. I love that Empower is trying to disrupt the industry and set the standard for being the best retirement provider. If retirement planning is a passion, this is the best company to align with. Small enough to know people and make an impact, big enough to have scale and growth potential. 

More flexibility in the work. I wear jeans almost every day (unthinkable when I started). Most positions get laptops for work flexibility. The culture is supportive and friendly and it feels like leaders really do appreciate and care about their people.",Change is constant here. You have to be adaptable in order to thrive. And there are growing pains with the growth of the company. Technology is still catching up. And not many positions offer more than 1 day a week working from home. But things are improving and Empower is more progressive now than it used to be.

90 percentage of the people who work in this organisation do not  have basic knowledge in English.
The top management isn't great either.
It's a monotonous boring but hectic job that doesn't help your career.
This is the only company that does what it does. So if you decide to  leave the organisation it is difficult to get a job elsewhere.
Most of the teams have nightshift. 
Taking breaks is frowned upon.
Most of the teams have zero day TAT ( turn around time) , that means in a 9 hour shift every 1 -2 hours events gets loaded and has to be processed on the same day itself. There are other responsibilities apart from this.

The way recognition is done is strange to me. A lot of people are doing a great job, and I'm not saying that everyone should get a prize or a shoutout, but figure out how to show your people that they're doing a great job even if a customer hasn't offered feedback. 
No separate sick leave. Why not have 5 separate days for sick leave along with PTO? 
Think colds, periods, emergencies, bereavement, car accidents,etc...wouldn't it be good to not have to tap into your personal time off? The job can be stressful at times, so this would be a nice incentive. Instead of offering hotel stays when the conditions are terrible, why not have an area of beds within the center or close the center altogether for rep safety? Train more remote workers for this purpose. It would save the company money. 
Working remotely isn't immediate or even soon after you train, but in the interview, it seemed like a given. It's not. 
Some managers are better than others. Unfortunately, you are assigned a manager and if they're not as proactive then its kind of a disadvantage to you. Managers that encourage their reps, see opportunities for them to advance, and teach them as much as possible are great managers. Depending on who you're assigned to, you may not get that."

Having worked  with many other Fortune 1000 organizations over the past 20 years, it was striking how unique the culture is at GWF and Empower.  They have traditionally promoted internal employees based on tenure and commitment to the organization.  80-90% of Sr. Manager, Directors and VPs have spent their entire career at Great West, now Empower. This has created a culture that is both resistant to new ideas/tech/ways of doing things, as well as fostering a very antiquated  expectation that employees should punch the clock early, always be at their desk, and stay well past standard business hours in order to gauge their worth and contribution.  It is extremely competitive for those few people willing to work 80 hours a week to possibly earn a promotion where even longer hours are expected.  In 2019, the Implementation department has a standard desktop OS of Microsoft Office 07....they have multiple half-baked, back end systems that are continually malfunctioning, and require constant troubleshooting and support.  The majority of Leadership (at least in the Implementation department) is average, to sub-par, and every Sr. Manager, Director, and VP has literally no other functional or leadership experience outside of the Great West bubble.  If you are seeking an entry-level or early mid-level position, it is a great company.  Above that threshold, you will likely be disappointed."

Empower sponsors new hires in the participant services call center to test for the series 6 & 63.","There is a huge, huge disconnect between management and employees. I’ve had a total of 2 one-on-ones since being employed since August. Support system once you get on the phones seems rather weak; they encourage the use of Group Chat but even that results in wrong information. Asking your team lead for an answer to a question will net you an answer hours later. Some items we were taught in training turned out to be wrong. 

Aside from little support, the work itself is dull and monotonous. Most of your day is spent struggling with assisting participants on the website as monotony ensues. Some representatives take 20 calls/day and others take 50/day - it ultimately depends on who your manager is and what gate(s) you get put on. 
Per the guidelines here, if a participant does become verbally abusive, we are not to release the call and rather try to quell the participant and get them over to a supervisor. This method can take a toll on mental health, which Empower offers no support for. 

Your metrics are constantly measured. You’re also looked down upon if you call in sick. Beware of this, as you are encouraged in one place to call in sick if need, but on the floor it will count against and it will hinder your ability to move up (yes, even one call out)."

Instead of dealing with an absolute glut of senior management, the push going forward is to replace lower-level positions with employees in India at a fraction of the cost. Good business plan, except when you factor that they run a business largely based on continued retirement plan and asset growth. I guess their own employees don't really matter in that equation. They are going to start having major turnover when internal employees stop acting as a backstop for the shoddy work coming out of India.

When I started with the company, I was told I was joining at the perfect time.  The company just hired a new CIO and the corporate culture was starting to change for the better.  While that was initially true, it didn't last.  The corporate culture has since changed for the worst.

Majority of its operations are in to night shift. Working in night shift is fine, even doing over time is fine sometimes due to unexpected business requirements. But the issue in GW is since the employees are treated as machines there is no harm in stretching for 3-4 hours daily thats what the managers think.  During my tenure in GW I was sleep deprived and in terms pf carrier growth  also GW doesn't offer much. Less pay, less hike, less bonus; over all the compensation is not even as per market standards. I remember, once we had a session with the Director. We shared few negative feedback to him regarding certain issues we were facing. Rather than assuring us that the issue will be soon resolved by the management, he simply ignored what me said started giving lame explanations. Perhaps, his ego was hurt because of us, thats why after that session he started targeting us for all wrong reasons.

For this job (call center rep) we're in 12 weeks of training for 2 exams, so you have to be self-sufficient at studying (paid studying during work), but everyone seems fine with it!

My colleagues are friendly, smart and great to work with. I love that the company has a strong community program. The cafeteria rocks, as does the campus, which also has a gym, doctor's office, bike share program and running trails. Also, I've loved the fact that I've gotten to change jobs three times since joining - it's been challenging, fun and I've learned a lot.

We're doing more in the community and providing more innovative services than ever before. Exciting to be part of a company that's trying to influence the market instead of just tag along. Company truly cares about our clients and is trying to move quickly to meet their needs. Although I've been in the same department for 11 years, my role has evolved and I'm constantly being given new challenges and opportunities. The work I do today is not what I did when I started. That keeps it fresh and enjoyable.","Lots of change. As the company is investing a lot in technology and transformation, departments have to do the same or more with less in some cases. Some locations have more limited career mobility than others. For long-tenured employees, some of the change can be challenging to get on board with. For some departments, longer hours to get everything done. Can't make all the changes as quickly as is needed. Definitely experiencing growing pains."

768,,"Community-minded, good benefits, working on innovation",2017-07-03,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"I'm based in Denver (headquarters) - I enjoy coming to work. It's unique to have a ""cause"" that we work toward every day--helping people plan for retirement. Definitely feels like a for-profit company but with an important, meaningful mission.

Lots of perks at the office: cafeteria, company store with snacks and coffee, covered parking, on-site gym (free), onsite health center (free with certain company health plans), convenient location near the highway.  Good health insurance. All employees receive 16 paid volunteer hours annually to use at any organization they'd like, and the company matches donations up to $5,000 each year per employee. People here are really nice and generally helpful. Lot of options to get involved with your fellow employees and in the community.

Like most big companies, work-life balance will depend on who you work for and what your role is. I think generally the company values happy employees. They support ""extra-curriculars"" like lunch and learns, employee groups, etc.","Tech needs a refresh - we're several years behind with updates. Budgets are tight, and professional development budget is low. You will likely not see a lot of superfluous spending. I came from small orgs and it was definitely an adjustment to the hierarchy and structure. The other side to that coin is that there's a lot of room to grow and learn, and new people to meet every day."
769,,Compliance Department in WI:  Overall a Good Office Experience,2017-06-29,4.0,Compliance,"I would describe my salary as being fair.  You could expect annual raises to basically just keep up with (or barely exceed) inflation (2-3%).  In today’s age, that’s actually not that bad, so to me, it’s a “pro.”

Benefits (much better):
-Company paid about 90% of premiums for healthcare, vision and dental.
-Company paid a 50% 401(k) match on first 8% of compensation (with immediate vesting).
-Other standard benefits are available (life ins, FSAs, tuition reimbursement, etc.)
-PTO is generous: 15 PTO days; 21 PTO days after 3 years.   10 paid holidays.
-Hours were very flexible, at least for my department.  You could arrive between 7-9 am.

My job was rewarding enough to keep me there for a number of years.  

Large office allowed for lateral movements if one desired.

Culture in compliance department was average to slightly-above-average.  Large department (and company) meant you could socialize with the people you liked and avoid the people you didn’t like.  Some people might not have been good at their jobs, but there were no toxic, bad apples present when I was there.  Department had around 30 or so people with a wide diversity in age, sex and ethnicity.","As mentioned by several others, it's easy to move around, but not easy to move up.

You are not incented to work hard because your efforts will not be financially recognized.  Everyone gets a standard base raise of 2-3%, regardless of your effort or quantity/quality of work completed.  Department uses a database that tracks various work completed, but I believe those resulting statistics had no correlation to your yearly raise computation.  I always wished raises were more stratified (0.5% - 4.5%) to reward the better performers and punish the lazy ones.  You might be able to earn a slightly higher raise by volunteering for projects that require at least a month or more commitment.

I suppose there's always going to be dead weight in any organization, but as one of my fellow analysts in Denver noted, ""Great West doesn't seem to get rid of dead weight so the lazy employees never have to change.""  That was exactly my experience as well.  I was surprised at how long poor performers lasted, and I believe those people would have been canned much sooner at a comparable financial services company.  However, on the other hand, this was a rare event, and in a department of this size (30), I never let a poor performer or two affect me personally.

My biggest con was the peer review system that we had in place for reviewing work before it was sent to clients.  If a coworker made a mistake that was deemed “critical,” you were expected to dish out a “critical error.”  Deciding what was a critical error was somewhat arbitrary; some coworkers had unspoken alliances to NOT give each other critical errors; some people who received errors took it way too personally b/c it was viewed as an attack on their pay (via the worthless statistics I mentioned earlier).  If you actually did your job and gave out critical errors, you could expect payback.  In the end, this led to a lot of unnecessary politicking, which somewhat diminished the culture.  In a sense, managers outsourced the portion of their job that revolved around ‘evaluating employee performance’ by requiring everyone in the department to dish out critical errors in such a public manner, which I found to be quite obnoxious.  Employee suggestions were solicited in several attempts to reform the system (which was noble of management), but the core problem remained.  I actually thought of a way to fix the problem, but I was 1 of 30 people (1 of 90 when you include Denver) and I didn’t feel like embarking on such an uphill climb."

I'm not sure the business methods make sense as keeping multiple contractors on board for high hourly rates seems like they are creating a revolving door of mediocre talent and poor investment strategies in quality workers.  There were layoffs within the department, only to have them turn around and hire MORE contractors for those same positions that they had let go, it just doesn't make sense. The department definitely made a turn for the worst after I was on-boarded as  creative services hired multiple creative directors, added unnecessary Mac laptops and created multiple ""agency"" silos of work without having the manpower to make this method efficient.  Too many upper management positions and not enough ""worker bees"" has led to many unhappy staff members. If you have found quality talent in a contractor, HIRE THEM instead of following them up with more contractors who are now starting from square one with no knowledge of current processes and brand identity.

In the 90s GWF was a mid-sized company that was able to foster a great family (work/life balance) oriented environment. Originally conservative but balanced in their spending and technical advancement. Today GWF has become the typical large financial corporation where growth and profit are at all costs – especially to employees. In the 2000s new management (CIO) saw IT as a cost liability and reduced the IT budget year over year resulting in unreliable outdated systems and infrastructure. The results were frequent and significant outages. The dedicated, experienced and knowledgeable technical staff struggled to maintain service levels by committing their time and strong team ethics. Next cycle; triggered by a large acquisition/merger, was to replace the CIO (again) and spend millions of dollars to catch up technically. This was done with no additional staffing consideration. Time demands for the new systems, and technical nuances of significant upgrades caused another round of service levels issues, and management finger pointing impacted staff morale. Next cycle; replace AVPs with new management that determined the reason for system issues must be the “incompetency” of the technical staff. So, staff is driven out, or their positions “eliminated”. In one department, eight (of ten) staff gone, taking over 60 years of knowledge and experience. Newly hired directors hire former co-workers and friends for positions reporting to their direct reports (without interviews) who have no experience with a financial institution or the complexity of the technology employed. The amount of talent that has left GWF will clearly have a long term impact. Spending money to address all these issues, IT is once again facing budget concerns even as the company continues to push growth. When and what will the next inevitable cycle bring?"

The hours are pretty steady-no weekends.
I did not have to do any work outside of business hours.

Another benefit is that they will pay for you to study for the FINRA exams when you get hired on.  I got 3-4 weeks to study for the 6 and 63 and got paid while doing it.

Working here is a great way to learn about investing and planning for retirement.","I was a representative on the phones and scheduling, service levels, and our procedures were the biggest downsides.

It is very difficult to take days off, especially if you are new and don't get to ask for your off days at the start of the year like all the seasoned employees.  It's especially hard to take off Mondays or Fridays on the fly.

Service levels were a big problem when I was there.  Often times we would be very busy and not have enough staff to handle the volume of calls coming through.  Back to back calls with no reprieve can be exhausting.  We would frequently have an hour of mandatory overtime on every Monday and sometimes more throughout the week.  

The day is also very regimented.  When I was there you got exactly 30 minutes for lunch and two timed 15 minute breaks throughout the day.  You had to press a button on your phone to get up and use the bathroom.  I felt like I was chained to my desk.

Doing the job is also difficult because of the amount of knowledge you need to have and the different and disconnected resources and computer systems you would have to be able to use.

Trying to get help from other coworkers can be hard.  Many people I worked with, even seasoned employees, were not willing to help and would rather pass the buck than take on a problem.

Management also does not do a good job of developing their employees.  I got the impression that because they need to keep people on the phones to stay in business, they were reluctant to develop workers and train them to move up or move out.

There is a very high failure / fire rate with new hires because of the insane short time period to study and pass the licensing exams.  
       During recruiting and interviewing they will say that you must pass the exams within the first 90 days of employment.  That 90 day period is a complete misrepresentation; you will have less than 10 calendar days for the Series 6 and less than five calendar days for the 63. 
       If you fail the Series 6 exam with less than a 70% passing grade, they will give you a second chance to take it again, but only if you scored at least a 58%.  If you score below 58% then you will be fired immediately with no second chance to retake the exam.   
     If you pass the Series 6, then you must take and pass the Series 63 exam, but you will have less than five calendar days to study and pass the Series 63.  The same circumstances apply; score less than 58% on the Series 63, then no retake, you're fired.   
     After passing the 6 & 63 then you enter their internal training period for several weeks.  Each week you are required to pass additional training assessments.  The instructors /  trainers are good and sincere about teaching the material, but they will ""fly"" through and simply skip over large portions of material in the manuals.  However, you are still required to pass assessments over that skipped material every week.

987,,Prudently managed company that offers solid job stability but with some areas of improvement within call centers,2014-12-10,4.0,Anonymous Employee,"Parent company out of Canada takes a measured and conservative approach resulting in the company meeting or exceeding quarterly financial objectives as well as creating a corporate work environment of trust and stability. Unlike most other financial services firms, Great-West very rarely engages in employee layoffs. Their fortunes are not principally tied with the prevailing winds of the stock market like those of some other major financial services firms in the Denver area.

New CEO with a sterling pedigree has been put in place effective last May. Lots of new talent as a result of JPM acquisition and merger with Putnam's retirement business. Very excited with the new executive management team.","Good ole boys (and girls) club mentality of VP level down to middle management. A ""do as I say, not as I do"" approach towards the rank and file staff. Favoritism and politics abound and if you're good at ""managing up,"" you'll be successful with these sorts of people.

Non-call center departments have a pretty good work/life balance.  Call centers, however, not so good. Call centers engage in ""lean staffing"" which results in constant heavy call volumes, erratic hold times, and a ""reactive"" rather than ""proactive"" response from line managers.  

Unrealistic service level goals and the constant cancellation of employee meetings (one-on-one's, team meetings, training sessions, etc.) in the name of meeting those unrealistic service levels with the limited amount of staffing has had a poor effect on morale. High turnover due to burn out and stress has been common over the years, resulting in senior management imposing freezes on staff from posting out for other positions. This has created a culture of indentured servitude. 

A work force management system is used to handle the staff's daily schedule and activities. This system is seen as very restrictive and de-humanizing to staff.  There is very limited ability to get time off for vacations or even schedule doctors appointments. WFO system viewed by phone reps and managers alike as uncaring, by-the-book, and inflexible.  Line managers have their hands tied when dealing with WFO staff; very little authority or autonomy. 

The call center culture contradicts the work/life balance that senior management regularly claims to promote.  Basically, there are two sets of rules-one for call center staff and one for non-call center staff.

Thus, a vicious cycle has been started-high stress, low morale, and micromanagement/high turnover/inability to pursue other opportunities within the company/loss of talent to outside 
employers/low morale and turnover/repeat."

This is the same system that Microsoft abandoned at the end of 2013; citing it as “the most destructive process inside of Microsoft…” which “pit staffers against each other, hampering collaboration”
As part of this system, Great-West Financial has mandated that 10% of all employees must be ranked as under performers. Managers of small groups (5-10 employees) must rate at least 1 of their staff as non-performers solely for the purpose of fulfilling the quota, regardless of actual performance. These employees will not receive a raise. I anticipate a significant portion will be seeking employment elsewhere, taking experience and knowledge with them, likely getting a raise. Perhaps to a competitor, opening a new campus 5 miles to the south?

This isn't surprising since the senior management in Product are all either actuaries or accountants.

Working in the department though is entirely different. Tons of behind your back talking, playing favorites with employees who are not remotely close to as being as good as others but since they suck up to some of the team leads they are more likely to keep their job or not get assigned specific work tasks. 

They don't want you talking to eachother, they dont want you discussing what you may have messed up on and how you could correct it with a fellow employee. They want you to sit at your desk, stare at the computer and not say a word. Unless your a team lead/manager then by all means lead by example and talk all you want!

The immaturity is aggravating. They will say be at your desk at this time not one minute later otherwise its a tardy, while they can hardly make it to work 10 minutes late everyday. I have never worked for an employer/department that has been so ridiculous.

They have SO MANY continual production errors, (many due to poor data setup) that 95%+ of your work is trying to rapidly solve production issues, often in a 'critical' status. Personally, I found that very stressful, particularly the fact that it feels endless.

Each developer takes it in turn to carry the on call pager. 99% of the pages are completely unrelated to front end development (where I worked) but still they come to us. You are on call 24 7 for a week. Extra pay for doing this task? $15 a day. (It was $25, but that was deemed to be too much...)

A director I spoke to there, said knowledge of the Great West business is far more important than knowledge of Java. It must be for that reason, that so much of the code that I saw there was poorly written - Huge, rambling methods, no documentation within the code, very little Null Pointer checking; the list goes on. As does the endless critical production tickets.

Finally, I discovered recently, that you lose your health benefits on your last day of employment. All of my previous jobs have allowed the benefit to continue to the end of the month.

1042,,Horiible Culture,2012-12-01,2.0,Anonymous Employee,"Location, cafeteria (though way too expensive), a paycheck. Some fun events on occassion. Free covered parking.Pockets of people who really care about doing good work.","CULTURE. A silo culture that allows teams who should be working together to dig their heels in and create obstacles for each other.Very hard to get anything done - much less get anything done right. Titles give some people permission to treat others bad. Some areas of favoritism that restrict promotion of good people and implementation of good ideas.

Some management need more backbone. Instead of managing individual issues, valuable perks were taken away from all - casual Fridays and flexible schedules. Poor performers not dealt with.

HelpDesk is understaffed. Don't often get quality results from them, which results in not having the resources needed to do my job right. It took days, and many calls to the help desk to get my computer working right during my first weeks of employment. Dread having to call them for anything. All i hear from them is how busy they are. 

""Big Brother"" - have to badge in and out of each building all day - and the parking lot during lunch hours. can't forget badge when going to the bathroom, or will be locked out of department.Phone logs printed for management. Internet excessively restricted, and probably heavily monitored."
1043,,GW:  Wants to change and get more agressing  but is throwing money and tools at it,2012-10-06,4.0,Anonymous Employee,"A lot of people who have been at their jobs for 20-30 years and know a lot
 Free COVERED parking and an accessible location off the freeway.
Good 401K plan","Bad training and documentation;  This is compenstated for by people who have been at their jobs for 20-30 years, but doesn't help with new employees or turnover.
So-so medical plan.  Doesn't cover much for eyewear if you wear progressive.  Doesn't cover much for prescriptions or chiaropractices.
The company wants to steamline and get more agressive but it keeps throwing tools at it that people find hard to use, time consuming, and there is very little training on them or they don't work in the environment they were supposedly designed for."
1044,,Good amenities while taking advantage of salaried employees.,2012-09-27,4.0,Senior Financial Analyst,"Great West is a stable large company that has great amenities on site. The cafeteria, fitness facilities, and parking garage are very nice to have.  Management was friendly and willing to help advance my career.",Corporate hours were not very flexible and they expected you to put in at least 45 hours per week.  They do not believe in comp time or overtime so they take advantage of salaried employees.
1045,,Six plus years here - great experience,2012-08-10,5.0,Senior Manager,"Stable, provides very necessary service to individuals. Bonuses and merit increases in place ever year I've been here. The vast majority of people enjoy working here - a lot of employee referrals. Nice corporate headquarters in the DTC.","Industry has constant change. Great-West operates very leanly. Change can take a while, after lots of analysis, but when it comes it's fast and furious."
1046,,Great for people who value personal time more than money,2012-07-29,2.0,Anonymous Employee,"Great-west is fantastic in terms of its demands on you. People rarely work more than 40 hours (except a few depts, which seem understaffed) a week so it's really great for people with families who don't want to focus on work. This is an incredibly fiscally conservative company and so there is no history of layoffs.","If you are motivated and ambitious this is not the place for you. Our average raise this year was 1.75%. It is in the company policy that you can not get more than 10% a year, even for a promotion. So if you get a 1% merit increase you can only get a 9% maximum raise if you get promoted. I know this goes as high as VP. Not sure if it's applicable to SVPs and up.

Also, you might expect an employee benefits company to provide great benefits for their employees. Great-west doesn't. I have heard it costs appx $5,000 out if pocket to have a baby. And our 401(k) plan is unbelievably average (4% match, no profit sharing)."

The benefits are good although healthcare did increase a little this year.
They are making advancements in software 
Laid back atmosphere.
Parking garage is nice to have.","Management does not seem connected with day to day operations. They will tell you they are looking into it and nothing seems to change. Maybe they are too busy and forget.
They only look at numbers for performance. 
Pay is conservative, however there were no layoffs during 2008-2009. 
More employee recognition or department lunches would be nice. 
Finding information that you need is not always easy to locate. 
It can be hard to move to an upper management position as not many people leave the company. 
Job responsibilities are not always clear."
1053,,Tough to get ahead at Great-West Life,2012-04-04,2.0,,"Life/work balance was exceptional, no rigid dictates about hours (outside the call center). People were friendly and welcoming. Rich tradition.","Management comes up from the ranks, little incentive for them to look outside the company for development. No commitment to diversity and a haphazard approach to learning. Quite siloed."

Great Pay and great 401(k) match

Adherence to your phone is monitored and very strict...unachievable for many
Little room for advancement unless you're young and male, or a son of a manager."
1055,,Enjoyed the works but hated the company.  To many incompetent entry level managers.,2011-12-03,1.0,Retirement Education Counselor,Good work/life balance and benefits.  Remote working opportunities if you work in the field. God IT department to make remoting easy.,"No clear direction from management on goals.  Sales goals do not reflect how incentive comp is paid and often changes.  They do not fire incompetent managers so there tends to be a decent amount of turn-over of employees is high.  Advancement opportunities is not ""what you know"" but ""who you know""."
