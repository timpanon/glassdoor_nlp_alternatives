The pay is good not great, but bonuses have been great in my experience. Diverse for what it is (IT is IT). Tech stacks are generally good. Lots of cloud work.","Lots of red tape and very process heavy, though to be fair this is to be expected given the type of data and history of company. The company is also pretty old school and feels very corporate. Lots of reorgs which make it hard to drive the direction of your career. Very heavy emphasis on security as it should be, but because of this, whatever used to work yesterday might not work today due to some random update/patch in another department. Sub par vacation/benefits and takes 10 years to get more days."

You get a few Bravo points for Administrative Professional Day once a year and you pay the taxes. You can get up to a 3% raise but don’t - you only receive a 2% yearly increase if you are lucky. While management receive at least 10% or higher. How does the hourly employees suppose to live off of that. While the cost of living increases yearly - but not your salary. A few EA’s do receive fair raises, while the majority do not. You are rewarded for your hard work with more work only. You get no bonuses or decent increases.

Merit increases are not actually based on Merit. They give just about everyone 3.5% which is infuriating when you worked hard and another team member did not

56,,Scary as S#$%,2022-03-03,1.0,Anonymous,"Company is making a lot of money, good bonuses (mostly for those in senior roles). Some roles might require overtime but many do not.","Anyone who has access to the inner workings of the leadership of this Business Unit knows: the President is an autocratic dictator who has created fear and divisiveness among his team (but he pays them well so they call him 'generous', furthermore many can't leave because they won't be able to make as much $ elsewhere), HR reports to him and therefore lacks integrity (ie. he can fire them!), Corporate turns a blind eye (because this is the company's profit center), the rich get richer while the poor stay poor (minimal pay integrity/equity), the company says it cares about customers but marketing materials are all about Equifax (ie. slogan 'it all starts with us'). Some really great people, but some nasty folks too (and it is allowed, even rewarded). My advice: RUN!"

62,,No work-life balance for employees,2022-02-26,1.0,Information Technology,"Excellent colleagues, dedicated and team oriented 
Latest cloud technologies 
Good bonus in recent years","Absolutely no work-life balance, expect to work long weekdays and weekends 
Projects are staffed with 90% contractors held to 40 hours per week, the few employees on each project are forced to take on all extra work that comes up
Most on the management track care nothing about the people reporting to them, they are completely focused on their next promotion 
Claims of work-life balance like not tracking PTO days or time off for volunteering are lip service, in reality you will be encouraged by management not to take PTO for vacations, funerals or any other reason

In short; if you’re early in your career, have no family and no limits on the amount of hours you can work, and want to learn the latest cloud technologies this might be a great place for you. Might also be good contractors. For anyone else, look elsewhere."
63,,Not the worst place,2022-02-25,4.0,Anonymous Employee,Benefits that included 401k matching,Lower level employees get their superiors bonuses but they don't reap the benefits of their hard work

Very redundant job - Workforce solutions, also known as theworknumber. After every call, you get less than 2 mins to wrap up call work before the system automatically puts you into the next call. The calls never stop, it never seems like there is enough staff to take all the calls. Customers wait in que for hours."
65,,Too many job duties for pay,2022-02-24,2.0,Implementation Coordinator,Nothing comes to my mind.,Pay is terrible for job duties and they do not take in account the city you live in for cost of living. Verbally told salary range and HR did not meet low end. Minimal help for all the roles I had assigned to me. Worked overtime but even that did not help stay a float with all the work I was responsible for.
66,,Culture of overwork and middling pay that will grind you to bits,2022-02-23,3.0,Senior Director Communications,Great colleagues who are truly about problem solving - very much a collaborative approach to work.,Compensation woefully low compared to the market; Out of touch senior leadership; Everyone but developers and sales/marketing are second class

Perfect work life balance",I can’t think of any cons. You can define your success by avoiding pitfalls if any
73,,Not the best. Not the worst,2022-02-16,2.0,PSC,Pretty decent work life balance. Base pay is relatively good and middle management does not micromanage,"Executive leadership is borderline terrible. Executive turnover is constant and only worsens the leadership problems. Every time a new executive comes in, we change course. The course change often leads to confusion and we regularly just go back to what we were doing. Most of the executives take credit for our success, but the reality is that our success is based largely on the housing market. We didn't do anything other than exist. Sales reps have little to no knowledge about most products we offer, but sell them anyway. There is absolutely no training, career growth or path. You simply do the same job year in and year out with no hope for recognition."

Get to work with many intelligent , smart and hard working people","Overly focused on process over product delivery

92,,Meh,2022-02-05,3.0,Senior Director,Good people- especially at mid and lower levels. Friendly teammates and challenging work.,"Lousy 2% raise for employees while new hires come in much higher. Little change for advancement. Difficult watching top 100 leaders celebrate themselves with annual beach trips, large stock grants and huge raises for your hard work. Too much politics for promotions. Not worth staying in a job without growth opportunities and getting paid less than peers.  Good luck with the annual “stealth” layoffs."

These numbers are laughable. 

Do they pay decent…yes. Do you get recruited with respect. Absolutely not. I think the overriding thinking from them is that I pay you, so shut up! 

Again, beware. Don’t say you haven’t been warned.","What I said earlier were the Pros. The cons are far worse. Try to get certain leaders to look at you if you aren’t on the 6th floor. Try to find any semblance of diversity. Just got rid of the highest ranking Black person there. 

They want people to stand out front proudly as diverse employees, but don’t support them. Completely laughable (and sad). Do yourself a favor and stay clear.

You won’t get promoted or provided with real opportunities unless you are a part of the loss up club. I mean it’s really bad and incredibly obvious."

The work life balance exceeds my expectations with lots of flexibility to work remotely. The pay is very good. When searching for a job, it's hard to determine if a company will be a good fit during the interview process because you never know what you are walking into until you actually get there and experience the cultural for yourself. I am so glad to have this opportunity to be at Equifax and I know I made the right choice. My boss and my team are so supportive and I feel that same level of support throughout the organization.","If you have no prior industry experience, the learning curve may be larger than normal but the leadership team understands this and allows sufficient time for learning and ramp-up.

The data is top notch and people really care about quality.","It's a very top heavy organization with a lot of people in management and, in my experience, not a lot of care taken to manage down or provide career guidance to individual contributors. Further, there is a hierarchical vibe as you move up in the organization which can make it very difficult to manage up."

176,,I have been acquired by Equifax and why that is a good thing,2021-11-30,5.0,Senior Director,"So recently the little company that I started with 21 years ago was purchased by Equifax for 1.8 Billion dollars. Scary for some, exciting for others and that is to be expected. 

What I have learned is that Equifax, 16,000 Employees world wide, does their very best to make you feel the personal side, not the impersonal of being large. That to me, that has been the most impressive thing about Equifax. 

The opportunities for young people within Equifax is endless, which is another positive for being acquired by Equifax. If I was 35 years younger I would be lining myself up to see the world while working for a great company. 

The HR department has been exquisite in handling the needs of Appriss's employees. They are so very well versed, excellent communication, excellent execution of doing their jobs. 

The management of Equifax is very real, they have been transparent, open and honest with us about the migration of two large businesses into one. I don't have a sense that they are elite or above those who report for them. 

I see a lot of mission driven people which I like in the work place. They have a sense of humor, with a sense of love for what they do.","Mergers, Change are sometimes hard to accept and sometimes a little scary for some. There is very little you can do about that because it is human nature to sometimes feel that way. 

Large companies like Equifax you can feel sometimes lost, no matter how hard the organization tries to make you feel important. 

New procedures and processes create new challenges, things may not move as fast as we are use to because we were smaller, less hoops to jump through. 

This is minor on one level, but they don't have an easy to use store to buy Equifax gear from. With 16,000 Employees I would think that would be beneficial."

181,,Feedback,2021-11-29,4.0,Senior Contracts Manager,The flexibility with work schedule and ability to have a great work/life balance. Working at Equifax allows for opportunities to be creative.

I have good work/life balance and a manager who respects me and the contributions I make to the team.

And with all the aquisitions, we're growing!",The base salary and bonus targets are low in comparison to other major companies in the area. The only saving grace is that our performance this year means good bonuses next year. Losing Bev as the leader of GCS was a major blow.

This usually means that there is high overturn, very stressful work conditions and lack of morale across the team. 

Equifax actually is somewhere were I really want to establish a long career and most of the employees have been with the company 5 years +. It shows because everyone is very helpful and it is not a toxic work environment that expects you to give 100% but get so little in return and a lack of validation. 

The market is extremely strong even during Covid and post. I have a large amount of inbound requests and clients want to book meetings and are loyal to the brand as a whole. 

If you are looking for the next stage in your professional career I would highly recommend looking here at any position or level.","Just like any other company it is tricky when you are new to navigate the internal process and systems. If I had one critique it would be to overhaul the highway of member numbers, Highfam, external ID's, etc...

It is quite confusing for new employees as well as for customers with all the different identifiers and time and potential revenue is lost in translation. 

That being said your team will ultimately assist you and guide you to make sure you are successful here. Most teams will not put as much time and effort to make sure everyone succeeds."

4. The company is succeeding in performance and the financial results are proof of it.

2. There have been way too many team reorganization’s that end up being disruptive to execution plans.

554,,"If you thrive in a growing company that embraces cut throat politics, this is the place for you.",2021-02-24,2.0,Anonymous Employee,"Fast growing unit of Equifax. Better to be aligned to the  St. Louis business than the Atlanta business, due to growth trajectory and bonus payouts. 

If you’re going to be hired into the St. Louis Finance team - you’ll do well, in career development and pay. The St. Louis CFO ensures that the Finance team is well taken care of, and this is an ever-growing team.  You should also read this as “if I’m not hired into the finance team, it’s likely I won’t have the same experience”. 

The actual work I perform on a daily basis, I do enjoy. It’s the HOW it’s done (at the detriment of others, or yourself) at Equifax that has given me pause.","While the company leaned into diversifying the workforce, it is only surface diversity they seek (eg if you scan the room, do we ‘look diverse’). Diversity in thought - that is simply not allowed.

Challenging to zero work/life balance for the masses.  While pay appears good, if you divide your salary by the number of hours you've actually worked during the year you'd be surprised about how much Equifax values you.

You can't take the 15+ days of PTO offered, and you can only roll over 5 days which must be used in Q1 or you lose it.

Professional, but threatening work environment, so do your best work and watch your back.  

Good luck if your role requires you to work w Atlanta team. There’s an internal tagline of “One Equifax”, which is a farce (behind closed doors, it’s laughable).

Remote work will not be a long term option at Equifax. Plans are underway to mandate an increasing #of associates that have worked from home during Covid-19, to come into the office. 

Like many large corporations, HR's priorities are to manage risk to the business, not represent the interest of the associate.  Unfortunately, the focus on the wellbeing and development of Equifax employees is 'just talk', and is not practiced."

-Upper management seems frantic in their inability to commit to a position for long enough to complete an initiative correctly. (In other words - just get it done NOW, never mind the obvious oncoming pitfalls we are choosing to ignore)
-Work loads can be outrageous. Management continually talks about ""quality of life"" and claims to support a 40 hour work week, but then continually commits to deadlines that require effort far exceeding those hours.
-There is no true enterprise identity. The company seems obsessed with modeling itself after the success of other corporations, essentially attempting to ""copy & paste"" those organizations approaches to various business challenges, rather than actually fostering the sort of in house innovation they claim to cherish.
-Every year, the number of full time employees with legal citizenship seems to be reduced, in favor of contractors here on work visas."

Less qualified staff (no management degrees) get promoted fairly quickly based on their networking skills and their ability to story tell rather than deliver, while those with credentials such as CFAs are left behind!

Nepotism is rife as is the amount of managers who are not capable of working at the level they have been promoted to. The senior management is tone deaf, and at a top level there is a lack of interest in their staff, apparent by the bullying culture which has got worse in the last three years. Executives who curse and scream at staff are tolerated, women and minorities in management are severely under-represented. HR don't care they now have a model where they report into the head of each area, making a closed loop for any complaints. The benefits are not great and get worse every year. Add to this a dishonest representation of how the company has 'improved' since the breach - at best it is just as bad as it was before, just in a different way. The CEO says he cares about diversity and about the BLM movement; he doesn't. Just look at the make up of the senior management team... Bottom line, the company gets it's assets (data) for nothing and packages them into sales-worthy products - it's a business model that makes money no matter how the economy is doing (especially the St Louis portion of the business). Despite this they keep laying people off just before the holidays then talking about how much money they are making. After each layoff the remaining staff are expected to do more work to make up the short fall. I actively encourage anyone looking for a position to look elsewhere unless they know a senior manager - then they will be absolutely fine."

Do not leave your jobs to join this company because it will be fast and furious and more than likely, you will be terminated out of the blue right at Christmas time. They always start terminating at the end of the year and continue every 2 or 3 months the next year in waves. Then they post the modified positions again to bring in people with no experience.

-Transformation - Wow, could this go any worse.  Rushing it and just assuming that every thing would go right.  Again, shows the failure of the CTO.  Why does he still have a job?
-Company Culture - The company could care less about its employees.  Why the heck would you rush so fast to open your offices in the middle of a pandemic?  No other company is opening their offices yet.
-Reorgs - Can Senior Leadership just stop and see if the last reorg actually produced any results?  Every other month their is a reorg and usually not for the better becasue leadership failed to ask any of the low level employees what went wrong with the last one.

743,,Huge growth in overly-complicated matrixed organization,2020-07-15,1.0,Vice President,"For context, the division based in St Louis has nothing to do with the credit bureau, run out of Atlanta.  Workforce Solutions provides income and employment verification by contributing records from all of the companies that hire it to perform basic HR functions (I9, ACA, WOTC, Unemployment Insurance Management, etc). The database is also fed by partnerships with major payroll providers that take a revenue share on the sale of their member companies' employees' pay history.  Combined, this creates TheWorkNumber (TWN), a database with over 100 million records, historical and current of American's pay and employment history.

1. TWN is a monopoly. No one else comes close to the scale and breadth. Equifax's growth is mostly driven by our ability to jack up the prices on lenders and government agencies that rely on TWN for income verification or eligibility confirmation.
2. Major technology investment is underway to get our platforms out of the 1990s. For example, we just deployed a major CRM platform to replace an outdated system.
3. Because of the security breach, the entire company is intensely focused on security.","1. High performance expectations with forced performance rankings leads to forced attrition of ~lowest 20%.
2. Highly matrixed organization leads to competing ""fiefdoms"" and endless meetings. 
3. Demanding and unreasonable expectations come from the very top of the division. Until leadership changes, expect toxic environment to continue.
4. Equifax's mission is to help people live their financial best. This line holds true in the credit bureau and in verifying someone's income for a loan. But it starts falling apart when Equifax works for your employer to deny or limit your unemployment benefits or when the TWN is used to collect a debt and help a debt collector garnish your wages.  For the most part, the services we provide in St Louis don't always leave our employees with that ""warm fuzzy"" that we're here to help people."

- While companies around the country were instituting work from home policies in February and March, Equifax still required employees to come into the office during the rise of the Coronavirus.

- And, while other companies around the country were extending its work from home policies, Equifax was one of the very first companies in Atlanta to require employees to come back to the office (on June 1). It also required its employees around the world to return their offices in June and July."

Decent Pay
Nice laptops for tech employees
Good food in the cafe (when it was open)","Been with Equifax for a year. Finally getting to see that all the talk that management gives about caring for employees is just hollow. 

As other reviews point out this organization is very hierarchical. Your boss is your boss and you very rarely interact with his boss. Decisions just flow downhill. This is unlike any other place I have worked. Not very comforting

Company is still going through a lot of change and transformations following the data breach. Change can be good but it does means instability and job insecurity with ever changing priorities.

Company management says they care about employees but is requiring all non-remote employees to go back to offices on a rotating schedule pending local government approval. This is in start contrast to what most of the tech and financial companies are saying. Many are giving employees the option to work from home for the rest of the year. Others say they have no immediate plans to require employees to come back to the office

In all there is a reason the company has a 2.9 glassdoor rating."
761,,Working From Home,2020-06-01,3.0,,"Decent pay, benefits, Attempting to be more a
more progressive company and move past just being a  stodgy credit bureau.","Most companies have been allowing their employees to work from home now for several months and Equifax is no exception.  What is surprising is that we are being asked to come back in  so we can collaborate and yet no one is able to do that with social distancing.  The truth is that although some departments  may benefit to some degree  by collaborating, others do not.  Why ask people to come to an office if they can’t get near anyone anyway?  There appears to be no issues with the performance of those working from home so why force people back?  If Equifax wants to be a progressive company,  their draconian policies  of  forcing people back in an office seem outdated. Google, Twitter and others are allowing 100% remote work regardless of when Covid is no longer an issue. This is not the time to force people into an office just because you can.  If you want to be the progressive data and analytics company, then  look at your outdated policies and consider that you are still acting like this is 1990.  My generation does not need to sit in an office to  perform.  Have some faith and trust in your employees that they will perform without being forced into an office. We can work effectively from any location  which also includes our own  spaces."

Not much else in the past year.","It wasn't long until after the current ceo came aboard when things went downhill. Loss of strategic direction and long term focus turned into monthly and quarterly outlook. After the breach a lot of new leaders came aboard. The big splash was to spend $1.25B to improve technology and security and use that to gain a competitive advantage. This sounds great but we're 2.5 years into it and our technology has never been worse. Every week our ceo provides these vague updates as to what transpired during the week. They're so generic and watered down yet it keeps being sent. Of course you met with the leaders in product, technology, security, etc. etc. How about an actual update as to what progress was actually made. Are we close to completed with our 3yr, $1.25B transformation or have we screwed up so many times that we've spent the money but have added years onto the timeline? Who knows. It's rough when your tools and even your corporate email are trash. They're broken on an almost daily basis. Gmail (yes i said that folks) has been down for the past 1.5 days. Are you kidding me? 2.5 years into the $1.25B spend and 10 months after the Gmail conversion and we still have these reoccurring issues? 

That's another thing, there is no accountability. The standards and expectations of work have gone so far downhill it's impossible to keep things moving anymore. The simplest tasks are made to be so difficult that its just not worth trying anymore.

All this is masked by the brilliant performance of EWS. Bravo, sort of."

The company has been run into the ground in order to meet the $1B in revenue goal. They will likely reach it, and then the decisions they have made will likely catch up with them. Before Equifax took over, this company was a leader in the industry. Within a couple of years, they will likely not even be a contender. They have either run off or fired most of the employees who know what's going on. They have already had over 100% turnover from the top ""talent"" they brought in a couple of years ago to shake things up. They got rid of a team of amazing leaders and have replaced them with inexperienced ""yes"" people who won't question the mismanagement mess that is currently in place.

Everybody is into everybody's business, your life outside office is monitored as much as it is monitored inside.
There are zero perks, zero incentives and everybody is in support.
They expect you to login instantly but can't approve your work from home cause you logged in instantly on their command.
Also here even putting things on mail doesn't matter, they don't care about mails too.
The manager to employee ratio is very bad. There could be one person reporting to 2-3 managers.

No career progression and working from home is discouraged. People are leaving in hordes with no replacement. High management says Dublin is part of a strategic plan but facts show otherwise, there's little investment and projects have been removed from the office.

No infrastructure ownership (it's all in US) and there are changes in configurations and permissions all the time without notice, affecting international teams and blocking the development. Management is unrealistic, even though they know about these problems they expect teams to deliver as if nothing was happening.

Huge storms over insignificant issues, which keeps teams locked in low value and boring tasks.

Lack of transparency. People hired for one project realize on the 1st day that they're going to another totally unrelated project using different technologies, with no explanations given. Candidates are told that the company is fully Agile and has only greenfield projects, which is not true."

846,,An IT Fun House on Fire,2019-11-02,2.0,Anonymous Employee,"In summary, you are a good fit if you: 

* Are new or transitioned into IT and need resume experience from a well-known company
* Thrive under a Parent-Child or Command-and-Control leadership style
* Are okay working overtime to meet unrealistic deadlines 
* Like doing agile, not being agile 
* Want critical information on a need-to-know basis 
* Are okay with delayed or ghost promotions 
* Do not refer gender diversity lack at the VP level 
* Do not mind paying high medical premiums
* Prefer to keep your head down and code/work
* Are able to work to the best of your ability without appreciation, recognition, and constant threat of being laid-off","In summary, you are not a good fit if you: 

* Are an independent thinker 
* Desire to grow as a leader 
* Enjoy collaboration, cross-functional teamwork and whole-team approach 
* Prefer meaningful work
* Believe non-technical workers are as valuable as developers
* Value quality over cutting corners 
* Want market competitive compensation
* Do not want to relocate to ATL
* Find favoritism and nepotism demoralizing 
* Want to work in a psychologically safe workplace 
* Prefer servant leadership structures  
* Want to work for leaders you trust, respect and feel confident in 

Additionally: 

* Above all, it does not matter HOW things get done, only that things get done. IT leadership is terrified of the Workforce Solutions President. 
* The CTO told people to stop being ""victims"" and to be ""vikings” and “storm the beach.” Irrespective of intent, this message is gaslighting people into silence and normalizing mistreatment and chaos. My leaders tried to gaslight me into accepting a big ole flaming hot mess of work WITHOUT real support nor success criteria. Hard pass. 
*IT has a deeply entrenched permissive culture  - and every definition of the word applies here. To name a few: cutting corners and going around the rules is norm: usage of unsanctioned tools, cutthroat antics to meet deadlines and perch protect. Weak boundaries such as managers or even leaders socializing with employees. As if flagrant nepotism isn’t enough. 
* Uppermanagement: When rating on competency, empathy, humility, integrity, communicating vision, and leading - individuals vary widely. As a collective, weak. Very self-protective and defensive. Bad actors and toadies are enabled. I recall a VP openly mocking a team during a meeting. Ironically, this team was his for YEARS until a few months prior. High school behavior runs deep outside and behind closed doors. The CTO even called out jerk behavior in meetings. Still, selective amnesia and blame-shifting responsibility for less favorable outcomes is modus operandi.
* The strongest  flavor of Kool Aid is the encouragement of innovation among workers. Caveat: transformation leadership itself lacks a certain ...freshness. Micro-middle management do not want leaders working for them; they want drones and toadies. So political and bureaucratic, unless you are a favorite, related to a VIP, or otherwise instrumental to their agenda, do not trust higher ups to  backup on implementing ideas outside of corporate mandate. But when your ideas do become part of scope, do trust to have them  passed off as their own. Foul."

-Corner office of building is toxic and a poor leader
-Healthcare benefits are not good. 
-They emphasize goals in workday as they claim to be about developing employees but come annual review time, turns out manager didn’t even read them. 
-No one can make a decision. Leaders constantly change their minds which cause more redundant work on the pawns and the pawns look stupid because what they didn’t originally wasn’t “right”
-Managers aren’t held accountable for poor managing
-EWS is like a high school; if you’re in the right clique you get promotions, spot bonuses, and especially sports tickets. 
-Don’t think about challenging a leader because they’re always right (sarcasm). Leaders hate when you don’t just agree with their stupid and illogical ideas so you’re then shunned. 
-They said my level isn’t eligible for bonuses but yet two other team members were the same level and were on a bonus plan
-So focused on the customer but claim the people are the real assets. (I think I just threw up in my mouth). They don’t care about the people and if you ask people, many of them don’t even want to be there. I heard the place was a different world with previous leadership.

Just not a great work culture.

858,,All round average company,2019-10-12,3.0,Anonymous Employee,Flexible work hours. Occasional remote work. Opportunity to contribute ideas and have them built. Relaxed atmosphere. Plenty of opportunities to gain financing for learning new skills.,"Everyone's complaint is always the same - salaries are way below average for the current market. It seems astonishing that a company this large can be outbid by start ups when it comes to talent acquisition. I've lost count of the amount of people who've left because they were made a better offer in a much smaller company elsewhere.

They don't appear to hire designers, or other creatives. The creative direction of the products is virtually non-existent, and UX/UI design research is sidelined or considered a waste of time. I've heard one product owner remark that they don't even know what their purpose is. In general, I've heard some astounding confessions from POs, to point where I began to wonder what exactly POs even do all day long. 

The quality of the developers varies wildly. I've worked with a great number of chancers, who are happy to do next to nothing for entire sprints, provided they can get away with it. The company can't seem to distinguish between the hardworkers and the chancers - everyone's the same to them, and as such career progression is rendered meaningless.

I've read complaints that management in the US are incompetent - but they're no better or worse than management I've worked with elsewhere. You set your own standards in this company. You can build and learn virtually anything you want - just don't expect such efforts to mean anything to the powers that be. 

Overall, great place to develop some new skills. But poor pay and non-existent career progression means everyone eventually moves on after a year or two."

2. Nothing to Learn  :-  There is absolutely nothing to learn and the work is repetitive just like any service based company. Don't even think of joining the Business Intelligence section of the company where folks are treated as second class citizens in comparison to the Analytics and sales teams. 
3.  Politics and Inefficient Management :- The product managers are worthless and HR Department is pathetic. Salaries can get delayed, notice period gets increased unethically, hikes are poor and variable pay is a scam.

The pay rate is good as long as you are one of the few that don't have to work an absurd amount of hours.,"Work/life balance is nearly non-existent in any support roles. You are expected to work as many hours as needed and there is always a lack of employees on the infrastructure support side of the house. It is not uncommon for someone to work 60+ hours a week without any sort of comp time or overtime compensation. Anyone unable or unwilling to work the 60+ hours is ""not a team player"".

There are too many directors, VP's and SVP's that have their own style and agenda. They conflict with each other and if you try to appease one, you risk offending the others. New ideas are presented, but never seem to come to fruition. When they do, it's only a ""half-measure"" and never in the way that was planned.

No matter how important your job is to the company, how well you perform, how loyal or hard working you have been, you are reminded often that you are expendable. You will hear that you are valued when senior leadership speaks, but their actions scream otherwise. It is incredibly stressful for a person to know that they could be let go without warning, for no logical reasons. All of my reviews were positive, people across the company depended on my work, I did everything in my power to help everyone and provide the best service that I could. I worked tirelessly to keep up with demand with little reward. All of this, only to be unceremoniously let go because my job was eliminated. The people who determined that it needed eliminated didn't even know what it was that I did before making the decision.

The benefits keep getting worse every year. They are sub-par with every company that I've worked at before (even mom and pop shops) and the HR department is laughably incompetent. Their HR department touts new employee ""perks"" in order to mask the benefits that are being rescinded under the guise of ""improvements"". Paying more for fewer lower quality benefits is never considered an improvement."

Generous sick-time policy.","Repeated waves of remarkably bad decisions have left the biggest sources of revenue struggling to feed the beast. 

Agile is paid nothing but lip service. Some small, cosmetic changes were made to qualify for certain distinctions years ago but those changes were never embraced by the company and have fallen away. Teams are still made up of separate sets of developers and testers; developers unwilling to help with testing toward the end of the sprint and testers not given the support needed to contribute to development. Iterative design is impossible given that the business side of the house never even paid lip service to becoming agile. In some organizations, most of the development staff are located offshore, but instead of establishing teams offshore and allocating specific blocks of work to those teams, many teams are spread between onshore and offshore making any pretension of co-location a joke. 

Sales and marketing defines the requirements and due dates, just like in waterfall. Teams are to realize software to those requirements and within that time frame, limited to predetermined available resources. Priorities are regularly abandoned and changed midway through, with developers swapped back and forth between different priorities as if context-switching has no cost. Even when priorities are kept constant for a time, developers need to squeeze their development work in between the time they spend on production support tasks. Some releases get badly bogged down in a seemingly never-ending back-and-forth, trying to get through numerous new process gates. 

Cooperation is generally viewed as something other departments need to do; when the needs of the business extend across organization boundaries, good luck getting anything done in a reasonable amount of time/with a reasonable amount of effort, especially when the cooperation you need to serve your customers requires cooperation from shared services groups. Even though offshore staff work late into their evening, it still results in a remarkably short period of time when working as a full team is possible, made even worse by the fact that many of the onshore team members are spread across two or three teams. The lack of cooperation extends even within teams, with enough onshore staff unwilling to time shift to help increase the number of hours that the team could be working together.

Politics, rather than managerial talent, governs management. Managers are driven to satisfy objectives rather than customers. Managers are quite blatant about their willingness to use funding intended for one purpose to further the pet projects that will serve as foundation for their next promotion. New leaders make bold promises which they don't have any way to keep, since the organization is far bigger than its leaders and reality won't cooperate with their vision. Politics has taken a toll in other ways, especially since the introduction of a matrix management structure. During the latest round of layoffs, critical staff members for certain projects were let go because their work was not critical to their direct-line management's own projects. 

There is no penalty for disrespecting staff. Where this manifests, it breeds a general environment of casual disrespect, including between disciplines, and despoils any chance of pulling together as a team to serve customers. 

Benefits are terrible. Equifax would charge more for inferior health insurance for just me than my partner is paying for superior health insurance for the both of us."

929,,Helping Senior Management Live Their Financial Best,2019-06-01,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"Compensation is competitive, though you will work tirelessly for every cent.","I have never written a Glassdoor review. I’ve not felt the need because even the least favorable companies at which I have been employed have been decent places to work. Equifax Workforce Solutions, however, is a horse of a different color. This toxic dictatorship is unlike anything I have ever encountered and the impetus behind my writing. I feel compelled to warn job seekers before they make a ruinous employment decision. In this review, I will be very intentional about using “manager” in lieu of “leader” when referring to those with greatest positional power in this company, as no aspect of their conduct is remotely reminiscent of leadership. To be sure, the sentiments expressed here are not solely my own; I am giving voice to the many employed by this company who have conveyed shared perceptions and experiences.

While I often hope I have but temporarily drifted into a fictional realm to analyze a case of corporate dysfunction at its worst, it is unfortunately my daily reality. The senior management team is soulless and has absolutely no regard for employees. In this company, it doesn’t matter how you achieve results; it only matters that results are achieved. It is demoralizing to push so hard for nothing more than the prospect of quarterly financials that satisfy overly optimistic forecasts. Sure, Equifax is a business and must make money; however, the radical emphasis on revenue consumes nearly every meeting and conversation. Purpose statements and organizational values may exist on internal banners and the company’s intranet site but unless they relate to the myopic focus on revenue and transactions at any cost that is the President’s modus operandi, they are merely empty words.

On multiple occasions I have witnessed a high and mighty SVP ostracize employees in front of a group of their peers and belittle brilliant people to the point of them losing any measure of self-worth. These insecure bullies not only receive a pass; they advance in this company! The talent acquisition process is highly selective and because senior management lacks a moral compass, they are good at selling candidates a bag of goods far from the stodgy and abrasive reality they will experience as employees. It is truly disheartening to see the degree of despondency that begins to overcome highly capable and talented individuals during their first 90 days.

I have seen involuntary cuts on five separate occasions in the last 10 months, impacting multiple parts of the company, in spite of the business unit being the fastest growing of any under the Equifax umbrella. This often occurs with little or no subsequent communication on who was impacted, leaving employees discovering vacant desks with feelings of being left behind in the Rapture. Senior management loves to control the narrative, so they generally elect not to discuss staff reductions with anyone outside their inner circle. Transparency and open communication are not values the senior management team possess. If one finds himself on bad terms with one of these most erudite senior managers, a reason will be fabricated – even a reorg to communicate a “position elimination” – in order to exit said person.

Simply put, no one advances in this company unless they feed the ego of the autocratic tyrants at the helm. If you wish to sell your soul to the power-hungry, malevolent puppeteers in command, lose all feelings of humanity and self-respect, and become consumed with fear and paranoia about whether you are next on the chopping block (and the probability is high that you would be), you should look no further than Equifax Workforce Solutions as your employer of choice. For everyone else, RUN AWAY AS FAST AS YOU CAN! Your wellbeing and sense of dignity depend on it. No amount of money or desperation for a job can justify taking a position at this soulless and most dysfunctional organization. Choose. Anywhere. Else."

My co-worker is at 120% of his sales goal for the year and was just put on a PIP by his senior leadership for ""not generation enough opportunity."" This is exactly how you lose good sales people. Another issue this company seems to struggle with is ethics and integrity. They will do ANYTHING to make a dollar off your data. We work with different payroll companies and have agreements in place with them that prohibit us from contacting their clients for sales opportunities. Our VP instructed us to ignore these agreements and to contact clients that we were not supposed to be reaching out to. Also, don't get too comfortable when you are hired. Equifax has gone through 3+ rounds of layoffs the last 2 years and you can expect that trend to continue. Most departments are currently running on fumes due to the amount of layoffs. You have to understand that Equifax board members and shareholders are more important than you and senior leadership won't hesitate to do another round of layoffs in order to make their shareholders happy."

We were a mid-sized, privately-held business specializing in unemployment claims and tax management with a reputation for providing excellent client service. I knew we were in trouble when, at our very first meeting with the “new bosses,” we were told, in no uncertain terms, that the goal at Equifax was “make money for our investors,” which they made us repeat, at an ever-higher volume, three times. If this sounds to you like a recipe for client and employee disaster, I will not disabuse you of that notion. Over the next two years, business went from bad to worse, especially after the easily-preventable security breach in September, 2017. Some of our biggest clients did not want to work with Equifax from the beginning, because they had worked with them previously, After the breach, that number began to grow. It climbed even higher after we were “onboarded” into Equifax’s way of conducting business, which is to put customer service at the bottom of the list. This little saga ends on November 14, 2018, when three Equifax higher-ups walked into our office and announced they were closing the company, giving us one hour to collect our personal possessions and leave. To add insult to injury, the boxes they claimed they ordered to pack our things were never delivered. Bottom line: If you wish to work for a company that puts the client last, treats their employees like numbers on a spreadsheet and doesn’t have the competency to have an order of boxes delivered on a given date, then Equifax is the company for you."

Thousands of dollars are spent on food for president visits and break room refrigerators but not on employee benefits or wages. Management would interfere with call queue functions for hare-brained attempts at increasing production line output when in reality, only served to diminish productivity further due to a lack of understanding how the call agents' responsibilities are organized. This employer will only ever attempt to offset the negativity and suffering inflicted on the agents daily by hosting potlucks or free lunches every 4-6 months or so.

As a result, changes are being made with no regard to half of the employees.  The first thing this president did when he took over was add several additional layers of management, so any hope of front line employees (account managers, sales, operations) having their voices heard is near impossible.  Or worse, when they are heard, they're simply ignored.  It's really a shame, because the new CEO seems great, but this company is so big the CEO doesn't have that much of an impact on the day to day...that comes down to the business president and his direct reports (SVPs). 

As if things weren't bad enough after the breach, upper management decided one month after the breach would be a good time to lay off half the account managers, leaving major accounts with no contact person for up to 6 months in some cases.  Now us current account managers are left to clean up the mess.

Sales plans, books of business, quota, and bonus plans are consistently delivered late and even change mid year sometimes, costing employees thousands of dollars.  As a result, but not surprisingly, this year we half lost our best sales people across every sales team.  This business unit is slowly crumbling from the inside out, and unfortunately by the time someone finally listens and does something about it at the top, it's going to be too late."

There is an excellent work-life balance with the ability to tele-commute.,"Strong disconnect between sales and implementation organizations within the company.  The implementation side of the company extremely litigious and does not innovate to meet the needs of the sales side, especially in government sales.  There is very little management oversight leading to poor implementation and improperly defined projects.  Constant rotation of personnel from project to project leaving in flight projects in limbo.  Threes also culture of dishonesty within the ,management ranks in terms of full disclosure of issues to both customers and employees.  Pay and health benefits are  sub par for employees.  For such a large company, the health insurance premiums are substantially higher than many small to midsize companies.

If you do well on that, you'll become an auditor: you review the forms. If anything is missing or wrong, you call the employer to let them to fix their mistake. If you meet your quota, you'll become an inbound agent and you definitely have to meet your quota to get promoted to Help Desk. That's the department where you troubleshoot what other agents can't.

Except I’m still waiting for that pay...wait a minute.","Have you ever seen the show Better Off Ted? Where the employer Veridian Dynamics is the worst kind of money hungry, villainous, corporation with ridiculous internal bureaucracy where secret hazardous employee experiments take place. Equifax Workforce Solutions is like that without the situational humor. Working there was a daily exercise in torture made bearable only by the company of the other prisoners. 

In all seriousness, this place is the absolute worst. I came from TALX which I once thought of as an evil corporation. How wrong I was. After Equifax purchased TAlX they systematically changed everything good about the company so that by the time 10 years had passed we were but unrecognizable hulls of what once were talented, ambitious, caring human beings that provided useful and valuable solutions to our clients. 

The newest leadership team took a successful company (albeit technologically outdated and stale) and exorcised every single thing that made working under the banner of the beast worthwhile. The “R’s” in the ivory tower made clear that despite numerous years of year over year success and sales increases that the rank and file would be held to even more ridiculous standards. Standards that were never put in writing, often not even shared verbally until halfway through the year, and retroactive to the beginning of the performance period. The way in which this billion dollar company conducts business technologically, operationally, and from an infrastructure standpoint is as if someone has placed a very expensive elephant on top of a house of cards that is supported by a tire fire suspended above a lake of monkey poo. If that didn’t make sense, you are starting to get what it’s like to work there. 

Besides the nightmare of reporting to levels management that are often incapable of coherent cogent sentences much less effective management, the solutions themselves are Ford Pintos that cost Porsche prices. Also, they don’t work very well, are supported by layers of stagnant and incompetent support, and in some cases are sold as comprehensive compliance solutions that are later revealed to be incomplete vestiges of what was actually marketed (read: bait and switch). That leads me to the breach. 

The best I have to say about that is that it can happen to any company. The worst I have to say about that is that the layers of arrogance surrounding the “incident” are as profoundly concerning as the event itself. The fact that criminal charges have only been filed against one person is testimony to the deep layers of political corruption that only a century old company can achieve. 

As a final note, I obviously discourage you from working for this barely held together carnival of deceit. But if you, like myself for 10+ years, are desperate enough to accept the blood money here are some tips: don’t try to exceed-it won’t accomplish anything, don’t ever go to HR you will regret it, don’t ever stop looking for a new job, don’t ever look one of the “R’s” directly in the eyes-you will suffer physical pain. 

And as a special post script, of you are considering doing business with EWS, don’t. Maybe just use them to get the price you want from their closest competitor."

The culture is changing from the top on down with new leadership that looks much more focused and effective.
Culture change is slow, but it's clearly underway.  There is more support for security here now than you will find anywhere else. I mean actual buy-in, not just lip service (which is typical most places).  Business leaders' bonuses are directly tied to security results (that gets their attention).  Anything with High or Critical security problems will be shutdown without hesitation (which is pretty rare even in financial companies).
That being said, there is a lot of work to do.  So expect being both productive and busy.  The hours are still reasonable, as management doesn't want people to burn out.
The new Security management is solid, and the CSO/CISO reports directly to the CEO and Board.","Every business struggles to find balance, such as what corners to cut and how many top priorities can we have?
The downsides are mostly typical for companies this size: 
- getting stuff done has been very personal- who knew who
- this can lead to people being adversarial, with the resulting grudges over time
- resulting in bad history between IT and Security groups
- growth focus led to technical- and security- debt growing far too large over the past decade
- so the company is now trying to juggle hundreds of transformational change projects at the same time
- the company is a group of business units and geographies, think little kingdoms, who don't talk to each other

- Management under IT and some BU's is hit-and-miss down to the team level in some areas

From Mid-Senior Leadership Team down was a pleasure to spend more than half of my life working with.","Most of all the current leadership of the Workforce Solutions Business Unit seems to have been crafted as Disney villains (keep an eye on your dalmatians around them). 

Prior to 2016 this Business Unit had leadership which fostered innovation, looked for ways to add value to the customer experience, was supportive of employees, and the leadership (collectively) was even pleasant and personable.   The current Business Unit Leadership portrays themselves as tyrants for whom all of the peasants must serve.  The current leadership's ""new innovations"" are 8 or 10 year old processes which they, the new leadership, had the idea for in 2016/2017.  Had they actually bothered checking with any one of the dozens of legacy experts they would have learned that this has already existed for years. But sadly, the organization was forced to invest in creating and rolling out a new product which was actually several years old.  Customers were, and are confused on this new product push and grand roll out of a solution which they have utilized for years.  Imagine a cell phone provider, who has provided their customers with free voicemail for years, investing heavily into a mailing and commercial campaign to announce that, ""Our subscribers will now get free voicemail!!"" This is what Workforce Solutions just spent the last 18 months gearing up for, and then executing on. 

On top of this disaster of a ""new product launch"" the new leadership is very standoffish and displays no real leadership qualities for their people. As an example the leadership gets invited to plan/strategize for a client meeting (for a top 10 client), and engages as little as possible.  Then, during the meeting, when the leadership decided the content was off the mark (for them) they completely belittle the service team while sitting at the table with the client.  This leadership approach is short-sighted and unacceptable for so many reasons that I won't bother going into the layers of failure this sets everyone up for. 

Furthermore the new leadership definitely has a ""do as I say, not as I do"" approach.  ""Watch your expenses!"", but don't pay any attention to the major, likely 6 figure,  office renovation that I am having done (to an already beautiful office)... ""Employees cannot bring families to work functions!!"" (then brings spouse to a work function).  ""Keep me engaged on your top clients!"", but then declines every opportunity to join planning calls and meetings (and later asks why they have not been engaged).  

I just can't stress enough how disastrous the Workforce Solutions Leadership is.  If you are considering a career with this business unit I would strongly suggest connecting with some of the peasants via LI or other available networks to gather firsthand feedback about the experience of working there these days.  The culture went from very solid, to the worst I have ever experienced in a matter of 12 months or so."

1133,,Workforce Solutions is TOXIC,2018-04-04,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"The ability to work from home.  Work/life balance - you can turn off at 5pm and still get the job done.  Many individual contributors care about their clients and repairing the bad reputation the company currently has after the breach.  Finally, and I’ll add this to the cons also, it’s nearly impossible to get fired here unless you’re a tenured employee with a high base salary.","Where to start.  First let me clarify to those looking at working here, there are 4 main BUs (USIS, Int’l, WS, and GCS).  I worked for Workforce Solutions (WS), f.k.a. TALX, and can only speak to this BU.  The company’s MO is to shift leadership from one BU to the next every 5 years or so.  To that end, if you’re looking at GCS, the President there is a wonderful person and while I can’t speak to much else, I can tell you the culture at GCS is undoubtably the best of the 4 due to his leadership, which is second to none.  I am unfamiliar with USIS and Int’l and can’t speak to either.

As for WS, I’ve never worked anywhere with a worse culture, which is a shame because it wasn’t always bad and happened as a result of the new leadership team.  TOXIC is the best way to describe it.  This stems from poor leadership at the top; a sentiment shared by anyone you speak with at USIS as current leadership previously headed up the USIS BU.  It’s hard to get fired here - meaning there is a lot of dead weight holding the company back.  The senior leadership team has gone all-in on using a consulting firm to blindly make the majority of business decisions for them because they don’t understand the business.  All this might be tolerable to the right person if the pay was competitive.  Unfortunately, every position at the company is paid higher everywhere else.  Talent/HR will tell you the company has a “red carpet in - red carpet out experience” and while I agree this is true, what they won’t tell you is that in between the red carpets is an experience equivalent to your employer holding a plastic bag over your head on a daily basis.  Having left, I realize the grass is greener nearly everywhere else and it is certainly nice to be able to breath again.

The runway for WS is almost non-existent at this point and there is no investment being made in new products.  The current leadership’s big idea for a new product already existed for the last 10+ years and after a year’s worth of development and having not consulted internal employees/SMEs for feedback, they’ve rolled out a product that already exists and no client wants to pay for - to which the SVP says to her sales team at this year’s annual kick off, “You better learn to sell vaporware.”

The future outlook doesn’t look much better either.  Yes, they’ve brought in a new CEO but if you study the hire you’ll quickly realize that while he may be a fine person, this was clearly a play to calm Wall Street given his financial background.  It’s a shame because the company had a real opportunity to transform the business to remain relevant and compete in the future.  My guess is things will stay the same or get worse."

Innovation or suggestions for improvement are not welcome. The senior leaders are very cutthroat and political; everything is done to curry favor with the elites on the posh executive floor. Mid level managers all march in lock step; senior leadership is never challenged.

The administrative staff is treated like second class citizens. There is a patronizing, chauvinistic air that permeates the whole place. Think ""Mad Men"" without the cool wardrobe.

The senior leader in my group was a narcissistic tyrant who seemingly was more concerned about ensuring that he reaped the rewards of the multiple loyalty programs he had attained status in. He was adamant about staying at only the finest 4 or 5 star hotels around the globe and spent a lot of time complaining about less than palatial accommodations. He was not at all concerned about the expenses incurred; however, he did have very specific preferences on the type of pillow he preferred. Lots of time spent on the phone with airlines arguing over the perks of his platinum/diamond medallion status and whether it entitled him to change flights four and five times without penalty (it did not, but he would never believe that). 

This is the kind of place that never does anything nice for its employees, not even something as simple as telling them they can leave early on Christmas Eve or the Friday after Thanksgiving. Every day is just like another at the Gulag."

1159,,Product Management,2018-01-24,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"Like anywhere, you'll find some good people to work with; flexibility to work from home; decent pay/bonus structure","Senior leadership in my business unit was totally unreasonable; didn't care at all about the people, but just wanted to make himself look good (trying to position himself as best candidate to be the next CEO). Seriously - he didn't care at all about the people or how ridiculous his demands were.

In my team, mid level managers had absolutely no backbone. They would not push back at all on senior leadership. We were told we could not question anything the senior leader said and that we had to act as if he was always right and was always ""the smartest person in the room"". Then all they did was push down on the team to try to deliver on ridiculous demands. 

I'm sure there are some groups in the company that don't act like that. Unfortunately, I was not in any of those. The leadership on my team was toxic and incompetent. 

On a side note, the technology used is second class (which is pretty obvious given the company was responsible for the largest data breech of sensitive personal information ever)."

1163,,A Dilbert Comic,2018-01-14,3.0,Anonymous Employee,"Low pressure and no need to work overtime. That means you have time outside of work to stay healthy and see your family and friends. You'll find many employees who have been here over a decade for that very reason. It's stable, the people are polite and friendly and tend to be family oriented individuals.

If you're a cybersecurity expert, there are enormous long-term opportunities here. Equifax is investing heavily in this area in the wake of recent (2017)  data breaches, and they need your skills and leadership.","If you're deeply technical and seeking intellectual stimulation, you may find your coworkers to be somewhat dull. The typical software developer at Equifax does not have side projects and does not read about software or attend conferences and meetups. They're mainly family people outside work. That's a generalization, of course. There are a few genuine big data experts keeping this place up and running. There's also an army of below average software talent who joined for the stable income and work/life balance.

Upper management is loyal to one thing-- investors. Town halls and stock reports are the same thing. It's yet to be seen whether the 2017 data breach will shock executives into taking their customers more seriously.

Management came directly from a Dilbert comic. That's not surprising for any enterprise though. Middle management is full of professional ladder climbers playing games to consolidate power and supporters for their next promotion. Customer interests are mostly forgotten by this brand of management.

Overall mission clarity is low. The company is comprised of several business units, and most units were former independent companies acquired by Equifax. These units retained their structure, culture, and leadership. Even after years, they remain silos with their own cultures and goals. So the company is fragmented and top leadership doesn't provide unifying principles and vision."

The company has cool rewards programs (when they're used).  Depending on your manager, there is a lot of flexibility to be remote and make your own hours...depending on your manager.... There seems to be a lot of trust to do your job - not a lot of hovering, in my experience, by senior leadership.","Where to begin... The culture stinks. Very internally competitive atmosphere and full of gossip. More of an 'old boys' club where the 'lifers' like to dish on other employees, peers or otherwise. If you're not willing to join in on the gossip, you're not included in opportunities. Definitely a play favorites kind of atmosphere. 

Besides that, I think the worst part of working here, in the area I was in anyway, is that there is no room for advancement, formally. You will be given opportunity after opportunity to own things, dictate process, try your hand at XYZ, but don't expect it to come with any kind of promotion or financial compensation. In my experience, it's management's way to let you think you're developing professionally, and let you learn new skills, but not let you branch out and stifle any chances of moving out of your position. For a company who has a core pillar of ""invest in talent"" they don't seem to practice what they preach. People need more than a pat on the back for taking on more work and doing a good job. 

Having said all this, there are definite perks of working here, like you'll get to do and learn a lot. For someone starting out, it's a great place to get your hands dirty and probably do a great job, build your resume. BUT beware, do not get sucked in. It will not get better. HR is almost useless in terms of helping you find a new role internally, and, unless you have an excellent manager (they do exist!), your manager will likely make you offers and promises to keep you that will never happen or change over time...get everything in writing. 

The turnover is insane - one way to get positive attention is to document every process of your manager. They'll be gone soon and you'll be a hero for knowing how to do that job...because chances are you and your team are going to be the ones picking up the slack. Do yourself the favor and be organized up front. Burnout is a hige problem, from my experience. Unless you are on an amazing team with great leadership, get out while you can."

1309,,Account Manager Inside Sales,2016-12-21,1.0,Account Manager,Friendly and helpful colleagues.,"Please read carefully!  For any potential Inside Sales candidates (Professionals need not apply.  This role is entry level).  The following should be taken into consideration:

1) Technology.  For a world class data company, it's very unusual that archaic systems are still being used.  Systems are slow and are not in line with one another.  One must use several systems to retrieve information required to do job.  Time consuming and frustrating.
2) Pay.  Base pay is average, however, the commission structure is skewed to favor the company and provide less pay to employees (stay long enough and you'll agree).  Although the payout is quarterly, it's typically delayed at least a month or two after due to issues confirming true numbers.
3) Micro-management.  Employees are being told how to spend their time, who to call, and when to call.  Also, daily reports are required to appease operations.  Meanwhile, legitimate revenue generating activities are overlooked trying to appease the artificial numbers created.  Calls are recorded to ensure your calls meet their definition of a ""sales call,"" which is very subjective.
4) Pricing.  Credit files are core business and company has outpriced them through yearly increases to point where customers are paying on average three times more then competition.  Very difficult to make up lost revenue. 
5) Performance Improvement Plans.  Company is not shy about putting Reps in PIPs, and in fact, have let many people go due to this.  One or two lost customers will put you in jeopardy to be put on one.  Very negative feeling with this hanging over ones head at all times.
6) Communication.  Very poor communication across various departments.  Extremely difficult to do your job when management doesn't even know who to go to to get things done.
7) Errors in critical data.  Reps are measured on net new business, however, in many cases, the new accounts will be missing from your book, resulting in less revenue and metrics not being met.
8)  Management.  Lack of understanding of what this role truly entails.  No trust or value of Sales Reps.  For a sales organization, it's interesting how no one in leadership roles have any true sales experience.  Middle management roles have recently been created, adding to an already crowded leadership team.  
9)  Dialer system.  Company has made it no secret that Inside Sales is now a call center.  One must be very cautious on how much time is spent in the bathroom, as your pause times and all activities are closely monitored. 
10) Negative atmosphere.  With all the aforementioned issues, it makes for a highly negative environment.  

I hope this information is beneficial to anyone considering a career in Inside Sales at Equifax."

They offer  fairly flexible schedules and I typically never have to work more than 40 hours a week, which is great!","If actions speak louder than words (which they do), Equifax clearly does not value their employees as their most important asset.  The constant decline of benefits makes that clear. Management is given a 3% raise ""allowance"" that they must divvy up between all of the members of their team.  Meaning most employees see less than a 2% pay raise each year."

Equifax strives to be accurate and fair, which is commendable since it, Trans Union and Experian are pretty much the only players in their field. Building and information security are vigilant and they do a good job of training the workers to be that way, too, because so much of what is done there involves sensitive materials. They do a good job of recognizing good work.","Meetings are inefficient. More time is spent jockeying for meeting rooms than probably should be. Like any overly corporate atmosphere, a lot of what you see is posturing -- managers calling a meeting for the sake of calling a meeting, endlessly cc-ing as many people on emails as possible, so as to seem more important by the breadth of your audience. They are not encouraged to be overly imaginative, and you won't move up if you don't sing the company line on the correct beat. Training can be hit or miss. Computers are slighhtly out of date (they still use unsupported IE, for crying out loud). If you sacrifice for the good of the team, your good deed will not go unpunished by rigidly by-the-book unimaginative managers."

Here is a good place to start, but it is a good place to get stuck at the same technologies.","There's no much possibilities to reach people in the US, who make the big technological decisions. 
They talk about being a company with a very flat hierarchy, but in reality, it is a flat hierarchy until you reach the Santiago Center Lead. You'll get the attitude of ""it is my way, or the highway"", so if you dislike dictatorship, just stay away from him.
Low salary wage, Exciting projects stay either in the US or in Dublin, Chilean offices are just an offshore software factory within a different financial branch, which doesn't let further growth. You will get stuck in the ""intermediate"" level as most of the coworkers. They don't easily let you go from one project to another. In that sense, innovation is limited. You will get to learn a lot from your team, but when you're done with that, there's no chance you will get to see any of the external technologies other teams are working at. 
Sometimes I felt like in a kindergarten. Most of the people really love gossip, so just try to keep your private life private. Ah! forgot to mention: there's no enough room for everyone (some meeting rooms are being used as working spaces), but it seems it's temporary."
1357,,Excellent work/life balance,2016-08-21,5.0,Director,Work/life balance here is the best I've ever had. Benefits are decent. Coworkers are a pleasure to work with.

1359,,Senior Hearing Consultant,2016-08-13,1.0,Senior Hearing Consultant,"None unless you are part of their corporate mindset. If you tow the line like a good little lemming, then you are a model employee. If you are a protagonist, point out what could be done differently, then you are not a ""team"" player.","To much one way thinking. When it was the Frick Company, it was very hierarchical. If you were a Claims Service Representative, you were the bottom of the barrel. You were seen and treated that way. I had a BS in Business Administration, put together a position paper, sent it up the chain and one Senior Manager stated that he was surprised  that a CSR knew so much and could speak so formally. I had more managerial experience than my own supervisor, I just didn't have the practical experience. 

Then TALX bought us out and then the culture changed for the better. Equifax then bought us out and things more or less stayed the same. Then we got a new manager and things went back to that hierarchical structure. It became the worst place to work. Everyone became fearful and then 1/3 of the people got laid off and 1/3 got transferred."

1) Per diem is taxable unless you submit bills but nobody might tell you - be careful. Atleast they give per diem - even though they deduct 20%-30% extra tax on it once you are back. 
2) Health insurance exists.
3) Your driving skills will improve as every morning you will face Bangalore traffic and then circle around to try to find a parking place for yourself.
4) You don't need an ID card - it is a BFSI company where the ID machine does not work!","1) Bonus not paid on time.
2) Appraisal does not happen on time. 
3) Offer letters are given out and withdrawn on the whim of managers. So if you get an offer letter and are hoping to join Equifax, then be careful.
4) Designation might be changed just before you join. You might get downgraded from Senior Consultant to Consultant.
5) There is no management. 
6) There is no retention policy.
7) Office does not have parking, coffee machine. 
8) Focus is on coming to office on time, and not the kind of work that gets done.
9) There are two teams - India business & Coe(US business). COE is a dead end. India business is suicide. Even then DONOT JOIN CoE - India business might atleast give you decent hikes and promotions.
10) There is no leadership. There were a few good leaders, they have left. Senior leadership might be good (no comments there) but middle management is rotten.
11) Work will not get done, so expect people to play a blame game here.
12) Do not expect managers to guide in you anything technical.
13) Middle management is also filled up with liars.
14) Telephone lines go blank as 'airtel did not register our payment'. 
15) Internet connectivity is frequently missing.

Good people doing good work and generally enjoying the daily challenges.  The company is growing and people are generally upbeat and optimistic about the future.  

Equifax respects your personal time and doesn't expect you to work on weekends or demand crazy overtime hours to demonstrate commitment.  The culture is pretty much a 9-5 mindset.  The parking lots are empty before 8 and after 5.  

CEO is one of the best.  when it comes to laying out a vision and a strategy.  You can't argue with his success and what he's done for shareholders over the last 10 years.  He's also a good person, which is rare when it comes to CEOs.  The only knock against him would be that he's not a good judge of talent.  He's hired some duds and keeps non-performing poor leaders around way too long.","There is little or no opportunity for promotion beyond the VP level.  Executive level politics are horrible, and although they talk about a ""meritocracy"", it's just a sound bite.  Promotions are awarded more like a beauty contest than based on performance.  

Compensation is below average.  If you stay longer than 3 years you get left behind on your compensation and they hire new people in at much higher salary levels.  Also, the disparity in pay between the Senior Leadership Team and the rest of the company is HUGE.

I find my job title does not match my role and was told it is difficult to create a title, therefore a title was just given, which isn't closely related to what I do. They indicated the job title doesn't matter but I beg to differ. This also doesn't help when you are looking to advance internally/externally or someone is verifying your information."
1507,,LOVE my Job,2015-06-09,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Well paid for the work.   Some not all positions receive bonuses which are generous.    Most direct bosses are fair and equal.

This company promotes on merit and training not on gender, race etc.     Equifax will help pay for additional higher education.    Most positions require college degree.","Most positions require a college degree, which in some cases I believe overlooks some valuable  employees due to lack of degree.

1511,,Great Company,2015-06-04,5.0,Anonymous Employee,This is a very fast-paced environment with challenging work. Management has always had my back. The company has a high moral code and has a strong vision for the future.,There are some employees that are not willing to accept change and some groups that make very siloed decisions based on what is best for them. This can make it difficult for the people who are trying to move the company forward.
1512,,Work Culture,2015-06-04,5.0,Senior Proposal Manager,"Equifax is one of the nicest companies I have worked for.  Staff are appreciated, encouraged to do well and remunerated accordingly.

The work-life balance here is phenomenal.
Equifax hires only the best and brightest candidates; employees here are incredible and have so much knowledge to share and we care about how our performance impacts our teammates and our company.
Equifax offers opportunities to grow personally and professionally and encourage career advancement and movement within the organization.","The most frustrating part for me is that like with any job that requires working on a computer, we experience times when our applications have hiccups and down time."
1515,,Great place to work.,2015-06-03,4.0,Front Line Manager,"The senior leadership in my area is very supportive and strives to grow our team's skills as a whole. Equifax is fantastic at adapting to a current market in whatever area it has entered, which provides for a stable work environment.","Movement within departments is sometimes limited due to many areas maintaining a smaller group size. People often associate Equifax with ""credit"" and nothing else. We do a lot of other helpful work int he world."
1516,,Equifax,2015-06-03,4.0,Anonymous Employee,"Very professional company.  I felt that the compensation was fair.  Coworkers were great to work with.  Most managers were very experienced, and they were able to provide good guidance to achieve team goals.","Unfortunately the company only really understands consumer business, and they are almost completely focused on existing business.  If you are in consumer account management, your job is safe.  Some departments will fight each other.  Company politics can be unpleasant."

As an employee of the Equifax Workforce Solutions subsidiary who works remotely, I've benefited from the company's generous 3 Week PTO grants, great health and dental benefits, and flexible work schedule.","Senior Leadership has changed twice in 4 years, my direct manager has changed 4 times in 15 months, and we are 1 year into a change in our service structure. There is little consistency or communication from upper management downward."

1522,,Solid Employer with Great Outlook but room for improvement,2015-06-03,4.0,Anonymous Employee,"Total Compensation package is fair and competitive to the market; Career Opportunities are available IF you put your career in your hands - talk to your manager, network, keep an eye on the internal postings.  Many employees are promoted from within; Decent benefit programs, including med/dental/vision, 401k with company match, great history of bonus payouts; High level of flexibility with work schedule, work from home opportunities and overall balance; Growing company with strong stock price","Not unlike any other company, there are some managers and some employees who tend to look out for themselves and are not willing to help others progress.  The practice of ""survival of the fittest"" during performance management fosters this type of behavior unfortunately.  At Equifax, this is known as Meritocracy and is drilled down from the CEO.  Employees are vetted against each other in something called calibration and only a certain percentage are allowed to receive high ratings each year during performance reviews.  It tends to force employees to work as individuals rather than as a team because the entire team cannot win in the end.  A bit of a frustrating process that tends to foster mediocracy in performance as a result.

No employee stock purchase plan.

Somewhat low annual merit increases for majority of employees (due to meritocracy described above).  

Silo'ed environment in many areas where the left foot doesn't know what the right is doing."
1523,,Vice President,2015-06-03,5.0,Vice President,Talented and engaged employees and well positioned company in its markets.,Dynamic industry with emerging technology with big data creating opportunities and potential disruptions

1526,,Fulfillment Analyst,2015-06-02,1.0,Global Fulfillment Analyst,"I'm going to retire in just a few more weeks!
Well, they hired me when I needed a job.  The first few years were really not that bad.  I hired into a small company that Equifax had just recently bought, and it took several years before the Equifax culture really started drawing us in.","I've been struggling with bad software for 50 years, but this is by far the worst I've ever seen.  Everything is carefully designed to slow down production and encourage mistakes.  There are at least three different single-sign-on systems, and you have to type in your password at least 20 times a day so you won't forget it, but it's up to you to keep all the passwords in sync.  ""Agile Development"" is so codified that the schedules must be met whether or not the tests pass, let alone whether the new web apps do anything useful at all for the users.  

And then there's the incomprehensible corporate-speak from the ""Senior Leadership"", maximize the word count and minimize the information content, but I guess you get that everywhere these days.
I could go on and on.

Worst job I've ever had, worse than bleaching tombstones in the national cemetery in the summer of '68."
1527,,Great potential but little actual enagagement,2015-06-02,3.0,Anonymous Employee,"Really interesting, engaging time to be at the company, with many innovative projects and solutions being supported by management.  Company has money to invest in technology and solutions and good leadership at the top levels.","Innovative projects and solutions, but many middle tier managers have been here a long time and are not innovative or creative.  Lots of emphasis on 'face-time', and management style feels 15 years out of date.  Lots of micro managing and passing down of extra responsibilities, with no compensation in return.  Goals change multiple times per year or are not even communicated until mid year, meaning a functional 6 months to achieve a years' worth of work.

Career advancement hindered by lifers who do not move on, and there is no career advancement outside of Atlanta or St Louis.  It is great if you work in these two markets, but frustrating when you consistently see talent and ability passed over in favor of proximity.  Company requires employees to mark their status as fully relocatable and able to travel 50% in order to be considered for management positions.  

Divisions are still very siloed, meaning that managers rarely consider internal candidates from other parts of the company, even though HR gives the impression that career growth is entirely fluid.  In reality, only upper management seem to move easily from silo to silo, whereas lower tiers are not given the ability to move laterally.  Overall, there seems to be a large communication gap between what HR and Exec team are pushing for and what actually happens at the managerial levels."
1528,,Performance-driven culture with strong leadership,2015-06-02,5.0,Director,"I have been impressed by management's leadership which is strong, fair, and intentional. There is accountability and an expectation of performance and growth. It is a highly collaborative atmosphere.  The company also seems to reward employees when the company is successful.  I particularly enjoy my colleagues as well as my department which is run transparently and with true concern for the employee holistically.  In my department, employees are given a fair bit of autonomy as well as flexibility particularly around working remotely.  The company has a strong corporate citizenship program and matches employee donations to charities from $50-$5,000.","The culture at corporate headquarters (Atlanta) seems stiff and dry.  Benefits are less generous than my former employers.  Depending on your field, opportunities for career advancement can be limited."
1529,,Growth Story with a Great Culture,2015-06-02,5.0,Anonymous Employee,Leadership pushes company growth along with employee career development. Welcoming culture that balances personal and professional development.,Legacy systems and processes present challenges to innovation.
1530,,Solid company but set in its ways,2015-06-02,4.0,Anonymous Employee,Equifax has a solid reputation with its clients and is the leading repository of decision information.  It has made great strides in improving the employee experience by offering work flexibility options such as work-from-home and flexible hours.  It has a good matching for the 401K program and does offer health insurance although it it expensive in my opinion. Work locations include gyms and reasonable cafeterias.,"The annual employee review system is not one of the best.  There is a quota system whereby only a small percentage is allowed to be rated as ""Excels"" and regardless of how hard you work you will probably be in the ""achieves"" category.  This is especially true if you are a junior person in a smaller department where the senior team members are entrenched and management doesn't want to lose them. The dress code, although not as stringent as other companies could be loosened for those who spend their entire work life in a cubicle out of the eye of any outside entities. Many times managers are provided gushing kudos and rewards for work that the rank and file accomplished, in spite of the manager's lack of knowledge about what the employees really do. I have seen a lot of turnover of great folks because of the perception that they aren't appreciated yet have unreasonable pressure from managers so the managers can shine."

The work schedule / flexibility to work from home is a big plus. The Annual bonus / profit-sharing is good if your position qualifies for it.",Upward mobility is poor; we rarely promote from within. Actual career development is virtually non-existent other than some basic eLearning courses and targeted leadership & high-potential development. Corporate politics within management play a significant factor (who you know or knew determines your opportunities). The majority of the work is underfunded and grossly understaffed which means at times it feels like a sweatshop.

The merger was smooth and Equifax gave everyone the chance to weigh in on the changes, making it a pleasant merger for everyone. Of course there were changes, but they happened in slow stages to give us time to adjust.  

I also love the Culture and Values that Equifax stands for.  They are very active in the communities where they have offices.  Before the merger, our company gave us time and opportunity to volunteer and/or donate to local causes.  Equifax Culture and Values not only allowed that to continue, it encouraged it.  

Equifax also wants its employees to succeed.  There are many opportunities for advancement and classes offered to allow us to learn about other positions.","As in any large company, there will be downsides, things that not every one is happy with.  In Equifax, that is sometimes the disconnect between different divisions.  Equifax is known for credit reports and scores.  If you work in a different division from the credit reporting, or the Atlanta based area, sometimes you feel like your division isn't as important in the large company emails and meetings.  When you tell people where you work, they only know of the Credit reporting.  It can be annoying at times."

They hand pick the people they want prior to posting opportunities and they do not talk about them within the internal groups.  If your good at your job, they want to keep you right where you are.  Its easier.  Looking at the landscape over the past several years there has been a huge shift.  At one time there were a lot of people that had worked here for years and looked forward to retiring from Equifax.  Now, all of those people are gone and there are a lot of college grads.  The talking points are, ""We want to hire the best and the brightest"".  The truth is, they remove people after about ten years in the organization, hire young grads and pay them half the salary.  And work them to death.  The CEO's talking points do not filter down to the entire organization.  Lets be honest, who do you think has the best and brightest ideas to move a company forward?

Your experience really depends on the group.  My previous group was incredibly political and pitted team members against each other and the leadership was petty and vindictive.  One minute you were a hero the next you were a villain having not changed your behavior only difference is the wind direction.  

The group where I currently work is a good group they  treat you like adult both in giving you the autonomy to do your job and hold you accountable for the deliverables for which you are assigned.","This place is a political minefield.

I've heard the pay was good for full-time employees and the benefits seemed competitive (I was intern).

Building is in a good area - relatively good array of places to eat nearby, near Westport, near other office buildings, and close to 270 if that's important to you. The building was also good compared to others I have seen an heard of (tad bit more open space and generally good facilities/working conditions).

Good place to gain professional business experience and learn about business in general","Some poor management - My manager was never around, always working from home (which isn't an issue except no one in my group saw any work get done by the manager).

Cold culture - People weren't very outgoing/friendly in general, my guess for the average age is ~40, people didn't seem excited about their job in general. It just felt more professional and rigid than I prefer (but I prefer a bit more of a relaxed culture which is hard to maintain in a large company). Also, I remember my manager telling me several times how things ""used to be"" before TALX was bought by Equifax. They used to have BBQs or whatever and overall it seemed like a more fun place to work. Fun would not be a word I would use to describe working there so it concerned me what direction the company was going. Another example is the Holiday/Christmas Party which was a lunch offsite, during a work day, that lasted just barely over an hour...wow.

While I was there a co-worker in my group had to work so much overtime for a proposal. If I had to guess she probably worked at least 80-90 hours that week. After I left, my friend who works there had to work several 12-16 hour days to keep up with the workload (one person left the team and the manager didn't help out) I don't believe this is the norm, but it made me think that work/life balance might be a little off there.

Like most office work, much of the time it is boring

I agree with one reviewer who talked about silo'd departments, us vs them mentality, lack of standard processes throughout creating extra work for people trying to work together/use the same information. For example, the marketing group had wonderful graphics that they used for who knows what but my team sent out proposals to possible clients and we were using old graphics and mad up graphics because we weren't given access to the new graphics for some odd reason. Why wouldn't you want everyone to have access to sending out graphics that brag about the company?"

No one is going to help your customers when you're out of the office.,"I could give you the whole list but it would be useless.  Read the other negative reviews.  The people leaving positive reviews are more than likely in management or C-Level Exec's.  

After 9 years in sales, I can honestly say the job was a dream when I first started.  I cannot come close to saying that now.  Over the years the systems have gone from old to antique.  And, getting a product added to an account is like pulling your own finger nails out because they keep adding people and steps to the process which make no sense.  If one person in Operations is on vacation and they have any responsibility for implementing a product, no set-ups will be complete until that person returns or someone finds a manager who knows what to do.  We actually bust it out getting our numbers (which aren't given to us until April or May)only to be told in December the quota is being changed and you did not reach your goals ... NO COMPENSATION FOR YOU!

Oh, and that's another thing.  You can bring in $500K in extra revenue YOY and still only be 75% of goal while the goof-off sitting next to you brings in $94K and is 110% of goal.  Unrealistic quotas, no equity in compensations, and systemic problems with the processes makes this company a dud."

The need to ""be seen"" is so problematic that people who want raises and promotions seem to intently slow down other departments by adding ridiculous steps into an already disfunctional process for fulfilling sales orders.  

New products are introduced to the sales teams but operations is never told how to fulfill them once they are sold.  Therefore, the sales rep ends up not only losing their sale but has to field calls from an irate customer on the issue for weeks.

Lying is a part of the corporate structure ... an entire team in operations was lied to about their job going away for months, they were let go 6 months after the first question was asked about their positions being terminated.  

Sales is in such a dissaray, that you can boost a dying book of business up by 16% in 2 quarters and still be repremanded or fired because the book of business did not reach 100% of goal as a result of the last rep who had it.

Overworked, lied to and humiliated in meetings ... not worth it.  It was an okay company when I started 8 years ago, but it has gone down hill for anyone NOT in upper management. I only stayed for the benefits but now it's not worth it and I'm looking for the door!"

Management is very good.  

Company has a very good culture","There are a lot of people that have been with the company for 20 - 40 years.  While this is a good thing, some ideas are hard to advance.  New management has addressed this issue and we are consistently pushed to think outside the box."

By far and hands down.,2012-08-06,1.0,Verification Specialist,"Good name for your resume, pays on time,comes with benefits if you're willing to put up with the extremely unprofessional work environment.",Management doesn't know what they are doing. They tell us over and over to be professional but consistently hire people that are incapable of being professional. I feel like I'm walking into a highschool every time I go to work because of all the drama. They consistently look over the older (I'm only 26) employees with more experience to promote young kids that are barely old enough to drink.

Good grasp of what is happening in the current economy.","Service is provided under the guise of sales.

Flexible Work environment
Interesting problems and technology to work with","Senior management does not understand technology
Very old school use of technology

The benefits are pretty good as well.","Equifax is a company that values internal relationships.  People are promoted by ""Who"" they know and are friends with.  Not if they're great fits or can help the company grow.  The Director and Manager I worked under were not good Managers at all, they were smart individuals but knew absolutely nothing about establishing and encouraging trust and encouraging their employees to be the best they can be. They were promoted because they did things to make their superiors look good.  Under their guise,  learning, education and appreciation were not promoted.  

I don't think many people at Equifax who are in Management positions are actually ""good"" managers at all.  

Also, I think many employees are severely underpaid.  After leaving Equifax, every job I interviewed for paid at least $20K more per year.  Long hours, bad pay."

Budget cuts and salary cuts are going to result in many employees leaving for better opportunities. More work for less pay. Managers don't fully understand the scope of employee's job duties and responsibilities and as a consequence heap more work on already overworked employees. The overall goals for employees are unclear and change often. Benefits become more expensive every year with no improvement in what is included in the benefit package.
