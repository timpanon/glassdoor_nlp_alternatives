2,,Good place to be,2022-04-09,5.0,Administrative Assistant,Really Good benefits with company,Not enough room for growth
3,,Don’t work here - Sales commission focused,2022-04-06,1.0,Financial Consultant,"- A lot of young advisors
- Some very successfuly advisors","- Management pushes products (Life & Annuity)
- Products are expensive and complex
- Stuck in an old pyramid schemer sales structure 
- They wont focus on assets / wrap fee
- As you get a large amount of AUM the fee they take on those assets is a lot. 
- You don’t get a lot in return for the fee that take on your book
- Most of the internal staff is under paid and therefore they are not good at moving the ball and making change"
4,,Good long term career,2022-04-04,5.0,Financial Advisor,"Job is hard for the first few years, but is worth it in the long run when you put in the effort",Job is hard in the first few years
5,,"Great People, Less Support",2022-04-04,2.0,Financial Advisor,"Great people depending on your branch, opportunity for growth, full commission schedule, no income caps","Very Cliquey, Lower Compensation structure than other firms, less support when starting out than other firms. Pushed to sell Annuities/Insurance instead of planning"
6,,Not What I Expected,2022-04-02,3.0,Financial Professional,"Decent culture, nice people, flexibility, work-life balance when performing well.","I wouldn't recommend working for Equitable Advisors as someone starting out in the financial services industry. I joined under the impression that I would be part of a group that advises clients on retirement planning and building a book of business through a target market with the structure and support of other advisors. This is more of a sales job (of course advising is sales based), however Equitable trains you to push the 403(b) sale and in my experience, did not train or emphasize enough that there may be better options from a financial planning perspective for the client. I don't feel like management prioritizes adequate training, partnership with experienced advisors, structure, etc. Instead, they focus on recruiting, having the new advisors write X amount of business, failing out of the business/quitting, and repeat. Upper management makes many promises that are usually not delivered, and there is constant pressure to make the next sale. In my opinion, not a place where you should cut your teeth. You'd be better off learning under an experienced advisor and learning what this career is really like than chasing the next commission while not learning the true fundamentals of what it takes to do right for the client and having your compensation be a side effect of the good planning and advise that you give, not just chasing a sale so you can pay the bills. There is potential for Equitable's structure to develop great advisors. The experienced advisors that I worked with do provide good advice. The issue is getting new advisors to the point where they can focus on the client's best interest instead of focusing on affording bills that month. 

Also be warned that you will be expected to cold call in this role. Finally, a major issue that I have with Equitable's benefits is that employer health insurance coverage is tied to the sale of proprietary products, not your overall production."
7,,Buyer Beware,2022-04-01,1.0,Financial Advisor,"I'm writing this so I can look at other job salaries and glassdoor requires that I write a review. This job is a sales job that's commission only and you are given no resources to obtain clients besides a phone. If you're able to bring in clients and sell then you'll rake, otherwise just use it to get your Series 7 and then bounce.",most of it. it's a tough gig. i wouldn't really trust the junior advisors either. came chasing after my commission once i left
8,,Cold caller for senior advisors;  accounts from your natural market go to mgmt,2022-03-31,3.0,Financial Advisor,"Flexible schedule and unlimited opportunity for highly networked advisors.
You'll get your FINRA and Insurances licenses.","Focused on insurance sales and other packaged products.
Most new advisors sell to their natural market until those run out and then can't survive unless they have low/no expenses and are cold calling animals. Most new advisors last about 1 year and then your good accounts go to managers. This is a fully commissioned position and would work for advisors with an existing book of business."

It's a grind in the beginning while you're building your practice.
13,,Workplace Violence,2022-03-26,1.0,Financial Advisor,There are no pros. I suffer a lot from this company.,This company used a golf club against me. From the very beginning the woman training me (digital marketing) said that management called me weird and she was inappropriate. My experience was excruciating.
14,,Waste of time,2022-03-26,1.0,Financial Professional,"No pros, do not do this.","At first they tell you this is an amazing opportunity and show a six figure range for how much you ""might"" get payed if you're a top performer. Then they tell you to take a few tests, easy peasy. Once you get into it you first need to get your state Insurance certification. You need to pay a separate college for the class, easily 80 hours of unpaid studying, take your test and IF you pass you move on to your SIE. Your SIE is another couple hundred $ for all the study materials, another couple hundred hours of studying all the material and a more money to schedule and take your test. Finally your Series 7 is the big one. Another couple hundred for all the study supplies, ANOTHER couple hundred hours of studying and $200 charge just to take the test. You can only fail it once before having to wait 30 days to take it again and even longer if you fail that one, $200 charge for the test every time. I spent the greater part of a year after graduating college being strung along from these people. They partially cover your expenses, then after your SIE send you One (1) $350 check for all your hard work before working on your S7. 

The recruiter/manager was not truthful about all the work that goes into getting your certifications, and all the hours after."
15,,Tough,2022-03-26,5.0,Financial Professional Associate,There is a lot of freedom. If you are successful you can do well,You have to sell in order to eat. Unless you are bringing clients with you this probably isn’t the way to go

The people are what makes the branch an enjoyable place to work.,A lot of time is spent on non revenue generating activities.

62,,Just trying to see if this is a scam,2022-01-12,3.0,Financial Advisor,Pretty sure it's not but 4 interviews is quite a few. Although it's understandable since you basically work directly with millions,Idk they seem legit the interview thing is weird. Always feels weird selling life insurance prone to pyramid scheme stuff. Also the start your own business! Thing is like pyramid 101 but the products seem good enough will update.
63,,Ton of Flexibility,2022-01-11,4.0,Financial Advisor,Unlimited income potential and autonomy.,Long hours if you want to build a strong business.
64,,Good place to start out of college,2022-01-09,2.0,Financial Advisor,"Flexibility of work, and large upside earning potential. Good place to start your career and obtain your licenses.",Company is very outdated with their processes. There is also only a $25k base salary or an option of full commission. On average people don't last past two years. Unless you like making calls you will fail miserably at this job. There is an overemphasis on useless trainings and much of the management has no clue what they're doing. Most of the time you are on your own to figure things out.
65,,Do Your Research!!,2022-01-07,1.0,Financial Consultant,"- Flexible hours 
- Get licensed (but Equitable won't pay for them until a year after you get them)","- It is literally the exact business model of a pyramid scheme. Seniors ""hire"" juniors who just cold call everyday and get meetings booked for the seniors. Juniors get paid little to nothing and usually quit after 1 year. The seniors don't have to pay them anything after they quit so there is a benefit to seeing juniors fail. 

- Through your first year you will make about $10,000. Second year about $25,000. And that is considered being on track. Absolutely no way to sustain living in NYC on that pay. 

- Your start is very closely tied to your manager. DO YOUR RESEARCH on them. If they are bad at closing business you will make NO money. Mine was terrible and blew multiple sales 

- For your first 2-3 years you will do the same thing every single day: Cold call people who want nothing to do with Equitable because they either don't know what it is or know that bad reputation it has. 

- Very slimy in the sense that you basically have to lie/con these random people into taking meeting with you 

- Culture is terrible. All the junior consultants absolutely hate being there because they are basically working for free. My first month there I heard someone say ""would you rather work here or be unemployed"", another answered ""unemployed because I'd be making more money"" and that is true!"

If you work hard you can reap the benefits.",Keep in mind it is a large corporate operation that can be very disorganized at times. Benefits and tools limited for new advisors until certain quotas are met. As with any company there are good employees and some that border on unscrupulous. Have a good understanding of whom you will be working with beforehand.
69,,What you put in is what you will get out,2021-12-14,5.0,Executive Assistant,"This is a company that you will want to retire from. Equitable gives you all the tools to become ""better"" in what ever position you are in.

If you don’t have the savings in your account to last 6 months, don’t go. It’s pretty similar to a pyramid scheme without calling itself a pyramid scheme. Education and training schedules would change month to month, sometimes leaving trainings up to associates that have been there for less than 2-3 years. Having associates pay up front for licensing when they’re out of college and only reimbursing when they pass is a disservice to the employee. A majority of other companies in the same space pay for the licensing materials, test, and a wage while they study."

They are always hiring which should be a red flag to everyone. They hire as many people as they can and use them for their connections. After my leads started to run low they fired me and my manager absorbed ALL my old accounts. So he will profit on my hard work. To management the employees are just another type of customer.

Every manager has a different style: some want you to cold call, others want you to talk to your natural market. Some managers are a lot better than others, and your experience at the firm is VERY dependent on the manager that hires you.
Lack of good training
Depending on manager, might not learn a real financial planning process. All has to do with the manager you get. Some are very product-focused, some are better planners.
VERY HARD when first starting off to make money and get clients. Make sure you have enough money saved as a buffer for at least a few months - don’t expect to earn a livable income in the first few months of working."

147,,Other Options,2021-07-29,1.0,Financial Consultant,Easy to get a job there if you are decently intelligent and can pass your licensing tests. They paid for me to get my licenses which is great.,"Brutal industry, prepare to cold call endlessly or go in person to grovel for money random people. Also really low salary or full commission. Fees are fairly high in their products and performance isn’t great. Those 2 aspects are the main selling points and it’s important to work for a competitive firm on both. Seems like they try to hire a bunch of people new to the industry which allows them to get away with a lot. They came to my school with lofty stories about “I made $250k my first year” because it’s unlimited commissions. They don’t tell you it’s a lot about who you know and getting lucky by landing a big case. If you aren’t, be prepared to live at home with your parents or live paycheck to paycheck. I would recommend looking for a firm with better name recognition, offers a decent salary based on where you live, helps you build your book of business, has a huge list of self directed clients that you can prospect on, and has natural organic growth of their client base. Equitable/AXA had none of these aspects when I worked there but now I work for one of the top 5 brokerage firms and it’s a better experience"
148,,I highly recommend you find a better securities broker dealer to work for—there are literally hundreds.,2021-07-25,1.0,Financial Professional,"You must earn your life, accident, and health insurance license which allows you to learn the nuances and benefits of these types of insurance.","You will earn ZERO compensation for the hours (i.e. months) spent studying for your insurance license and the SIE.

I was told I'd have a salary, later found out that I'd be commission only (it was better for my manager if I was commission only). Was told expenses (i.e. gas, Bart fare to see clients etc.) would be covered. This was not the case. Was also told I'd be reimbursed for my tests after I passed, but it turns out you only get reimbursed once you've been there for 6 months. The list goes on and on.

This company is as close to a scam as you can get, and is worse than a pyramid scheme. Constantly forcing clients into annuities with high fees knowing that it's not the best decision for the client, but the one that pays out the best. No wonder they rebranded to get away from their reputation under AXA (shocker - they're just as bad with a new name).

Employees were constantly pressure (sometimes forced) to write positive Glassdoor reviews, especially after a bad one would surface. I'd be super wary of the 5 star reviews on here, especially the ones that say ""all it takes is commitment."""

For this, I believe that it's a good starting spot for an aspiring Financial Professional. While you, most likely, wont receive a salary, the compensation schedule is above average in comparison to the overall industry. You receive roughly 44% with a 30% bonus. This equates to roughly 58%. This bonus will deteriorate with time though. Still, this is nothing in comparison to the upwards of 90% that Independent Advisors receive. Regardless, you have unlimited potential in what you can make and can do incredibly well for yourself with hard work, a good natural market, and some luck.","The focus is on heavy client acquisition and not building a sustainable practice with trails or re-occurring income. High-cost high-commission variable annuities with poorly rated sub accounts are pushed. This is very rarely in the best interest of ""your"" client. Your is in quotes because your client is really the companies client. You are sold on the position as if you are independently contracted and have the freedom to build and run your practice in the manner that you see fit. This is not the case. You will be expected to put in a minimum of 60 hours weekly, attend numerous company meetings throughout the week, and work weekends. There is very minimal work-life balance. Although, this isn't a knock on the company specifically. More so on the outdated financial industry as a whole, as this is all common practice throughout the industry."

212,,Mixed Feelings,2021-05-02,3.0,Financial Consultant,"Great team-based culture, depending on the Financial Manager you get hired under. Great trainings for a new financial professional. Good starting place for an individual looking to make a career out of financial advising.","Primary focus is on sales and not on financial knowledge. Focuses on client acquisition through high single commission annuity products. Typically, not the best option for clients. Not a great model for building a book of business long term, as this model equates to minimal trail commissions. Work life balance is poor as you're expected to work 12 hours days, most of which is wasted time. The claim is that you're self-employed and that it's your book of business. You are not and it is not. You are an employee of Equitable and ""your"" book is really their book."

216,,My experience at Equitable,2021-04-24,4.0,Financial Advisor,"In my area, the training is superb. I can't speak to the quality of training in other areas.",It can take a long time to generate significant income.
217,,Great Company and Culture,2021-04-23,5.0,Financial Professional,"Senior Advisors help you start your career. A team oriented environment.
If you take the full commission option you can make 130% commissions for the first year after getting contracted.",Takes some time to get going in the beginning between licensing and going on contract.

I have felt extremely supported to excel in this career and have nothing but positive things to say about management.",Not exactly a con but you will not succeed if you are not a self-starter or go-getter. You must be ambitious and take responsibility over your own success. Not a place for someone who wants to coast through their day. This is a career where you are in charge of your own success.
221,,Good Experience/Long Hours,2021-04-21,4.0,Financial Consultant,"The training is a big focus. They will make sure that you have the tools you need.

You get used and told to sell family and friends and the advisor above you hires you just to network off your back. Back office is a mix between good and bad. older staff is great, younger staff drinks in office"
224,,Do Not Work For This Company,2021-04-16,1.0,Financial Professional,Gets your foot in the door with the industry,You will be used by your mangers to leverage your friends and family to sell insurance products to.
225,,Good company--focused on woke agenda,2021-04-15,3.0,Financial Advisor,"Improving dramatically in their technology, offerings for financial planners/AUM advisors; not pushed to sell proprietary products","Hyper-focused (like every other major corp.) on COVID, social justice, etc.; back office processing can be horrendous"
226,,Good for younger folks,2021-04-13,4.0,Financial Consultant,"Awesome office environment
I got to know many awesome people.",You work really hard in the beginning. Usually over 50+ hours a week. And get paid like a part time. There is a reason why this industry has such a high turn-over rate for the first three years.

231,,Entrepreneurial Workstyle,2021-04-04,4.0,Financial Advisor,You are master of your own destiny,know mainly as life insurance company
232,,Not for everyone.  But they will take anyone.,2021-04-02,2.0,Financial Advisor,You have independent career.  There is no set working hours or salary.  Don't expect to get a paycheck every week.  People are nice.  Some are happy and others are successful.  Most don't make it to 4 years.,"Many challenges.  
1.  They take half your commissions from the onset.  They will give a little of that back in what is a complex formula called POP.  Your manager gets 30%.  This is why he or she hires you even if you don't have experience. 
2.  They charge you almost everything you use like office or cubicle, telephone, computer package, subscriptions, cloud storage for your files, financial planning software, errors and omission insurance, licenses for everything and anything else.  Can be up to nearly $1000 per month after 3 years when you have to sign a agreement.
3.  All the experienced advisors will use you to their benefit.  They call it teaming. 
4.  If you had a career making decent money over 50k in another industry and want to try this, go-ahead.  But after 2-3 years, you will lose your previous career, connections and will always be in this retail financial services industry.
5.  There are two business units.  Traditional and RBG. Don't ever do the RBG business unit.  It's the ones you go talk to school teachers in their school locations.  With Covid and uncertainty, it's a real challenge.  They usually get new college grads to this unit.
6.  You will lose friends and family.  They will take your first meeting or two and then never talk to you since they think you want to sell them high cost Insurance and Annuities.  
7.  High margin products like insurance and annuities are how you make money.  Not low margin products like advisory or investment accounts.  
8.  Compliance and regulatory challenges.  You do your own paperwork and if something is wrong, Compliance will make you do it over and get new signatures.  
9.  Making meetings is difficult.  Be aware of this.  If you cannot make meetings by calling people, then this is not for you.  You cannot really use social networks to make meetings."

235,,My “Mentor” who supervised 8+ “mentees” dropped me like a hot potato when I stopped producing,2021-03-26,2.0,Financial Advisor,"Unlimited earning potential, not a desk job","If you’re not willing to work 60+ hours, and have the audacity to say so, you’re out."
236,,"Hard work, but pays off",2021-03-25,4.0,Financial Advisor,"You get what you give, your salary is dependent upon the effort you put in","You have to put a lot of work in to get where you want, and you won't get where you want within a few months. It'll take years to build a business you're comfortable with. With that being said, it's worth it if this is a field you're passionate about."
237,,Performative activism masquerading as progress. Unreal expectations and zero leadership accountability.,2021-03-25,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"The benefits, once you qualify, are decent. If you go into this business with a mentality that you will build your resume and leave after one or two years then it might be the place for you.","Retaliation culture under a “we’re a family” mantra. People are “incentivized” to leave good public reviews. I recall a message going around with incentives for leaving a 4 or 5 star review on Glassdoor. Internal polling shows a different environment. Far from what you see on public forums. There is an expectation that you can somehow outperform unequal working conditions and standards. This is a social club type of environment, you either fall in line or “you don’t have what it takes”. 

Management is constantly claiming to fight inequality, but if you do not meet the model minority model, then you are not deemed “qualified” for the job. Company has been silent about recent racially motivated events, yet still claim that they are fighting inequality."

243,,Building a Business,2021-03-17,5.0,Vice President,"You can build your business to any level. No cap on commissions. Base salary in the first two years while building residual income. The culture and teams are incredibly close. With the virtual state of the world, we have been able to run even more meetings with very experienced advisors. Two ways to get started building your book, and neither are ""who do you know"". Once you build up a book, you can set your own schedule, work remote if you want, and there's no limit on time off. Love what I do, and won't do anything else. PacNW branch has the highest per capita income, and the youngest advisor force, but a business doesn't happen over night.","The first 6 months are HARD. You have to put in the work, and if you're slacking off you're going to hate it. If you're willing to put in that work and ride out the initial challenges, then you'll never do anything else."

Amazing company culture around the office(and more recently zoom calls and such).","Pretty slow start. This job has a bit of a startup cost and a learning curve. The first year or two is a lot of hard work that goes under paid for the most part but it all builds up that base as your time goes on.
 A lot of personal expenses. Licenses and such grow quite a bill year over year as well as other nickel and dime type expenses (office space, tech package, travel costs, etc).

259,,Truth About Equitable Advisors,2021-03-15,5.0,Financial Professional,Constant support from every level of Financial Professionals. There are many different trainings to continue and build on your knowledge. They give leads for cold calling when you are in the study process. Once licensed you have the opportunity to buy zoominfo.com where you get thousands of leads. They give training on dipping into your natural market and most importantly they do not leave you to fend for yourself. They ask you to reach out to people you know but they do not expect you to do that right away. We all know our friends and family do not want to be called not knowing what you do exactly. Cold calling is scary but Equitable helps out a lot building your client pipeline!,"This is not a 9-5 job, you are basically your boss.

This is not a traditional 9-5 job that is stable with a guaranteed paycheck.

306,,Former Employee Review,2021-02-24,2.0,Financial Professional,"The branches are split up into teams, so it's easy to get to know everyone. Most people are energetic and hyped up for the day. Lots of meetings, check-ins, and competitive spirit. The leaders are cool and very friendly & knowledgeable. Everyone was easy to talk to.","Before you get to the office, they don't tell you how long each day will be or give you a good outline as far as what you'll do day-to-day (training, meetings, etc.) and seem to make things up as they go along (probably due to the company rebuild). Be prepared to dedicate most of your time to the job.
Training is difficult to go through because you have a ""lesson"" with each person on your team, meaning that there's room for contradiction and incoherence. In my case, it seemed like everyone had very little time for me and didn't prioritize my training so we constantly rescheduled or they would forget. Some people missed out on some training completely.
You also don't get paid anything besides a small bonus until you contract. It is a lot of work for little pay off until then."

318,,Your Outcome = Your Effort,2021-02-13,5.0,Financial Advisor,"Equitable is a great place to start your career as a financial advisor.  The support you receive is somewhere between totally independent (no support) and a wirehouse (they exert too much control).

Training is daily also, starting the week with National training, early in the week Regional stuff, and every day something with the local branch office and team. ""World class training"" was promised in interviews and that's held true.","It can be hard to get started, but once you're in a rhythm, it starts to really flow.

They’ll hire just about everyone with the expectation that only a small percentage will stick. They sugarcoat a lot of things or conveniently don’t mention certain information to keep you around. They don’t invest time in you to help you grow. Many managers are still building their book of business so they don’t have time for you. Be ready to call on your natural market. If you’re a traditional advisor, be ready to make 1,000 calls a week. If you’re RBG, you better hope you get good districts and partners otherwise you won’t succeed."

From day 1 you are lied to about the training, pay and career advancement. Let me just begin by saying many of the reviews on here are current employees that are sold the dream that they say if you put in the effort you have unlimited earning potential. That may be true, but it is very rare as for this position you are nothing more then a call center where you make 500+ dials a day trying to convince random people about life insurance. I was told I would be financial advising and getting the training needed and all I got was just a bunch of meeting set and ran that they tried pushing life insurance. My friend wanted me to help him with retirement planning and said he did not want life insurance and they pushed 3 different life insurance products on him. 
The knowledge that I learned after being here for a year was the same knowledge I had when I originally started. 
I would avoid this company at all costs unless it is truly your last option and just use it as a stepping stone. Dont think youre any more special then the rest of the people because youre just a pawn for the management to fill up their pockets. I should have known that after my first 2 months there that 15 out of 40 people in the office left to other companies"

-Low Base Salary ($24k for California is not livable)

-You get 2 options: 1) 100% commision, no base salary or 2) They basically take half

Training
-Do not pay you while you train (You'll be making no money while you get the 4 licenses it takes to get the job; other companies like Bank of America will pay)

-Make you pay for your Life and Health exam and SIE and study materials (Any respectable firm will pay for those things for you)

-Make you pay for your finger prints and other regulatory needs.

-You have to use their laptop to access their website which YOU will have to pay for. That is not normal. You will have to rent a laptop from them which you will pay them money each month to use. A respectable company would buy you a laptop which you would use while youre their employee

Summary
-This is a classic ""Churn and Burn"" Company. They only want your friends and familys accounts and then youll quit and theyll keep them with their ""Non-compete"" clause in the contract youll have to sign.

Do not work for them."
393,,Complete Joke,2021-01-12,2.0,Financial Advisor,"The managers seemed to care a lot about you--until you found out they make money off everyone hired and take a percentage from all the clients you bring on at the beginning. 
Training was in depth.","Everything from the initial interview sounded great. The manager interviewing me explained the difficulty of a financial advisor and I knew that it's not a cake walk. However, they told me (and the other individuals I started with, who BOTH quit) I'd get a base salary plus commission. My thought was I'd be able to keep my head above water and pay bills. Before getting hired you have to pass the Life and Health exam and SIE. You then start in office and be prepared to call all the people you know the first day and set meetings up for their pyriamid scheme. While in office and setting meetings and training you will also have to pass the Series 7. Until you pass your Series 7 you CANT sell any securities, only life insurance. Not to mention that you will only be getting paid $300 measly for the first week of training, and after that you better hope you are selling insurance to your family members! You won't be making any money for several months. There's a reason there are several young, fresh out-of-college individuals that start here and it's because they don't know anything about the workforce or know better. PLEASE don't fall into this trap. The entire Independence, Income, Impact might be a reality for financial advising, but I'd rethink doing that with this firm."

402,,E(asily)quitable -- College Graduates STAY AWAY,2020-12-23,1.0,Financial Advisor,"Sponsor your series 7, 63/66, (on your own dime)
Experience
The rest of the pros they will tell you in the interview, there's not many","If you are a college graduate interviewing for this role, you NEED to read this.

- During the interview process, they will consistently leave out truths about the role. They bait you in with promises of $52k your first year, $60k the next and $75k+ ongoing-- do not believe this, or anything else--these are best case scenario projections and do not reflect the performance of 98% of advisors in their first 5 years. Senior management's goal in the interview is to get you 'bought-in', and then make the decision to join 'yourself', all while they're using reverse psychology to pull your arm and make it seem like the role is hard to be selected for. Management is compensated based on how many heads are under their wing and how much money is brought in.

REGULATION BEST INTEREST: In July 2020, FINRA and the SEC released a new regulation called ""REG BI"", that require recommendations within the financial industry to be relevant and necessary to clients. As a financial advisor, your job is to make recommendations. Legally speaking, you're only allowed to recommend products that have a clear benefit to your client. The problem with REG BI and Equitable is that you are in a commission-based role--you get paid off recommendations. So, imagine an advisor who is young, only on commission, and trying to get started in this career--they're going to be hungry to make recommendations so they can eat! The compliance team at Equitable is working harder than ever because recommendations are two-sided: one part benefit to the client and other part commission to the advisor.

When clients hear you're paid in commission, they back off, because commission-paid jobs are unattractive to the consumer. Think about it in terms of car salesman; everyone knows the car salesman doesn't care about you whatsoever, and only cares about getting you to spend as much money as possible on their lot.

""Impact, Independence and Income""--3 huge lies.

Impact: During my time at Equitable, the only impact I made on my network was bothering friends and family who you are encouraged to reach out to when getting your business started. In our current day and age, especially after COVID-19, you will not meet anyone that is suitable to your business. Your goal is to find people with money, presumably in their 30s and 50s+, who do not have a current advisor and will be willing to meet with you after a cold call. Realistically, most people with money 1: have an advisor, 2: are smart, hence having money, and will not deal with someone who is in their 20s getting started in the business and 3: definitely won't solicit a cold call. (If you're lucky enough to be in the RBG with Equitable, you will have a market of teachers to reach out to. However, they are overworked, underpaid and untrusting of cold callers).

Independence: I don't have to stress this one too much, but I will highlight my experience with 'independence' in this role. Here's what Independence really means: a required 64 hours a week, over 10-12 hours a day Monday through Friday and another 6-8 hours Saturday. If you don't work those hours, management tells you that you don't care about your business. You have administrative responsibilities on Sundays, of all days, and you still don't get paid for any of it.

Income: Here's the kicker; let's say you decide to go for this job anyway and tolerate the above issues I've mentioned--IT'S A COMMISSION ONLY ROLE! You make zero dollars and zero cents an hour only bringing in $100 at a time after chasing clients in your network to sling a life insurance policy (that's pretty much all you're going to sell, by the way). Let's say you make it to 'contract' where you sign your life away to the firm in exchange for a 'salary'--THEY CUT YOUR COMMISSION IN HALF AND GIVE YOU $24K A YEAR. The reputation of Equitable among financial firms is laughable. Just for having your Series 7 you will be paid a base of $50k with any other job out of college with zero experience, only working 40 hours a week, and not bothering people making cold calls and trying to make it in this industry. 

Another kicker on the money side: they make you pay for everything. Equitable will not spend a single dollar on you until you contract, and even then after dumping over $3350 (full and total cost from interview-contract) on exams, on-boarding/licensing fees and business costs, you will be reimbursed $1,000 at contract. Oh, the contract. You sign a two year agreement to stay with the firm under some very kind conditions:

- If you leave within two years, you owe reimbursement back
- Commission is cut to 50% of whatever you weren't making before
- Increasing quarterly production minimums with 6 month 'safety nets'--so, similar to how interest works, if you get behind on production you might as well walk yourself to the door

The problem with the contract and working for Equitable before the contract is the psychological game they will play with you day-in and day-out. The second you look up from the cloud of commitment they've stuck your head in to ask 'wait, is this the best I can get?', they will tell you fake horror stories of any other starter job you could get. They will consistently pat you on the back and reassure you that there is nothing better than where you are, and that you must stick with it for it to pay off. In reality, places like Equitable are only getting worse. In our day and age, again, it is only getting harder to market via cold calls, LinkedIn and through your network. People DO NOT TRUST 'standalone' advisors for a reason, especially when they're only getting paid commission.

If you've read this far, I'm not discouraging you from pursuing a career here. But in 6 months when you look up wondering 'what else is out there for me?', just know you could have made more money working minimum wage at half of the hours you put in."

You will be put through their ""Fast Track"" system which means right after you get your state life insurance they will pressure you to come in right away and start selling. The first day consisted of getting a high pressure sales script that they will listen to with you close friends and family. These are supposed to lead to meetings ran by your managers. They also require you to pay for all the testing and prep work, which is not at the industry standard. They claim it will get reimburse (which if you make it to get contracted you will get half back). This comes into the second half of problems where you will not receive an actual contract until you sell and obtain a certain amount of criteria (including getting licensed). The company is set up like a pyramid scheme that hires people on to burn through their contacts and have family/friends stuck in a position with the manager that hires you on. Also they charge you $600 for on boarding. Yes, they charge you for on boarding.

Health, Dental, and Life Insurance are practically free (for top of the line plans, the contribution is peanuts). Salary is very reasonable, but when considering all the benefits that are provided it all adds up significantly. Culturally, I can speak on behalf of the Century City office, it the BEST office environment I’ve ever worked at. How many people can honestly say that they love going to work and miss their co-workers? Well I'm more of a realist than optimist, so for me to say that is saying something. The cultural vibe of the office has a perfect balance of professional etiquette mixed with fun and exciting energy. The leadership also puts a big emphasis on having a happy and healthy culture and are very generous when it comes to continuously enhancing that; from dinners to happy hour’s and awesome holiday parties, and events, they do not skimp on anything. You really get the sense that the management generously cares about their people. The leadership is incredible, just being in their presence alone is so motivating to become the best. There’s so much respect and support for each other no matter where in the hierarchy you’re in. They trust and respect their staff, which in turn allows us to work autonomously and run with projects and different initiatives. At the same token, they make themselves available to assist and support with anything we need. Besides creating such a great culture, they’ve also built such incredible systems to help people reach their career goals (so long as you put the effort in tapping into it, the sky is the limit here). The amount of digital tools, training's, and overall support we’re provided with is unparalleled to anything I’ve ever seen before. From helping advisors on social media, to really cool integration tools for Salesforce that cuts down on hours of data entry, they thought of it all.

The ideal candidate will have a combination of intellect, an outgoing personality, and time in the community. The more visible and well known you are, the better.

610,,Enjoy Working Here Once You Get Past  On-Boarding Hurdles,2020-04-23,5.0,Anonymous Employee,Was lucky to be hired by a great team with a good work ethic and desire to succeed yet have balance.  The environment since we've brought on new operations management has improved so much and it excites me that I get to work alongside these individuals.  They are very supportive and will answer any questions you have.  They say what they mean and they mean what they say.,"Starting out as an advisor is challenging.  You don't have the tools you need to succeed.  It's a Catch 22 where the company wants you to hit a specific number yet doesn't really give you any tools to help you hit that goal.  You are oftentimes left in the ocean without a life jacket so to speak and it's a struggle.  Once the trial by fire ends and you make it through that point, it seems to get a little easier, but it would be nice if there could be better on-boarding processes for new hires and existing advisors alike that are helping to train these folks.  The job is hard enough as it is.  The less complicated our jobs can be the better performance I believe is likely."

615,,"Difficult, but rewarding",2020-04-22,5.0,Financial Consultant,"- Culture is by far one the best things about this company. People are friendly and very welcoming in this environment. Other advisors bring people into their projects and their business to help them get a footing in a market. I can't express the amount of help that people have given me  from literally booking meetings to my calendar to helping me close deals. The managers are always more than willing to help and sit down to put in the time and effort with new advisors. People who fail out are people who just stopped working and never asked for help.
- The Platform: although AXA Equitable was initially an insurance company, but I've only ever sold 4 life insurance policies. (Initially didnt like to bring up insurance being afraid of being a life insurance salesman). I focus on wealth management through the advisory and the brokerage platform. 
- Resources: the amount of resources that are put into every advisors is quite a bit. For a while, there was a lot of knowledge and training that I couldn't figure out what I wanted to focus on.
- Partnerships: they partner with the best in the industry for wealth management.

Out of all the jobs I was offer, the reason why I took this was because I knew it was something that took time to build, but it was something I was SPECIFICALLY looking for. I wanted to build something from the ground up and make sure that I can control my practice and how I wanted to build it. I interviewed at Merril, but the reason why I didnt go there was that they were so focused on only working with higher net worth clients that I STILL would have to cold call to find. For being a young professional they have provided me with a background that makes me more marketable than any other advisor firm would have.","- It was very difficult at the very beginning.. In this role, people think that their going to randomly land a whale of a case, which rarely happens. 
- The income to be livable can take a few months to build. Thankfully they disclosed that at the beginning. They stated that this can take a while to ramp up to be living in San Francisco. I highly recommend if you do this and want to live in the city you should have a good savings account that will last about 5 months or live at home for the first year. 
- I wish they could go into the basics more often then having fund managers come in

Primarily the issues that most people have are the initial start of getting clients and the low pay at the beginning. It sometimes can feel like you're a salesman."

The culture created there is incredible and you really do get to run your own business. Equitable is a brokerage firm therefore you can use other investments and insurances which ultimately helps when the business as well as do what’s in the clients best interest at all times. Along with management, there’s a lot of senior advisers that are open to helping new people and really encourage joint work along the way to help build your business. I love being able to help and positively impact my clients lives and make a real difference. There’s a fun competitive environment here that keeps you driven with alot of opportunities to further your career if you wish to do so. You also have the opportunity to make real great money once you understand how to prospect for clients via emailing, calls, networking, etc",The beginning is the hardest. I will say this job is definitely not for everyone. The testing phase you do not get paid for but then again the testing is super hard and most people can’t pass the securities exams since they’re not focused or determined enough. I almost didn’t take my interview because of the reviews on here but I gave it a shot and actually asked some of the non-managers their opinions while I was there and it gave me a reasonable expectation of the work I would be doing.

They really pride themselves as a brand as being high quality and all encompassing. The staff and hiring managers really invest into developing their new agents. And they have done an amazing job of creating a work dynamic that feels very team oriented. Everyone is always willing to help everyone.,"More so a career con. This job is very difficult and will require all of your time and energy early on. It requires commitment in all senses from time, energy, money, and relationships. It is not a career to be taken lightly and if you have any doubts at all I would recommend not trying."

We host events to boost branch morale and productivity which is great. Equitable in itself is an amazing company, with the pandemic going on we have donated money to Feed America to help those in need. In the branch there are so many trainings so advisors have the opportunity to learn more about the company and the products available. Advisors/staff are always getting recognized for the hard work and achievements they accomplish.","As an advisor you have to work hard to start up you book of business.

-Culture: The management team has created a culture that breads competition, but has everyone wanting their piers to succeed. 
-Mentorship: There are multiple mentorship opportunities, from working with people on the advisory panel to gold mentorships, to management. 
-Income: The first few years are challenging, but if you can get through the first year or two, the income opportunity is endless and I was able to make well over six figures in my third year.
-Flexibility: You get the opportunity to work when and where you please. Which can be a blessing and a curse, but for the people that are disciplined, this is what I enjoy the most. 
-Training: Lengthy training program, that they couple with the mentorship program to make sure you get good classroom knowledge, as well, training with other advisors.","-First few years: The first few years are the most challenging, from studying to your  third year in the business are a grind. I'd say its similar to becoming a doctor or lawyer, in that you have to work long tough hours up front, but get extremely rewarded if you stick it out. 
-Technology: The technology isn't the most user friendly, but they do use salesforce, linkedin, asset-map & Morningstar (financial planning tools)"
634,,Never Ever Work Here,2020-04-14,1.0,Financial Advisor,There aren't really any except learning the industry and making friends with co-workers who are fighting for survival with you.,You will be thrust into a legal pyramid scheme. Your manager will coerce you into exploiting your friends and family for clients into terrible insurance products. When you burn through that you will cold call. The majority of positive reviews left for this company are from managers who rely on higher ratings so they can recruit more unsuspecting young people or from new advisers that that don't know any better yet that they asked to leave good reviews. You will sell insurance products and you will not learn true wealth management. This is a fair warning.....90% of people will hate working for this company. The turnover rate is EXTREMELY high.
635,,Entrepreneur but no alone!,2020-04-14,5.0,Financial Professional,"If you are a self starter, driven to help people, but don't quite have it all figured out, this is the place to be.  The firm genuinely cares for their advisers AND clients.","None, meaning no cons, if you are a business minded person who wants to be successful, you will take advantage of every opportunity provided.  Otherwise if you are just looking for a job, you should reconsider going to work for someone who wants to be your boss and direct you how to help them make more money, this place is here to support the business efforts of each person who is building a client services practice. With that in mind, costs are looked at not as costs at all by successful people but rather investments. Investments in you, investments in your knowledge, investments in your skills, investments in your brand, and investments in your pursuit of happiness. Do these things cost money? of course they do, but by definition a cost is something you cannot get back, whereas an investment by definition provides you not only your money back but in addition it offers a rate of return while your money is in it!"
636,,Unbelievable How Little Managemant Cares,2020-04-13,1.0,Financial Consultant,You get a ton of kickback for selling annuities and life insurance as opposed to traditional wealth management investments.,"I was recently asked by management to write a review on Glassdoor about my experience at Equitable due to the amount of negative feedback they were receiving. To my disappointment, instead of trying to rectify the prevalent issues, the management team was only focused on brushing the feedback under the rug to try to feed in as many new employees as possible. This proves to me that this organization is indeed just a pyramid scheme whose end goal is to take your clients when you inevitably leave. I have also come to find out that the management team receives significantly higher compensation for proprietary annuities and life insurance sold, which is why their trainings and everything they sell is focused around these. I wish I noticed these differences earlier in my career so I could have made a change. Instead I feel like I have wasted my time. Before you make the same mistake I have, please consider how you may be taken advantage of."
637,,Strong Leadership & Commitment to Advisors,2020-04-10,5.0,"Vice President, Regional Management",Company management is very committed to the growth and support of advisors.

Overall the culture is great, and lots of fun events the employees do among themselves as well.","No real downside to this business.

646,,Great Company Moral and Support,2020-04-07,5.0,Financial Professional,"Working with this company for almost a year now has been amazing.  The way that they support, motivate, and guide you towards success is impressive. I chose to work for Equitable because of their strong belief of help people. Their focus on the clients and on their employees and adviors is truly amazing. They provide the tools and trainings to help you become the best you can be. Your manager is really your mentor help show you the ropes and guide you towards building your own successful career.  When they hire people, the key words they look for are ""wanting to help people"" and that shows through everyone in the office. No matter the position everyone is willing to help you. If you have the passion, ambition, and perserverance to do this career path, there are people to help you along the way.  They have a salary and commission combination to help you during your first two years starting up your business.  Another favorite of mine is that they really encourage a healthy work life balance and remind you that there should be time on your schedule for you and your family. I really appreciate that.","The only cons I really have are industry-wide cons.  In this industry, it's hard work because you are creating your own business, much like an attorney or a doctor.  To become licensed,  Equitable does remiburse you once you contract, but you do have to pay the cost of them up front. The way I thought of it is, that's my investment to start my own business, because that is truly what it is. Paying upfront for license exams is becoming more and more common amoungst the industry so again industry cons."

650,,Stay Away from this Company,2020-04-04,1.0,Financial Consultant,"Met some great people, including in management.","They are not transparent, and borderline misleading. They do not disclose that you will not be paid, or that you will be forced to work overtime without pay. The career path goes as follows: The moment you accept an offer, you immediately begin studying to pass your State Insurance Exam, the SIE, the Series 7 and then the Series 66. This period is also called PEP (Preliminary Employment Period). You have to pay for the study materials out of pocket, and will only get reimbursed by the company months down the line. Each test will take between 1-2 months to complete, from starting on the study materials all the way to scheduling and taking the test. For the San Francisco Office, once you pass the SIE they ask you to start showing up to the office 3 times a week for their ""trainings"", which consists of learning their sales process, products they offer, and the occasional third party money manager trying to promote their products. They also have you start making phone calls to get business. Any business you schedule for the first 12 months must be run with one of their advisors with at least a few years' experience. The true on-boarding period begins once you pass your Series 7, which is also called PEP 2.0. They create a schedule for you to strictly follow, which includes going to the office, shadowing other professionals outside the office, taking the nearly hundred of internal compliance courses, and studying for the Series 66 licensing exam. For the San Francisco Office, it is during PEP 2.0 that they also require you to stay late on Mondays, and come into the office on Saturdays to make phone calls. You also have to go in for additional trainings, where they explain the on-boarding process. It is during one of these meetings that they reveal to you the pay structure. During PEP 2.0 (which lasts until after you pass the Series 66, finish the internal compliance courses, pass their test on the selling technique, and reach certain selling targets) you will only be paid around $700 TOTAL during this time. Note that it takes 4 months at the earliest to get through this stage. Additionally they do not provide a travel stipend, so you will undoubtedly have used up more than $700 on travel to the office and out of office meetings before you even receive a check from them. Reaching all the requirements to end PEP 2.0 is called Contracting. Once you contract, you get the choice of choosing between a payment structure of a small salary (around 24-27k a year) with commission, or commission plus bonuses. Once you contract is also when they reimburse you for all the study material and licensing costs. To recap, PEP and PEP 2.0 lasts for about 7-9 months, during which time you have to work overtime and only get paid $700. I personally spent over twice that amount on required travel during that time. Throughout my time at the company, management loved to talk about the “uncapped income potential” Equitable Advisors provides compared to the rest of the industry, as well as the high retention rate the office had. In my experience, both of these are complete lies. Within my first few weeks, I personally saw 3 people leave, and the rate stayed consistent throughout my whole time at the company. The biggest reason why Equitable Advisors is constantly hiring is because they are bleeding people. Compared to the competition, which will pay you a minimum of $75K immediately once you accept an offer, provide study material for FREE, give thousands in bonuses for each exam passed, and offer the same levels of commissions, Equitable Advisors is the closest thing to a scam in the financial services industry."
651,,Be Aware,2020-04-01,2.0,Financial Professional,"You will be sponsored for all your licenses
Most people are nice
You can keep your clients when you leave, in theory, though not always in practice
This company is not a good place to spend any prolonged period of time, if you need experience on your resume then it may be a descent option but you need to have at least 3 months worth of cash on hand because you will not make anything for the first 90 days in my experience
Because they spend almost nothing on new employees they don't really care if you leave quickly","The company wants you to sell to your family and friends, thats all they are set up for, if you don't have a couple hundred people you can call to sell insurance to you won't make it.
The turnover rate is unbelievable and the company is frankly setup to where most smart people leave within a year
There is no base salary and management gives you almost nothing to work with
They sell insurance but claim to be financial advisors
They openly and actively discourage cold calling or anything other than selling to family and friends which is crazy
The company gets people out of college pays them nothing and uses them to sell insurance to friends and family, after that its almost impossible and there is no support for moving beyond your warm market to become an actual advisor with a sustainable business.
If you want to cold call expect to spend a thousand dollars on getting the services yourself, and you will not be reimbursed or even encouraged.
The management is at best passive and at worst down right sketchy, I have seen people play fast and loose with various laws and regulations, never outright criminal but definitely not good
You will be expected to put in absurd hours, 7am to 6:30pm, and there isn't any flexibility
They say you will have a mentor but really thats just a nicer word for boss, I was told to make a list of people and call them from my cell phone because they won't even give you a phone to use

Honestly it's basically a boiler room but without any of the resources you would get in a boiler room, and management hates anyone who mentions this."

Happy hours with your fellow disgruntled coworkers are the highlight.","Despite what you may hear during an interview, this is not a wealth management company but an insurance company. This is reflected by their constant trainings on insurance and annuity products. Managers get paid more when their associates sell insurance related products, specifically AXA’s, so they heavily push these products. They will have freshly graduated college students go door to door at public schools selling expensive, ineffective annuities to unsuspecting teachers. The only thing management cares about is bloating their numbers by hiring literally whoever will accept the position. They will preach unlimited income potential and tote the (maybe) one new advisor that does well, but in reality if you make ~$40k+ in your first couple years, you get praised for being a high performer and fast tracked to becoming a “Regional Vice President”, a completely hollow title. This is essentially a MLM scheme, and there is so much turnover here once employees realize what the position actually entails. Be very careful of who your manager is, most of them do not care about bettering their associate’s careers, only about maximizing their corporate numbers. They will be manipulative and try to lock your “natural market” to insurance related products with the intent of taking your clients when you inevitably leave. Please be careful of what you are getting into prior to accepting this position."

As a new advisor the partial salary would have been paramount in allowing me to comfortably launch a practice.
Required to pay for all study materials
Will receive undue pressure to make at least 100 dials per day, while studying, with a very threatening tone

On the same level as being a doctor or lawyer. If you work this business correctly it will pay you back ten fold. If you are passionate about insurance/investments and want to build a business that you control this is the right career for you. 
AXA pays commissions upfront so if you close big business that can be a great pay day for the advisor. The benefits and training are great too. The NYC branch of AXA is the only place to work in this company because we are the largest and most prestigious branch so there are a lot of resources to be successful here.","I know I said a lot of good things about AXA above and I mean it all. For full transparency, I will eventually leave the firm/industry. None of that has anything to do with the firm. I have become less passionate about financial services and I want to start selling something else. If you are reading this I caution you to only take this role if you want to grow a business and are prepared to undertake the initial pains of becoming an entrepreneur(or any finanical adviser role). People will reject you and it will be hard to get your business running in the first 6 months to a year. I think the reason most people leave the industry is because they glorify what it means to be an adviser(They think of gordon geeko or Jordan belfort). This job is much more than that and if you aren't 100% dedicated then you won't make it past the 3-5 year mark. I have had a pretty successful run here but I have realized over time that even though I am good at this job I don't know if i want to dedicate myself to this career for the long term.

941,,Best Decision I've Ever Made,2018-06-29,5.0,Regional Vice President,"- Independence: You get to build and run your own wealth management practice. It is a very entrepreneurial endeavor that affords you all the freedom and flexibility to decide who you work with, when you work, and how you focus your particular business.

- Income: The uncapped performance-based recognition and pay is a huge draw to AXA Advisors, and this industry overall. The better you are at your job, and the harder you work, the higher your pay, incentive benefits, and level of support you'll receive.

- Impact: The best part of working in a performance paying job in this industry is that we do incredibly well for ourselves personally and professionally solely through the great work we do for our clients and community - if we are not helping them, or focusing on their best interests, then we do not get compensated. It puts us on the same side of the table as our clients, to truly make sure we do right by them.

- Mentoring: Your VP serves as your coach and mentor to guide you through the process of starting a business from scratch. They have all built advisory careers themselves, and all still run active practices, so they speak from experience rather than just classroom understanding of running a firm. 

- Models: AXA has been around for 150+ years, and covers every market, every financial product / service. Needless to say, there are a lot of different ways to grow and run an efficient wealth management practice. AXA operates in a collaborative model, so incoming advisors won't have to ""reinvent the wheel"" - they can take best practices from senior / top advisors and replicate within their own practice to ensure a quicker path to success.

- Markets: AXA utilizes a platform that relies on Target or Niche Markets. Rather than try to be an expert in everything to everyone, the platform and culture is best served in finding your specialization and growing your particular expertise. The collaborative office environment allows this to be most effective so no one misses on any opportunities they run across in their marketplace. This creates the atmosphere of working in a ""team of specialists,"" which clients love.","- You have to be fully bought in, or it will be a waste of your time. When you're a good match for this type of career, and this industry, it will bring great opportunities for you and your family. When you try to ""force fit"" into this type of role, you'll ultimately flunk out.

- It's hard work to start a business, and it takes some time to fully ramp up. Not everyone is willing to put the blinders on and wait for the delayed gratification of when your practice really takes off.

- The flexibility is a huge plus for most, but a lot of people can't handle the fluid structure that's inherent to an entrepreneurial role. If you can create systems and processes to make yourself efficient, you will thrive.

- Commissions are a turn-off for most, but not for those that are built for this career. You only get paid if you are doing your job, and doing it well. Showing up and being physically present doesn't do anything for our clients  / marketplace, and in turn nothing for your bank account. It doesn't matter if you're the first one to show up and the last one to leave, you earn no brownie-points for simply working hard - you have to balance that with working smart as well, and getting better as you go.  If you are the best advisor, you will be paid the best, plain and simple. 

- The learning curve is steep, but it's this dynamic nature that draw the select few to this career. The structured in-the-field training is key to getting you up and running as soon as possible. This allows you to quickly see if you love this career, if you're good at it, and if you see yourself working in this role for the long haul. This also allows you to shorten your runway of ""startup"" time and an efficiently running financial practice."
942,,Financial Professional,2018-06-28,5.0,Financial Professional,"Mentorship - The bay area branch provided me as a new employee a great mentorship program to see success at an early stage in my career. Everyone has a pay-it-forward mentality including employees that have been around for 30+ years.

Training- The knowledge and experience I have gained so far is priceless. The managers are knowledgeable and provide a minimum of 6 hours per week of in depth industry and product specific training.

Career Opportunity - I see this as a last career opportunity. Every client I end up making, I hope to retain for my career, as well as building a lasting relationship with those clients.

Compensation - This is a position where you are compensated by the effort you put in. Compensation is unlimited and provides a great commission plus bonus opportunity for the employees.",Entrepreneurial jobs are not for everyone.

951,,Advisor,2018-06-18,5.0,Financial Advisor,This is a wonderful career and firm for the right individual! Very challenging and rewarding business as you are paid in direct value you bring to your clients and the firm. Few careers offer the benefits that advising does and few firms offer the support AXA does.,This career is defintely sales upfront. Sales can be very difficult for someone who is unwilling to go outside their comfort zone or face rejection. Both are necessities for a sales role and candidates should be aware of this.
952,,Financial Professional,2018-06-15,5.0,Financial Professional,"Great backing and support from the company and the management team. EVPs and VPs will get in the trenches with new advisors to help them be as successful as they can be. From interviewing, and speaking with advisors at other companies - AXA by far has one of the most competitive training process and compensation structure. 

I also love the team dynamic with AXA. Even through everyone wants to be successful and is working to build their own business - everyone is willing to lend a hand to help expand our skills and knowledge by working together. 

When I was interviewing with several companies, one of the first things that stood out to me with AXA was they had multiple platforms for new advisors to launch from. If we have strong networks, we have tools to become the go-to advisor in those areas. On the other hand, many new professionals do not have a strong market to build from. AXA has another platform for these advisors so we can get in front of potential clients from day one!  

Overall, I'm so glad this is where I am today and looking forward to seeing where I can go!","Not about AXA, but about the industry: This is a challenging and rewarding career. We are building a book of business, and have to be willing to put in the hard work and effort from day one to be successful. AXA has all of the tools and resources to help new advisors, but if we do not put in the work and time we can't fault anyone else but ourselves. If we do put in the effort, we can have a very rewarding career with unlimited potential!"

4.  There is a Real chance of advancing into management.  This presents an opportunity to have others generating income for you, and grow your practice into a real business.  With this kind of success, you not only feed yourself, but all of your staff as well.
5.  Given the diverse product set offered by AXA Advisors, you have a wide choice of what you will specialize in going forward.
6.  And, with this product set, you are not marketing products by AXA Advisors on account that AXA Advisors doesn't make products.  We give advise, find client needs and wants, and fill them with products from a wide range of companies.
7.  To be in this business you need to like/love people.  We get the opportunity to learn about everything about our prospects.  This means that very quickly we learn of the client's health, financial picture, and much about their personal lives.  In other words, we get to know very quickly more than the client's doctor, CPA, attorney and maybe even their clergy person.  From this may emerge people who become not only clients, but close friends as well.  I do not know of another industry in which people in the business share their knowledge with others, and where best friends are made on account that we're just 'doing our job'.","1.  You will work probably harder than you've ever worked for the first few years.  But, when you're far enough along to look back at those ""early years"", we find out that they were great; that we learned a bunch; that we made friends of other new Financial Professionals, and that we finally know what we're doing.
2.  There will be some twilight or early evening meetings, and you'll most likely be working on Saturday mornings for a while.
3.  Vacations are hard to plan when you're new in an industry, and don't know where money will come from next week or next month.  This may or may not be a problem.  If you do well enough, and you don't have to break records to qualify, there are company qualification trips that are beyond great.
4.  There's so much that can be learned, and so many ways to utilize what is learned, that confusion reigns for some period of time.
5.  As for other Cons, I simply cannot think of any."

1030,,5yrs wasted at this terrible company,2018-04-29,1.0,Financial Advisor,"Please read my full review as I spent 5 years at this company and qualified for many trips including National Leaders Forum.
- Flexibility is incredible, but I worked 75hrs/wk to earn it
- Commission structure is very high in the industry.. why? Because you're selling high cost annuities that are absolutely terrible for the client. 
- Training is incredible, at least in the office I was in. They taught me how to grind and how to sell, our processes were flawless.","- Annuities are absolutely horrible products. We were literally taught to never say the word annuity because clients know this. All in just for investment side not even the actual benefit base annuity side is close to 2.5%. Compare that to a traditional index fund of .04%. And the mutual funds inside are bad. You should never be invested in a MF as it is since they are inefficient, 80% of the time never out pace the market, and you have no control over capital gains tax or investments inside. You will literally have trouble sleeping at night selling this to your friends and family knowing the returns are god awful and they're stuck in it for 7yrs. 
- Turnover is awful. No one makes it. Why? Because you're constantly selling products with an up front commission. So you will continuously grind to sell more, but you're not actually creating a business for yourself with a recurring revenue. Once you start having to pay for everything, you'll start to stress even more, and you'll constantly want that up front giant commission check with bonus to stay afloat. 
- Managers drink the koolaid and will tell you how amazing annuities are. But they get HUGE incentives for you to sell Retirement Cornerstone. And if they believe in annuities so much, why do they tell you that you'll roll it into a brokerage account the day it comes out of surrender? Because then you'll continue to get paid on the account. 
- You are not a fiduciary. Not in the least bit. You are heavily incentivized to sell insurance and annuity products from axa. That is a conflict of interest, and a product to sell. Go work for an RIA where the fees are transparent, and you're using low cost index funds and ETFs that actually make sense for the client. 
- There was at one point so many negative reviews coming in on Glassdoor, all the managers in our office forced us to write a positive review. Why? Because they only care about one thing. New hires. If you're breathing, they'll hire you because there is nothing to lose. You pay for everything. And they get giant commission checks for you going on contract and fast starting. Managers don't care about anything else but how many hires they get in a year. They kept asking our team to go out and find people to hire for them. It's ridiculous.
I get that you could make a lot of money here, I made more than any 22yr old should. But it's not worth it when you start to realize how much of a scumbag you are and being a dressed up car salesman. Please don't do this to your friends and family. Don't do this to yourself. You'll regret it like 90% of others who fail out."

I spent thousands of dollars on my licenses, commute and expenses with NOTHING in return from AXA which is funny considering they love to tell everyone you will make 80k-100k in your first year. LIES. While I was there the ""management"" and ""training"" I thought I would get were all just broken promises. You are taught nothing and you are basically given a phone and told to build a book of business. Might I add it such a revolving door of recent graduates that on my first 2 days they didn't even have a desk for me to sit at basically waiting for someone to leave so I could sit. The managers who tell you they believe in you and are investing time in you only want to spend time helping you if there is opportunity for them to make money off of you. I was told time and time again that they don't push people to reach out to family right away but yet they like to insert as many times as possible to tell your family what you are doing aka the only way you will make money here in the beginning is if you harass your family into buying something.

1057,,Get licensed and get out,2018-02-12,2.0,Financial Adviser,"They will hire anyone that they legally can, so it's not difficult to get started here. 

If you're young/fresh out of school you will be with many similar individuals. 

Senior Advisers and nice, but ultimately dismissive because they know you're not likely to last around. 

They will encourage you to hit up close family and friends for their services, but won't force you to like many other firms would. 

No Quotas!

Study plan and help preparing for your Series 63 and Series 7 is awesome. 

They don't make you sign any binding contracts (since you literally pay for everything) so this is a solid alternative for getting licensed over others that require a year long commitment. 

Show up everyday and smile big because you know you're there just long enough to get licensed.","You aren't paid until you pass the 63 and 7, so expect to have enough money to survive without pay for 2-3 months. You have to pay for all licensing ($1200 or so). They use a lot of misleading information while recruiting you, so take everything they say with a grain of salt. You have to pay for literally everything (parking, laptop, office space, postage, etc.)

Their business model is to dupe young and ambitious entrepreneurs to sign up their close knit money with AXA's advisers and then burn you out with pushing cold prospecting methods on you once all the warm ones are used up. There's a conflict of interest when advising your  friends and family, since the senior adviser that ""works"" the case with you just wants to get paid up front since they don't know how long you'll stick around. They'll recommend an insurance product that they describe ""will work just like any other investment"" to line their pockets with a nice commission while your family and friends get stuck in a sub par investment.

Big Red Flag: Management won't answer questions that relate to the startup process while brushing you off as wasting time that could be otherwise used to prospect. They don't want you questioning what they're having you do, because it fits their business model of taking advantage of you. The sooner you figure it out, the sooner they lose.

It's easy to look at the 3-4 senior advisers making seven figures while working 25 hours. It's not so easy to try and imagine the thousands of bodies that they climbed over to get there.

When you're hired for this position, the expectation is that you will fail. Some of the managers will treat this as a weird form of motivation. But think about it, why on Earth would you take a job where you're expected to fail?

The managers and sales staff that have been around for more than a year are there because they're PHENOMENAL salesmen and ruthlessly determined people. You will go in to meet with them ready to quit and walk out ready to work a 60 hour week.

Insurance is king at AXA. Yes, you might be a wholistic financial adviser here, but at the end of the day, they will teach you to push insurance products, even when there are much better products or strategies available to them."
1058,,Good company if its a good fit,2018-02-12,4.0,Financial Services Professional,"unlimited commission, flexible schedule, great training, great benefits,","Pay is only commission based, find all of your own clients, have to pass licensing tests before starting"
1059,,Advisor,2018-02-08,2.0,Anonymous Employee,Phenomenal environment; the culture is great.  Base salary for 2 years to get started.,"I had a bad manager - terrible sales training, which led to the downfall of my business"
1060,,Worst career decision of my life,2018-02-06,1.0,Financial Advisor,Very few . . .,"I worked in the Retirements Benefits Group (RBG). The firm makes many promises and guarantees in which only the lucky 1% achieve (although they tell you it is easily attainable). The commission structure is very confusing and not transparent at all. When I asked for them to send it to me to review it, they told me no...and that it could not be sent out. The examples they use when describing the commission are far from the many, and are the few who are doing great in the business. They say that everyone is achieving those numbers (and thats true because the only people still left are the 1%, other wise you cant survive on the income to stay). They tell you the retention rate is amazing and is something like 97% retention.....they dont tell you the fine print that it is (97% retention once you have been there for over a year and are hitting certain metrics.....THOSE are people who make up the “so called” 97% retention rate). Also, the position is a commission position (see below for details about salary). With that (and with the salary option), you have to get RE-contracted every 6 months and hit certain metrics every 6 months or you are fired and it is a 0 forgiveness policy.  

Once you are hired, and have been lied to about all the details, you have to pay for EVERYTHING. Computer, E&O insurance, tests, licensing, travel, sometimes office space, etc. Also there are little to no benefits with the commission/salary.  There is a salary option, but first you must get contracted. Contracting can take anywhere from 4-6 months (they will tell you 1-2) where you must not only pass your series 7 test, but must also hit very difficult metrics such as writing several large life insurance/annuity cases and getting around 24 applications minimum. It took me 6 months to get contracted and I was not paid a dime in those 6 months. You are paying for all expenses within those 6 months and your credit card debt will be very high at this point. Finally you get contracted,  your generous $24,000 salary begins. Well divide that by two, with all the expenses you are paying for on your own, and no benefits. To do business, they had me driving an hour each way to meet with clients to write 403b/457 applications. Few apps will be $30 <  commission (if you even get one that day) with the majority of any apps you write being under $15. Not to mention, if you decide to take the salary option, they cut all your commission earnings by 40%. So after driving 2 hours everyday to work with government employees or school teachers (who want nothing to do with you, and who make very little $), you will be lucky if you get 1 or 2 apps in any given day. Most days I ended up losing money on gas in my car, with a good day being $30-50. I average 3-4 apps per week with little to any life insurance cases ever.

Management differs from city to city, but mine was very lackluster and the opposite of helpful. Management was only in it for themselves as they have their own metrics to make and helping you is their last priority. The only thing management is good at is hiring you. After a week or 2 of training, you are on your own. I left AXA over a year ago and was in deep credit card debt for over 5 months. I dont normally write reviews, and hate focusing on the negatives, but I really had a miserable experience that I would do anything to take back. My experience wasnt a one off either. After reading other reviews from around the USA within the Retirement Benefits Group (RBG), all the negative reviews you will read are 100% true and accurate. Its been a little since I have been with the company, so I am not just blowing smoke when I write this review. I have left that part behind me. I am writing this for the sake of the next person that considering taking on a position with AXA. I promise you when I say, after all the hardships and expenses, it is better to be unemployed than to take this position with AXA. Take everything they tell you with a grain of salt, and question each and every statistic they throw at you. They will tell you what you want to hear and make narrow promises. 

Do youself a favor and DONT WORK FOR AXA."

There is a reason AXA is a global fortune 500 company, but not a US fortune 500 company.  Americans are smart enough to not buy into their lies.  You may get a few people who feel sorry for you to buy a policy at first, but then it's all down hill.  A few things you should know before working for AXA: no salary, over worked, no benefits, unprofessional managers, and micro managed. Staff avoid any questions about when salary starts, commission, etc until you have invested a thousand dollars of your own money.  During the weekly training calls they call people out individually on how little they have sold.  I do not know of any other company that thinks embarrassing their employees is effective.  A manager who had never met me chewed me out over something I said over the training call with everyone listening.  Just one example of the unprofessionalism.  You will spend a thousand dollars of your own money,  which is not refunded if you do not meet all of their requirements in the hazing phase.  They tell you that you will learn about securities, but really they just push you to push your friends and family to buy term life insurance policies because they benefit AXA the most.  Definitely be prepared to hardcore sell to all of your friends and family and be ready to lose some friends.  They sell you on a dream job, but once you begin they make you feel trapped because of the money you have already invested and cannot get back.   They lied about commission, telling me I would receive 100% of what I sold when in reality it is less than 1%.  It's a work hard not smart career.  The typical pyramid scheme where everyone over you is more concerned about there own book of business than helping you learn and build your own.  There are much better insurance companies out there to work for that will actually coach and mentor you. If you want the same experience without costing a thousand dollars I suggest working for another pyramid scheme company that does not start you off a thousand dollars in the hole."

- You're told you can do anything at all in this job, but then once you're hired you're pushed into selling one or two products (mostly insurance and some annuity) because that's what the company needs to hit its benchmarks. 
- The company pays for NOTHING. You have to purchase your own computer that has to meet their specs (ends up being well over $1,000) and place outdated and clunky hardware on it that rarely works. On top of that, any additional services you want to be able to use are charged to you and can end up costing more than it will bring you in."

1100,,Great opportunity but there are better ones out there,2017-10-19,2.0,Financial Advisor,"Great work environment. Excellent office, management is superb. They really make you want to drink the kool-aid and it sounds perfect on paper. Also, provides you with the licenses you need to go do something else. Really excellent leadership and if you succeed its a path to early retirement. Some high-level producers make upwards of over a million per year and don't work nearly as much as other people making the same. It really does show promise as a career and those who make it do really well in it. If you don't have a job out of college and you're out of options this is a great place to start. Especially if you want a series 7 license.","Here we go, I'm going to summarize the cons without sounding nit picky. First off, it's all commission (not out of the ordinary in this industry) therefore it costs literally nothing for them to hire you. They pay you a $1500 stipend and then the rest is up to you. They'll say to you that you can market yourself in ""anyway you want"" but in the end it's a smile and dial business. You'll be dialing till your fingers come off even tho they say you can use other forms of marketing. They stress ""always be closing"" like there's no tomorrow so you'll be as pushy as possible to the people you talk to on the phone. They brag they're better than Morgan Stanley or Wells Fargo when those companies actually have structure for their new employees. They say ""you can work whenever you want"" but yell at you if you try to leave before 8pm. Yes the hours are 8-8 and they expect you to work saturdays too. Most managers will make you go on the phones in the first day or two of you starting, meaning you're selling products you really have no clue about. The ethics of the business are also questionable. Because your only goal is to set the meeting you need to do it by any means necessary and I am not going to lie it was pretty fun getting someone to commit to something when you know they don't want/need the product although if you feel uncomfortable misleading people this isn't the right career choice for you. Don't let the name ""Financial Advisor"" fool you, that position really means ""insurance salesman"".  And if you thought cold calling was a bad business practice theres a practice they use called blind dialing where you take a companies phone number and copy it into an excel file and dial numbers from there. These are only some of the experiences I had, but really it's different for everyone."

Don't give you all the information you need for taking the Series 7. Suggest unhelpful and even harmful ways of studying. Dragged my husband along for 11 months. What do single people do right out of college if they don't actually pay them anything until they pass the test? They drag this proccess out and string you along for way too long. How do they expect you to support yourself while you are waiting on them to process all your paperwork and get you a test date. This was the most frustrating hiring process I've ever seen.
1107,,Most of these reviews are fake,2017-10-09,1.0,Financial Professional,"There aren’t really any, I suppose flexible schedule and learning about a company you don’t want to be apart of","Too many to list, most of the reviews here on glass door are from managers and current employees that were told by their managers to give good reviews. Why? Because the managers live off of churning new employees because they receive hiring bonuses and overrides on your sales. It is just your normal pyramid scheme, the company locks your clients into long contracts, makes you pay for everything yourself, and then tries to bill you for things you shouldn’t have to pay for when you leave.  Company won’t be around much longer, other than a life lesson you won’t gain much from working here other than maybe a stepping stone to a real financial services company. Most of the guys that work here have no idea about financial planning and are really just insurance salesman. It’s is very rare you will find a portfolio built by an Axa advisor that will outperform the market. Take my advice, and instead of learning the hard way like I did, wait for a better opportunity."

AXA is always looking for new innovative ways to do business which will benefit the client and the advisor and make business more efficient. 

AXA is also a big family. Our leadership has experience from the bottom to the top as most of them all started as an entry level financial consultant and they have worked their way to the top. This shows in their attentiveness to the concerns of the work force and in their ability to make changes when necessary. Our Chief Sales Officer has a saying, ""As a company we win when the client wins first and the advisor second. If the client does not win and the advisor does not win then it was not a good deal.""

1125,,Focus is on sale of commission based products,2017-09-11,3.0,Financial Advisor,Initial training product training is good.  Branch operations/compliance support is great.,"Compensation structure for new financial advisors remains weighted toward commission based products.  To be successful and keep your contract you'll need to sell a lot of cash value life insurance and variable annuities.  This may not be in the clients' best interest, and new advisors will be hard pressed to navigate this conflict or interest with the focus of doing what's best for the client.   Additionally, and perhaps reflecting the AXA's priorities, in response to the DOL ruling, for retirement accounts the only approved variable annuity with income benefits is AXA's own proprietary product.   This seems contradictory to the intent of the DOL ruling as other carriers such as Lincoln and Prudential also have similar  products."

Whatever AXA tells you during the interview, they are a LIFE INSURANCE company first. If interested in an investment practice you will have to pay $50 a month to use their awful third party broker dealer affiliate LPL' and their software.

My dad is 54 and currently in job search, he was contacted by AXA as a ""great fit"" for the position when he has zero finance and sales experience.

They really trick you with your gains potential, in the sense that it takes way longer to make money than they make it out to be. If you are not financially stable going into this position I suggest pulling out now because it costs over $1000 to pay for study materials and the actual exams. Yes, they reimburse you, but it won't be for at least 3-4 months after you actually start the testing phase. After you do finish the testing, in our first 4 weeks you only make $1400 plus commission (which hardly anyone makes in this phase). If you have a lot going on in your life, I suggest staying away because the early stages of this position will only make matters worse.

Prior to starting you must pass your series 7 & Maryland Life, Accident and Health tests. During this time you are not paid & you must pay for these test (~$700, but you will get about ~$500 reimbursed after 3 months of being fully contracted.)
Once you start working, your first month you are paid hourly, but must work 40 hours per week (no more, no less), I received $1,400 for the month + commissions (I did not make any commissions yet and it would be difficult to do ). For the next 2-6 months, you are not making any money except on commissions. After you make $3-$5K, then you are done with your Pre Employment Phase (PEP). 3 months from now you will receive that $500. Now you make a decision to either be on a 3 year track to make a decreasing salary or decreasing bonus. I believe the salary starts at $24K then reduces by about $4K each of the next to years. The other system starts you making a 30% bonus on all commissions which decreases (I believe) by 5% each year for the next 2 years. Either pathway focuses your income from comissions."

If you don't acquire new clients quickly there can be times of depressed income.  However, turning over the right stone or relationship can make an entire career.  Early in career work/life balance is not present.  Later in the career, it can be amazing."

1173,,Extremely Happy. Give it what you got. It will give back more!,2017-06-06,5.0,Anonymous Employee,AXA training has been detailed and empowering. I am an entrepreneurial minded person and this firm has given me every tool and resource to help me make my dreams come true. The leadership has been phenomenal. They challenge and encourage you beyond what you thought you could do. The team environment is supportive and encouraging as well. Everyday I get the chance to help people! There is a flexible schedule and the compensation is great. I came in with eyes wide open and I have not been disappointed,The industry in general is a tough field. After interview many places I went with AXA because I felt they were honest with me about what to expect and their retention rates are crushing the industry average. I knew to be successful I had to  learn from the best and have the best training.
1174,,Financial Consultant,2017-06-06,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"For those looking for a career and not a job, this is the place.  It is a very rewarding career because you feel meaningful and relevant in your client's lives. Every day you are helping clients solidify their financial household by helping them retire, sending their kids to college, and helping them during tough times in their life.
High performing people can make an above average income of $100,000+ and the best advisors make multiples of that.
Co-workers are great and extremely helpful.  The management team is caring and work more like your partner than a manager.
For new advisors training is consistent and very helpful in launching your practice.
Benefits are great compared to other companies, and I know the benefits are great because we work with benefit programs from our clients and other companies that we work with.  There is no comparison.
Also you are able to work flexible hours.","Early on it can be a lot of hours in the first few years.  However you are able to have a flexible schedule which helps in maintaining your personal life.  As your practice evolves the hours become much less though.  Some experienced advisors truly work a part time schedule once their practice is built.
If you are not licensed already, you need to become licensed to work in the financial industry.  AXA sponsors you and helps you prepare for the necessary exams.  If you are committed to the studying process, it should only take 45-60 days.  Those 45-60 days are a small price to pay compared to other professional fields like becoming a doctor or an attorney, which require multiple years of schooling and similar exams to enter into their fields."

1187,,Great potential for long-term career if you're willing to put in the work..,2017-05-08,3.0,Financial Consultant,"-Running your own schedule: You set your own hours but its a very competitive field so if you're not working 50+ hours a week in your first two years you won't make it for long. If you put in the hours and see enough people, you're bound to get some good clients.

-Uncapped Income: For most advisors, you're going to come across a few clients that close big cases for you and you earn big commissions. Truly uncapped but again depending on how much work you put in, and how lucky you get, to come across such big cases. 

-Plenty of resources: AXA does give you the tools to succeed but they won't hold your hand the entire way. It's up to you to go out and do the market researching, lead generating, and all other types of income-generating activities that takes for you to succeed. If you're self-motivated and can manage yourself, you're going to do great.

-Great environment: My team was great and we all got along very well. I made very close friends in the time I was there. My team would plan team-trips once in a while just to hangout outside the office, and the company itself provides company-trips for those who qualify.

-Location: I worked in the midtown Manhattan branch and the office was very nice. Many companies close by to prospect at, many good food choices, and access to all types of trains. When clients would come over for a meeting they mostly would compliment the nice reception/conference room area.

-Long-term opportunities: You truly set your own future here. If you want to be just an insurance agent then you can focus on insurance and make a great living. If you want to be just an investment advisor then AXA offers great funds through LPL Financial (it will just take you a while to build your book). You can become a manager after a couple of years and train people. The choice is yours, just make a decision and commit to it if you want to last.","-Your entire income is through commissions. If you stop working hard and stop prospecting, then your income will show in a month or so when the business starts slowing down. This can be an issue if you don't have any savings on the side.

-Negative Commissions: Most of the commission you take on life-insurance products are ""paid up"" commissions, which means that they are paying you a year's-worth of commission upfront in anticipation that the client will keep paying their premiums as they promised. If the client does not pay most of what they promised, then AXA will take back what they paid you in commissions accordingly. This can be an issue if you close a $5,000 commission client, then 6 months later the company tells you that the client stopped funding their policy and now you're in a hole of $3-5K with AXA and they will take it off from your next commission until its all paid off. Again, if you're not prospecting constantly, and managing you existing clients, then you're gonna find yourself in some tough situations. 

-Big push for insurance products: AXA is a financial firm with a strong focus on insurance (life, disability, long-term care, variable annuities, etc.) If you're not selling insurance products then your not making a lot of money."

- Pizza on Wednesdays","-Their staff is completely inept, and oftentimes you are payed significantly less money than you earned. And on top of that, after they underpay you, they find ways of making it so that you owe them money, not the other way around (based on the experience of the majority of my coworkers as well as my own). AXA will bleed your wallet as much as they can while you are there.
- Successful advisors love talking about how much money they made, but none of them address how much they had to spend to make that money (mostly because if they do, their accomplishments are no longer impressive).
- You are given minimal support and have to dive blindly into everything you do. They will not help you get leads, and you will receive minimal (if any) guidance on how to build your book of business from the ground up. 
- The ""Financial Professionals"" are salesmen with no financial acumen or literacy. Most AXA Advisors are able to memorize presentations, which makes them appear to have the knowledge and skillset that they actually lack
- Their commission system and awards oftentimes make FP's have to chose between doing what is best for their client, and doing what is best for their them personally or their family. It is rarely the same thing.
- They want their FP's and FA's to blindly buy into what they tell them. Regardless of any evidence contrary to what they say. ""I know it hasn't worked for you yet, but just trust the process"". This often causes the smart and knowledge-oriented employees to seek opportunities elsewhere."

1232,,Best Firm to start a Financial Advisory Practice,2017-02-14,5.0,Financial Consultant,"- Best training on the street - bar none.  You are trained on all aspects of being a financial advisor.....products & accounts (insurance, investments, annuities, employee benefits), strategies (general financial planning, business planning, retirement/ estate planning), sales skills (telephone, presentation, referral asking skills), practice management (time management, delegation). Training is delivered 1x1, group settings, via virtual courses, sometimes offsite conferences.
- Compensation.  I worked at a previous firm where you got about 20% of every $1 of revenue generated.  At AXA you get anywhere from 50%-90%, with the big producers getting in the 90% area.  Plus have a great stock purchase plan called SharePlan.  
- Great marketing materials. Available for just about any prospect or situation.  All are AXa branded.
- Out of the box ready marketing.  Seminars, mailers, letters, campaigns, marketing strategies....all are pre-approved and ready to go.  No need to design a marketing strategy yourself.  
- Depth of products.  You can be a one stop shop for any prospect/client.  No account or household minimums.  Some insurance firms allow you to do investments, BUT only after selling insurance for 3+ years, or maybe they only allow mutual funds (from maybe 30 mutual fund families).  At AXA you can work with investment clients from the start and work just about all mutual fund families.  Also have employee benefits for businesses as well.  Only loans and property/casualty insurance are not offered.
- Technology - AXA has embraced technology more so than other financial service companies, but the industry as a whole is still behind the curve on technology use.","- The industry itself is extremely difficult. The easy part is the accounts / strategies.  The hard part is the sales skills and practice management.  Most people that fail never grasp that.  You have to work the hardest on what you probably don't want to work on at all: prospecting and marketing.
- You pay for everything, which is a tradeoff for having the best compensation package.  The good news is your costs are generally fixed whereas your income can go up. When you are new much of the cost is picked up by AXA, but eventually you do pay for everything.
- The commission structure is not straightforward.  It takes a while to get used to, its like a different language.  Once you get it your fine."

My biggest regret was not coming here right after college as I toiled around with Wall Street and all its bureaucracy and job volatility for many years before I had enough with people always having control over what I can make, where I can go with it, and will I be there in January after layoffs/bonus(maybe).  

Def a good place to be if you are hardworking (I was putting in 60+ hrs a week in banking and figured if I'm doing that, I might as well do it for my own business and get the opp to make more $), smart, and want to be in control","Not a con but it does require persistence, dedication, and motivation to stay on track.  If you fall off, a good manager like I have/had will pick you up and find your drive again.

They only pay you about $1000 for your first 3-6 months.  You need to get 15 clients before you can be under contract, which is when you would begin getting paid more.  You have to pay for all testing, all materials, etc.  They will make it seem like you only pay for a few tests, but they don't mention all travel and random classes ranging from $30-$100 that you have to take through them.  They hired 10 people with me and after three months only 2 are left (both got set up with rich parents helping them out).  They will promise that you will do joint work to help get you on your feet and learn, but this is a lie.  They will tell you to go alone to lurk outside schools and businesses and bother people when they want to go home.  They don't teach you anything valuable.  They also don't care about their clients and fill out all compliance paper work listing random things they say the client wants when they are just trying to suck up the most money possible from unsuspecting clients.

-There are a lot of hoops to jump through to do the customer service side of the job as you must be compliant with strict security rules.

My manager was always available to talk to me and teach me...even answering my questions via text at 10pm at night. The branch manager (Jamie) is a big wig in the company, must be making seven figures, and yet still has an open door policy where even the newest advisors can stop into his office. He used to walk around the cubicles just to say hi and tell funny stories or help with any questions we had. There were definitely advisors doing very well (not all) and there was always a focus on doing the right thing for your customers. I learned a lot during my two years there, but ultimately didn't make their validation schedule because I figured out I'm not really a good fit for financial sales. Still the experience was top notch and I still have a bunch of friends there.","Like many of the other reviews said, the hardest part is finding the prospects to talk to. Once you do that, the products, services, and joint work partners in the San Diego office are all high caliber compared to what I saw out there (I worked for two months at another financial firm with basically one product...whole life insurance...no matter what the client needed and the manager there was an authoritarian micro-manager!). It sounds weird, but the other challenge I saw at least in the San Diego AXA office was that people hung out with each other probably too much. It was easier to hang out with cool colleagues than to prospect  for new clients. While it was an awesome culture to be in, it probably hurt me in the long run in hindsight."

You can leave axa and agree to not reach out to your clients at leaving  but its ok for AXA to send you bills months down the line if the client hasnt continued paying their premium.

1298,,"Read this for honesty. Not ""entrepreneurial"" -- it's just sales",2016-09-13,2.0,Financial Professional,"-Technically uncapped earning potential

-Total scheduling freedom

-For someone with little technical ability, no novel ideas, but a desire/ability to grind through repetitive, unstimulating tasks, it can be a lucrative career (it's just a numbers game at the end of the day, and you have to stick around long enough to throw lots of darts at the board)

-If you have a warm market of family or ethnic connections, you can make decent money selling reasonably competitive products.

-You can learn a lot about the insurance industry, and then leave to go apply it somewhere more technical.

-You will get some access to a house book of orphaned accounts, which can be a decent way to get your income and referrals started in the beginning (but don't expect miracles).

-AXA is one of few insurance companies to do international underwriting on foreign nationals. If you are lucky enough to have access to such people, you can make great money in that market. Chinese advisors are in especially high demand right now.

-A good way to get pure sales experience, which you can take elsewhere (my recommendation would be tech sales)","Dont get AXA Equitable, which is the insurance company, confused with AXA Advisors, which is the wholly owned subsidiary you are working for (where all your problems stem from). Aside from the fact that your experience will partially depend on which branch you get hired in (some provide way more support than others, another fault), here is the truth about AXA and the industry: 

-The industry is contracting. Individual sales are less lucrative than they used to be, so now you are making up for it in volume

-The general public has little faith in your profession or your industry

-There are no legal definitions for terms like ""financial advisor"", so you are lumped in with fly-by-night insurance salesmen (in the public's eye, at least)

-Technology is gradually automating more of the products you sell, making them cheaper to deliver to the customer directly. People can now buy property/casualty/liability/health/term insurance online. You can get mortgages online. What makes you think permanent life insurance is so sacred it can't be sold online, allowing companies to cut out their commissioned sales forces? AXA managers will assure you permanent life products and annuities are too complex and special to sell online, but at one time the same was said about brokerage accounts and managed money (now being threatened by ever evolving robo advisors). 

-The average middle class client will soon have little need for you; they will be able to get on demand advice online from a fee-based advisor anywhere, and that will rapidly devolve into a price war between thousands of registered ""advisors"" competing for the same piecemeal business. Do you want to wade into that arena? No. Which means:

-You will eventually try to target a much smaller pool of wealthy, complex clients who have a legitimate need for a financial advisor, except they will be flooded by solicitation from agents just like you.

As far as AXA Advisors goes:

-Salary is worthless and untenable for someone who doesn't have a big cushion of savings or family support, especially if you have student loans / bills. (24k year one, 12k year two, that's it)

-You will be actively discouraged from soliciting managed money business and from spending time learning in depth market trading concepts (the excuses will sound something like ""It takes forever to make money doing that, why not sell insurance, which has bigger commissions?"" Or ""Just give me (your manager) the managed money and I'll put you in on an insurance or annuity case""). Would you trust an ""advisor"" who has such little understanding of trading that their excuse is ""I don't pretend to know the market, I'm just here to help you manage your risk""? Because that's someone who only knows insurance. 

-Another refrain you will hear is that you are here to counsel people against their worst behaviors and impulses (like buying high and selling low). Are you looking to become a behavioral therapist or a technical professional? 

-AXA is an insurance company first and foremost. And when you are a hammer, every problem looks like a nail. Despite everything you hear about the ""open architecture"" you supposedly have available to you, an AXA product or service is somehow magically the final answer almost every time.


Additionally:

-All the products you sell are commoditized, so it is much more difficult to differentiate yourself from the other solid products out there. So now you are selling uphill / with one arm tied, since you can't rely on the strength or novelty of your products to pique people's interest into meeting with you.

-You can't control or change the products you offer

-You can't control the pricing or competitiveness of your products

-You will encounter tooth and nail resistance if you leave and try to take your clients with you. 

Does any of that sound ""entrepreneurial"" to you? What entrepreneur in their right mind would enter into such an arrangement? At best you can be considered a franchisee--you are expected to adopt someone else's brand and products as your own, with no control. And no equity.

If you are a true ""entrepreneur"", find a way to efficiently fund your living expenses while developing your idea. If you are a good salesperson, you could do well here, but you are better off finding a company with a more specialized / differentiated product that you will be able to leverage more clearly and effectively. 

Ask a long-time AXA producer (preferably in a producer group), who isn't a partner or in management, what the industry was really like ""back then"" and how much better it used to be. You will continually hear the party line from management about how much easier you have it because of the tools available to you, but the reality is that 20 or 30 years ago the general public was much more open to doing business with you and you would have been paid way more for doing it.

If you are totally set on a career in financial services, and you are going in ""cold"" (i.e no connections in the industry or very warm, wealthy markets to sell to) do whatever you can to get into another company that has an actual hands-on advisor ""track"". They will groom you over a period of a few years to learn the business, support established advisors, learn techniques, get your CFP / other credentials, all while obtaining an actual livable salary (which allows you to focus on learning and frees you of low-end ethical dilemmas, like selling something to people who don't need it, or selling a higher commission product). Make sure the company you choose will allow you to learn insurance AND investing, and you will become a true, well rounded ""advisor""."

1333,,Great Local Leadership,2016-07-23,5.0,,"I worked at AXA Portland for over 5 years.  I've seen that the local management really cares about their Advisors and their clients.  Their doors are always open to employees and advisors, from the most successful to the newest and most struggling, and they try their best to give everyone the tools and mentoring to be successful.  Not everyone has what it takes to be successful in their business, but they seem to be doing their best to pick the best people and doing what they can to give them their best shot.
The office environment is also very positive.  Great, friendly, and helpful staff to offer support, and a friendly/competitive camaraderie environment which encourages people to do their best, while also encouraging teamwork. Fun competitions and events, birthday parties, summer picnics, happy hours, etc.  
Professional environment too; management takes care to avoid HR issues and has encouraged a fun, productive, cooperative environment, while keeping things PC and office-appropriate.  Though the majority of the Financial Advisors are men, this isn't the place where you'll hear a lot of swearing or inappropriate jokes or comments.
I was a great place to work and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a positive environment for an admin or Financial Advisor job.  Just be prepared to work hard.

The management does a great job on not feeling like a boss, but you're a part of a team. Doing joint work together with management is encouraged and they do not take away from your commission. They genuinely care about your growth and try their best to help close deals and show you the process. They don't push to sell your family and friends, which is a positive too.

Dealing on the customer side it feels like a holistic and comprehensive approach versus other company that do a cookie cutter method. Feel like your are actually providing value to your clients instead of ramming product down their throat.

They give you a great market to go to, which is the school market to setup teachers with 403(b)s, but doesn't mean you'll be able to get on every single campus. Then they help provide you with numbers to call and clients who have not done reviews recently. There's multiple different markets that they provide you, so you don't have to purely cold call and network.

This is a career, not a job!","There's a lot of hoops to jump through. You pay for your own tests and have to do training on the computer before you can sell anything. Sometimes at the beginning you don't know what to do and often times feel like you're just there with absolutely nothing to do.


Doesn't pay salary right away until you make a certain commission level which is about $5,000 in commission. Not hard to hit though.
It's a difficult job for anyone who does not have a sales background or have a deep network. Really a hard job for anyone that recently graduates college."

-Young environment with lots of flexibility and free time","-Poor compensation and no benefits for new employees
-Little support from senior management
-Environment characterized by favoritism and immoral business practices
-Essentially no training in investment advisory--each training session emphasized teaching us about poorly structured AXA products that benefits the advisor far more than the client
-Way too much emphasis on selling their own insurance products (biased) rather than focusing on the clients interests
-High-pressure marketing job with significant cold calling

With the newly passed Dept of Labor laws concerning commissions from this type of work, it is likely that most of the advisors will get out of the business--AXA Advisers works completely off of commissions. The DOL passed this law to get rid of scumbags like this."

If you want to be an employee, this is not the career for  you. New advisors get a lot of responsibility to make sure they're building their practices in a way that will pay long term dividends. Many new advisors are too short term focused and this freedom is too free for them, and ultimately they fail by developing bad habits. If you want to start a business, build it from the ground up, receive all of the recognition along the way and eventually add a partner or a family member, this is the place for you to do it.","AXA Advisors is a financial planning firm but many people associate it with a life insurance company (AXA Equitable, a subsidiary). Many new advisors try and maximize their short term income by selling life insurance to friends and family as opposed to doing good, comprehensive planning and dealing with both asset management and also insurance, among other things. The connotation then becomes similar to that of some of our peers, which is that we bring in people to sell insurance products to their family."
1344,,Fantastic People,2016-06-28,5.0,Operations Team,"This company attracts a lot of good hearts.  In my personal experience over the 12 years, AXA branches are extended families.  Agents that work in the field and the many staff that support them are often the most patient and passionate people.  The ones that are in the industry for pure commissions do not last.  But the ones that care about families and communities are often here for decades.  Or for life.","Onboarding / Licensing requires a lot of study time and paperwork.  The many tools, products and options are assets but there is a high learning curve."

- Great, yet tireless, training program.
- Salary option if 100% commission is unsettling (not a recommendation)
- ""unlimited income potential"" (notice the quotations)

AXA is a decent place to start a career in Finance if you can't land a job in institutional finance right out of college but don't get to comfortable. Know that if you do not plan to stay in one geographical location or with AXA for your entire working life that this not a job where you can pick up and move.","- ""Flexible schedules"" that are not really flexible. Yes you do make your own schedule on a day-to-day basis but that schedule will be riddled with ""mandatory"" trainings (both local & regional), evening call sessions and Saturday morning work hours. Generally you can take a day off here or there but it is more or less expected that you don't take any time off for the first 3 or so years. They won't tell you no but you'll know they aren't happy in the most passive-aggressive ways possible.

- The 403b market is completely saturated with financial salesmen who, because of a minority of past/present advisors, have gained a reputation of distrust and skepticism by the very market you will be selling to, public school employees. The current climate of access to school buildings to prospect for new clients is not good and getting worse.

- Compensation. It sucks. That is unless you have an extremely juicy natural market you can sell expensive, underperforming financial products to without feeling that lingering sense of screwing over you family and friends. P.S.- the salary option is a joke. what they don't tell you is that there is a whole list of expenses that they take out of it and put back in their pockets. I.e.- Liability @ $250/month, Brokerage fees ~$40/month plus others I can't remember. Just don't expect that $2k/month salary to actually be $2k. Commission get cut in half when you're on salary as well.

- Trainings are often boring, repetitive and more times then not feel like a drain on your time to get actual work done. The trainings consist SOLEY of selling techniques. Think you're going to be learning about actual finance? Nope, not a chance. They teach you how to sell for better or for worse, depending on how you look at it."

There are Mentors that are truly interested in your success.,"Managers that are not sensitive to diversity which includes women, working mothers and people of color. I can't speak for all branches, but the San Francisco branch is  like a car salesman. They do not do holistic comprehensive Fact Find. They only care about the numbers and volume.
Managers rush a sale to make numbers. And when numbers are not made. They blame the advisors. When you complain to upper management, they defend their managers because they only look at the numbers. Just because a manger makes a sale and it looks great on paper, it does not make them a great manager that truly cares about the success of their advisors. The SF office is a young office of 20 years old advisors and 30 year old managers that shoot from the hip. They do not bring value to the table. I have lost a few sales because of this.

I have learned a lot about the business in my time here. Opportunities to move into management and climb the corporate ladder.","I genuinely think the management here cares about the employees, but the way the compensation structure is built there is literally no way the client can ever come first. Make no mistake, financial planning/advisory is a SALES position. You have to bring in clients and assets. The question any young person should ask themselves, is do I know what I want to sell and what is your ideal business model. I cannot say this enough, TALK TO OLDER ADVISORS from different firms/ business models and ask them what they do!!! While you can sell products from a number of companies as well as do broker/dealer and advisory business, none of this is ""benefits eligible"" comp. You will not get a 401k contribution, pay S.S. tax, OASDI, health benefits paid for without selling an AXA proprietary product.

1397,,Did you find the office alright?,2016-02-15,2.0,,"There are some great people in the office, who are fun to be around.","You must provide your own computer, which has to fit Axa’s specifications. My 2011 MacBook Pro, did not meet the requirements, which meant I had 1 month to purchase a new computer. 

When I signed my contract, I was told that my job was “to bring clients to the company”. This shocked me, as it gives no consideration as to what is right for the client.  

There are mandatory trainings for new representatives, which occur 6-8 times per week. You would think these would be helpful, and considered a pro. However, many of the trainings were run by “managers” who were not certified to manage and were not knowledgeable on the topics they were teaching. Think of someone teaching you to swim, who had never been in the water before...When the “manager” didn’t know how to run a training, the subject turn to their own performance at the company and had great of a salesperson they were. In addition, incorrect information was given during trains multiple times. Most new representatives did not notice this, however, I researched the products we were being trained on in order to know exactly what I was selling. 

As for the job, building a client base consists of either cold calls/cold walk ins, or sending mass emails. This of course is after you have recruited your friends and family to the company. You are expected to work 12 hour days (which I did for awhile) with minimal compensation ($1,700 for 4 weeks of training, then 100% commission). If you know plenty of wealthy people who are willing to give you their money, then this model is great for you!"
1398,,Great Place to Work,2016-02-12,5.0,Financial Consultant,The best reason to work for AXA Advisor's is flexibility and compensation structure. In this job you create your own luck and salary by how are your work and how fast you learn. If you rather sit in a desk and be a drone to corporate overlords then be my guest just don't choose this job and think that it is that.,In creating your own schedule and starting a business it takes hard work.

You're required to buy a computer that has ridiculous specs to run their software which you will end up paying over $1,000 for. You do not get paid nearly enough for the amount of work. More like a sweat shop where you build your managers book of business for them. You almost always give at least 10% of every case to someone else.

Otherwise it's an ok place to work.,The benefits were expensive and copays were high.  Computer system needs to be updated.  Difficult to complete work when systems are down or wi fi is too slow.
1405,,Great Job if you are willing to put in the Work,2016-02-04,5.0,Financial Professional,"Friendly and supportive staff.  Everyone, including top producers and even the Branch Manager himself are willing to help you at a moments notice.  Lots of training opportunities throughout the week which is necessary for such an involved industry.  You essentially are running your own business, which can be daunting to the ill-prepared.  The management staff will give you all the tools that you need to be successful, whether or not you put them to action is up to you.  This is not an easy career but it is a very fulfilling and lucrative career.  If you have drive, a strong work ethic, and are coach-able you have the potential to do very very well in this career.  If you are lazy and don't like to work hard you will not survive in this industry.  I absolutely love everything about working for AXA Advisors and I have had the ability to really make a positive change to the lives of my friends, family, and clients.  Do your research and know what you are getting into but know that if you want to make your own hours and really reap what you sow then this is a great career.  If you are a confident, hard-working, charismatic individual then this is the best career out there by far.","Be aware that you are your own boss. This is not a Con to me, but there will be no one there to hold your hand on a daily basis.  There are tons of training's and anyone will help you if you ask, but no one will be standing over your shoulder and making sure you stay on task.  I love this aspect but if you lack the ability to stay driven and do what you need to then this isn't the career for you.  
It will be a lot of work.  Again not a Con to me but an advisement.  Financial Advisors can be some of the most highly compensated individuals but it is a direct correlation to how hard you work.  You have to build your practice, so in the beginning be prepared to struggle for a bit until you get established.  Again this is directly related to how much activity you have.  AXA will give you all the tools but in the end this job is as lucrative or miserable as you make it.  If you like hard work and really making a difference in people's lives, this is the job for you.  One little Con  I have is that some meetings tend to be a bit early in the morning but it is a great way to start your day.  Also the IT support can be a bit challenging sometimes but that is not an issue with the Branch, that is more of a issue with the home office.  As someone that has had several jobs in several industries this is by far the best career choice I have ever made."

1447,,Hard,2015-10-09,2.0,Financial Professional,AXA has set up access to a large number of insurance companies so that you can offer clients the solution that is in their best interest.,Monthly expenses you pay to AXA to be an advisor make it very difficult to get ahead. They are a constant drag.
1448,,Patience and Perseverance,2015-10-03,4.0,Financial Advisor,"The office I'm working from is going through a rebuilding period so there's a lot of new faces. The people are friendly, management wants to be there to help and develop everyone the best they can. I'm only a couple months in so far, but that's my initial impression. Plenty of opportunity for growth. Getting sponsored for licenses such as Series 7 and 66 is a huge boost.","Be patient when trying to build your portfolio. Becoming a successful financial advisor takes a lot of time, patience, and perseverance. Be prepared to work hard, but it will pay off."
1449,,Everything You Need To Know,2015-10-03,1.0,Financial Professional,"In order to get your Series 7 license you need to be employed at a firm that will sponsor you, so you can always get your licenses and leave, except most firms with positions that require a 7 also require multiple years of experience, furthermore most firms that will sponsor you will not only pay for your licensing but also pay you while you study, not AXA. For the first six months after you pass your exams you are in ""pre-employment"" (you don't actually get to work for the company yet) in one of two divisions: traditional or retirement benefits group (RBG). In traditional you are making 100 cold calls a day to either households or businesses with a list that you have to buy yourself (expect to spend hundreds of dollars), I actually like making cold calls, the problem is that no one has ever heard of AXA, so expect to have to explain what your company does in every call. RBG is composed of people who sneak around schools trying to sell teachers the employer sponsored retirement plan (403(b)s) and then cross sell life insurance. Many school districts have changed their system of compensation such that the commission on a 403(b) is roughly $2. I could not make this up. If you want to make any money in RBG expect to drive for hours back and forth every day to a school district that has not made the change. Did I mention that the school's administrators and security do not actually want you there? Expect to be called into the principals office or asked to leave the premises several times per week. RBG would have been a goldmine when insurance companies first cornered the education market, but now it is highly oversaturated. Expect to hear about your last five predecessors from the people you speak to. The hurdles (production requirements) are ridiculously low compared to other firms due to all of the aforementioned reasons. You really do have the freedom to set your own schedule although if you aren't going to work 12 hours a day I would not bother. AXA has such an extraordinarily high turnover that after you leave, everywhere you go you'll meet people who were once your coworkers, which helps with networking.","You will likely make no money ($0) while working at AXA. They pay you $1,200 or something when you pass your exams, but that's only because they lost a lawsuit in California forcing them to.  After you pay for your three licenses yourself that $1,200 quickly approaches zero. There is pressure to sell products you do not understand haphazardly to friends and family. The only retirement products you have available to sell are life insurance and annuities, making you an insurance agent. To make matters worse you can only sell AXA insurance and AXA annuities versus other options that could be less costly or produce a higher return for the client. There are other insurance companies like AIG that let you sell non-proprietary products and pays you a salary on top of commissions to do so. Managers received promotions based on their ability to sell annuities, and do not have a clue how to recruit or train new employees. Not a protocol firm, meaning you cannot take your clients with you. Many other firms will allow you to take your practice with you, furthermore firms will pay you up to 3 times your residual income in the form of a bonus, to do so, this is not available to you at AXA. There is also a severe lack of training, expect to spend one day (if that) with your manager then you are on your own to learn all about the securities industry and bring in clients."

Work/Life balance is good meaning you can go in to work and leave for home or work 4 days a week if you want just know that you only get paid for sales so it's in your best interest to hold yourself accountable and work 50+ hours,"Management lacks in just about every department, they promise education training and support but after years with axa I'm no better off. They recruited me on the great team they had and that they would help take me to the next level since I was already a Financial Advisor. The team fell apart and new guys with no education or experience replaced them on the first week, and the few guys that had been there years had no idea how to train. I managed millions of dollars before joining axa and after years with axa I didn't pick up a single new client. Needless to say I can do much better with another company. Stay away from this one there are better opportunities if being an insurance and investment professional is your goal. They pay system is screwy, at almost all other firms you receive 1099 at AXA if you sell a $100 monthly life insurance policy you 'get' $50 a month for 12 months, however because of the w2 tax treatment the almost $600 in monthly fees for salesforce and 'technology' that never works you never actually 'get your $50 & REALLY expensive E & O.

The spirit of everyone, although slightly competitive, is very friendly and there is a lot of camaraderie.",I joined the company with the understanding that there will be a lot of training provided by my manager. I did not get the support that I was promised and my education stopped short almost instantly. It left me feeling lost and unsure of what to do.

We also got leads at the beginning of the school at new teacher orientations. Very little cold calling on my end because my manager had a good relationship with the school districts I was working at. Good way for anyone to start the business and build their book. 403(b) cases are very easy to close because teachers need it anyways. AXA is a good place to start your financial planning career especially if you are fresh out of college and do not have any high net worth people in your natural market.","Unlike other companies, AXA does not provide you with marketing materials or pay for your seminars. They also make you buy the companies laptop and get your own printer. It gets very expensive, because you do alot of driving if you are in the RBG market. Also, after 3 years if you are in your ""pop"" contract, you will have to start paying for your cube...yes your cube...and mine costs a little over $700 a month. Alot of other companies will not make you pay for your cube and if they do its only $50/month. You also cannot get an outside job...not even selling Mary Kay. I left AXA because I feel like even though they had good training and connections with the school district, they were not generous with their employees compare to other insurance companies. AXA also does not paid as much as some other companies."
1472,,Run For the Hills,2015-07-31,1.0,Financial Consultant,"-Ability to set your own schedule
-Essentially starting your own business with little to no oversight and direction","Simply put, do NOT work at AXA Advisors.  

Let me start off at the pay structure.  There is no base salary, whatsoever.  This is ridiculous for a recent college grad with little to no savings.  On the same note, you have to front the money for your tests (series 7 and 63/65/66) where EVERYWHERE else will actually pay for it.  That is a lot of capital input for little reward.

Next up: the support network. None.

Reimbursements: AXA does not reimburse you for anything.  Nothing.  This is the only job where I had actual negative cash flows.  All in the name of ""starting your own business"" which is such a joke in itself since most of your actual revenue will be split up amongst the higher members of your team (after you do all of the work sourcing the clients but the ""big guns"" come in for the close).  On average, you are making far below minimum wage and the actual probability of success is fairly low.  If you really want to try to battle it out and have a career in wealth management, then try Private Client Services at a bank or work at a RIA.

In summary, do not work here unless you are super SUPER desperate and you literally do not have any other options."

1488,,Consultant,2015-06-10,2.0,Anonymous Employee,"Not a ton of positives about the experience.  You will encounter managers who appear to be your best friend, but everyone has their own motives (they are required to hire LOTS of agents....and they get overrides on your production).  I did learn some great sales skills through the trainings and you will learn a great deal about human behavior through client interaction.  It is a job based on who you know, so if you don't have a network of 1000 people to call your first day it will be a tough road.","You will be required to sell your friends and family insurance products, even if it is not suitable.  This is how you get paid ""upfront"" and make your ""foundation"".  Most of the time you will be doing joint work with another advisor since you have no previous experience within the industry, this means you will split commissions (usually 25-50% of the case).  

There are no leads provided, everything you do comes from your network or your cold prospecting.  If you're under 30 you'll find that your only options is to become an insurance agent....yes this is an insurance company!  Selling propriety products gives AXA the ability to own all of your clients so you can't leave without having to start over at another firm.  

Compensation is pretty terrible unless you can sell large insurance policies or large annuities.  Most of the time these large cases require people to invest all of their money in 1 product....highly unsuitable for most clients.  Any CFP or independent advisor can verify this and once you see the fee's and surrender schedules you'll understand why you get paid so much.  

On that point, the broker/dealer split for AXA is 50/50.  This means you get paid 50% of the true  GDC on all products...even AXA-Equitable.  If you look at independent shops your payout is 80-90 percent, so you can get paid more to work elsewhere.  Managers get overrides on your productions to the tune of about 30%.  No one will tell you this because they want you to think that splitting your commission is fair (they will ask for 25-50% of each case, then get 30% on the back end).  

You will pay a good amount of money to work at AXA.  Yes that is right, you have to pay to work there after you contract.  Roughly, $1000/month for the first 2 years which was never disclosed to me.  You will have to buy your own equipment ($1200 computer, office supplies, software, printer).  Everything in the office is usually broken and no one cares to fix it, more equipment to buy on your end!

Turnover is extremely high.  In the 4 years I worked at AXA I saw over 55 advisors churn through the system.  There are only 3 advisors who have been there over 5 years....don't confuse managers with advisors.  Managers stick around cause they hire and absorb clients from the drop outs...its highly lucrative to become a manager and churn advisors every 2-3 years.  I would estimate the turnover rate within the first 3 years is 95%....evidence confirmed by the fact the office is all new hires out of college.  No one sticks around there unless they sell their sole to become management.

I would never recommend anyone using AXA for their financial planning.  They will tell you about their open platform, then stir you into a high fee/high commission insurance product.  I would ask what the exact compensation is on each product (6.5% on annuities - but you only get 3.25% based on the broker/dealer split and 55% of the first year premium on life insurance).  I would then ask the advisor how much of their own money they have in each product and ask them to prove it with statements....they really hate when people ask what they do with their own money because they of course use the low fee/commission options that are most suitable.

If you are desperate for a job and don't mind selling your friends and family then give it a shot.  No one will help you unless you can bring in a client, that is the hardest part of this industry (finding qualified prospects who trust you).  GOOD LUCK!"
1489,,Financial Advisor,2015-06-08,2.0,Financial Professional,Ability to sell both insurance and manage retirement funds.  I believe this product mix allows for complete problem solving when working with a customer.  The AXA name carries some level of respect: the company has not endured the financial strife that others in the industry have.,"Costs: A never ending cascade that constantly chips away at your ability to become fully self sufficient.  Office space, IT support, internet, liability insurance, senior management support, etc.  

Absence of Investment/Support:  you are regaled with stats on how associates that are with the company for 3 years are the highest in the industry.  That's great unless you're in year 1 or 2.  There is a culture of ""you're on your own"" so don't expect any help from established advisors to work their book to pick up some scraps to help offset what you're doing on your own.  You will be pushed hard to use your network of family, friends, and former co-workers to sell product to but keep in mind that after you leave, those customers get absorbed by the firm. This is straight commission so you will be worked hard and no one will care if you don't make it...another crop of young people sucked in by the promises of wealth and the ability to be their own boss will arrive.

Ask why their are so many empty cubicles for such a successful firm.  It's not an expansion it's churn and burn.  If you have friends in the industry ask them about this place: it's positioned as a personal touch company interested in your success but they are no different that anyone else.

If you are a trust fund kid or someone that has minimal personal expenses it may be worth a shot."

The leadership of the D.C. branch comes from a position of industry experience and success. It is important to me to have a leadership team that made the commitment to build their own successful financial practices and prove themselves in the industry, so that I can be confident in their guidance and advice in building my own practice. What is very appealing and encouraging with this firm is the office culture is one that emphasizes joint work with experienced advisors, comprehensive training, and most importantly self accountability in building my practice. I'm very happy with my results and experiences at AXA.","Entering the financial services industry as an advisor working directly with clients is challenging. Challenging not just at AXA, but at any financial firm. This can be frustrating. Work-life balance is tough to start out because it takes time and commitment to build a successful practice. However, once your practice builds momentum the work-life balance improves greatly and provides more flexibility  than any other career I have worked in. A challenge that I experienced is that coming on board is not taking a job, but building a practice. That mental shift from being an employee to being a business owner building my financial services practice was a bit of a struggle, but it is essential to understand to be successful."

Once you leave and a client decides to cancel their contract, AXA bills you for the advanced commissions.  That's not a problem and I agree money should be reimbursed.  However, agents who take over your newly acquired client may churn the account (cancel their existing account and make them open another one within AXA to increase their application count to meet the monthly quota) or simply give bad service making the client want to transfer to a better institution."

They're very good at guiding new employees and training them to the best of their ability so that you won't feel like you're being thrown out in the ocean and have to teach yourself to swim on your own.","Like I said in the title, this isn't for everyone. You'll experience a lot of rejections as you learn the trade and practice, and the first year or two requires a lot of grunt work that may not be worth it if your heart/drive is not in it. If you don't enjoy meeting new people and building relationships, then this definitely isn't for you because this career depends heavily on networking and building rapport. Most people quit before 2 years because they are short-sighted and don't see the benefits of the investment in the long run. Your experience also is mostly determined by your manager and not the company overall since he or she will be your mentor. Mine was great, and if I stayed it would mostly be because I didn't want to disappoint him, but the job itself really depressed me so I eventually decided to leave and change career paths."

If you can envision yourself making the excuses seen in many of the posts on this page, written by failures who cannot own up to their faults--I am speaking directly to you. 

-There are some rotten apples as in any office, it is difficult to understand how some made it through the interview process. Perhaps I shouldn't judge a book by its cover, but laziness is evident from the manner a person dresses and conducts themselves--as well as their attitude towards life. 

-Start up costs among other fees. Not really a con considering these are involved in any business venture in addition to the fact that you are investing in your career and book of clients--but again--this is geared towards those who tend to make an excuse for their own failure.

Do not receive base salary until 6 months into the job. Have a lot in savings before starting or you will not survive. Average payout on a new client signed is three months."

This gives me an opportunity to be my own business owner and represent myself to the clients as my company. Which is a great advantage and another great trait in the financial world.",The Entrepreneurial part might be as good as it might be bad. For example you gotta pay rent for your own cube and/or assistant and stuff like that.

1582,,3.5 Rating at Best -- Coming from a once dedicated worker and AXA advocate,2014-09-21,3.0,Financial Consultant,"Great benefits. Salary for the first few years of building your client base. Wonderful management support in Texas. Young group of workers with personalities that mesh well. Great culture overall. Great support team to help you get service work and paperwork completed efficiently. Only in office for maybe two days a week within the RBG group. Otherwise, out in the field prospecting new clients. Has been a wonderful experience and great start to career to gain industry experience and open up doors to new opportunities. Great sales experience. RBG is encouraged to meet new leads face to face rather than cold calling. Developed experience in financial planning that will help with personal future goals, savings and investments. Great company products across the board.","Have to be extremely dedicated because a lot of times the negatives outweigh the positives in the first 5 years. Have to be a hard worker to get where you want to be in your career and to succeed a lot quicker than most. 

They nickel and dime you from the time you contract on. At different increments in your career you start having to pay for new things: software, E&O insurance, state insurance licenses, continuing ed credits, FINRA service fees, and more. They also never give you a heads up when new items will start being deducted from your check, you are just shocked one day when another $100 comes out of your check per month. After two years, I now have $700 coming out of my check not including med benefits. This is fine as long as your market isnt saturated and you're consistently selling. 

After two years and several additional starting advisors come on board, you begin to feel a little bit like a number. Management support falls off a bit and they almost seem to want to help the new people succeed at that point rather than the veterans with experience but still havent made it to their 5th year yet (so they still need help).

Dont even think about taking time off. When you take time off, you dont get paid. And if you're having trouble making ends meet anyway then theres no way you'll be able to eat the next month. (When you sell a product in one month, you dont get paid on it until the next month.) So if you like to spend time with your family, friends, or take trips better think twice about this position."

1591,,"If you don't want to sell insurance, you're going to have a bad time!",2014-08-18,2.0,Financial Consultant,"DISCLAIMER: this review constitutes only my OPINION

*Great place to start your career, and they're willing to hire almost anyone (even without your licenses)
*Will help you get your licenses if you don't have them
*Great position title if you want to switch jobs later on
*Flexible work schedule. You work when you want to, but with that said, expect to work long hours if you want to succeed.
*If you're self motivated, you will do not badly.
*If you're self motivated, charismatic, and good looking, that is when you will make money.
*Great coworkers (not including the managers-- see cons section)-- everyone understands the stress and frustrations of working with fickle clients. They will stand by you and help you as much as they can.
*If you have a good manager, you will probably have a better time. That said, your chances of getting a good manager are pretty slim
*You do make good money if you're good at what you do.
*pretty good training: they teach you a lot if you have the time to sit in on all of the meetings
*good benefits- commissions pay out at pretty high rates
*our life insurance products are not bad in my opinion
*Senior Executive Vice President was an amazing leader; I only wish the district managers were the same.","DISCLAIMER: this review constitutes only my OPINION
ALSO: this is not a vindictive reaction to being fired; I have successfully hit quota thus far and expect to continue to do so in the future.
NOW, WHERE TO BEGIN?

*high turnover-- in my time there, I have seen too many people come and go. Because they hire everyone, most people are not actually fit for the job. Chances are you are not fit in the long term either (~90% industry attrition rate)
*middle management is largely HORRENDOUS; they're driven by greed, which is understandable since this is a sales job at the end of the day, but they don't help you much
*they bait you with success stories that have you chasing the dream that you are THE one to make it big, but one day the sobering reality will hit that you are probably not the one that will make the big bucks
*they, in my opinion, bait and switch you (which ironically is an unethical action in the industry)
Example 1- I was told I would be working in wealth management (which is not completely untrue), but if you want to hit quota, you usually begin by selling insurance (was not told this)
Example 2- promise of two options when joining the company: option 1 included a salary, option 2 included no salary but larger commissions. When you finish your probation period, option 1 sometimes magically disappears.
*our annuity products, in my opinion, are not the most competitive in the industry
Elaboration- products look good on paper, but- in practice- are so-so. Most successful advisors don't sell AXA products (so I've heard)
*forced to sell before you completely understand the product
Example 1- sold my family members multiple products that were probably not the best options for them (partner may or may not be motivated by greed/quota pressures e.g. managers)

The list could go on and on."

AXA provides a platform for advisors to give feedback to senior management. The company also invests heavily to make us leaders in a digital environment.,"Like any entrepreneurial business, the career requires a lot of hard work and can frustrate those who are not willing to commit the effort needed to create a successful practice."
1596,,Bad experience waste of time,2014-07-26,1.0,Financial Advisor,Big company. Not many pros unfortunately. Great location.,many false promises to get you in. Didnt deliver promises.

I met some great people there (who have all left).,There is a very high liklihood that you're going to get a ton of accounts and end up turning them over to your manager when you leave.  They really push proprietary products.  If you don't sell AXA products you're not going to have benefits.  When you compare AXA compensation to what you get as an independent advisor you'll be shocked by how much AXA DOESN't pay their advisors.
1602,,Sales not an Advisor,2014-06-30,2.0,Financial Advisor,Easy way to get your Series 7/66 & LAH Licenses.  Can provide some beneficial financial services industry experience.  If you know a lot of people with large retirement accounts you can make large sums of money very quickly.,"You will be forced to sell to your friends, family and then just about anyone who will still talk to you or answer your phone calls.  Little to no help will be given to you once they see you as having tapped your ""natural market"" and you will be discarded.  Compensation is purely commission based making almost everything you sell an inherent conflict of interest."
1603,,No True Leadership,2014-06-28,1.0,Financial Advisor,You can earn your FINRA licensing.,"Without real leadership this group of offices in West LA, Woodland Hills, Irvine and Koreatown will always under perform. Branch managers say they have an open door policy, but don't have time or interest in speaking to you. Divisional Managers lack management and leadership skills. 
You can't hire everyone and spread managers too thin to train the new advisors, Make a mistake and you might receive a rude call from the compliance bulldog. I could never understand a word she said but knew she was not happy.  I spent long days learning from those who would give me time but in the end I realized that this group did not care about me at all.

1606,,growing experience,2014-06-09,3.0,Anonymous Employee,"Despite the cons, it's definitely a place where you'll experience the most character development. It'll force you to either give up the comfort of a high paycheck in the beginning or to have you reach out and network with people you never thought you would talk to for life. But through these processes, it's personal growth and relationship building, whether you made a sale or not at the end of the day. Plus as AXA advertises, it's not about selling but about helping, which I genuinely believe it's true otherwise I would've never even stepped in this industry if the company or the industry is not filled with people who are kind at heart. I was there for 6 months but I believe I've seen both the goods and the bads. I still believe given the motivation and passion in insurance and retirement planning and a kind heart, you will succeed. Also you will meet some of the smartest coworkers because they all have good degrees. Despite the fact that most people don't make it, those that do are high-achieving and intelligent.","It's more on you to make a difference. Not so much relying on the manager or the company to push you. No parking. No base salary in the beginning. A lot of cold-calling before successfully building that referral network.

Good training for those new to the business, company paid travel to training in NY during 2nd year.  Good wholesalers, insurance and investment. Good products with option to go outside brokerage (limited crump) on insurance products if needed.  Technology is decent, e-apps and salesforce.  LPL is behind on adapting site to iPad.o","Brand recognition in US, which can be important to newbies, continues to be a challenge.  Expenses can be high (E&O, appointments, limited free marketing materials, purchase your own computer & stationary, LPL fees, etc).  Training was REQUIRED in my branch even if you don't need it, until you hit certain production numbers.
 Joint work is great training, but check out your work partner on FINRA broker check.  I didn't and lost a big client (1m aum) because my ""expert"" joint work partner had a client complaint and I didn't know about it.

Management does an extremely good job assisting new advisors in launching their business.","Being an advisor is extremely difficult--no one at Karr Barth will try and hide that from you.  It is difficult for good reason, however.  Other reviews cite having to pay for licensing or tapping your ""natural market"" as negatives.

Expect to be on the phone making a lot of cold calls if you don't have a lead network in place.   This would be fine, except that you have to pay for/produce the leads yourself.

Highly aggressive sales and prospecting environment that encourages use of deceit and intellectual property misappropriation such as lifting corporate directories from conference rooms at target companies to gain access to prospects. Managing VP's tacitly condone misrepresenting relationship between AXA Advisors and other companies to add false legitimacy and get appointments. Advisors are routinely expelled/ banned from office buildings.

You have to sell your soul to be successful. I saw through the lies pretty fast but was in deep denial, and chased a few opportunities that did not pan out. Hours are not flexible in reality, because your managing VP will guilt you into being there 12 hours a day.

They treat you as a business owner, so very few costs are paid for by AXA. That unlimited earning potential is undermined by working with a saturated teacher market. 
This was my first job out of college, so I wasn't entirely sure what to expect. For someone who knows 100% they want to be a financial advisor, AXA has a lot of resources as a huge company and a lot of great producers. Do not go RBG, go traditional to those who are certain about becoming an advisor."

I am not a person who would have someone buy a policy to drop it right after I left the company, but they have had these experiences in the past.  BE AWARE - THEY WILL SEND LAWYERS AFTER YOU REGARDLESS OF YOUR TIME AWAY FROM THE COMPANY.  I CANNOT RETAIN CLIENTS WHEN I NO LONGER WORK FOR THE COMPANY!

The employee benefits are pretty good including a generous stock option plan, a nice bonus structure, and residual pay. 

 It is a postion where if you can make it through the daily grind for 10+ years you will be very happy with the money made and is without a doubt a job you should only consider if you are truly looking for a long term position with a company.  Don't work here if you only want to get 1-2 years of experience and move on, it's not worth it and there are better places to do that, but if you go in with a long term perspective it can be a good opportunity for those that are driven, competitive, and good in a sales/numbers environment.","It is one of the hardest jobs I've encountered and the numbers back it up as there is a little less than a 15% retention rate of employees after 4 years.  A big part of this is there are a lot of costs associated with the job, for example: you rent your office space from the company and have to pay for it, the same with the mandatory company computer, as well as your licenses, the majority of the planning and organizational software necessary to do the job, and professional liability insurance among other expenses.  It's not uncommon for my first salary paycheck ever month to go entirely to these costs.

You spend about the first 3 months of work without any form of salary so in additional to trying to learn about all the products and services, you are required to try to sell these products in order to make money, even though you do not know enough to adequately sell them.  Additionally in the short term the pay isn't competitive with other companies in the industry, it gets better after about 5 years and catches up, but that is due to the compounded residual pay in addition to the bonus structure.

There is a terrible work/life balance as I typically find myself leaving home by 5:30am and getting back home after 10pm.  This is mainly because the job is at it's core a sales job, which would be fine, but in addition to going through the typically sales process (prospecting, making calls, preparing for appointments, running appointments, closing the sale) you don't have an assistant of any type so you are also responsible for the administrative half of the sale (filling out paperwork, processing paperwork from start to finish, following up with and correcting any errors made by yourself, the client, or the home office-who unfortunately are very understaffed and as a result make an immense amount of mistakes).  This gets better after time when you can afford to hire an assistant to handle the follow up and paperwork, but again that is an entirely out of pocket expense with no company support.

There isn't a very clear channel of communications at any level of the company.  When paperwork needs to be followed up on you can easily wait on hold for 30+ minutes just to talk to 4 different people about the same problem before ever getting to someone who can solve it.  There needs to be a restructuring and a serious reevaluation of how best to provide insurance."

They also have a strong line of (life) insurance and annuity products that makes the sale easy for the right clients.  If you manage to pass the initial hurdle of $3,000 of production credits (6 month probation period), you will be given some form of salary (as a draw) that can extend up to 3 years.  Benefits are pretty good too and includes a pension down the line.  Depending on the office you are in, you can potentially have access to some very experienced advisors with whom you can partner with.","It is first and foremost a sales position.  If you are in the traditional advisor position, be ready to start contacting all your friends and family to get you started in addition to going out and prospecting through networking or cold/warm calling.  If you are in the 403(b) division, get ready to eat your pride and walk school campus with the hopes of meeting teachers even when school policy technically forbids you to be there.  Thought you CAN have access to some very experienced advisors, they don't always seem to care about your success (which is kind of natural since I'm sure they see a lot of people come in and go).   You really have to develop mentor and partner relationships early on if you want to succeed.

Also, AXA Advisors is primarily an insurance carrier.  If you are big on investments through mutual funds, if you want to be more of a fee-based financial planner, AXA may not be the right place for you."

Most of the people you will work with have been employed for less than five years. The veterans are to busy or so far along with their career to give any thoughtful advice.

1728,,Karr Barth/ AXA Advisors Interview Experience,2012-08-03,1.0,Financial Advisor,Very nice building. Staff seemed satisfied and content.,"This company goes by Karr Barth Associates and AXA Advisors. They called in about 5 of us for a group interview and gave us more information about the company. Then they said they would be selecting two or three of us to come back. All the other candidates, including myself,  had their master's degrees and so did everyone else I spoke with at the company. This gave me a few shreds of hope. I was called in for a second interview to speak with the president and was eventually told that I would have to pay $650-800 to get licensed and that I would have to draw from my ""natural market"". For those of you who don't know, that is people that you know like your parents, family, and friends. After that, I was told that I could go for 4-5 weeks without receiving a paycheck ""due to the peaks and valleys associated with this type of career"".  Also, they asked that I work until 8pm and come in on weekends because, ""It's not a job, it's a  career business"". Additionally, the president who interviewed me was writing on my resume the entire time I was speaking to him and not making eye contact with me or showing any other social vital signs. I did confirm my third interview (which I will not show up for) to show them that they are not the only ones who can waste other peoples' time.Thanks for the false hope and wasting my gas money.

1734,,Terrible company for women to work at.,2012-06-16,1.0,Financial Advisor,You can make you own schedule and not have to go into the office.  AXA does have some good life insurance and annuity products for clients.,"Unprofessional workplace.   As a woman I was always passed up for recognition and production awards even though I had out produced all counterparts multiple times over the years.   I would be yelled at in my annual reviews for the way my hair looked that day rather than being praised for having the highest production.  My managers insisted on taking sometimes up to 20% of my commission for just being a manager.  I was also required to split my commissions with a partner (usually a new one) that could not produce yet.  I often had to train my partner and split my commissions with both my manager and partner.  This was awful because you eventually become 100% commission and you have to ""feed"" other associates.  The managers set it up this way because there is very high turnover and they have to hit recruiting goals, and they do not care if the new associate succeeds because eventually the manager wants to take the clients and commissions from the failed new person.  The manager ultimately wants passive income where he takes a cut from all his employees and takes all failed associates' clients and ongoing commissions.  The manager ultimate goal is to NOT work and feed off of you.

To institute this disgusting practice the manager (male) threatened me in private meetings.  I had worked hard and tried to hold on and protect my business.  This happened on multiple occasions.  I felt I was proactive in reporting threats and behavior to the branch manager, but he placated the situation.  He eventually addressed the sitution, but his poor judgement and procrastination had let a bad situation become horrible.  There is no human resources available even after I asked the branch manager multiple times.  I was punished by my branch by having it be accepted to be yelled at and cussed at by other employees .  One example would be in talking with my compliance officer about a rationale for opening a new account and updating investment strategies.  The compliance officer would yell and lose control over crossing something off a form rather than writing NA next to it.  Compliance officer's actions were ongoing and others could hear him yelling at me, and some others like my old manager, would be very buddy buddy and wait outside the door to go to lunch with him.    There would be no recouse.  

The horrible examples of unprofessionalism and need for human resources, and code of conduct  in this office (San Diego) are paramount.  This office is a locker room.  You are either in or out.  Also, do not  be stupid, if you are in you are playing the game and stuck selling mostly proprietary products that other firms do not carry.  This means that after 5 years ( or what ever it may be) and you want to change firms: you cannot without leaving your book of business and all your hard work and sacrefice with them.  

There are a lot of firms on the street.  I have to admit, when I first started there I loved it and fit in for many years.  I learned a lot.  You will get to run a lot of meetings, learn the basics better than almost anywhere for a short time ( assuming you have no prior sales or financial experience).  Then get out and move on.  Build your own book with a product agnostic firm.  That way you can go anywhere: wirehouse, independent, etc.  This firm does have an experation date for most just like when you graduated elementary school.  Think about it:  you would not want your child to spend all their school years in elementary school, however they do need to attend there K-5 years there.  The product, scope, and financial industry knowledge stops here at a low level.  Think about what kind of advisor you want to be.  At the end I learned I had outgrown the firm, and I could not be fooled or drink anymore Kool-aid in being told AXA was it.  I didn't care about partying with them or fitting in.  What was important was my career as a Financisl Advisor, my book of business, and growing my knowledge ( yes I stopped going to training because they only trained on a couple of products over and over again).  I learned a very hard and thankful lesson here:  do a good job no matter how hard, mean, or unsupportive people become of you, you will shine and make it out.  Those who ridicule you, desperate to fit in, or suck up to those who are mediocare at best, will always sacrefice their self interest in their career because they have to continue to appease to get their morsels.  I do want to note that not all advisors here are bad, and I met some very nice people along the way, but usually they had other circumstances that helped them side-step the toxic vortex.  I am thankful to the real friends I made, for AXA giving me my start, and those who did support and help grow me.  I wish them the all the best.  To the others and the business model I leave you this:  ""It is not what you don't know that you should fear most, it is what you think you know to be absolutely true and is in fact false that is of the greatest threat."
