within my own area, the management team has gone to extraordinary lengths to ensuring a good work-life balance and following the principles accordingly.",I cannot think of any cons at this time (and I know it sounds corny.)
44,,Great Company,2021-12-02,5.0,Client Services Director,If you are willing to take on challenges and aren't afraid of change you can do well at Experian.

46,,Truly is an amazing place to work,2021-12-02,5.0,Senior Sales Manager/Business Development,"6 years in and I still have culture shock. Leadership truly cares about the people and the high-performance culture means you are always pushed to be your best self. The solutions are actually making a difference to businesses and I love knowing we are making a positive impact on the economy.

There are some truly amazing people here. Everyone is competitive but also helpful - wanting everyone to succeed!

The overall feeling is like a start-up company within a larger enterprise! Creative ideas are rewarded and innovation is felt throughout the company as they welcome ways to improve both internal processes and solutions to solve client's issues!","The company is a bit siloed with the different business units, but this is something we are actively working on! The training and onboarding could be better but again in the last 6 years have been major improvements."
47,,Great Company & Great Culture,2021-12-02,5.0,Sales Manager,Product innovation is vibrant and focus on client success a key driver. Collaboration across multiple teams is encouraged and strong. A focus on diversity is very welcome and the company truly invests in developing people. Among the best company cultures I've encountered anywhere!

High innovation company
Approachable and engaged Executive team",No negative feedback at this time
50,,Great company--for sure I'd recommend Experian as a great place to work,2021-11-29,5.0,Senior Account Executive,"I have (as of Dec 2021) worked for this company for 36 years. 
And no lie---it has been a fabulous company to work for! 
They have trained me, and supported me, every step of the way. Without a doubt, I would not hesitate to recommend Experian as a great company to work for. Great people, great products, a top notch leadership.","It is a a fast-paced environment, so keeping up with the new innovations can be challenging."

53,,No One in their Right Mind Will Work Here,2021-11-25,1.0,Customer Care Specialist II,"Paid time off on all major US holidays, M-F schedule","Everything else. Back to back calls, our two 15 min break times vary everyday, work schedule will change every few weeks and employees are expected to go with it, the phone tree is a dumpsterfire and so is IT. Experian intentionally makes it hard for consumers to reach live agents, and even when they do, there's no guarantee that the line won't get disconnected during the call or the agents' CRM won't freeze. Management is shady and unsupportive. All they focus on is our metrics, they don't have our backs when it comes to the day to day issues that impact our metrics. For example, supervisors do not take escalations, ever(!), but will ask us to lie to consumers and promise them calls back. Some even belittle callers, implying that callers are just idiots or liars, and don't take their credit report concerns seriously. When we agents report technical issues, they blame it on our internet or refer us to their incompetent IT team. There is NO pay raise with upskill. On the disputes team I was still EXTREMELY limited in how I could help because of Experian's restrictive policies and procedures. There is no way to move into another department or grow at this company either. It's unfortunate but true that a good number of people who work here are either undereducated, unprofessional, or unempathetic, but it's like Experian intentionally hires people like that to frustrate callers and keep call volumes down. They eventually plan to get rid of live customer service agents completely to cut costs! I worked here for a year because it was remote, I couldn't find work in my field, and I had to have A Job to pay the bills, but I've been absolutely miserable. This crappy call center and company are not worth it!"
54,,Great place,2021-11-23,5.0,Account Executive,Great place to work. Very inclusive.,It is dependent on the individual
55,,Relationship Manager,2021-11-22,5.0,Senior Relationship Manager,"Inclusive Culture, Career Opportunities, Management that listens, face paced, Industry Leader, Looks for ways to improve society","Speed to market at times can be slow, pricing is higher than competitors"
56,,Great Workplace and Culture with Opportunity,2021-11-19,5.0,Director,Experian focuses on improving in every way every day from developing products that help the consumer to opportunities for employees to being open in dialogue around supporting the community and building an all inclusive culture.,"Experian has a diverse portfolio with multiple layers of regional, global and local business leaders that can complicate and increase the workload and shorten timelines of delivery. This is good for opportunity and mobility, but can also be challenging."
57,,Culture,2021-11-19,3.0,Customer Service Agent,At the corporate level Experian is a top place of employment,Working in the Allen TX Contact Center the ranking considerable drops
58,,The best in every way,2021-11-19,5.0,Senior Vice President Marketing,"Experian is the best company to work for. The reasons are endless. The culture, the teams, the innovation, the purpose, the mission, the intellect, the curiosity. All leads to immense satisfaction.",None that I can think of
59,,A fantastic company with amazing colleagues!,2021-11-18,5.0,Senior Director,The culture! Experian walks the walk and doesn't just talk the talk when it comes to building a winning culture. This is evidenced by the many Best Place to Work awards across the globe. The approachability of all levels of leadership is a welcome change and it makes one want to give their best for the company and fellow team members.,Nothing worth mentioning comes to mind.
60,,Great Place to Work,2021-11-17,5.0,"Director, Product Management","Great ethics-driven company that puts it's employees and the customers we serve first.

While the organization is highly results driven, they also promote great work-life balance for all employees. It is truly a unique organization and great place to work.",Experian is a results-driven culture which can be intimidating to some people.
61,,Fantastic Company,2021-11-16,5.0,Senior Software QA Analyst,"Great Benefits; Executive Leadership; Flexibility; Opportunities; 
Diversity & Inclusion","The amount of overtime, sometimes"
62,,"Fun, Rewarding, Plenty of Opportunities",2021-11-16,5.0,Director,"Experian wants to do more and wants to do better - so they hire the best talent to focus and deliver on what's right for the consumer. There's a lot of autonomy, a lot of different initiatives and great leadership. and just as hard as you work, there's the balance of a fun culture, where 'people' is the primary reason people love being at Experian and stay. Experian works hard to create opportunities for consumers but they also have a strong focus on our employees and recognize us as people who are different.","Because Experian wants to be the best, the work is hard and there's a lot of it. If you're not up to the challenge, this isn't the place for you. And because Experian wears many hats and has multiple business units it takes awhile to get up to speed and really know all about what Experian has to offer. This, however, I see as an opportunity to grow and transition into other roles, other business units, even other regions since Experian is a global company."
63,,"Work hard, play hard",2021-11-15,5.0,Director of Operations,"If you're hungry and are willing to work for opportunity, there is a lot of growth potential for people here. I've had a very positive career trajectory in my six years here.","Working here is not for the faint of heart. This is not usually a 9-5 job that allows people to coast. There is always a mountain to climb. While this is still a pro for many people, people should know this is a hungry to achieve culture."
64,,Excellent Culture,2021-11-15,5.0,Team Lead,"I've worked at Experian for 18 months and I'm constantly impressed at the strong, positive culture. Leadership is no-blame, quick to recognize good work, and supportive of employees.",The only cons for me are minor: tech support / help desk doesn't do a great job of setting up new hires tech-wise and my role does require working outside standard business hours on a weekly basis (still only working 40 hrs / week).
65,,The BEST place I have ever worked!,2021-11-15,5.0,Senior Director Marketing,"Experian truly cares about its employees. They help us grow professionally and personally and allow us to bring our whole selves to work every day. If this wasn't obvious before the pandemic it certainly become obvious during. Experian did everything in their power to ensure the safety and well being of each and every employee they have across the globe. And perhaps even more impressive was how quickly and smoothly they executed the transition to remote work. Beyond caring for employees Experian is also full of opportunity. Opportunities across a variety of businesses in all locations around the world. Experian really is a world class employer, I consider myself lucky to work here!",The pros FAR outweigh the cons but if I were forced to come up with one it would be that we operate in a highly regulated industry which results in long development cycles.

The work is very interesting and challenging.
There are great options to move between divisions as well.","This is both a pro and a con - Experian deals with a lot of personal information, so there is a lot of security in place. Sometimes there are processes and procedures to follow to get work completed. All very necessary since the company places security as a top priority."
76,,Collaborative Environment,2021-11-03,4.0,Contracts Counsel,"co-workers are great, collaborative environment","understaffed, difficult to achieve marks as a high performer because of rating system seems to be curved so that most employees rate a meets expectations"

Secondly, it remains important to be mindful of Remote employees -when promotions and advancement opportunities materialize. Lastly, budget permitting, a shared, local office space for the ""in immediate area employees"" would be appreciated greatly, and well utilized. (again, budget permitting)."
86,,Working at Experian,2021-10-12,5.0,Director of Support Services,"Emphasis on teamwork! As a new employee to Experian (my company was acquired by Experian last year), I have been made to feel a part of the team from day one. Everyone is very helpful in navigating the many systems and I can always find someone to help with whatever issue I'm having.","Not many cons with working for this organization. I guess the only thing I can say is that everyone is remote (due to COVID), so it will be great to actually meet coworkers in person when it is safe."

All of this and more were available and honestly, every year just keeps getting better! My colleagues are great, the work environment is fantastic and I'm provided all the tools I need to be successful.","Experian is a very large dynamic company.

93,,"Excellent environment, less than competitive pay",2021-09-27,4.0,Senior Scrum Master,Excellent and I mean excellent working environment. Work life balance is the best i've had at any company. Extremely flexible and accommodating of schedules. Trusts you as an autonomous professional to make decisions about your time and work.,Salary does not keep pace with market. Existing employee increases are capped at an arbitrary % against your base salary. This means that you are always anchored to some degree by what your starting salary despite how much you advance. This encourages people to leave the company.
94,,Great Place to work,2021-09-24,5.0,Affinity| Operations Back Office,"Great people, benefits, competitive wages, and the ability to work remotely from home.","I do believe that in general the wages are competitive, but with the many rolls of backoffice agent that we should be rated higher than customer care professional 1, and the pay scale could be better for this position."
95,,"Incredible company: great work-life balance, and intelligent people",2021-09-22,5.0,Director of Strategy,"Experian has great leadership with a vision and strategy. They value families and the work-life balance is very reasonable. The people are kind, ambitious, and educated.

I have earned many certifications while working for Experian and paid for by Experian. They have invested in my professional growth. We have great insurance and benefits and my favorite is the amount of vacation/sick time given to us. They give us a lot of paid days off to balance work and home life. I have learned a lot about credit and now sit in the 10% of the top of the nation with my credit score. All from education while working here and doing the right thing. Management is very supportive and most are hired from within the company.,Consumers can feel very passionate and confused about credit. Maybe they are trying to buy a house or help their kids go to college but have run into a roadblock. They call us when emotions are high. It is our job to listen to the customer and find ways to help them. You must be able to listen to an upset customer without being upset yourself. This is easy if you just focus on how the customer must be feeling and finding solutions for them.

101,,Great company with great benefits,2021-09-10,5.0,Learning And Development Specialist,"The benefits at Experian are amazing. I have yet to see or hear of a company that has better benefits than what Experian offers to their employees. The Medical and vision insurance is incomparable. 
We have the HealthMatters program thru Virgin pulse that you can earn money thru. So far this year I have earned over $600. This is taxed but free money, all you have to do is keep track of your steps and log in each day and click on some buttons. If you are interested in getting healthy or need help with mindfulness this is the tool for you. 
Starting out you get 3 weeks of vacation and being here as long as I have I now get 5 weeks. It is amazing. 
The maternity leave benefits were amazing when I had my son. I got to spend the whole 12 weeks off with him. I could not have done this at my last 2 jobs. 

The company is ever changing and growing so you will learn new things and never be bored with your job. Due to this changing there is always a need for new employees and many opportunities for growth. I have worked as an agent, a lead, a supervisor, and now I am content with my Training position. I found my niche.","It is fast paced so if that is not for you it can be a bit over whelming. 
Change is a constant with Experian due to innovation. If you do not like change then you may have a little bit of a struggle."

You will learn a lot, however the training they provide is not enough for their expectations.","Work life balance doesn’t exist. They do not lend help when needed, however they expect you to work as many hours and have the same knowledge as upper management without the pay."
105,,Its a job,2021-09-07,2.0,CSID,"Easy hours, work is not hard","Constant changing schedule, jobs and support."

-Tremendous amount of perks and benefits
-Opportunity to work from home
-Big push for diversity, equity and inclusivity
-Celebrate everyone's differences that make them them.","- Raises aren't too large
- A bit too structured (it's a corporate thing I believe, just a little too rigid for my taste).
- Red tape for a lot of processes.
- Innovation gets rolled out a bit too slow. 
- For the creative types: There's no Chief Marketing Officer, so there are endless conversations about what's right for the brand and what's not. If there was a CMO, creatives and marketers alike, would not be spinning their wheels to push innovation and ensuring proper brand equity in the public and internally."
115,,Great company to work for,2021-08-26,5.0,Global Data Analyst,"Culture - leadership, teamwork, inclusive

117,,Not much opportunity to advance in the company,2021-08-16,3.0,Market Development Manager,"Fun environment, people are easy to work with, fair pay to start (if you wait around for a few years you'll see a solid commission check)","Experian offers fair pay to start, but the since the sales cycles are very long (over 1 year), it can take awhile to start seeing your commissions come in. You'll have to be able to live at least 6 months off just your base salary before you can expect to get any sort of hefty commission. There is little to no way to advance in the same business unit, so you will have to jump around to different segments and self-educate on the products that they sell."
118,,Awesome place to work!,2021-08-16,5.0,Data Management Analyst,The company has great flexibility and my coworkers are awesome!!,"So far I haven't found any cons, really loving it!"

Last year, I was impacted by California wildfires where my family was evacuated and displaced for 2 days. Experian jumped right in with the support of hotel accommodations, meals, and a phone call from Human Resources. I was so touched by Experian's priority to put people first. For the duration that I have been at Experian, my pay increased exceeded my expectations and the work life balance is top notch!",The company is huge!

123,,Best Corporate Experience by Far,2021-07-30,5.0,Content Strategist,"I've been at Experian for two years, three months. It's been the most positive corporate experience I've had in OC and it's not remotely close. 
The culture is positive and inclusive top to bottom and everyone I've worked with has been respectful, enthusiastic, quick to praise and collaborative. 
I always feel valued by my team, partner teams and leadership.
I've worked in other financial services companies of similar size and the compensation and benefits at Experian are superior.
Leadership is positive, hard working, encouraging and wiling to share positive feedback from other executives and stakeholders. 
Interdepartmental collaboration is fluid and positive. 
For me, there has been no drama, politics or toxic atmosphere. 
Since pandemic began, the company has demonstrated leadership's concerned with our physical and emotional wellbeing. 
100% remote work has eased my commuting stress and expense significantly. 
Choosing the work option that is best for you (office, home or hybrid) is encouraged and reinforced by HR.

Constructive criticism 
Paid time off that’s accumulated

Benefits are pretty good, you can WFH and the office is nice.","There is a TON of turnover which feels destabilizing at times, and some of the upper management is terrible, and their bad behavior goes consequence free. There’s a lot of favorites and cliques, so bad employees are often protected. It has a ton of potential but they have an enormous amount left of growing to do."

I have found everyone to be very professional and positive.

Despite the size of the company, the team I have joined is very personable and encouraging.",The corporate provided equipment has layers of protection including texted codes & passwords daily.

160,,It's not really Experian.,2021-04-18,2.0,CSID,"The pay is pretty good, not great.
The community is all right.","Mandatory OT
Minimal-no support on weekends
Promises of benefits we never get
You aren't getting the benefits Experian employees get.
No holidays, even if it is one labelled under ""my benefits""
You will have to take calls for over 290 different companies as if you worked for that company, you won't be trained for most of them.
Training was lacking, and the trainer didn't seem to have a full grasp of what csid does.
CSID doesn't stand for anything, it's not an acronym.
There have been days where I was logged in, at my computer, and not been payed for those days.
Training often times does not match company policy.
CSID is open 24/7/365, we don't have supervisors at all hours, though.
If you want to call in, you'll have to do it when the attendance line is open, also not open all hours.
The help desk has never fixed anything I've called in about, they blame me for the problem and then hang up, if they follow up at all.
You are held responsible for replacing faulty equipment.
you will have your calls graded in house, and by every company you take calls for, all 290 of them.
Many of these companies will provide their customers with a wildly inaccurate view of what csid does, you can expect people to call in looking for credit advice pretty frequently.
Every department is badly understaffed, you may be transferred to a different department to meet their needs without any input from you."

173,,Great company with good people,2021-03-11,5.0,Senior Account Executive,The company takes care of its employees and clients. Great benefits and work life balance.,No downsides. Putting something here to meet the 5 words requirement.
174,,A place to grow,2021-03-09,5.0,Vice President Product Management,I've worked in multiple business units over many years. One of the key reasons I've stayed is that I have had multiple opportunities to take on new responsibilities and gain new skills. The culture is very inclusive and leadership truly cares about and are fair to employees. High performance is an expectation and top performers are rewarded.,"Very few cons - on occasion, it can be a challenge to get things accomplished, but I see this with many large organizations (not unique to Experian)."
175,,Super culture and strong business,2021-03-08,5.0,Vice President,"Good people to work with where you enjoy going to work. Very focused on the employee, great work place flexibility - you can structure your day around your family needs. Strong business.",Need to integrate the businesses more. There is too much duplication and repetition happening in the individual business units.

Budget process demoralizing"
177,,A true trainwreck,2021-03-02,1.0,Customer Service Tier I,Benefits are good. That’s all I have.,"Pros
Benefits are good. That’s about all I have.
Cons
You’re baited and everything is sugar coated during the hiring process and training. They play a big happy family mentality but when you hit the floor all that goes out the window. Your managers will say “we care about you as a person” but I assure you that is garbage. They are so understaffed that they are requiring 5 hours of overtime weekly, on top of the 2.5 you’re already doing by being forced into a 30 minute lunch. The training is questionable and spotty at best. It took three weeks for me to become clear on the actual functions of the job. The left hand doesn’t know what the right hand is doing. The systems are terrible. They are running multiple old programs from a notebook and expect tip top performance. Ludacris. There is no “unscheduled” code so if I need to use the restroom I’m forced to use “break” which takes me “out of adherence.” There is no support from your team or managers when you hit the floor. Frequently you will find yourself with a customer on your line and something you’ve never experienced and NO ONE there to help. You might even call your trainer on their cell phone and be told “they’re too busy to help.” HR and upper management has changed more times in two months than I care to pay attention to. This place is TOXIC."

They have been outstanding during the pandemic - putting out videos from their homes, keeping us constantly up to date and just checking to make sure we have what we need.

Prior to the pandemic Experian implemented many Employee Resource groups that really bring employees, that don't work together and might not have an opportunity to get to know one another, together to learn about their culture, areas of interest etc.

They do frequent employee surveys to check the status of employees.

Experian is also very focused on our Consumers and Customers. For consumers, they have live sessions to learn more about credit and tons of resources to help consumers, including the Boost product.","Resources can be a bit uneven, some of the Business Units have many resources, while others that support then have very few, causing bottlenecks."

Executive management team has done an AMAZING job leading us through the past year of global pandemic and racial injustice. The company is dedicated to providing a safe and inclusive work place for ALL.
Nearly all employees have been working remotely throughout the pandemic and it sounds like the future will be a mix of remote and office working, allowing even more flexibility for employees.","It's a big company, so sometimes it feels like the executive management team is a bit too removed from the rest of us. Experian is a high performance workplace, so they expect a lot of each employee. This isn't necessarily a con, as I enjoy working with other high performers, but at times it does feel like they expect more than what is reasonable."

Great perks and benefits the company , on the surface is good to employees, however, if you have a bad manager the company completely supports the manager and moves you out to cover for them",there are a few bad managers - if you run into one you have no say and plan on leaving. On the surface everything looks rosey. I truly do not believe the entire company is like that just a few bad apples - that fact that HR and the company does not support the employee and turns a blind eye to bad management is toxic and terrible

Loads of FTO - paid time off.,"Management began to make moves to remove my employment. Performance was hyper focused on negative despite achievements. I sought assistance from HR and upper management, they in turn told my manager to develop a PIP. PIP set a list of tasks to be graded on at the end of review. All seemed well on the graded tasks when manager began to rattle off other concerns outside the PIP. Terminated based on performance. Contended and showed emails of timelines and deliverables, doesn't help.
Discovered three weeks later that my position is being posted in Costa Rica with a higher skill set ( likely could not hire someone in the US for what they were paying me with that level of skill )"

Its a massive pilferning operation being run by the Xlabs to pick up other products or ideas and keep repackging them.Its a very SEA trait.Shows how shallow the entire innovation initiative is. NA has way more products and initiatives going for them. This enire awards management is a hogwash to keep a few leaders happy.sad.

PM's control 80% of the designs going out. A designer has been given a golden key by the VP to destroy any design for the worse. They will even put it in their portfolio as their own. Prepare to be backstabbed.

(They were too busy attempting to either come in late or leave early.)

For an information solutions company, there computer systems were terrible.  For the short time that I was there I had numerous hardware and software problems and access to necessary programs.

I come from a background of working for small companies and I got a call from my now manager Joseph. Although, I was in the middle of a server outage at my old employer, I explained to him the situation and I was able to reschedule my phone call interview. I did my best during the phone call interview and was brought in as a contractor for the term of 6 months. Leaving my full-time job at the time was a risk because it was my primary/only source of income and I took the leap. I worked extremely hard as a contractor and I'm proud to say I've been converted to a full-time employee. Working here has completely changed my life for the better, my pay is stable and I feel like I'm contributing to the larger picture.

There are a several great leaders and mentors across the organization, if you're lucky enough to find a role under one of them","The executive team is protective of each other, which is not unusual in corporate America, but disturbingly protective of some bad apples in the ranks. One VP in particular, I've been unfortunate enough to work under for 2 years, and despite reporting multiple incidents to HR and the C-suite over the course of those 2 years, and knowing that multiple other leaders (most of them female) have also reported incidents, NO ACTION has been taken, except to give this VP (male) more power and more teams.  Meanwhile, his entire high-performing team has turned over in the last year due to the toxic environment he has created, but HR and C-suite still choose to turn a blind eye.  If you get stuck under such a leader, good luck to you.  The exec team will choose the leader over you, no matter how high-performing your track record or how long your tenure."

You never know what you are getting paid or if it is correct.  We wouldn't get commission statements for months at a time.  Then you would need to spend hours combing through as the there are thousands of lines of data on the statement.  While I was employed there we had a payment agreement on service data.  After some time they literally pulled all of us into a meeting and said they would not be paying us for what we had already produced.  For me that constitutes theft.  They told us many things and never followed through on anything in regards to pay, product, or working conditions.  Even after switching positions it was the same nonsense.

341,,Relocation  of U.S. positions to other countries.,2019-02-04,2.0,Systems Engineer,Benefits are satisfactory for U.S. employees,SME knowledge and loyalty not valued by upper management. All to bottom dollar and no communication in town halls to show how company is making the bottom dollar especially when it is by relocating staffing changes out of U.S.
342,,Worst experience I have ever had at a company,2019-02-01,1.0,"Manager, North America Decision Analytics Support",Health care plans are good.,"This place is run in the US in a lot of ways like it's run out of someone's garage. Light on processes, objectives are not disseminated by management, employees don't understand the overall vision for the business because it's not being communicated at all. There are virtually zero attempts at team building or truly educating the members of teams to make them more effective in their roles.

The senior management team claims they are focused on maintaining a high performance environment, but at the same time are unwilling to pay for high performing employees. Senior managers don't listen to the rank and file or front line managers to see if they are clear on the direction they are taking the company or if their leadership is working.

Senior leadership constantly make decisions in a vacuum, resulting in a constant churn of stress and client issues - and problems with employee satisfaction in their roles. In two years of employment I went through three large scale reorganizations and three different managers. Suffice to say that stability is not Experian's strong suit.

Experian also went to an offshore contractor model in the last few years, implementing it in a stupid, sort of plodding one size fits all way. The results have been mixed to poor but the senior management team loves it because the bottom line looks fantastic with all the money that was saved by firing all those American full time employees and replacing them with cheap contract labor (that don't know the job). Experian could be a world class company if they decided to focus less on the bottom line (they are already generating a ton of revenue) and more on customer excellence and employee development. In fact the bottom line would look even better if the focus were shifted appropriately.

Overall I'd say the problem with Experian in the US is specifically leadership at the VP level and above. Over time, the way they are managing the direction of the company will drive the most experienced, senior people on the front line out, and all that money they've saved will turn out to be a wasted opportunity for future gains. Ironically all those managers will probably be gone by the time things begin to fail.

The problem is that Experian sells very specific, proprietary products and services and it takes years for someone to truly be effective creating and selling those products and services. People with the knowledge needed to fill technical roles at Experian do not exist in the marketplace. They have to be trained after being hired to actually do the job working on products and services that only exist at Experian. This isn't well suited to a contractor model, and it lends itself to having higher paid, more technically proficient employees who can learn quickly in order to be successful. Since Experian's US leadership isn't interested in doing either of these things, instead focusing on achieving short term gains at the expense of the long term, I don't think the future bodes well for the company's continued success in the United States.

I'm relieved that I don't work there anymore. I've got a long history working for large, successful Fortune 100 corporations. This was the most stressful, frustrating experience I have ever had working for a company."

There is a lot of collaboration and camaraderie.  The managers really care about their employees and want to see them be successful. 
Benefits- good PTO/ sick/ holiday time off. Nice little perk is that most people work remotely or take time off between Christmas and New Years too.  Gives you some time to regroup for a bit. 
Employee events- external employee events have declined a bit but there are always internal events going on in the office and after work if you are able to attend.","Change (not always a bad thing) but seems pretty constant- reorgs, new leadership, lay offs, internal moves.

Some supervisors play favorites and some employees get  away with doing as little as possible. Recently, around 100 employees were let go due to jobs being moved out of the country or to Van Buren, Arkansas where the pay scale is lower.

I'm not sure how the other 6 were even able to become supervisors.
- What's the point in having a pizza party or a potluck if they don't give us time off the phones to eat? So you're basically still taking calls while trying to eat,
- We were told one thing in training then told the complete opposite when we started taking calls. What's the point in have training if we're told to do the opposite of what we learned once we're out on the floor.
- You get points deducted for dumb stuff when it comes to quality assurance. I got points deducted for something that we WEREN'T taught in training and when I asked a sup they didn't know the answer either, I also got points deducted because I sighed on the phone because my systems went from working to all of a sudden being down. Also got points deducted because I was told one thing in training just to find out when I got graded that what we were told in training was incorrect.
- The systems that are used are trash. They're either down or going extremely slow. 
- You are basically billing, technical support, credit education, and a lot more but that is not reflected in the pay.
- Customers are told to call in if they have certain questions just for us to have to tell them that we don't have the answer. If they call because their score dropped there's no way for us to know what caused it but for whatever reason, the website tells them to call us which results in A LOT of angry customers.
- There's no reason people should be on hold for 2+ hours to do something as simple as getting a password reset, cancel a membership, or update payment which takes less than 2 minutes for the agent to do.
- You have to be dispute trained to move up, which is up to your supervisors' supervisor."

456,,"No trust in employees, extremely toxic environment",2017-03-02,1.0,Anonymous Employee,I can't think of a pro about this place. I guess the location is good if you live in the city.,"Unless you want to be treated like a child and be disrespected every single day, I suggest you run, and run fast and far away. This place doesn't have any trust in their employees or understand that life happens outside of work. Family stuff and doctors appointments happen, but this place doesn't care or seem to get that. Additionally, you must work 9+ hours a day. If you leave one minute before that, you will get yelled at. They also hold mandatory end of month meetings AFTER hours, so on top of your 9 hour day you must stay for these, or again, you will get yelled at like a child. Some of us have families and children we must get home to, but this place doesn't care. I've never seen such an inflexible place of employment in my entire career.

I've never felt so untrusted in my entire career. I always felt like I was being watched. Also a very catty and toxic environment, which starts at the director level and above. I'm well into my career and have never experienced people questioning my integrity until I got to EDQ. In fact, all of my previous employers have always tried to counter me when I gave my notice, so to be treated like a child at this place really says something. I've literally seen so much turnover in my life at one company in such a short amount of time.

My advice is not to take a job here, even if you're incredibly desperate. Something else will come along! It's not worth the distress."

It is amazing to work with colleagues all over the world and at Experian there is a very high degree of cooperation and courtesy.

There is no value for innovation.  There is no respect for people.  This was evident in my 2 week tenure.  My first 3 days, I did not have a computer--and was expected to know what was being emailed to me by HR as if I did.  Your employee orientation lasts long enough to take you to the security guard to get your badge, and then good luck...go got work.  Nobody talks to you.  Nothing like driving into work and sitting in traffic an hour to sit in a cube in a fairly trafficked area, and nobody even says hello.  Ice cold, if you are a people person, this place will make you angry.  I don't think anyone knew I had kids, taught at the University, and did not care to ask.  Never seen a place like this. Don't waste your time on the interview process, this is not a good place to work, no matter how many awards they buy.","This is not a technology company, so if you are a geek.  Go somewhere else--they dont like geeks!  The PC I finally got, could barely run the security compliance software.  I did not even have Visio for diagrams.  There is no trust at all, and no assumption of professional competency.  Pretty much all web sites are blocked. Try writing code with Notepad, I swear they just wanted to frustrate me. Forget about Eclipse, Atom, Cloud9 -- you are screwed!  Lets say you install a Linux Shell and wget an editor...busted.  You cant even install personal productivity software on your work computer.  Think for second, why does a place so anal about security run windows?  Makes no sense at all...how much malware/rats/viruses have been dropped on Ubuntu or Open Office?  Don't walk away from your desk to go workout--forget about work life balance--that is corporate BS too.  When I came back, I had a Kensington Lock on my computer and chair--how humiliating.  Here is the rub, I was not given a Kensington Lock, and when this incident occurred, short of it being a good laugh on me.

The best employees and talent have now left the company to become directors at their clients. It is unfortunate, because there was a time that this was one of the best places to work. Now, if you do 0 work, but spend your time buddying up with management you are guaranteed a nice position and pay. There are several people in management who are of no use, lack the merit, and definitely haven't put in the required work to be at senior leadership level."

Experian acquired Passport so they growth was too fast for executive to conduct quality measurement and performance reviews.

I have several colleagues who have been with the company over 40 years!  That's gotta say something, right?  The benefits here are also pretty amazing. For example, they really value loyalty here, so the longer you're at the company, the more accelerated your paid time off is.  They start you off at 15 accrued paid days off,  and after 2 years with the company, they already bump you up to 20 days off per year - and that's not including the 10 paid holidays and 5 days of sick time either!  You get 5 days of sick time per year with no need to accrue.  It doesn't roll over, but you get it automatically at the start of every year.  Depending on your team, there's a lot of work/life balance with opportunities to work from home if needed.  The maternity leave is also generous here, so it's a great place to work if you plan to start a family or already have one.  They have an employee stock purchase plan that has really paid off, giving employees 15% off the lowest fair market rate, and they match 401 (k) at 4% (100% vested). They even have a 401 (k) Roth option as well if you prefer everything to be after taxes.   I also think the pay is really competitive compared to others in the area.  The campus is also in the heart of Costa Mesa, so you're near a lot of good restaurants and happy hours.  Managers tend to be flexible, and overall, it's a great place to work.","It can get pretty clique-y here with some nepotism if you're not part of the good 'ol boys club.  If you're in management, you work pretty hard for that sweet-looking paycheck.  There seems to be a lot of pressure in upper management, but if you love to work hard or your work is your life, this is the place to be if you're in management.  Progress here is slow and bureaucratic, especially updating software systems.  They could use a makeover here, but that seems to be in the works for the next couple of years."

Recently gave bonuses to new hires and not veterans because they want everyone to be at the same pay rate, mean while veterans have been waiting for a year to receive a new raise.

Want I mean by that is employees are told one thing, i.e. ""it's a company policy"" but I have seen specific examples of male employees having a high up friend, which means that HR policies don't apply.

The writing's on the wall - even new hires are quitting one, two, three months in. Most of the change stems from a poorly executed shift in business strategy & the new director is running the business into the ground. Most importantly, the product use-case is niche, it's littered with bugs and the development team has done nothing to remedy the issues.

The expose you'll get in every position to the operations of a world-class corporate software provider is unparalleled; if you're looking to grow your business acumen and willing to put in the work, this is the place to do it.

Complementary to this, EDQ still maintains a young, fun culture with numerous events, employee improvement sessions (career planning, public speaking, technical training) and options for charitable work.  

Senior management is highlighted in areas with extremely strong talent that is as concerned with your personal growth as much as the growth of the company, leading to endless stories of individual contributors taking their first management roles here, and progressing through the ranks. 

In addition, the structure of the company isn't set in stone.  In my 3 years at EDQ, I saw more than 5 individuals step into roles that didn't previously exist, due to expressed interest in creation of the role or justification in business need and a match to a skill-set.  

Overall, this makes EDQ an unbelievable place to be if you have aspirations of quickly growing yourself, your skills, and your career.","As with any quick growing SaaS company, the work / life balance leans to the former in certain positions, with the caveat that this is often self-induced for career or growth-driven individuals.  This can be remedied through better time management or a talk-track with your manager but it's easy to fall into the ""I can do everything"" mindset as management will let you take on the world once you're proven."

It was a great place to get a foundation.,"The last few years the company has really lost a lot in terms of its culture and engagement.  Employees have been scared of losing their jobs and therefore a lot of talent left the organization.  There also isn't very much room for growth.

Good benefits (401k both normal and Roth options, good health coverage with HSA account option, access to Experian's credit monitoring, flexible time off, bonuses available yearly.)","No trust from upper management
Poor work environment (small, crowded, and loud)
Innovation from top down, rather than getting advice from the technical experts.  Whatever the buzz word of the month is will be what they want to innovate on.
Bonus structure for IT is based on outage minutes globally.  Before initiating this, they had a year focused on dropping outage minutes as far as they could.  Now they expect us to keep up those minutes without any downtime windows.
No clear accountability or responsibility assigned to groups.
Multiple town hall meetings and surveys performed to find out the issues within the company, but nothing ever done to fix them."

I think the company has a bright future & am excited to be on board!","I can't say I would have written this review in 2010 when everyone was just glad to have a job, but this company puts their money where their mouth is and invests in it's employees - as business gets better, so do the benefits.

And then the remaining 50% of the job must be pursued after hours or on weekends. In my group 70 hour weeks were the norm.

Corporate computer systems and technologies are old and don't work well making it very challenging to find the information you need and want when you need it in order to do your job well.  In sales you can spend a lot of time trying to resolve issues with specific products and services that your client has purchased which don't work correctly or produce the expected level of results which hinders your ability to land additional opportunities with other clients.

We've also had some nice additions over the last year or two as well.  Everyone here really is supportive of each other and work-life is taken seriously even when clients really demand a lot.  There are always tons of little events (free lunches) most recently a Thanksgiving lunch and then a Cyber Monday lunch.

Overall a very challenging job day in and day out but if you like challenge and like learning then this is a good place for it.  I don't think there is a day that goes by you won't pick up something new if you are open to it.",Change can be challenging if you don't embrace it and as we've gone through changes the last couple years it has at times made the environment difficult at times.  People don't always see the light when going through change so if you are a glass half empty person versus a half full person this might not yet be the right place for you.

* Contractors quit all the time
* People don’t talk in meetings (fear)
* Jobs are moving offshore (great for US citizen privacy)
* Managers really stuck in their ways

When you start training they will butter you up promising you this and that but when the time comes for you to received what was promised management will say they've made changes to the procedures. 
I'm all for changes but not changes every other week with little training and high expectations.  
The products that the company offer are not effective for consumers. There is more technical issues than actual product services. You'll find yourself trouble shooting on most of your calls. Management/IT has no resolutions for products issues. 
If you plan to be in a company that you can grow in this is not the company for you. Management only promotes friends, it seems like everyone that gets promoted is buddies with management. 
They hardly notice any hard work or any agents going above and beyond what they're supposed to do. If they call you to their desk it's more than likely because they want to tell you how you didn't do something right. 
You get punished for doing something incorrectly when you weren't ever trained on how to properly do it. 

The company looks at you as a number not an person. Everyone is constantly quitting this company. The company turn over rate is out the roof. But they don't care because they'll just hire more agents. There is literally a new hire class every month and half of them are gone before the next month.

Completely oblivious to the fact of having management or business skills ..

625,,Great place for professional development,2015-06-24,4.0,,There are 3 areas in which EDQ excels as a great place to work.  1. The company culture.  It is a very collaborative workforce and everyone truly exhibits the work smart / play hard mentality.   Great people that celebrate success and give back to the community.  2.  Improving professionally.   You will learn a ton and get better every day.  3. You control your own destiny.   Promotions are in your hands more then they are subjective.   Great results will get you a promotion.,Often times there is disconnect on strategy and vision from Sr. Mgt. down to individual contributors.  Or the focus changes within certain departments repeatedly in a short span and this sometimes results in lack of execution until it's corrected/communicated.

It's a business run by financial people who see every employee as a prospective money-saving cut to be made. It's best assets are certainly not its people, as they are expendable. The more you make, the more at risk you are. An example of this was last year's wholesale layoff of people in the NYC office, moving jobs to ill-prepared employees in Costa Rica making a fraction of what the New York employees made. The Costa Rican employees were unprepared, and Experian was forced to make offers to people they had previously laid off. Technology was ignored and not invested in for years, and so Cheetah started losing clients to competitors. With little in-house innovation talent, they were forced to buy a not-ready-for-primetime ""cross-channel"" platform that was panned by Forrester. The Cheetahmail/Cross-Channel Marketing Marketing has not had a leader in a year. Most senior marketing and product development people have left, pushed out or fired over the past 6 months.

675,,Stay Away From Experian NSC - Especially Women,2014-08-28,1.0,Account Executive,"There are definitely some positives. The team, as a whole, is full of outstanding people and are in many cases very good at what they do. The support teams, like sales support and membership, are some of the best people I have ever worked with. I have a lot of respect and admiration for them. Experian as a whole is a very good company. But this does not, and I mean DOES NOT apply to the NSC.","I do not know a single person in the Experian NSC who is happy working there. Not one. NSC Management refuses to be clear about rules and standards, and in my opinion it is because it allows them to twist, bend, or make up the rules as needed to support decisions that actual data would not support, or to single out individuals when they would have to include others if they went by data and clear standards.

I quit recently, but have been told by NSC team members I have a good relationship with that NSC management has either stated or strongly implied in meetings that I was fired. If true, it means that the people you will work for if you join the NSC team are liars, that they gossip like schoolgirls about private, confidential personnel and disciplinary matters with people who have no reason to know. You know how a lot of offices have the person that has nothing better to do than spread rumors? Now imagine that person is your boss.

Not long before I left, one employee got up from his desk in a rage over something he thought another employee did, but which I thought would be perfectly legitimate if she had done it. Employee A, the enraged one, who is large and male, walked over to the cube of employee B, who is smaller and female, and yelled loudly, with f-bombs here, there, and everywhere. With A’s presence between her and the exit from her cube and A’s posture being very aggressive, B had little choice but to endure this. She must have been scared out of her mind and felt very threatened. Surely A would be fired for this, right? Nope, at least not before I left about a week later, and as far as I know he got a slap on the wrist before being sent back to work 20 feet away from the target of his outburst. I don’t know if a warning was issued, because, to my knowledge his case was not discussed publicly. It would be very ironic if management said it could not discuss personnel issues publicly, because all signs suggest they are perfectly comfortable with it. My colleagues expressed to me their belief that A, due to his sales numbers being good, would not be in any danger of being fired. That is speculation, but the near-assault as I described it happened and one team member must have been deeply shaken and intimidated and the other suffered no real consequences I am aware of. If that is because of his sales, somebody could conclude that, in the Experian NSC, if your numbers are good you can harass and abuse others. As I said, I don’t know why it was handled the way it appears to have been handled, but I would not want any female relatives or friends of mine to work in a place where one employee could treat another like that and not be immediately escorted off the property by security.

Now, consider the comfort level NSC management has and the amount of tolerance they have for employees resolving conflicts, real and imagined, among themselves even if it might increase the risk of office rage like the 100% true story above. To this, add crazy systems like inbound calls ringing on everyone's phone at the same time, so individual performance is not necessarily based on superior sales skills, but could be mostly due to someone's ability to keep their finger on a button on their phone. If you work to feed your kids or keep a roof over your head, this is not a small thing. It is deadly serious. If you think your ability to take care of the people you love is being messed with by luck, circumstance, cheating, or other things you cannot control, you may feel a lot of stress and frustration, and if you don't, the person next to you might. This system is what has passed for good judgment at least twice, with two different groups. It obliterates the team atmosphere and gives people a reason to look at their fellow team members as  threats. Especially if they have the severe anger-management issues like the person in the story above, who you will be working with if you join the NSC.

It is commonly believed that if you do break through and have a good year, and exceed your quota, NSC management can and sometimes do raise your quota so they need not pay you. It is also commonly believed that NSC management has reneged on a sales award at least one time. These are rumors, but if management enjoys spreading rumors I might as well let you know what team members have said, since I consider it to be more reliable than what management says. Personally, I believe they are accurate.

In summary, the way I see it, if you join the Experian NSC, you will work for people who refuse to be clear about standards and rules. You'll work with a team that is almost entirely unhappy. You may be subject to harassment, abuse, and intimidation, or possibly even violence, by someone already known by NSC management to have engaged in threatening behavior against a fellow NSC associate. You may sit next to this person, but only if you work in the Experian NSC. You can look forward to having to argue for your interpretation of the rules because others interpret them in away that is bad for you, and NSC management is unable or unwilling to make a clear set of rules that apply equally to everyone. 

I left because I had a disagreement with Experian over what I considered to be unethical practices by the NSC management team that pressured me and others to choose between violating the law, violating Experian policy, or alienating management. Any of those could have put my job in jeopardy. I believe my relationship changed due to my raising the issue with HR, which failed to provide any assistance in resolving it. You can take this as the word of a disgruntled ex-employee if you like, but an employment lawyer I talked to agreed with me, but pointed out that Illinois is an at-will state, so if they can make up a good reason to let you go it can cover for illegitimate reasons that might be the real cause."

Unfortunately, based on some bad purchases and failing technology, management has decided to cut this and laid off a large portion of the client services team and creative team to be outsourced to Costa Rica. Furthermore, those that weren't laid off have been leaving since the outlook of the company is bad. 

There isn't enough support for the technology and what was once a good platform has been filled with issues from long downtime to constant errors. The response time for these issues is lacking which is causing many of the larger clients to be frustrated and leave. Which ultimately led to lay-offs for many employees.

There aren't enough training programs in place for managers to manage their personnel properly. The upper management is so far removed from the day to day aspect that the focus is on pinching pennies rather than supporting their employees. The main aspect CM has for it was it's client service support which is often what propels it against competition. With their decision to cut it's US resources down and to only give top tier clients the same level of service, will affect them in the long run.

As employees, there is currently no job security unless you're an employee outside of the US. The pay is considerably less in comparison to the competition and the raises are on average 3% every year. Promotions that were promised haven't been fulfilled. There's no room for growth. In the past, I would recommend this for new graduates, however now I would recommend looking elsewhere. With mass-layoffs, technology issues and outsourcing of jobs, the outlook isn't good. There has been a mass exodus of employees and management doesn't seem to notice or care. They even tried offering back people that they laid off their jobs- most people said no.

Experian has taken Cheetahmail and turned it into a company without any culture and the only focus on low CPM and retaining clients. Without a strong client services team, this will fail. If you're looking for a job- look elsewhere- Responsys, Exact Target and YesMail are all MUCH better options. Better platforms & better customer service."
681,,"Would be 5 stars if not for the fact that each year the company has layoffs, as often as quarterly.",2014-08-18,4.0,Anonymous Employee,"The main office at 475 Anton is great with schedule flexibility and supports the work/family balance.  9 out of 10 managers are supportive and available when you need them.  Good benefits and vacation allotments.  Clean, newer office and equipment.  Overall pleasant workforce with a 'let's help each other' vibe.  Backstabbing and self-promotion at the expense of coworkers is NOT the norm.  
Experian is ethical in its purported intent and business goals and actively promotes community involvement and supports local and national charities.","Workforce is top heavy with management, especially on the director and VP level.  The company talks about not having silos (i.e. groups that have information that isn't known/shared freely with other groups) yet silos persist and cross group/department communication is poor.   Customer focus initiatives are rolled out with fanfare, much to the appreciation of clients, only to fade away in a year or two due to changes in upper management and/or a lack of accountability from regulators.  
And of course, mass layoffs are routine.  I worked there for almost 15 years, and for the first few years, the layoffs happened perhaps every three years, including the year I started.  The last six years have incurred layoffs every year, with the rate increasing to quarterly this year.  Perhaps this is due to the change in upper management to those with a background in finance: the bottom line for the next quarter is everything (shareholders must see an immediate profit!), and long-term planning is moot?  I guess time will tell if this strategy works or if the talent pool of experienced workers becomes so drained that data quality becomes severely compromised."

Much like Sybil with her multiple personalities, Experian needs to understand who they are and what they want; they then need to develop a good plan for success and to stick with it - not flip-flop and change direction every year.  They also need to quit over-working, under-paying and taking advantage of the decent, loyal, dedicated employees they have left.  Before the end of each fiscal, positions are eliminated and department budgets are cut all to improve the bottom line - but at what cost?  Over my 8+ year tenure, I took on 3 additional positions due to downsizing without any increase in pay.   Promotion to the next job level never came through even though it was the work I was doing for several years.  The expectation is to work more hours (50+ hours p/week is the norm and what's expected) to complete the job(s) at hand which in turn creates a reactive rather than proactive work environment.  Corporate global strategy to create shared services (AP/AR/IT) in Costa Rica, Chile, Kuala Lumpur in order to reduce redundancy across all business units resulted in entire departments to be laid off and outsourced to these off-shore locations.

Experian QAS is a company that has high expectations of employees and looks to hire bright, motivated individuals willing to put the work in to advance their career. At every turning point over the past 4 years, I've been rewarded for my hard work with the next opportunity, including more responsibility, more strategic projects and immense exposure to how a business is run. 

The culture is something I really enjoy - the core values are real and important to the senior management team. People are friendly, and like having fun. You can be as involved as you want in this - for some people, QAS is their social circle; others only attend a couple of events a year. There are lots of ways to get involved at all levels - through committees, community service activities, or casual get togethers.

When I started 4 years ago, it was a pretty formal, rigid place to work. However, over the past 18 months, we've made major changes, like switching to casual dress code and creating more flexible hours and work from home arrangements. Personally, this makes me feel like the senior management team really listens to employees, and will make the necessary changes to respond to employee needs.","This can be an intense place to work - expectations are high, and we often try to do many things at once.

Lots of off-shoring of technical roles, minimal investment in products, they expect to make 40% margins but only invest 2-3% total revenue back into product, hence the decisions based on stock impact.

There is absolutely no trust in the company. No matter what level you're at. The executive management thinks they are leaders, but they don't guide or inspire anyone like a true leader does. They dictate at every level. No one is inspired or encouraged to think.

Finance is chronically understaffed in corporate and most business units (with the exception of the overstaffed semi-autonomous Consumer Direct business unit).

- Heat – if you can’t take the heat coming from the pressure on your daily responsibilities as a sales individual you should pass on this opportunity
- Challenge – You have to be ready to challenge yourself and sometimes learn what you thought you already knew
- Hours – This is not a 9-5 job, this has been said before, but especially in sales, if you want to blow up your earnings you have to earn it

Front-level management cares a little too much and protects the team in an unhealthy manner.  

Fat could be trimmed to make a team run well, but usually isn't.  When folks are cut, they are measured from a political perspective (tenure, friends/ties, etc.) and not what they can provide or do for the company.

No career development.  Teams are built in a very flat manner, which gives team members little room for advancement.  Even if you execute your job wonderfully, there is little opportunity for you to advance since there's a strong feeling that choices for promotions/advancement are done from a political more than pragmatic perspective.

Senior management feels dishonest and when they speak to you, it feels like they're trying to sell you a used car (and not a good one).  Often times, when there are layoffs, executive speeches are contrived, insincere, and leave you feeling like they were just trying to keep rats from fleeing a sinking ship.

I was a newb and I knew just based on how things were running after staying for awhile that it was time to leave. It's no wonder why there are many people quitting.

I loved everyday of my work because I actually loved email marketing and loved the brands that I worked with. To implement things for my clients I got to push the limits of their crappy antiquated technology and learned a lot in that process. Because I enjoy creative problem-solving and fast pace environments, the job was really fulfilling.

Selected few people I worked with were truly some of the best talents I have ever met throughout my career with great personalities. However, some of them have left or might no longer be there as you read this.

Environment is casual, everyone is in the 27 year old range, if you are young, this could be a fun company to work in.

The Experian brand looks great on your resume, good for your next career jump.

Company structure is simple and easy to navigate  (if you exclude the Experian company).

Occasional free food and alcohol can be a plus.

Casual and comfortable environment and dress code.","Complete lack of leadership and strategic vision. I thought the management were very childish and clicky. I felt almost as if they were all still in high school. This trickles down to every aspect of the company, from the way they treat employees to they way they compete in the market. 

Job promotions are done unfairly, not even really based on seniority which I can understand to some extend. They will usually complement a hard worker but the promotion will be passed to someone who is a suck up. Even if these suck ups are horrible at their job, lazy, slack all day and is completely unqualified. You can imagine the cause and effect leading to bad managers and lost employees/high turnover. 

Majority of mid level management are young (under 30) and are still learning to be leaders. This is acceptable if these guys are trying to be good leaders. Problem is most of them think they don't need to improve. 

Profanity, hooking up at company events and expressing inappropriate behavior is acceptable. The most unprofessional environment I have been apart of.

There is no such thing as processes/control/efficiency. They operate like a start up which is a downfall for such a large organization. They company grew but the internal processes remained antiquated which causes a lot of issues and inefficiencies leading to long hours, out of scope projects, angry clients, internal miscommunication etc


Turnover is really high, right before I left, there were about 1 person quitting almost every week. 

Complete lack of training, you will need to figure everything out yourself with no support from your management team. If you make a mistake due to lack of training, its still your fault. If you like to sink/swim in a job, this is the place for you. Otherwise, close this window and reconsider another job unless you're desperate."

Casual dress code.,"Sweat shop, unappreciated and between senior management and very upper management, they will attempt to squeeze every drop of blood they can from their regular employees and are definitely taking advantage of their employees in the poor economy. 

They used to allow employees to work from home, now they are no longer allowed to do so. However after putting in a full day’s work at the office, they put pressure on the poor employees to continue working from home to complete what they couldn’t at the office. This is as a result of a reduced work force. They have no regard for anyone's personal and family life.

The company constantly lies to their employees - a few months ago it was stated there will be no more layoffs as there's lots of work and not many left to get the job done. On 11/10/11, they laid off 10 (+5 from other locations) employees and the remaining ""fortunate"" are now left to do even more work. They are so afraid of compromising their jobs, they wouldn't even consider calling the whistle blower hotline about being treated unfairly. In the company's eyes, they are lucky to have a job.

An employee recently gave their 2 weeks notice w/o having another job lined up, they had enough of the unfair treatment. The company even said they would give that employee more time off and the response was it didn't matter how much time off they received, it was a moot issue as they wouldn't get to use the time off anyways as the company still expected them to work on their days' off.

Another example, Iron Mountain in Addison was too close to do business with but they have 2 major data centers in TX, one in Allen and the other in McKinney. Schaumburg used to be a data center until upper management's ""smart decisions"" deemed it better to have 2 centers in TX.

Not sure how this works but they have sensitive data of US citizens but they have off shored work to their ""Experian"" locations outside the US. I don't know if this data is stored there and/or worked on there but that might be a possibility.

Technical people are now expected to work in the office, at home and on holidays and do what it takes to get the job done and the deadlines completed. The good news is, congrats - you get to keep your job.

There is a lot of favoritism there too promotions aren’t mostly given based on merit but on who knows who.

They react to security issues instead of being proactive and they use the excuse there's not enough money in the budget to implement the necessary security measures, of course they have to pay off their CEO's VP's and share holders; that's of ultimate importance.

It was a great company to work for when the previous president owned and ran the company. Under his command, everyone got the feeling the company cared about its employees. Now that corporate has come in, it feels like a sweat shop and you get the feeling they are trying to squeeze every last drop of blood they can get out of you and absolutely no loyalty to their regular work force."
