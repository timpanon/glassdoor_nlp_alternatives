Middle management is focused on keeping upper management from finding out how far behind and overbudget projects are -- and fighting to avoid upper management initiatives.

Long work hours are expected.  It is management policy to cut costs by using uncompensated weekends and evenings for making delivery dates.  

There is no real career advancement path unless you are buddies with middle management.  FICO will keep you in your narrow job, refusing lateral assignments until they no longer need the position.

543,,Technology Operation Support Engineer  I,2018-07-08,1.0,Anonymous Employee,- FICO is a very good company except CCS Project which is located in MagarpattaCity Pune.,"- I used to worked with FICO around 2 year and would like to highlight some points :

Offer :

- Please do proper negotiation with HR, there is no shift allowance in pune office. Your package has contain shift allowance in it. So please check with HR during negotiation.

Facility : 

- If you ever received  an offer from FICO, first thing you should do is get the Pune City bus pass for a year because cab system at FICO Pune is worst, you would see cabs without fuel , drivers goes on strike and worst part is wrong clubbing. Transport will club you with someone who lives 15Km opposite to you location and ask you to sit first. Just avoid this instances, I would recommend to get a bus pass. 

- Food is not good, you will find  warms, cockroach in your dinner and lunch. Even if you compliant the same there is no one to listen.

Appraisal Time :

- You will find menagers taking 1:1 with employee once they received any email about appraisal period from management. Then they will start assigning you the trainings/courses.
- If you are married person then congratulation, you would get time to time appraisal and good hike.
- Rest of the employee will get less hike, saying your package is good as compare to your experience.

Notice Period :

- Manager will force you to server full notice period, even if you are ready to buy out. In such situation, reach out to you HR. 
- Worst part is manager does not like if you reach out to the HR, because they have made Pune office as their home. Manager will snap you in meetings. I’ve faced so many things during this time.
- Manager will pin point your every mistake, will ping you every minute and ask you fi you are working or doing nothing.

Note: 

- L2 manager is trying to be become a senior manager there, so he is trying to pressurised employee one the floor, he does not even know how to form a good relation with employee. Taking employee out to Bar or pubs and ask them about internal things, is not a professionalism.
- L2 manager has ruined a culture, an environment. You will surely loose many people during this senior manager race."

Great place to go to end your career and collect a paycheck.,"There are a huge number of systemic problems in the GTS organization within FICO. Management is either unaware or uncaring. 

-Nothing is documented; not policies, procedures, or metrics leading to a lack of accountability. 
-Management has provided a rough outline of how they would like parts of the organizations to function with absolutely no guidance on how to fulfill it and a tremendous lack of resources. 
-Aforementioned lack of resources. Departments have been drained by turnover at the engineer level; both ""layoffs"" and a number of resignations. These positions are not back-filled in a timely manner in conjunction with a hiring freeze sent from on high.
-Communication is non-existent from management. There is no clear concise vision of how the organization is supposed to be run or what it is doing at the moment. As I'm writing this on my last day management has still not informed the only other person on my team that he will be by himself starting tomorrow.
-Teamwork is not a word used around here. Lower level managers within the GTS organization are constantly at odds with each other over everything and tell their reports not to speak or help other supervisor's reports.
-Risk-adverse in the IT field. The company would rather throw band-aids at problems and leave things barely functional than to take a risk or expend resources to fix a problem correctly.
-Some departments within GTS allow you to work remotely, some do not. 
-No culture whatsoever. One horribly catered team lunch a month where everybody rushes to grab a plate of food and leave. No team-specific events. No ""goodbye"" lunches. Nothing."

In addition, while the transition to a SaaS business is not easy, a great focus and enablement of products for various industries and customers into the Cloud is well under way to prepare for the paradigm of today's customer preferences and scale for the future.  Though the Company has been around for many decades, the management team and subject matter experts in the organization have prepared a successful business which has and will continue to be rewarded by Wall St.","Investment is at a premium.  Revenue growth is low, single digits and thus the operating expenses are static year over year.  You'll see a tepid investment strategy followed by a purge every 12-18 months.  As an employee, there is a 5-10% job elimination and/or hiring freeze which creates a degree of instability.  (this could easily show as a 'pro' if you are an investor) 

 You'd like to see better communication across the enterprise in terms of strategy with clear goals stretched to each function.  Related, resources are at a premium.  Other companies have implementation, IT, or integration teams or dedicated functions to augment the operating teams.  Leadership assumes a significant double-duty in terms of executing and process improvement which can create challenges on work-life balance.

Fico is a small mid sized company with large company issues. It has a lot of cash reserves and what it does, it does well. It desperately wants to be seen a real player and become a global company but it has process problems, intractable lifer staff, a massive US centric attitude to overcome and niche set of software. 

Fico has remained the leader by simply buying up the competition. It has not grown because there is demand for it's product, nor because it innovates but simply because there is no one else in the space.

FICO does a great job integrating new colleagues and creating a trustful environment. My feeling: Employees are very important to FICO and the company does everything to make them comfortable. Tasks are also very interesting and a challenge in an international environment where Teams don´t necessarily sit together but are spread all over the Globe.

Contracters are treated like 2nd class citizens.  I name one example: I started the same day as another new colleague, she was a permanent hire.  On the first day, she had her emails set up already, her laptop issued to her.. etc.

For me, onboarding took 1 week for a Contractor's employee's profile to be set up. In the meantime, there is no access to anything. The HR support is managed out of India, so they are bloody useless. I had to complain about 5 times via my personal email because I was without email and access to office tools/systems in order to work.  This is the problem with outsourcing to 3rd parties. You must be a very profitable organization to be having an employee being unproductive for an entire week from joining.

FICO employs Glint surveys that highlight deficits in the company culture.  This realization doesn't appear to impact any change.

FICO is always in cost cutting mode.  Employees feel they're always first on the chopping block.  You can read in other reviews regarding layoffs, no pay increases, or bonus pools that aren't funded.  Living in fear of job loss isn't a good feeling.

781,,Disfuctional and sad -- because many people are excellent,2015-10-13,1.0,Marketing,FICO has some good products. Many of the people are bright and capable.,"Several areas to be concerned about.  

1. Many people have been there for 5+ years. They are entrenched in old ideas. They are not progressive in the least. They bring fresh people with great ideas, but the old guard is so afraid to think outside the box, they don't embrace those new ideas. This goes up to the executive suite.....The new members on the executive staff get it...the old FICO people don't. Those new execs are terrific, but it is hard to get the masses to follow along...they just wait for the new management team to leave so it can be status quo....they literally wait them out. This is why things will never change. 

2. They market and sell like a million dollar company. They could be a billion dollar company with their suite of tools, etc, but they don't know how to market past their standard customer list...financial services.  They don't know how to speak to other markets effectively. 

3. They are so caught up in making sure they are the smartest people in the room, as a result,  they worry more about sounding smart than effectively communicated with the customer.  Because they ARE the smartest person in the room -- you can't tell them anything and they have no desire to learn anything new. 

4. Sales teams very old school. They have not figured out the channel at all.  They can get so far direct, but to really make FICO a $B+ company, they need to engage and empower partners. They need to get rid of the old sales dogs who refuse to learn new tricks! 

Lastly, the executive suite (with the exception of a few) is completely cut off from the rest of the team.  To the extent that you have to have a special card key to get into their office areas.  Yep.  There is a locked door between the minions and the C-Suite.  Sad."

817,,Lead Scientist,2015-07-06,4.0,,Great people to work with,Resources and technology are disorganized
818,,Will Grind You Down,2015-07-05,2.0,IT Services,"As commonly said in most reviews, work flexibility is excellent and the technology is at the top of the field. There are still many wonderful, talented staff members to work with; although their numbers dwindle by the week. This last fact has at least put a halt to the annual redundancy rounds they used to have.

Share price is sky-high, if you care about that sort of thing. (The staff share purchase plan was axed about 8 years ago)

Benefits scheme is average.","Pay is generally below market rate, except - perhaps - at hiring. Do not expect raises. Do not expect more than a pittance of a bonus unless you are sales staff. Promotions often involve more work and more responsibilities in return for nothing more than a job title.

The above was perfectly acceptable to most employees in the past, because FICO was known to be a company with excellent products and technology but without a work schedule that would burn out even the hardiest of staff. This has changed over the past few years, but the refusal to pay people for working long hours hasn't. In my area of work (IT Services), overtime is unpaid. On-call coverage is unpaid. Compensation for long, early-AM hours while on call is nil. Again, this was accepted when such things were rare but they are now commonplace.
Because of this, IT Services is in chaos as skilled, long-term staff have fled and been replaced with contractors. 

While FICO is a US-based company, we did at least get the impression that they tried to keep the global workforce in the loop while it was head-quartered in Minnesota. With the move to California, all decision making is based there and even Minnesota employees are out of the loop. Employees are frequently in the dark about even the shortest-term goals.

As has been said in many reviews, operational groups are in silos (white towers, if you prefer). It is frequently impossible to get any coordination between groups unless a Project Manager has been assigned to the task. This is made worse by a culture of acquiring technology through acquiring entire companies, which are then left to operate autonomously for years on end.

The Board is big on ideas, not so much on execution. This is oddly the opposite of the Board in past years, who were good at ship-keeping but had no idea what to do with the wealth of patents, ideas and excellent staff at their disposal. Surely there is a happy medium?"

I'm excited about this opportunity and looking forward to see where it takes me.","As of now, I have no cons to report."
859,,Sr. Consultant,2015-04-17,5.0,,"I have been with FICO for awhile and have very much enjoyed my tenure here.  What makes this a special company are the people, leadership and product offerings.  You get the opportunity to work with really smart, excellent natured and fun people every day!  I've been here long enough to go through a few CEO's and we have never had better strategic direction than right now.  It's great to see how the company is growing and as a result our bonus's have been good.  What FICO does is in demand everywhere!  Credit scores, fraud detection, decision management etc.   Every company needs what we have to offer and it's only going to grow from here.  If you are a hard worker, FICO recognizes it!","FICO is a dynamic company with lots of change.  I would presume in order to keep up with the market and competition.  If you are someone who doesn't like that, it might not be the best place for you."

861,,It's ok,2015-04-17,2.0,Anonymous Employee,"The head of talent acquisition recently sent a company wide email asking us to review FICO on glassdoor so that FICOs ratings could improve, so here I am doing my part.

The pros: the company is doing great.  It seems like every quarter our revenue and profits are up.  The people I work with are great.  I really like my boss and my co-workers.  Our IT guy is probably the most responsive IT guy I've ever dealt with.  He answers your questions fast.","The benefits are a joke:
-401k match is average
-paid time off is average
-Our healthcare plan has a huuuuge annual deductible (several thousands) that we have to pay 100% of before our healthcare plan pays anything.  
-FICO does allow me to contribute to an HSA pretax which is nice but our deductible is waaay over the max that I'm allowed to contribute to my HSA.  
-FICO does put in a few hundred to my HSA ever year, so that's nice
-No employee stock purchase program"

There are opportunities for advancement if you work hard and show initiative.
Executive leaders are more then talking heads, they actually put some thought into how to grow the business.
Generous number of paid holidays.","Benefits, particular healthcare, are poor. Coverage and company match are well below other companies of similar size.
Other compensation, like bonuses and commissions, are low or nonexistent.
Culture is poor. Management talks about the need to improve culture, but doesn't take real action to make culture better.
Various internal departments are territorial with lots of in-fighting, making it hard to get things done.
No ESPP or stock options. Executives talk about how well the stock is performing, but employees don't care because they don't own stock in the company."
863,,Analytic Consultant ||,2015-04-16,3.0,California,"You get to learn a lot of new things, like new programming luggage, project management skill, even another foreign language. Work and life balance is good. It's good for family driven people, since working hours can be really flexible here. BTW, I am still new, so this is just based my first year experience. I will update,if I find anything new.","Some work is  tedious and repetitive. If you like doing the same thing over and over years, this is the right place. And also FICO tends to prefer people of using their own products to process data ,which is not efficient compared to the popular tools on market. Benefit is average level. You do not get anything special."

868,,Very positive first 10 months,2015-04-15,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"FICO has far more going for it than credit scores.  It is a leader in predictive analytics, and participates in a wide range of related markets.  This means a lot of really interesting products and projects.  FICO draws really smart and engaged people.  It is a hard-working place, but very ""grown-up"" with strong respect for life outside of work.","FICO's offices are very dispersed geographically, with three in California alone.  Project teams are frequently spread across the globe, which means lots of conference calls, and some demand for travel, although that might be seen as a plus.  The wide range of activity across markets and products means that getting extended attention from senior executives can be challenging, although the flip-side of that can be lots of autonomy."
869,,Great work environment to work on interesting problems,2015-04-15,4.0,Analytic Science Lead Scientist,"The Transaction Analytics  team in San Diego is a mature group with a lot of smart people.  There was opportunity to work on several interesting projects.  The work - life balance was good.

The group is continuing to evolve internal processes to adopt more Big Data technologies, although the current development stack is not there.",Compensation is only average.  Limited growth opportunities unless you make a significant contribution (e.g. patent / brand new process).

872,,A traditional company pivoting into a SaaS company.,2015-04-15,4.0,Software Engineer,"At FICO it's common to work with big businesses. It's fun to know that your company is providing some of the behind-the-scenes capabilities to enable these household names.

While FICO is largely known for scores, their technology products are pretty diverse and there are a lot of interesting projects to get involved in. While a lot of my work can be somewhat repetitive there are new and interesting problems to solve all the time.

My immediate management is great, very involved and aware of issues--but also providing plenty of autonomy to do my job. My colleagues are also very capable and I very much enjoy working with them.",Salaries for technical positions are a bit underwhelming. Paired with the high deductibles and limited coverage from the benefit package this can really hurt a family. The final significant issue is there can be a lot of red tape to getting anything done and this can be stressful when customers are demanding answers and the 5 different departments involved aren't moving quickly.
873,,opportunities for self learners,2015-04-15,4.0,Engineer II,Fico offers a wide variety of different technologies to work with and learn from as Fico has its hands in a vast array of different fields.,There are no raises and the annual bonus pool is a bit of a joke.  Training is all self guided and you will frequently be asked to work with things that you have no experience and be expected to figure things out as you go.

There's no real time to really hash out the new technologies.  Upper management are too hell bent on rolling out the product that they don't provide the time to go back and fix serious issues before they go live, even though the engineers inform them of such. Micro-management is all over. While on conference call, engineers have been yelled at by CIO. Never a good experience and should never happen."
879,,Senior Software Engineer,2015-04-15,3.0,Anonymous Employee,Contracts with our suppliers and customers have been renegotiated over the past several years.  The resulting contracts have created a great potential for expansion and a need for analytic and software staff.  Limited work from home is sometimes available.  Good vacation benefits.  Decent year-end bonus in recent years.,"As is many corporations, managers are wooed and hired while the production level gets overloaded and offshored.  Project schedules are set optimistically to meet contract needs, but staff is not added to produce.  Significant free overtime is expected and commonplace.

Salaries at hire are good, but promotion below management level is designed to be difficult and pay raises almost non-existent.  A significant number of employees ""boomerang"" out to other companies then come back. 

Project management is very weak and in fear of reporting any problems to management."

There are A LOT of very intelligent folks here, who are very passionate about big data, analytics, fraud, etc. Many of them have PhDs and are not the most social folks you've ever met. This is a company that values direct answers and self management. This is also a company that I believe is going to be better and bigger, but a little awkward right now.","If you succeed, everyone succeeds with you, if you fail, you fail alone. Very little, if any direction from management, or leadership for that matter. There is a lack of communication from leaders, no road maps, and terrible performance review process.

Some international exposure.  Relatively small company  with  well established place (albeit narrow)  /role in the financial domain. Attempts to adopt to the current market conditions.
On a separate note:   the company  might  be a  potential acquisition target.","The efforts to position in the current economic environment lead to wild restructuring events that appear to be random in nature. Good software engineers leave the company.  The emphasis is on the new management with the hope that  they are ""the men"". Unfortunately the past 3 years do not promise much in this respect.  The company strategy is  to keep its place in the financial industry (revenue generator)  and to penetrate additional verticals. It is questionable that the company's software products and cloud based systems and services will produce the expected results."

933,,Mixed bag at FICO,2014-07-24,3.0,Product Manager,Lots of very smart people. Interesting projects. Great brand.

Always cutting edge technology has been utilized based upon the client solution and expectations. Because of this my skill set has always improved and I've been exposed to diverse software. The office culture has improved the last few years with a CEO focused on keeping talent rather than with layoffs. Flexible working hours are a benefit too for work/life balance.,"Stingy with money for the working class employees. It's hard to keep up with the cost of living when during an annual review there is no raise given. Company policy states they don't believe in giving a cost of living increase. Ironically there always seems to be plenty of money for the executive leader's salaries, bonuses and stock options."
935,,Come to FICO learn and leave.,2014-07-05,3.0,Anonymous Employee,"Technically challenging place to work. Cutting edge in some areas and well behind in others.   Co workers are good, helpful and friendly.",Lots of layoffs.  Management by cost cutting only.  Medical benefits are not much better than nothing.  Employes are always expendable when it comes to making the bottom line.  Salary increases are only for the highest performers which are kept artificially low through a quota systems.  Not unusual to go for years without receiving any thing more than small a bonus.

939,,Don't get sick or they will eliminate your position,2014-06-04,1.0,Anonymous Employee,There are some really nice people who work here.,When I got cancer - my position was eliminated.  I was treated horribly by HR.  The office is a rabbit warren of offices where no one interacts and it appears no one likes working there.  It seems to be a large company where no one is excited about what they do.  Their health care is horrible for such a big company and they make everyone do a time card everyday.  Weird weird place.
940,,Way cooler than you might think,2014-05-16,5.0,,"True pioneer and current leader in the ""big data"" and data science space.  
Combines the financial strength of a mature, well-established business with an energy-level and focus on growth that feels start-up-like. 
Leading edge technology solutions that truly drive decisions at many of the most influencial companies in the world.  
Large enough (around 2,600 people globally) to provide resources, stability and a wealth of opportunities, and small enough to allow performance contributions to readily stand out.  
Really smart people working on really important, real-world solutions.","It can be a bit complex for a company its size.  The nature of the business problems FICO addresses are inherently complicated, and the relevance of its solutions spans virtually every industry.  As a result, it can be difficult at times to succinctly define priorities.

* Some nice perks (coffee machines, cafe, wellness benefits, cell phone plan)
* Relatively flexible working hours, though executives do heavily promote working in-office for collaboration purposes.
* FICO's got a lot of very exciting products that are incredibly relevant in the world of big data/cloud analytics.  It feels like a fantastic time to be on board with this company.
* Open-door, honest policy that lets you know exactly where your performance is hitting its stride and missing its mark.","* Some inefficiencies with the constant technical upgrades/changes.  The IT service group is in Bangalore, and sometimes important details are completely lost in translation.
* Not everyone is on the same computer platform, so there are hiccoughs.
* Sometimes it feels that there is a chasm between the Executives and regular staff, but if you are a hard worker, try speaking up -- likely they'll be responsive.
* It's a big company, and it can be easy to feel lost; it doesn't have the ridiculous perks of some of the tech companies in Silicon Valley, but there is a stronger belief in life/work balance that is clear.
* There have been some personnel changes due to the shifting trajectory of the company; this isn't a company for people who want to rest on their laurels and just collect a paycheck.  You need to keep yourself educated, thinking & adaptable to succeed."

you will be surprised at how little work you have to do",you could get a very good review but then get laid off months later
954,,Do your homework,2014-03-16,2.0,Anonymous Employee,"Working conditions at FICO depend largely on which department you work for. Analytics has always been valued and is the best group to be a part of. Software Development is generally not, although some product development groups are much better than others. 

At the San Rafael office, most employees have spacious and comfortable offices. The company recently installed Starbucks coffee machines on each floor and provides free snacks. The in-house café serves good food and the café staff are friendly and responsive to requests. There’s a walking/bike path nearby that is handy for exercising and there are in-house showers. 

Depending on your group and appropriateness to your position, work hours are generally flexible. Until recently, working remotely has also been supported, which has helped tremendously with commute traffic and the odd working hours necessitated by working with a global staff, but is unfortunately now discouraged. Salaries are competitive: neither high nor low.

FICO employees are very bright, skilled, hard-working, and friendly. If you’re in the right group, have a supportive manager, and have a high tolerance for uncertainty and stress, FICO may work for you, but be sure to research the group and position you are considering.","Many FICO jobs have been moved out of the country and employees don’t know from month to month if their jobs will be eliminated. This makes it difficult to make financial plans and commitments such as buying a home or even a car. This kind of uncertainty causes continual stress and anxiety, affecting employee health and attitudes.

Cost-of-living raises appear to be a thing of the past, as are a previous employee stock purchase plan and option awards for most employees. Bonuses, when awarded, have been small. Healthcare benefits are no longer competitive, with the company moving everyone to HSAs and reducing company contributions. It’s difficult to obtain the training necessary to keep skills current due to lack of funding and time. Middle managers no longer have defined vacation, but are supposed to take time off when work allows, which varies considerably based on the opinions of their own managers. 

The performance review system is very competitive and discouraging. Management has said that there are not performance “quotas,” but practically speaking, if a manager of a high-performance team tries to rate all of his staff high, he is discouraged from doing so."
955,,My opinion of FICO,2014-03-05,1.0,Lead Consultant,"Opportunities to travel, learn new technologies","They paint a picture of the ideal job at the interview, once you join everything that they preached does not happen. 50% travel becomes 95% travel, the bonus becomes nothing and the management is incompetent and works on face value rather than merit."
956,,Company is a fraud,2014-03-04,1.0,Solution Integrator Consultant I,"Benefits and pay is good.
If you do not have any career goals and just want make money best company to work.","1. They hire you for one thing and give you something else.
2. Interview will make you feel that something challenging is on its way when it comes to work, in real they give you work which a high school kid can do.
3.Lot of politics and management just ignores these things.
4.No team work no team bonding activities what so ever."

2) Great environment for virtual office workers
3) Great place for junior-to-midcareer sales","1) FICO has been trying to reinvent itself since the Tom Grudnowski era.  Still attempting to do that, and the current Cloud strategy is questionable.
2) Board is sometimes too involved company operations, leading to weak senior leadership.

They genuinely care about the quality of the products they produce.","Seems like the company's focus is purely on increasing stock price through shuffling resources and making announcements to excite Wall Street. Execs seem to have lost faith in increasing stock prices by producing, selling, and supporting quality products. They do not properly fund projects and they lay off key resources, then when projects come up short as a result, they blame the worker bees and do another round of layoffs. The remaining workforce then tries to pull things together with fewer resources and less expertise.

Went with overseas development, which made quality a bigger issue and stretched already-challenged people management process to the breaking point. 
Led to exorbitant sales comp packages and a speedier- than-usual revolving door for sales acct execs, client partners.
Poorly conceived and poorly executed product marketing has demoralized the technical base. Sadly, many customer have come to expect less-than-acceptable product quality, in order to get to FICO fraud detection models 
The new CEO, Will Lansing, has remained well hidden, beyond a few global emails announcing products (which assistants write anyway) and chiding us to pretty-please come to the office and not work from home (even if there's nobody in the office with whom we work...)
Internally, Finance runs the show, so other departments are forced to do their work for them, and woe be to anyone that questions it.

* The FICO name is still respected and good to have on your resume.
* Overall friendly environment.","* Frequent layoffs and unreal attrition!!  Many find a short-term career here and move onto better things.   
* Morale is low, as people are constantly afraid of getting laid off next time. Many employees are secretly seeking positions elsewhere and leaving before FICO can lay them off.
* Extremely weak senior management
* Unrealistic expectations are the norm, company-wide
* Employee ""motivation"" is achieved via threats (""If you can't do it, we'll find somebody who can..."")
* No upward career progression possible if you are a Senior Manager or Director
* Consistent layoffs of long-term, senior contributors still haunt company ... FICO does not value previous accomplishments or exemplary performance
* Widespread executive arrogance - only they have the answers
* Poor compensation practices - tiny or no salary increases year-after-year, even where performance ratings are High/Very High and bonus pool is fictitious
* Bad compensation policy. Unorganized and short sighted management. Anyone who waves a dollar (promises revenue growth that is) at the CEO is taken into the executive team.
* No long term thinking. No emphasis on the strong analytics that was the hallmark of Fair Isaac of the past. Only empasis on sales targets and earnings per share. The blame (and hence the layoffs) is passed on to the junior staff.
* No bonus payout in years!!!!
* Unrealistic expectations from some managers who don't believe in work/life balance. 
* Communication severely lacking in Finance and Accounting. 
* Employee morale is low and shows no signs of improving. San Diego salaries are low compared to the rest of the region. Company is so focused on sales that support functions are taken for granted."

The negative to this equation is that your headcount runs lean.  Management asks a lot in terms of deliverables and output - but rightfully so.

Senior management has no appreciation for the people (tenure, experience, knowledge, performance reviews) and carries out frequent lay offs to meet the bottom line.
Frequent organization changes that do nothing to improve execution or communication, and decrease productivity during re-org adjustment periods
Short term focused company looking only at the next quarter, with no vision or strategy for the long term.
