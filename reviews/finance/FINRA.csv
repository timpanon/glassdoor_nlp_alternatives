Work life balance
Pay - Varies by department but base pay is solid. 
Benefits - Generous vacation policy (19 days off/year, plus additional sick time)
Executive leadership is very communicative about company changes","My biggest frustration is that it takes FOREVER to make any decisions or changes. If you notice a way to improve the way your team works, be prepared to have 62 meetings, send 153 emails, and create 14 different versions of a request document, only for a senior leader to sit on it for 2 months and then reject it because they don't understand your job. Basically, if you are happy accomplishing little each day and just want to get a paycheck and go home, working here is great.

* The org overall genuinely tries their best to improve
* Great retirement benefits","* It's a giant organization and it has the stiff culture that accompanies such an environment. Not much they can do about that, just not my style.
* It seems that lots of people are lifers. There's not much room for advancement in such a situation.
* Lots of the work is just maintaining bureaucracy. It's important work, that furthers an important mission, but it's not hard to imagine yourself as another cog.

That's maybe the worst I can say about the place. It's just work. Sure, it's bland, but it's not evil. It's not grueling. It's dull maintenance."

Management is difficult, a lot of we versus they, where to land the blame.

The work is interesting and important. Executive Leadership really seems to care about the staff and their direction over the past year has just been incredible. The pay is great and the benefits are wonderful. Colleagues are very smart, capable, and driven people. If you have a good manager who looks out for you and ensures that you have great opportunities, you will find the work very challenging and rewarding.","Senior Management definitely sets the priorities and tone for each department, which may or may not be in alignment with the tone and priorities set by the Executive Leadership Team. Particularly in Technology, few women make it past the Associate Director role. The great pay may come with long hours and absent or micro-management. A senior analyst role in one department could have a dramatically different set of expectations from a senior analyst in another department. Overall the experience varies dramatically depending on where you work. It is very clear from the Executive Leadership Team's actions that they are trying to address issues. It's just very unequal right now, and if you have a bad manager or are on the short end of the stick, work is exhausting. One particularly upsetting thing that happened to me - my manager didn't speak to me again after I resigned, and delegated all of my offboarding to another person on my team."

I felt like I was being watched by all of them all the time. My manager would constantly (strongly) hint for me to tell on other coworkers to her every time we had a one on one, but that was just not me. My team was pretty great. Workload was pretty heavy and I would always work overtime on my own time because I could never finish everything due to all the meetings and calls I had to do throughout the day and due to not being fully staffed we would have to cover for other teams. I told my manager that I was so busy and she basically told me that I should be ""lucky to have a job in the pandemic"" because so many other people didn't. I was very thankful and tried my best, to be honest. Also they would fire at least one person each month while I was there and they were people that have been there for 15+ years.

Hard work and results are usually recognized and rewarded with a promotion and a high performance rating. Work can be very interesting if you are assigned to the right cases and/or develop a reputation for being very good at your job.

People complain about the pay, but I didn't think it was bad, especially adding in the health benefits and 6% 401k match. You could get 10% more working at a broker-delear but with much less interesting work and who knows if the company will care about compliance (looking at you, Wells Fargo).","Management is typically pretty bad because they're focused on closing cases and barely focused on developing and supporting examiners. 
Morale in most regional offices is not very good. This is in part due to some employees who are just complainers and low-performers yet think they should be paid more and should have gotten a promotion instead of someone else. This can lead to a toxic level of disdain for FINRA which infects other employees.
Political and bureaucratic. Always scared of SEC oversight yet the oversight never actually seemed to have any consequences regardless of what happened. It probably hurts regional management performance scores, but of course this would never be disclosed to employees why it actually matters."

159,,FINRA's Response to current events has exceeded expectations,2020-07-04,4.0,Director,"1. Response to BLM has been energetic from the CEO through management. After years of platitudes from our diversity HR looks like something is being done about racial inequality. 
2. Equally, FINRA's care for its employees during the COVID period has been outstanding. The teleworking technology has worked seamlessly. Executive management has been proactive about ensuring staff have time for child care, elder care, grocery shopping; we even had a surprise day off from the CEO! We are in no hurry to return to the office, and it seems there will be many additional WFH options as we phase back.
3. We're getting raises to bring our base salaries in line with our industry.
4. FINRA remains a warm, safe, friendly place. The rearrangement of staff assignments and reporting lines that resulted from an internal reorganization have forced former ""frenemies"" to learn to work together, and surprise! it's been a great success.","1. 2019-2020 promotions were given based on ""who you knew"". There remains endemic stubbornness to look outside one's comfort zone. Perhaps as we start putting some meat into our diversity program this will be successfully challenged. 
2. Little interest from new management to learn how successful programs worked before tossing them (but that's typical in management changes).
3. Not really a place for an ambitious person
4. Some fear/risk of embracing and promoting diversity improvement opportunities"

Overall, the culture at FINRA is great. The organization values collaboration, innovation and diversity and inclusion. I've never worked somewhere with so many employee resource groups before! (I think it's up to 10??)

After five years with the company (and one promotion), I can honestly say I still feel like I'm learning and still embracing new challenges. That's what has kept me engaged. Plus, I get to work with some seriously smart people. I'm lucky to be able to learn from their expertise every day.

Another pro in the current environment is that while many financial firms might be laying off given what covid-19 has done to the economy, FINRA  won't since FINRA is most important during periods of greater volatility.","FINRA doesn't pay as much as a financial services firm, but the work-life balance more than makes up for that difference, in my opinion. Not to mention the knowledge that your work is actually doing some good in the world - not just making a big organization some money.

One other con is that if you are at a cocktail party, you can pretty much guarantee that most people will have never heard of FINRA and if they have heard of FINRA, they probably work in the financial services industry and might not want to talk to you."

It appears that most of managers are afraid of upper management and there is bad communication most of the time among departments or even within departments. Evaluations are strict (based on management) and in order to perform on an average evaluation level or above average one employee has to work overtime most of the time. Competition among coworkers is encouraged which creates a hostile work environment with too much stress, again depending on management. Not enough days off, not a secure place to work anymore.

The culture remains highly political and cliquish. Staff pay remains low, while senior management pay remains obscenely high, and opportunities for advancement remain scarce. Employee turnover is high, and no one in management is held responsible for it. Too many firm exams are unnecessary exercises in checking boxes. Too many enforcement actions target low-level reps and small firms, while CEOs of the biggest Wall St. firms skate. Rule-making nibbles around the edges of existing rules rather than aggressively expanding into problematic areas. Management does too much to appease member firms."

- reasonable work hours 
- work exposes you to the broker-dealer industry and is a great way to learn
- solid benefits. remote working available after 1 year.","- toxic culture that starts at the top and trickles down. management gaslights you into believing it's a ""relaxed"" place to work and it seems that way, but it's a frat house environment. There are a lot of big and fragile egos there. 
- toxic environment seems to extend throughout most of the financial (member reg, ofdmi, etc.) groups. Tech seems okay.
- management has no accountability. They can and will blame every mistake on the investigator. 
- minimal room for growth and upward mobility
- to succeed you must ""play the game"", become buddy-buddy with the bosses, worship the ground they walk on, and become a peon. There is no room for dissent. So either keep your head down or fall in line.

They are planning to lay off or push out half of each of most of the teams on the tech side as the aws migration finishes up. Most people on the hardware side expect it and understand it, but the irony is, finra would be better off keeping its technical talent and slicing out all of middle management  and some of the vps. This is a company of too many chefs and not enough cooks—and most of the chefs are ones you’d see getting yelled at by Gordon Ramsey for sucking so bad to extend the metaphor. Finra is full of nontech managers who use their employees knowledge as their own and make technical decisions without discussing with their technical team first. I can count on my hand the managers that are technical and know what they are doing. But, even then finra is company of fiefdoms as well on the tech side. One team builds a tool that is similar to what another team is working on, instead of working together for something bigger and better, both teams waste time building a different version of the same thing!! Even better, the senior management push to get every app in the cloud by a certain date is such a hardline that developers and literally forced to send unfinished apps into prod. They run deployments and literally tell ops they don’t know how to support or run it and this is prod. Core apps are breaking and crashing and those same tech teams get laid off as managers who caused this problem in the first place sit back. Finra is on the cusp of really dying right now. Major contracts have been lost as well—because management is not letting technical folks work together to build a better product."

-Free bottled water in the break room","If you have any self respect, just don’t do it. I’m not sure why some of the other posts are about great work life balance because I was either in the office, on the road or at an airport waiting for a plane. Home was something of a myth. 
There is a reason the examiner position is permanently posted online. It’s one BIG revolving door. I could not believe how many examiners had worked there less then a year. They tell you minimal travel in your interviews then you find yourself living on the road not remembering the last hotel you stayed in or what city or town you are in. The pay is no where near where it should be for all the divorces and fractured relationships it causes. If the recruiter tells you about the big year end bonus, what ever numbers he tells you just cut it in half. Honestly, I felt like I was a trucker and being paid like one. Puts lots of stress on any relationships. Senior leadership/directors (in the LA office) is a text book example of individuals being promoted based on tenure and not on skill set or competency. 

-If you are a single individual that has cats at home with no other human relationships this might be for you. (Majority of co-workers fit this profile)

-If your life aspirations are to audit financial offices and write a lengthy (And I mean LENGTHY) review and then have it criticed by a manager who will pick it apart then this might be for you. 

-If you like having NO Job autonomy this might be for you.

-If you enjoy being micromanaged to a point where you can’t breath with out permission then this might be for you.

-If you like working long hours (50-60 Hour weeks) and not being paid overtime this job might be for you. 



The co-workers at FINRA are nice, but the majority of them have almost no personality. I guess that goes with the audit space. I wish I would have read the reviews before I took this job. I will never get those two years back on my life."

As a matter of fact, I spend 80% of my time creating test data using Excel and 20% of my time figuring out how to work around some internal tools.

Before going to interview, they sent me some information about SDET in Microsoft and let me thought that SDET is a position to write testing framework and that there will be testers to perform testing.

During interview, they asked Java/SQL questions and I thought I probably will write Java/SQL. But in day-to-day work, I don't even get assigned to write SQL because I am a SDET in FINRA AKA Tester. (They don't have Tester in FINRA. SDET IS TESTER) During interview, I asked is there any difference between SDET and Tester; they said SDET will do both development and testing work. In reality, if you are proactive and lucky enough, you will spend 5% of your time to work on testing framework. I am basically a SQL tester in FINRA.

Once I got into the company, I spent a week to work on a 4-year-old / out-dated orientation documents. There was no useful onboard training and on boarding can be really painful for some of the new hires.

It is almost impossible to internally transfer to other groups or roles, though they say you can always switch to another group or roles during interview. That is not the truth. I have already worked as a tester for 3 years and talked with them a couple of times but I don't see any sign that they will convert me to real development role.

They place developers in testing positions and call them SDETs.  SDET in FINRA is not real SDET. If you are a developer. DON'T GO TO THEIR SDET POSITION. CAREER DEAD END FOR DEVELOPER."

-There are a lot of departments and functions, so there is opportunity to explore internally and be promoted within the organization. 
-They try to embrace diversity (at least on the surface) and have some programs that allow minorities to better network and foster relationships within the organization.","-Everything is about politics instead; business decisions are made based on what executive will be pleased
-There exists a significant silo mentality; the right hand doesn't know what the left hand is doing in many cases, which means one's job experience is very much dependent on what department and what manager they work in and for.
-There is rampant micromanagement of employees, fueling employee burnout and distrust.
-There are some extremely intelligent individuals, but in my experience they tend to get ignored when they attempt to bring up innovative ideas to really try to help protect markets and investors
-General communication among the organization is poor; despite management's efforts to change it with expensive messaging campaigns, the district offices seem to be in another world from the headquarters in the DMV.

There are ample opportunities to be creative and make a contribution to the FINRA mission through technology.  FINRA chugs > 50 billion transactions per day and assembles a wide variety of data in support its regulatory obligations.  That comes with many interesting technical and data challenges waiting for smart people to solve.  If you have what it takes, then you can go far here.  There is no shortage of challenging projects, only a shortage of truly talented people.

So what does it take?  Initiative, outside the box thinking, willing to go outside your comfort zone, common sense, and a collaborative work ethic.  Someone who is willing to step out, and maybe step on a few toes in the process, will find this to be an invigorating place to work.  Put in the energy, then it will likely pay off.  If you don't put in the effort and just do your 9-5 thing, you won't get much out of FINRA other than a pay check.

Benefits are good.  401k, healthcare, etc are as good or better than any company I've worked for.  Annual bonus  is icing on the cake.  The pension plan is the cherry on top.  Additionally, FINRA technology offers plenty of opportunities to learn new technologies.

Company should really practice anti nepotism policy because there are many instances of friends and family being hired through connections and even large members of church groups all in the same dept. Staff is overall not professional and most dress like slobs. Too many cliques and staff only hang out with colleagues in same role. Many instances of ethical violations not reported to upper management which are swept under rug so the dept doesn't look bad or to protect employee who is a favorite of manager. Extreme micromanaging where they want the employee to list all of the assignments they've done for the day and report to manager who times each assignment to see if time is used efficiently.

Promotions were based on gender and appearance and had nothing to do with performance. Work was extremely repetitive and the quality standards were ever changing. Performance was measured with unrealistic goals and there was no competition between employees. Fear was used as a way to keep employees in line; say the wrong thing and you risked being terminated. Positions were created out of thin air to give the feeling of a promotion without the pay raise or the title. In almost three years of working for this company my contract was changed 3 times, once to decrease the pay, and two to increase the hours without adequate compensation.

Advice to Senior Management – Stop pretending that you are still in college! It's time to grow up and start treating employees with a little bit of respect. Reward employees for creativity and innovation and stop promoting based on how good people look in the morning. Hire a consultant and overhaul the management, at least within the gateway call center. I would NEVER recommend anyone work within the gateway call center. You'll realize what I'm talking about when you wake up one day and realize how much you hate your life.

I only worked 40 hours, with very little overtime. The company is very loyal to their administrative staff. I felt I could keep my job until retirement. Very secure. 

The compensation for administrative roles are fair, as are the benefits (401K, medical, dental, and the BEST vision insurance). At the beginning of the year, you receive all of your sick leave (72 hours) and personal days (32 hours), and accrue your vacation time (3 weeks to start, and increases yearly) -- which is very nice. 

The Seattle office is centrally located, the office is small (about 20-25) so you get that work-family feeling, the work consistent -- there is always something to do, and the team frequently gets together for luncheons, potlucks, and parties.","In terms of administrative work, there isn't a lot of room for growth if you aren't in NY or Rockville. The District Office's are too small to gain more responsibilities through your career. But if you desire moving over to an examiner level, FINRA likes to hire within.

Depending on your manager - potential for great work/life balance.  I am one of the lucky ones.","Career advancement is almost non-existent if you are not an attorney.  Almost every position has a maximum level of the lowest management grade.  To get above that level, you need an executive in your corner as well as a J.D.  If you have a lot of industry experience, that's great, but it won't get you anywhere.  In fact, several whose only experience is here will take opportunities to minimize any knowledge you bring.

If you live/work in the DC area, your pay grade and salary will be the same as those who live in areas of the country with no state income tax and a rental/real estate market where the average cost is 1/2 to 1/3 of what you will pay.  You will learn to live paycheck to paycheck and your raises even as a top performer will probably not match inflation.  

Titles across the organization can vary greatly.  A ""senior"" in one division is a ""lead"" in another and a ""manager"" in another.  A ""lead"" can be a ""manager"" and even an ""associate director"" depending on where you land.  This makes it very difficult to work across the organization when you encounter title happy people (of which there are many).  Although you may be in the same pay grade and have the same level of responsibility, you will probably be dismissed as they assume you are ""beneath"" them if they think your title isn't worthy.

Although the organization advertises its work/life balance culture, it is 100% dependent on your manager.  Even if you are a top performer, if your manager feels you need to in the office every day (even if your duties don't require that), you will be in the office every day.  If you have my manager, you will be one of the lucky ones, but I have learned that my situation is the exception and not the rule.

Way too many office politics - who you know vs. what you know, and decisions are rarely made in a timely manner or at the right level.  The comments I have seen on here about backstabbing and throwing people under the bus is pretty accurate depending on who you work with.  I have seen some of the worst offenders win big awards...amazing how well that mentality works for them.

If you travel for the company, as many do, you will be subjected to policies that often don't make sense.  Make sure you follow all the policies and guidelines to the letter or you may just be paying for dinner or ground transportation out of your own pocket.  Spending guidelines should be cumulative.  It encourages us to save money for the company, and if we are in our second week on the road, we may like to have one really nice dinner and not be penalized for it - especially when the other 9 days we came in way under the guidelines.  Keep in mind that making us fly home every weekend generally costs the same as allowing us to stay, but keeps our morale high if we have that option as it lessens the wear and tear on our bodies."

551,,Stuck in a hole I can't get out of.,2013-04-05,1.0,Regulatory Analyst,The benefits plan is probably the only thing FINRA has going for it (I wish I could say the same salary-wise compared to other comments posted on here).,"I don't even know where to begin.  Little things like our technology platform are sorely lacking.  We are also sitting on a decent amount of cash and yet I don't think my bonuses have ever been anything to brag about.  The pay structure/grade system also could be a bit more generous.  If you want to attract and keep talent, pay them what they're worth.  A simple concept that's missed by the bigwigs who run things from on high on K Street.

Senior Management appears to be pretty misguided and/or clueless at best, but most likely apathetic.  There's no career guidance, let alone room for advancement.  In my case, I came to FINRA as a recent MBA grad who already had five years of industry experience.  Little did I know that FINRA prefers to hire freshly minted law school grads with no job experience, period, and virtually no industry experience other than what one can read in a textbook.  We're supposed to be regulating the financial industry and those who have industry experience are somewhat frowned upon instead of being used as a resource.

I have been with FINRA for five years, and have tried to transfer to different departments solely in an effort to gain more experience in different functional areas (we are way too silo'ed, if that's a word).  Sadly, I was told by various HR reps that my resume was deemed ""too light"" by hiring managers for those positions I applied to, although the positions I applied to were well within my pay grade, or the next level higher.  When I've tried to fight to get promoted to the next pay grade in my current role, I am told that I was passed over but to ""keep doing what you're doing"".  Probably the worst career guidance I've ever received.  So if you do the math, I've been here five years with no promotion ever earned, yet I've seen my department hire tons of law school grads, only to see them walk out two years later and replaced with another law school grad.  Meanwhile, those of us who been ""loyal"" feel like we get crapped on constantly.  I think the philosophy of my department is to replace the bodies once they go cold.  

In short, this company is run by lawyers who appear to just backstab each other in order to get ahead while playing C-Y-A doing it.  Meanwhile, the Analysts who are loyal suffer and the morale in the office just sucks.  I now find myself in a position that I can't get out of, with a unique skill set that, since I am not a lawyer, does not help me in my job search/career development."

554,,Unbelieveably bad!!!,2013-02-25,1.0,Human Resources Analyst,"super salary, obnoxiously rich benefits (I can probably retire at age 50), no one watches what you do and you can easily disappear into the woodwork--the checks still get direct deposited into my checking account!!","Where to start... bloated, inefficient management.  Backstabbing galore.  Eveyone is out to throw each other under the bus, especially in my department.  Many people pad their expense accounts in my department, and no one is the wiser.  Makes you wonder how sharp we are as a regulator.  The general public simply would not believe some of the backwards interpersonal relationships senior management has here with each other.  To make matters worse, in Rockville, there are snakes in the pond behind the building, and they slither around the employees who go out at lunch for exercise.  Such a metaphor for what goes on inside the building."
555,,Get out of dodge,2013-02-23,1.0,Examiner,"Benefits and work/life is pretty decent.  Great way to learn FINRA regulation and network within the industry.  Given regulatory and industry changes in the US the technical skillset is probably less valuable than it was twenty years ago, but is nonetheless valuable.  `","The organization moves at a snails pace and so does your opportunity for advancement.  Its so heavily matrixed that getting visibility, and recognition, for your achievements from the people that matter is next to impossible.  Moreover, although there are a fair number of great people to work with, there is also a sizable amount that are truly wretched.  Some of the most miserable and incompetent people that I have encountered in my career are employed by the firm.  Get out after 2-4 years."

561,,A very negative culture dictated by upper management.,2012-12-22,1.0,Principal Examiner,A great place to learn a lot about regulations and the financial services industry provided you can find someone experienced to train and mentor.,"There is a lot of backstabbing, dirty politics, bullying and discrimination dictated by management.  Little opportunity for advancement.  Since the merger, the company has been aggressively forcing experienced people out, losing expertise and talent.  Most of the good managers with technical experience who cared about regulations are gone.  On paper, company looks great, in reality it regulates by ""smoke and mirrors"".  The company is a “sweat shop”."
562,,Weak culture and generally low morale; not the best place to work if you want a well-defined career path.,2012-12-12,2.0,Current Employee,"Excellent benefits. 

Incentive bonuses (although, I'm not 100% convinced these bonuses are awarded on merit; I have a suspicion bonuses are doled out by popularity/likeability).

FINRA seems to be moving towards creating a more diverse place to work (e.g., recently expanded employee resource groups, including the PRIDE Alliance for the LGBT community, as well as groups targeted toward other minorities). The CEO plays a *very* active role in driving this much- needed change.","FINRA is RED TAPE CENTRAL. You can't get the simplest tasks done without multiple approvals; it takes a long time to do anything because there is so much bureaucracy. 

The HR department is pathetic. I am greatly dissatisfied with the lack of encouragement and opportunity for advancement. HR does not have job descriptions readily available/easily accessible to employees. 

FINRA Technology is a joke. They are WAY behind and need to catch up with the rest of the world, especially when it comes to remote access, server/storage space, hardware refreshes, and staying current with software versions. They recently banned web mail for bogus reasons and block most social networking sites (which doesn't make sense to me since a lot of fraud and other valuable market info can be discovered/researched with these platforms).

FINRA does not encourage alternative work schedules like telecommuting or flex days. They might pretend this sort of flexibility is existent but in reality, you have to jump through hoops to get permission. It would be easier to sneak into the White House."

Pay while not so generous is good for the amount of work you need to do.,"Management in my particular department, from middle to senior, is very out of touch with their subordinates.  In addition very few of them are willing to put themselves on the line to make very much needed moves to push the company forward.  Garbage in garbage out is too often the way our surveillances are run, but no one in a position of authority tries to rectify these obvious issues.  Passing the buck seems to be the M.O. of most of management here.  I have never worked at a company where there is such rampant C.Y.A. in action.

The lack of a true meritocracy system when it comes to rewarding hard work tends to ensure that most employees will not give their best effort once they wise up to the way things operate at the company.  The underperfomers make out the best because more often than not, the high perfomers end up pitching in to make up for the underperformers ineptness to help meet departmental goals.

Work progress moves at a snail's pace, and more often than not, very arbitrarily.  It's not uncommon to bring investigations close to the finish line and then have it sit an additional several months with management before it's closed.  Management is definitely the bottleneck.  I say this sarcastically, but it seems like once you get to be a manager, you are obligated to ramp up your laziness exponentially."

The tech side is not shown any respect. Most of your coworkers will be H1Bs who are treated like livestock. Turnover is high. Morale is low. I can not recall a single time someone in tech was asked for an opinion by management. New policies and technologies are introduced without buy-in from the support people by people who have little to no understanding of the technology or what it is used for. 

Some departments grow even when the workload stays the same. Additional employees are used to push paper around, slowing down other departments. There is a lot of political infighting between departments. Management added two layers of bureaucracy in my time there. Most employees must fill out two timesheets each week, some fill out three!"
