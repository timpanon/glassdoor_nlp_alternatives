There is constant effort to get you up to speed and they have an open office culture which encourages you to reach out to almost anyone in the business in your learning journey. Support is great one does not have to feel their way in the dark, the lights are always on and there is someone holding your hand all the way.
Management style is very transformational and not transactional. They encourage innovative ways of doing things thus change is never seen a risk but an asset. Working hard is coupled with being smart at doing your job. Excecutives are approachable there is very little disconnect between the levels of business. Personal and Professional Development is encouraged constantly. There is care for your wellbeing personally and professionally. Huge brain power to leaverage from.

The Sr Leadership team are a stereotypical set of ""good ole boys"" network who get issued private stock in FNZ solely based on how well Adrian likes them. I regularly was forced to work 60 hours a week with no appreciation at all. The company hires a lot of Uni grads and then they work them to death. Morale there is always low, unless you’re one of the few wealthy few who get company private shares and special $ treatment from Adrian Durham.

This company might be worth big money now, but the public needs to know that working for them is like the movie, ""The Devil's Advocate"". Adrian Durham is really angry human being who treats his employees like yesterday's rubbish. The world needs to know this as money isn't everything in life. Right Adrian? 

Adrian was even caught threatening an employee's life on a group email when the employee refused to work 60-70 hours a week (with no overtime/time in lieu earned) in order to get a high visible project that was failing to get over the line.

This place is to be avoid all costs. Don’t like an initial high salary lure you in. They’ll suck the life out of you and you'll certainly never have a work / life balance working for them."

Excellent global opportunities if asked you can be permanently moved to your desired location.,"Not at all a supportive environment. Everyone works like a robot and not concern about the team members. No one works as a team and if someone has to ask something then no one is really open to teach and make their teammates grow. If you need any help in work then they will just snatch that work from you and give it to someone else. Not at all people-centric, they do not value you as a person. Always over commit to the clients and hence a lot of overtime is needed. No work-life balance at all. They say it's up to you if you want to do overtime no pressure at all but then this overtime is not being paid a monthly salary and is being promised to be paid with the annual bonus, which means you get your annual bonus if you do overtime(absolute ridiculous policy). Unrealistic expectations and not tailored from person to person. Your opinions and voice is never appreciated and is suppressed by people who are working with the company for ages."

66,FNZ,"Stimulating and challenging place to work, surrounded by motivated people",2021-08-13,3.0,Solutions Consultant,"Lots of variety in terms of the work the role allows you to focus on, with one seldom feeling as if they are just following set processes. Given the multi-dimensional nature of the FinTech industry and the offerings of FNZ as a company, the work is constantly challenging; in part due to the multi-faceted nature of the items being worked on. This can be a double edged sword, as in certain roles you are constantly learning and not bored. There are an abundance of interesting people to learn from. Most staff are approachable and eager to help, where time permits, so there are great resources all around you at all times. There are some very intelligent and talented people working here. 

The company has adapted well to the work from home initiative, as a result of the covid-19 pandemic, broaching home work conditions and equipment requirements early on in the process. Being almost purely digital, in terms of role requirements, the majority of functions were able to transition pretty smoothly (in part due to the dynamic nature of the company itself and the senior management). 

This is a very exciting company to work for, with rapid expansion underway. The timeline for global reach enhancement is pretty impressive, with there being a very clear vision from the CEO. For anyone willing to stick it out and make the most of the opportunities to learn and develop both professionally and personally, this is potentially a great company to work for (from a Solution Consultant's perspective - clearly less diverse or stimulating roles might be quite different in terms of opportunities).","There is always a lot to learn, in very small time frames, given the lack of resource. One constantly feels like they are on the back foot. This is the perpetual Achilles' heel of the company, particularly in the project/client-facing functions, where analyst-type staff are moved around in order to plug holes, wherever they crop up (and crop up they do, on an almost daily basis). 
Again, on the positive side, this allows staff to get exposure to a broad range of different client projects and various platform functionalities (which might otherwise never been broached). 
However, to the contrary, this directly translates into long hours and the need to work weekends (often doubling your contracted working hours), in order to meet client expectations. The fallout from the collision of responsibilities is often in the form of failure to meet deadlines, which is hardly ideal. Although, in the end things tend to get ironed out and expectations are met (albeit somewhat revised at times). 

Compensation very dependent on the path you are set on, and not necessarily down to individual efforts and aptitude. The business of certain clients is obviously more valued than others (usually tied into the size of the contracts, and the AUM potential/for future business); this entails that those on the key projects tend to learn the most and be compensated the most (as the company cannot afford them to leave their project teams, due to the potential detriment to client relations). 
The result is that those who have not been put on such a client project are often bounced around more, as they as a resource are less vital on their own projects. This both means they fall behind in terms of their own client work and potentially upset these 'smaller' clients. 
These people are resultantly often less developed, due to not becoming SMEs in a particular platform and are paid significantly less than 'key' peers."
67,FNZ,"Great employees, terrible management",2021-08-09,2.0,Analyst Developer,"Paid overtime with extra incentives for working over the weekends, 
Very helpful colleagues and overall great collective,
Above average work benefits (7 sick days, contribution to purchase of office equipment when working from HO, ...)","Senior management makes promises to customers without considering whether the company is capable of delivering on them. FNZ is severely understaffed for the ever-expanding number of clients. That results in extreme pressure on the employees and the work quickly devolves into frustrating loop of impossible deadlines and overtime. Overtime work is very often part of the planning and employees encounter intrusive and repeated requests for working late and over the weekends. This happens pretty early on in the development cycle, so crunch periods can last many months before the actual production release (sometimes with insane ""one last push"" narrative going on for weeks).

Since everything needs to be done at breakneck speed, there's almost no time for proper documentation of the processes. Developers often need to piece together information from various incomplete notes. Considering the pressure from management to finish work quickly, this is highly unpleasant experience.

Developers are moved around the various projects. They are expected to be immediately productive (since in the eyes of the management this is supposed to save delayed releases) even though not all of the projects are using the same architecture or even the same technology.

Management rarely listens to employees that point out the problems and suggest realistic ways to overcome them. Many genuinely great ideas for improvement are cancelled because they don't bring immediate benefit.

I would be sceptical about the positive reviews here since employees are asked to write them very early after being hired when a lot of the company's problems are not apparent."

•Progression is promised then moved away just out of reach for months at a time to keep you killing yourself for little to no reward
•End of Year reviews mean little as they don’t link to any pay rise bonus or progression e.g you can get a 1(outstanding) and it is just that 
•Massive expectation to work OT no matter the cost and if you do not you are dragged through the mud for it
•Training is 100% on you which is good but not when you are being asked to do a job in a team that is very understaffed do not get 30 mins in a week to yourself

- employee assist programme

- opportunities to relocate to a wide choice of countries
My experience at FNZ to date has mostly been very positive. The company embraces diversity and the team are all friendly and helpful. I have been given plenty of support and encouragement in learning my role and enjoy being a part of the organisation.","There are times when the workload is full-on and you may need to put in extra hours. The company does not pay overtime as a rule but it can be approved if the overtime is deemed necessary. 
If you don't put your own limits on how many extra hours you are prepared to work, no one else will (and no one may necessarily know how much extra you are putting in)
There is a very strong focus on productivity measurement. This needs to be the case to a degree because of the huge amount of flexibility we are given. However sometimes the measurements being used do not take everything into account and it can feel like an uphill battle to try and achieve those goals. In saying this, I believe the company is working on improving this system."

There's been heaps of opportunities to learn new skills (even for someone with little technical knowledge starting out), gain experience on new teams, and there are always opportunities popping up to relocate or try out new roles.

Opportunities - when I joined I believed that promotions would be merit based, but a promotion requested by superiors over a year ago was and is still being held up somewhere at the top, others are in the same situation. There is really no process for advancement, despite the CEO's promise this would arrive during the early months of this year (perhaps he meant 2022 though).

Overall the culture is toxic, employees are seen as slaves, some clock around 100hs OT a month just to cope with the workload, but the company will not recruit enough people to fill in the vacancies.

Instead it feels like it regards the entire Operations department as a burden that can only be released by automating it away, and somehow make it in the meantime with less people, pressuring them into OT.

After 1 week in the company I was asked by HR to add a positive review on the glassdoor, this is really a bad sign so I skipped that, and now I know why, after more than a year in this pseudo corporation where people are used like a slaves, mobbing was present on the daily basics, mostly by delivery managers who were pushed by senior management. It was so overwhelming I could barely keep up with anything. I had to recover from that and if I had to choose between going back to my ex gf with borderline vs working in fnz once more I would pick the first option. 

Your manager does not give a damn if you are working 8 or 12 hours a day, or 14, or over the weekend.. once I complained I got the answer about no-can-do because it is how it is and the DMs are responsible for setting up the goals on the current sprint which was basically putting everything in one basked praying the overtime will do the job. It did not work out at all. 

Tedious job, old stack, front made in ancient technology and backend too, say my name (VB). Tasks were written in one words, spending enormous amount of time figuring what's actually happening in the code. No documentation.

Once doing a task it mostly lead to waterfall errors everywhere, slight change was causing the entire project to crash, no github but some ancient accurev which was lagging af, creating a pull req took sometimes half of the day. 

Because everything there is based on the ancient legacy crappy backend new products does not matter how hard you tried, it was just bad product all over again because built on the unsolid ground.

Anyone not working the weekend is accused of not being committed to the project, even if they have been working weekends for months on end. People are moved from team to team on a weekly basis which means constant context-switching. After a team has estimated a whole delivery of work, the CEO himself logs into Jira and reduces story point estimations. Clients are paying for specific team members without knowing that those devs/testers have been moved to a different client's project, and managers are forced to lie to the clients to hide this fact.

High pressure on overtimes (poeple have cca 30 hours a month).  If you have under 10 hours per month, you should work hadrer because it is no fair to your colleagues who do more.

Some managers miss soft skills. Important thing is that the higher management will be satisfied, no matter on the lower stuff.

People keep leaving the company with no replacement coming (no hiring is happening). The number of clients is increasing and the additional work is be split between current stuff. 

Salary reviews almost didn’t happen. When they did the pay raise was riddiculous (cca 500-1000 CZK after year). The difference between senior (with extra responsibilities) and normal officer was 500 CZK.

After applying to different possition going through 3 rounds, HR didn’t even bother to tell me the results of the internal hiring. No feedback ever received.

- There is no assesment procedure, either you are good at your job or not, it is the same for them. The only reason why they will raise your salary, is because it will be lower than average in the team.

I have been in FNZ for over 8 years and have been given the opportunity to grow my career and help to shape what the future of FNZ looks like. This is something that is very rare in business in modern times so if you are looking to really drive your career and put all your energy into it, then you will be rewarded and recognised for that commitment. 
FNZ is a fast paced place to work and yes there can be long hours involved depending on what projects or roles you are involved in but this allows you to really stamp your mark on the work you undertake.
The company is very flexible and has a very clear commitment to supporting its employees through good times and bad, so for example, there are wellbeing sessions including yoga and breathing / mindfulness sessions weekly to support mental health. 
FNZ is a large family , you are not just a number as is the case in large corporate environments and everyone looks out for each other and willing to help when required.
I always wondered in 2020 if i could find a ""job for life"" and in FNZ i have found my ""employer for life"".","Working hours can be long yes, but the very fact you can drive your own career path turns this from a con into a pro."

The general attitude towards work seems to be, work hard and you won't be overlooked and there is an emphasise on 'you get out what you put in', which to my mind seems a fair expectation for their staff.

Team members have been very friendly and welcoming and happy to help.

Management has been positive and motivational.

Management are aware of the current impact Covid 19 can have on their staff and regularly encourage their staff to look after themselves and recommend wellness courses and resources available. 

There is good company wide communication - regular updates are sent to staff and there is a designated portal with plenty of information, staff testimonials and interviews with higher management.","Lack of bonus or incentive scheme.

No real staff benefits other than the opportunity to progress and develop within the company.

Healthcare is minimal unless you contribute from own salary to increase entitlement."

- Unresponsive HR
- Bad management - if you don't speak Czech, expect all meetings to be in Czech anyway. They will switch to english for 2 minutes when you ask them to, and then go back to Czech again.

- Meeting a whole team in a project can take time and seem daunting, leading to newer starts both only meeting people as they ""need"" to, and being mistaken for knowing who to talk to regarding specific issues.
- The developer training program is a good overall look at FNZ code, but still projects can all have their own unique quirks that can take a bit of time to get used to.

I could go on for ages but time is precious and there are lots of companies out there looking for high quality graduates, quite simply do not choose this one. This is not a good place to learn. The structure of the scheme is terrible, you get placed in a team who is under staffed and are set to work on a task which is basically dealing with low level exceptions from a system that is flaky to say the least. There is no formal training or supporting documentation and you are taught by an existing, usually demotivated employee, who has their own job to do so they have very little time to invest and the majority of learning happens through your own mistakes for which you are berated by your “manager”. I use the term manager very loosely as there are no development discussions and you feel like your are interrupting them. The culture is toxic and there are various former grads strewn around the office still in junior roles who will happily share their experience which is unsurprisingly very similar to yours. The more senior roles are mainly held by lifers who have no ambition to move because of you do you lose your security.

The experienced employees are great to work with and go the extra mile to help the wider teams.  The newer graduates are highly intelligent and eager to learn.","Despite the fast pace this often doesn’t transition across to rewarding employees.   There is no overtime but you may get an incentive payment at the end of a project, however this is not guaranteed and may just be a token payment.

You might end up fixing bugs for months rather than developing something new"
257,FNZ,FNZ: an arena for growth,2019-10-31,5.0,Operations,"Growth and comfort rarely coincide.  If you want to grow, you have to endure and persevere.

Earlier in my career, I had the chance to be a part of big, established firms where you get hired and everything is 'clear-cut'.   Very little room for growth.  Minimal chance to be creative.  No chance to redefine your role and explore possibilities.  Flat.  Not that definition and clarity is not good but if you are someone who works well under pressure and aims to push the boundaries of personal/professional growth, FNZ is the place to be.

It is relatively young compared to other players in the industry but already paving the way to success.   Imagine being a part of that; growing together with the company.   Seeing how improvements are put in place or even being a part of the solution.

- Overtime hours can be horrifying. 50 hours per month sometimes is not enough

- Trainings are chaotic; Trainers could be experts, but lots of them just can't explain 

- Communication between the Edinburgh office and Brno is absent in many teams

- Many positive reviews on Glassdoor are unfortunately made either by HR or by people who have been politely asked to do so by management

Company team-buildings take place every Friday, grab your pint after work and chat with head of local branch informally, if you wish.  Based on my previous working experience in big corporations (13 years) FNZ is so much different:  it lacks bureaucracy, hard work does not go unnoticed, improvement ideas are welcome and supported, there is no micro-management, and common sense prevails over processes.

Staff are given clear outcomes to achieve, and get the autonomy to deliver them -  At all levels.  The culture is great; everyone is highly intelligent, very friendly, social and genuinely kind.  Coming into FNZ can be a little like diving into the deep end for some, but everyone is very willing to help.  

FNZ is growing at a rapid rate, and successes are continuing to accumulate with no plateau in sight.  It is a very interesting and vibrant place to work, with plenty of opportunites to make one's role their own, and shape it as they see fit.  There is always plenty of change at FNZ across all areas, so it is definitely not a dull or stagnant place to be.

There is not always a clear objective to client meetings, meaning you can sometimes attend these rather blind.
More attention to other departments is required when taking on new business as things seem to get agreed before the teams involved are actually notified about it.

2) If you put in the graft and make sure people at the top are aware of your work, you can be immensely rewarded.
3) Collegiate and flat structure - most senior leadership team members are happy to be challenged - but make sure you have a strong argument to make!
4) Visionary founder-CEO who understands the market (including in different jurisdictions) and where it is moving next.
5) Private equity backed - high performing staff can be awarded slices of equity in the business.","1) FNZ has not been the best at recruiting senior management personnel who are able to cope with its high growth stage - this has resulted in a relatively high of turnover at that level which results in wasted costs for the business.
2) Lack of competent people in some areas, which slows down the business as certain streams require the expertise of a small number of knowledgeable staff who inadvertently become bottlenecks.
3) Can be gruelling and not for the faint-hearted sometimes, for example if the workload is a lot but there is no one to support you, taking ownership may mean long hours for days or weeks. This is not a place where you expect to work 9-5 every day, but at the same time it isn't a sweat shop all year round.
4) No formal appraisal and reward process in place - but this is currently being set up by HR so hopefully will result in better morale for any unheard voices.

Great opportunities to actually make a difference both internally to FNZ but also to our customers and their end investors.

Immense number of very intelligent and vastly experienced people who are happy to provide mentor-ship enabling personal and career growth. 

Ability to gain experience in a number of different areas and geographic locations, there is no barrier to growth for a dedicated and driven individual.

Flat organisation structure, every voice is heard. If you have a well thought through and structured opinion, be it positive or negative, you have the ability to raise this at any level and actually be heard.

Team ethos, most people at FNZ work hard (both in terms of time and effort) the result of this is a great support system in the team you are working with. In FNZ you will find that most teams are very close and both work hard and play hard as a team.","No formal mechanism for receiving constructive feedback to aid development.

Lack of structure and stability in career development, there is massive potential for career development but it must be grabbed rather than individuals having a path to work towards which can often be demotivating for those that don't have a clear idea on where they want to be heading or understand how to get there.

Significant disparity in salaries for similar roles / levels. Salaries reflect how important an individual is at a given time and not necessarily the overall contribution to the company. This leads to some individuals being on massively inflated salaries which demotivates peers on a similar level"

Dynamic - Based on the speed of growth, workers are required to be flexible and dynamic with their approach to work. Management is more than willing to accommodate staff needs to make sure everyone's needs are being met.

Opportunity - Firstly, the speed at which FNZ operates at means that there are new roles being created often and along with internal promotion it is not hard to find yourself progressing internally. Secondly, FNZ is a global company with many officers located around the globe.  There are opportunities to relocate globally with FNZ.

People- There are some really intelligent/funny/diligent people who work at FNZ. Most people are willing to share knowledge or have a general chat about whatever.

Culture - Very accommodating for all staff. There are many different groups within FNZ, so there is something for everyone. There are social events throughout the year, which creates a 'work hard, play hard' environment.","Ownership - Some specific business units fail to take ownership of specific business functions.

- Culture, so when something is unachievable (actually a lot of simple things such as branching, in time code reviews, reading test reports, using jira boards, using jira as your primary source of truth, code style, test automation) they say: ""well, this is FNZ"" or if Glassdoor ratings are too low to hire new people it's  okay to ask HR to write some anonymous reviews (check rating trends and you will find out that ratings were improved from 2.1 to 3.5 in just 2 months compared to much longer period of very  negative ones, they call it magic) or when your CEO thinks out loud that all eastern Europe employees are lazy or when you supposed to have town halls on a monthly basis but you had just one per year or when you are just a number (if we have a developer that can fix one defect per hour in a particular project, then it's not a problem if the same developer will be asked to fix a defect in a totally unfamiliar project with expaction that it will take same hour) or in order to have a pay raise you need to put your resignation first
- A lot of areas that waiting to be improved, but nobody really wants to do a thing about it until a client bites them in the аss with very rational questions.

Ever growing global portfolio of business affords fantastic opportunities for individuals to improve into a variety of roles in a variety of locations.,This is no 9-5 but growth opportunities and hard work go hand in hand!
380,FNZ,Challenging environment with plenty of opportunities but not for everyone,2019-03-21,4.0,Lead Systems Analyst,"Working in FinTech can never be easy as you can never be on top of the market changes, regulations or customer expectations and this is something that people forget when getting into the FNZer experience! Like in any other company we need super-people that can stretch, go above and beyond, think out of the box and never stop.
Quick expansion and high growth cannot be obtained if people are chill, it really requires efforts and continuous hard work and as the company is still growing there are always changes and attempts to do things differently with the failures and successes that come along.  
But, with this being my 5th job in IT I can definitely say that there are pros in working at FNZ: 
 - It is a fast paced environment requiring you to give your best every day, learn continuously, challenge yourself and others.
 - You can never get bored (at least in some of the departments) as the tasks vary, allowing people to experience new things and many times find their cup of tea. Cross team movements, position changes and people doing things even outside of their role description or experiencing new challenges is pretty common. 
 - If you are a person that likes challenges and self-driven it is easy to find your way: anyone can become top performer and be rewarded, become an expert in certain area, get a management position.  You do not need to wait years for a promotion nor have to have certain previous experience or go through a lengthy process to move forward. 
 - The company has really broad job types so almost anyone regardless of the background,  with sufficient qualifications and the right attitude can join and then find his way up.
 - The job is not a 9 to 5 type of job and although many times people tend to complain about the extra effort required or the requests for overtime these were never really mandatory and the efforts are almost always nicely rewarded. It is true though that you need to be an assertive and disciplined person to be able to get to work-life balance (it is not easy but there are people that are really mastering it and are productive enough in the standard 8 hours).
 - Nice opportunities for business trips both to other FNZ locations and client sites
 - Great location of all offices, young and dynamic people and super friendly and helpful.

It is not a company for people that love processes or expect to have A to Z description of their daily work or constant guidance. It is not a place where you can just fill a chair, you really need to work hard and give your best. It is not a place for people that cannot learn by themselves, cannot manage their work, cannot prioritize or are not able to organise their tasks as there are constant priority changes and you need to have the strength and flexibility to quickly adjust and not lose your temper.
Surely not a company that suits everyone!","There is never enough time to focus on highest quality and many times we focus on quantity rather than quality, we do not spend time on reviewing the lessons learnt or sharing them with other teams that might go through same.
You need to be self-driven and learn constantly in your own time, in particular there is not much space for and focus on personal development and training in general.
With such a fast paced environment, decisions are made pretty quickly and not always communicated in a timely and clear manner to everyone so there is space for interpretation and discussions that might make people unhappy."

Its a great place to be able to utilise your skills and be able to effect change. You are given responsibility and your input in your role makes a difference.

I like FNZ's vision to be able to lower costs across the financial services industry so that more people can have affordable access to financial advise, and to actually see that FNZ's input into the industry has helped this occur.

Some of the benefits on top of being paid at FNZ are a great complement. From free travel insurance for employees on both personal and work travel, free health insurance (the premium option at Southern Cross that covers free dental etc), free life insurance and TPD cover, bonus schemes that include equity and cash, 26 days annual leave, paid volunteer days, bonuses for referring colleagues to work at FNZ, multiple sports team to participate in and many more benefits","Being a growing company there is never a shortage of work. Work life balance is an important factor for many people and FNZ do a lot to facilitate flexible working arrangements but there is never a dull moment or period of time where there is not a project on the go.

The company was built on lies by overselling and under cutting customers and its staff., it had a lot of major customers who have left or are looking to leave at the first opportunity if they are not already being sued by a customer. The majority of the time, something that gets delivered to a customer has never been designed, built or tested to meet their requirement so that FNZ can hit their payment milestone and avoid huge penalties! They tell customers that everything on the backend is automated but the reality soon kicks in that its a paid monkey pulling leavers manually.

Old investors/Senior staff managed to pull off and sell its stake to new investors recently…god bless the new investors by the way, obviously haven’t a clue and didn’t do their homework on the creative accounting.

413,FNZ,Stay clear of the operations department,2018-09-03,2.0,Investment Operations Officer,"1. The technical department (not operations) is run by competent people and the atmosphere and general attitude are so different, that it feels like a completely different company. Don't get me wrong, the product still sucks, but here at least the people are supported to find solutions, not blamed, blackmailed and humiliated like in the operations department. 

2. I must say the benefits package is amazing and if you have to courage to ask for a good salary, you will probably get it. Only accept job offer here if you are sure you have negotiated a high salary for yourself, otherwise you will be slaving for mediocre pay. 

3. If you are inexperienced and you need to make some solid money in exchange for your life for a limited time period, and if you are capable to negotiate a high salary, then you are the right person to work in operations. 

4. HR and office admin team function better than in other companies, they are friendly and really helpful. 

5. To be fair, there is a career growth possible, even a fast one. Be careful to make friends with the correct people though to achieve this.","where to start :D 

1. Constant firefighting, no real processes, testing or automation in place

2. The product itself (the platforms) is horrendous, ludicrously complicated and a pain to work with even if nothing goes wrong - but on top of that, there is always something wrong. 

3. MONKEYWORK - prepare for 9-12 hours of monkeywork per day. It will kill your soul and turn your brain to mush. 

4. Team leaders are often nice people, but facing tremendous pressure from higher management and given no tools, freedom or power to really make any decisions, but always taking the blame for anything going wrong. 

5. The management...I don't even know where to start. Ok, to be fair, SOME level of favoritism, scapegoating, inside politics and dishonesty towards clients and employees is normal in any company, especially a corporate- but in FNZ it reaches levels where you are left with your mouth gaping in disbelief. 

The managers leading the operations department in Brno are the most unprofessional, incapable, vindictive and petty people I have ever met in any corporate (This is not true for team managers and team leaders, they are heroes of the company, standing between the employees, and the monstrosity of the ""management""  here). 

6. Stress. There is more than enough  "" justified"" stress when there is a real problem  - but the managers often add to this, instead of mitigating it. 

If something is not working and you are doing the best with the rest of your team to handle things, that is regularly the time for the managers to come and require an ""urgent"" report, clear months of old breaks, demand you to ""explain"" how is it possible you are not managing well (using language like they are army sergeants, not managers meant to manage people), etc. 

Several people experienced health issues from the stress. 

7. Overtime. The pressure for overtime is ridiculous. There is a huge fluctuation in operations and at the same time, big clients are onboarded. The daily tasks can be often managed only if most of the team stays daily for overtime, and they require extra overtime to clear the backlogs (don't expect training or guidance for this, however). 

There are meetings where the TL asks one person after another how much OT they can do on each day, weekends included. Coming in for 2-3 hours on a weekend is not good enough, they want a full workday on weekend and ideally at least an hour of OT per work day. This is not the TL's fault as they are doing this begrudgingly and because of the pressure of the higher management. 
If you say you will not come during a weekend, you must state a reason, and if the reason is not "" good enough"", you or your TL can face guilt tripping from the management and are considered a negative person which does not contribute to the team. 

8. Training. There is some initial training and regular testing of the most crucial areas (like handling client money). But processes are missing for the actual work, often there is a problem and teams don't even know who should be solving it, much less how to solve it, and there is ping pong and fights between teams as they are trying to shrug the responsibilities on anybody else. 
They are not to be blamed, as nothing is clear and everybody is so overloaded, its the only possible approach. However as you can imagine, the atmosphere of the department is one of constant stress and power trips between different groups and levels of people. There is no training for new platforms and clients, people must invent their own workarounds as bugs are not fixed and a LOT of the knowledge is being constantly lost because of experienced people leaving all the time."

High management and CEO are bunch of liars with no empathy or social intelligence trying to push people to work until they burn out. Crazy overtime hours which are not paid, being part of this company should be compensation big enough for you. Benefits? Oh, come on, who gives bonuses to their employees? No one cares about you as a person, you are just a number in their spreadsheet… feeling tired, sick, want to have a life? Not an option, you`ve signed up for this, so work until you drop. 

Your line manager will be most likely someone persistent to hang around for long enough to climb up the chain. Most of these people don`t have any managerial skills whatsoever, they just like to use their power and bully others. Culture based on snitching and treating the employees based on personal preferences and friendships, not actual contribution or skills. You could be the best technical SME in the world, once someone doesn`t like you, you`re done. Some people are not afraid to do anything to achieve getting the role they want. As a result there has been quite a bit of incompetent people getting all the way up to the high management. They only hang around in there because they are good at lying and they are willing to do whatever it takes to keep their power.  People in technical positions are jumping around trying to fight fires, but there is no way they can ever win this as the stubborn CEO decided there is enough people working on his projects and he might only need more of his managers (wonder what`s the reason they can`t deliver anything on time). There`s constant lying to everyone and they force you to lie to others yourself. Promising work to be done even if they know they don`t have resources and there is no way it will be done in next couple of months. Then they just shrug, postpone the work and laugh into their clients` faces. They are so bad they are not even ashamed of it."

Their moto should be lie, cheat, steal and repeat. One could go into the various ways in which the greed and incompetence of the senior leadership crushes morale, quality of work and client satisfaction but so many review have already more than adequately articulated these failings.
You will be lied to during the interview process to get you through the door with promises of change and a bright new future. Rest assured these are the standard platitudes used on new recruits, for you only to discover there is no intention to changing the model that grinds its workers to dust and seeks to dupe clients into taking on technology platforms that are not fit for purpose. This would not be the case if the staff were allowed to do their jobs in an orderly manner without being pushed from account to account in a deceitful game of musical chairs unknown to the client. To which when the music stops deadlines are missed, outages occur, patches are jammed in and weekends are lost, this all becomes very familiar territory for FNZ employees. All of this neatly rounded off by the legitimate ire of the client as their business suffers once again.

Another word of warning, eventually your clients will not trust a word you say due to the track record of FNZ failures, consequently your professional reputation will suffer. The longer you stay the worse this will become and eventually you will be intrinsically linked to the numerous deceptions the client has endured.

Unfortunately when it comes to FNZ its best for potential employees and clients alike to avoid at all costs. Take these reviews very seriously they are warnings from people who had to endure this horrendous company first hand, at least benefit from these cautionary notes."

A good rule of thumb from what I have seen of the other reviews is that the bad reviews are pretty much spot on. They are telling the truth which is why FNZ are always looking for staff (until they ship everything over to Brno, currently happening). The most incompetent management I have ever come across, a culture of lying to clients, not meeting the basic terms of service, basic financial service rules that are sacrosanct everywhere else violated like it’s normal…I could go on.

People are what makes a company, and the people at FNZ are really great. The company culture is amazing, very different than anything experienced before. To summarise in few main points:
- Great people;
- Complex, challenging job which is ever changing, improving and never gets you bored or a know-it-all;
- Amazing location in the centre of the Silicon Valley of Europe.","Working in a fast-paced IT company has its disadvantages. The work never ends or slows down. There's always a lot to do, but that's what keeps us going."
450,FNZ,AVOID AT ALL COSTS,2017-07-15,1.0,Distributions Officer,The employees in non-management positions were nice. As was the free cereal in the kitchen. I wish there were more pros but that’s about as far as it goes sadly.,"- For a company which makes itself out to be cutting edge and leading the way for platform technology, all of the back office activity its COMPLETELY manual. You are printing computer screenshots off, to write on them, and then rescan them back onto the computer. Or you are manually keying in information from a printed spreadsheet. Utterly ridiculous and tedious monkey work. I felt like my brain was turning to scrambled egg. I wouldn’t wish such awful, mind-numbing work on my worst enemy. Truly soul destroying.
- Constant promises of promotions, bonuses, etc. all never fulfilled. Impossible to make a career there unless you somehow wriggle your way into a management position. Of which most of the management are absolutely clueless, manipulative megalomaniacs. They even cancelled a Christmas party once because they have so little respect and consideration for their staff.
-  They are slowly moving staff away from the UK to Brno so that it’s cheaper for the tedious, manual work to be completed. Why they can’t invest in their staff or technology is beyond me. 
- Look at all the fake 5* star reviews posted on here by management. That tells you all you need to know about this company! Management even openly joke at the office about posting these pathetic reviews. How embarrassing."

454,FNZ,Would reccomend to stay away,2017-03-11,1.0,Operations,"almost all of the non-manager employees were really wonderful people trying to make the best of a difficult situation.
Casual dress.","If you are coming to this site to decide weather to accept a job offer, I emphatically advise you to decline. If you are tempted because they offer slightly better pay than another  company, please keep in their bare minimum pension contribution and non-existent bonuses. If you are in a desperate position, I would advise you to continue applying to other companies and to not let yourself get out of practice.

Demeaning and inappropriate comments made to employees by managers are brushed off as ""just a joke"" or ""not important because other people in the company have said similar things."" Employees who complain have a tendency to disappear shortly after. When I first started I noticed what I thought to be a strangely high number of people out on long-term sick leave. Initially, I thought those people must be faking or trying to game the system.  By the time I left I understood. The company culture and the way they treat employees is not good for your health. 

They are incredibly dishonest, to the point where you will be left with your mouth hanging open to find that people lie so shamelessly.  It is certainly not unique to find that a  supplier stretches the truth to its limits in its relationships with clients but I found the situation at FNZ to be extreme, and more unfortunately, to crossover into their relationship with employees. Starting from the time you interview, you can not trust anything that they say at any time. There are moments when you might begin to think that you are the crazy one, because of how much they do not care about reality. There is no point in fighting it because the conversation below illustrates is the kind of logic you will encounter at FNZ.

 A: ""It's raining."" B: ""No it's not I am standing outside right now."" A: ""Well, you're wrong because it is raining"".  B: ""No I am outside, it's definitely not raining. The sun is out, there is no water."" A: ""It is, the drops are just so small that you can't feel or see them."" B: ""If you can't feel or see it, it's not rain."" A: ""I really can't believe you have the audacity to be outside right now, you should be indoors minding your own business, what does the weather matter to you anyway, you're being really negative and it's affecting everyone.""

They make promises to clients that are far outside the realm of possibility or ability
and resourcing of the company which puts stress on everyone.
 
There is no training at all outside of a few slideshows about regulations that their clients have demanded that all employees are aware of. You maybe be thinking, well they must offer some training because it's X role and there must be very specific things I need to learn to do and I am managing other people's money after all. You would be wrong. There is no formal training whatsoever about the platform or relating to any specific role. They may lie to you about this in interview and I've seen them lie about this to clients.

If you read through these reviews you will find five star reviews, which are obviously planted by the company. This behavior represents what you can expect from FNZ : dishonesty, misrepresenting facts, and an insane inability to listen to criticism ."

Firstly be really careful about the glowing reviews - I've not met anybody in my time with FNZ who would right a review like those that appear here. This includes the lifers who've been there since day zero. Even those who stick at it are honest about the troubles FNZ has, I'm afraid too many reviews here smell of desperation and are almost certainly false. This should worry you.

The issues are pretty straight forward and unfortunately becoming well known in the client market. Never had a company promised so much and delivered so little. Over commitment on projects and an almost delusional capacity to under resource results in an incredibly challenging delivery environment. Regardless of where you work in FNZ you will spend most days in fire fighting mode.

Work / life balance is an enter so struggle. The expectation of some senior management is suited to the sweat shop rather than a modern, functioning business. As a company they've grown so quickly but working practices are incredibly immature.

Flexible working hours are really great - you can go and leave whenever you want, so if you need to run and do something, there are no issues with it. Going for lunch when nobody is checking you and breathing on your backs is also great. 5 weeks of holidays are standard with today's employers. Introduction of training center in Brno's office is also a step in the good direction. For people with no or little previous experience, it is a great start for their careers. Overtime policy is really good in my opinion - when you want to work, there is always some work, so you can get some extra money if needed. Free coffee, snacks, juice, and fruits are great benefits as well:) Possibility to travel to other branches all around the world is great by itself. Czech and English language courses paid by the company with individual approach will raise your language skills whether you are from Czech, or any other country. English speaking environment is great for any foreigners who want to come to Brno. Friday beer, where you can meet many coworkers and drink free beers or beverages is a great bonus, and something that many people look forward to the entire week.","I have to say that when reading most of the negative feedback here, all of it is true (even though they fail to mention good things here). When you are in the company for a longer time, you will begin to notice many things which you won't like, especially coming from the top management. Advancing your career is also almost non-existing - you will be doing the same work over and over again, until you will long for a change. If you are searching for a well paid job, look on some other companies instead (there are plenty not that far away). Here you will be under-paid, and with certain roles, you will have to be prepared for a really big workload. Culture of getting more inexperienced people for positions means great opportunity for students or those freshly out of school, however, the downside is less experienced working environment, and little knowledge base around you. And many time the quality of products developed here. Hardware side should be improved as well - old laptops and equipment are still used, and many times you need to fund things in the office from your own pockets, otherwise it won't get replaced.
Fruits could count with increasing number of people in offices - it doesn't seem to be the case nowadays, but it is a benefit which doesn't need to be in place so this is only a minor issue.

In the time I have been at FNZ it has gone from being a small firm with offices in Edinburgh and Wellington to a much bigger organisation with offices and clients in 8 different countries round the globe.
There are some really great, very smart people here to work with and a real can do attitude drives the company. There are great opportunities for hard working, driven people to get noticed and get on.
The work is rewarding and the package is good to.","FNZ is not the place for someone who wants to turn up and do 9 to 5. The speed at which the company is growing means that a lot is demanded of people and, at times, that means extra hours.
Growing companies always have challenges in how they adapt as they become bigger and operate across multiple locations. FNZ has had it's share of challenges but recognises when things aren't working well and isn't afraid to change to address those challenges."

If you are talented, hard-working, committed and enthusiastic then the there are fantastic opportunities to really progress your career and work with like minded people. If you are not of this persuasion and prefer a standard 9-5 with a familiar work pattern, then this is not for you.

Really talented work-force. No real hierarchy and this is reflected in a relaxed, cooperative working environment.","Some of the execs are not needed and are carried by the talent within their teams.

499,FNZ,At least it's never dull!,2015-10-31,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"For motivated staff there is the opportunity to develop highly sought-after skills.  Work is never boring (with the possible exception of Operations roles), and FNZ has a reputation in the industry as a tough place to survive - so when talented staff move on it is generally to great things.","Promises are made to clients which can not always be delivered on, and company is consistently under-resourced to deal with a very quickly growing client base.  Staff are pressured to work long hours for little reward, and culture is extremely reactive.  Every day at work involves putting out fires - and for client-facing staff, stretching the truth to its limits.

Promises are also made to staff - next year will be better, bonuses will make a comeback, communication will improve... Not many who have worked in FNZ for more than a year will take these seriously.

Career progression has a random quality at times, with some very mediocre performers moving on to managerial roles in which they will sit comfortably for years, while many talented staff either move on or stagnate.  Upper management changes regularly - it is assumed this is due to disagreements with CEO, who has an admirable quality of staying informed and involved in many facets of the business, but could also do with letting people get on with their jobs.

Side note: As mentioned by another poster - not convinced of the authenticity of some of the positive reviews posted here.  Rarely have I heard staff on the coalface (in any of the offices globally) say they believe FNZ is a good place to work - or manage to turn the 'cons' into 'pros' in job interview fashion, as those reviews have a tendency to do.  Definitely try to talk to some current/former employees if considering FNZ as a place to work."

I really like the flexibility that the company offers. It’s a fun place to come to every day and that is what work should be about.",FNZ is growing so fast  which means that there's a chance that it may start to lose its mojo although there's an important emphasis not to become dull and corporate so I’m not overly worried about this.

The CEO runs the company as a dictatorship, the so called leadership team come and go with alarming regularity unable to make an impact or work in such a culture. There is never enough money to pay the bills so they go unpaid for months on end. Clients are lied to, decent people sacked to save money without any thought or care. There are no decent ethics at work here and the board and investors are gutless and do nothing about it. Even many of the ""positive"" reviews on here appear to be fake.

This comes with an expectation of hard work but then that's the point is it not? The support provided at every step has been fantastic and the opportunities within the company are numerous.

From my personal experience, the working environment is fast paced, friendly and at times extremely challenging . There is an extremely good support network available with a positive culture at heart.","As with every business there are challenges however it's important to note that all challenges I have seen have been overcome, perhaps largely through peoples skill and commitment. Rapid growth has caused some growing pains however I'd rather be in a growing company than somewhere stagnant."
509,FNZ,One unique company with an inspiring CEO,2014-12-08,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"A most unique place to work -  a company with values and a culture that sets it apart from the rest of the market. The culture and values were defined many years ago by an inspiring and strong leader - FNZ's CEO. At FNZ people are encouraged to challenge where they feel appropriate, and to have their own opinion. There are many very talented and extremely hard working people in this company. If you want to take control of your own career through hard work and dedication, this is the place for you. The teamwork is exceptional and most people are willing to go beyond their call of duty to help others in whatever way they can in order to get the job done. This part of the FNZ culture was created from the very top of the organisation, has filtered its way down across the business, and has not wavered over the years. Hard work is recognised and rewarded. The working environment is friendly and open with respect given and received by all colleagues - no matter their role or place in an organisation chart.","Working as a team and going beyond one's role profile might not be attractive to everyone. Taking responsibility and ownership is needed in order to function here - again this might not work for everyone. Over the years there have been quite a few changes in senior management and also organisation structure. This resulted in some uncertainty across the business in the past months - however we seem to be back on track now with little or no uncertainty remaining. Those that are here, believe in the company, it's CEO and their own roles too."
510,FNZ,"Fast paced, career boosting, going places",2014-11-17,4.0,Anonymous Employee,"One of the best parts about this company are the people you work with. FNZ has manged to acquire a large number of very intelligent people who are all willing to share their knowledge and expertise. The working environment is relaxed and there are a few home comforts such as breakout areas, tea & coffee, breakfast, fruit etc. The salaries are competitive and there is plenty scope to boost your career.","Management has become somewhat disjointed from the 'worker bees' in recent times. Some of the senior management (key decision makers) make uninformed decisions which results in teams being pressed for time. Most of the company works well under pressure and it can be fun. But the disadvantage is that employees can't then produce their best work. The personal review process is a bit of a running joke and not all hard work is awarded, it's expected."
511,FNZ,"Plenty of potential, but CEO needs to go",2014-11-14,1.0,Anonymous,"Work hard, play hard culture. Agile working style - things happen at speed. The concept behind FNZ's products is excellent and if properly executed could be a huge disruptive force in financial services. Some very smart people, succeeding in spite of the CEO's meddling.","The CEO is a dictatorial micro-manager that can't go a day without riding roughshod over a management decision or dreaming up some new hairbrained bespoke product. Managers quickly learn that to succeed at FNZ you need to be a ""yes"" man. Disagree with Adrian at your peril. The result is a dysfunctional mess of an organization, lurching from restructure to restructure, and operating on the brink of financial ruin.

The hours are long, and the rewards are not good enough for the negative impact on your life. Equity is offered to good performers, but it's not even worth the paper it's printed on."
512,FNZ,What was that??,2014-11-08,2.0,Anonymous Employee,"I did see a squirrel outside one day which was a particular highlight of my tenure. 

Other bonuses such as the office, location and the fantastic staff make FNZ an enjoyable place to work. Unfortunately there is very little else to recommend other than that. It is the tone coming from the very top of the company that lets FNZ down.

For a graduate, FNZ may be a good place to start out. You will pick up new skills, be given responsibility and efforts are being made on the social front too. Just make sure you have an escape plan ready.

Previous reviews about salary and benefits are misleading. FNZs standard package is ok, just make sure you negotiate to the right amount to cover pension contributions.","FNZ has many challenges for the embattled employees. Managements (lets not lie here, Management is just Adrian) decisions are made without adequate consideration of the workforce, the cost or even feasibility. The majority of staff time is left to deal with working under pressure to make something decent out of the latest ""get rich quick"" scheme.

The boom or bust approach to finance makes me nervous for long term job security. We have periods of redundancies, then new people are hired soon after. Twice weekly food hampers were stopped entirely then moved to once weekly after a couple of months.

Overall, FNZ has much growing to do. The employees are committed for the moment, but there is only so much you can take. For a company heavily dependant on the employees to keep the show going, they need to be treated better. The management team have done well getting to this stage, but it is time to cash in the chips and let someone else take FNZ to the next level."
513,FNZ,Opportunity to be part of something you help to shape,2014-10-30,5.0,Product Group,How many other companies can you truly say that regardless of your starting position hard work and capability is rewarded and recognised and opportunity is offered. If you have the ambition and drive then this is definitely the company for you. The people that work here are hugely dedicated and achieve great things - definitely a factor in the meteoric success of the company over the last 10 years or so. There are social clubs and charity events you can get involved with if you want to or not.,"As a successful growth company there has been a need to evolve and this has led to change, which some people may see as a negative - its subjective change can be good !"
514,FNZ,"The more you put in, the more you get out",2014-10-23,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"More so than another companies, FNZ is a place where it's up the individual to really make an effort, push the envelope and grab the opportunity.  The environment and culture reflect this, and the quality of people is high.  On the client servicing side - there are some amazing opportunities to be exposed to some very experienced & senior people in the market place - you won't get his in other large institutions.  Seeing much better comm's from senior management recently - the training programs I think must be working.","FNZ isn't perfect, and it isn't for everyone, it is hard work and a challenge.

Their customer base is expanding rapidly and continue to win major contracts. This also offers great opportunity for global relocation. Had an absolute blast working here so far. Done some great work, have an awesome team. Can't imagine working anywhere else now.","If you're not prepared to work hard, or have issues with management/authority figures, it's probably not the place for you. Most of the senior managers are very down-to-earth and get their hands dirty so there's no real reason to have issues. Management is not hard to enter into. I've seen many people work their way up, simply by being awesome at what they do and THE WAY THEY GO ABOUT IT. Like most companies it has an 'old-school' of employees, but it is a meritocracy, and being complacent will mean demotion. The old-school guys are there because they continue to be innovative and incredibly hard working."

From looking at other systems it is very easy to see that the FNZ products are a cut above everything else in the industry and as a result should put the company in a very strong position in the industry over the next few years.

Salaries are competitive with the market.",Work-life balance can be a challenge at times but is far better than it used to be and there are signs that it is continuing to improve.
518,FNZ,The risks far outweigh the rewards,2014-09-23,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"The initial atmosphere is youthful, exciting and with some fun fringe benefits that clearly show the image they want to portray of a cheeky upstart. Minor employment start-up issues encountered were quickly owned and responded to. In addition, immediate colleagues and peers across the business were open, friendly and enthusiastic - people at the operational level are this company's biggest asset and there are clearly some who really enjoy the challenges that come with their job. There are elements of quirkiness about 'how things work around here' that make it feel exhilarating. 

Even as the facade started to peel away, there are aspects of the working environment that you won't get in the big corporates: kitchens, break-out areas with toys to play with and a slight sense of mischief. This would make a great place for a first-timer who needed a transition between school/university and a more mature company; senior prospects are more limited, due to the whims of the CEO.","The biggest issue is volatility at the senior level: in less than a year, there was almost complete change at the executive level, which meant that nobody stayed for long enough to address the real issues affecting the company - a significant issue when you work in a highly regulated industry.

There's also penny-pinching in the craziest places, ranging from a failure to invest in robust IT controls right down to ignoring maintenance until the security speed gates break. Little things quickly build up to give staff a fatalistic attitude, while leadership end up having to make snap decisions without considering medium-to-long term implications.

The working environment is all about delivery, and less about time served (which does introduce a certain equality of opportunity). The flip-side that negative news is ignored until it can't be put off; chasing the next big sale or the much-vaunted new release becomes all consuming.

The benefits are pretty weak, to the extent where you'd better be prepared to negotiate a big basic salary to compensate for losing things that are pretty much expected in financial services; the pension provision is particularly poor, being the bare minimum required by the Government.

One thing that becomes very quickly unsettling is the CEO seemingly enjoying his role as part workaholic, part pantomime villain. While he is undoubtedly very knowledgeable and talented, there is such a thing as too much hands-on. Even professionals and experienced people from elsewhere in the industry will find their expertise and judgement challenged to pretend that all is well to clients - and should they fail to do so, they will be escorted from the office with barely an acknowledgement to operational staff, who are left in disarray. This happens far too often for a business to remain sustainable in the long term."
519,FNZ,"A roller-coaster that just got boring - once you're in, take time to step back and take a look from the outside...",2014-09-18,2.0,Anonymous Employee,"Initially the salary was great and being in the company in the early days in Edinburgh was very exciting (we got paid cash bonuses once!).  Did get to work in 3 geo's across my FNZ career.  Responsibility was handed out with trust and if you could deliver then you were rewarded.  The start up feel was awesome in those early days.  Annual leave benefit is pretty generous - man, you needed it to come down!  I personally benefited from promotions and reward but a lot of very good employees around me did not.  

Many of the CEO's qualities I actually admired - there is much satisfaction in outperforming your competitors (many of them long established).

If you are young(ish), driven, want to gain experience faster than your peers then absolutely give yourself to this company for a short duration.  Unashamedly use them to upskill yourself.  Then get out.","Durham was/is tyrannical but it was water off a duck's back personally.  Problem was that the round about way it affected my position is that the exec was completely mis-matched with what the company/Durham were doing.  This was really strange as I believe he had a hand in choosing them.  And then sacking them.  The management that do survive have also, not unsurprisingly, immature and weak people skills.  Taking young bright sparks that are technically gifted and then telling them to step away from their hands on job to manage teams/projects is a great way to scrimp on salaries but inevitably leads to high staff turnover.  I reckon most of these people actually struggle to organise their socks and undies drawer.

No place for shrinking violets - you'll get steam rolled.  And Durham makes that quite clear so man up if you want to succeed (I personally didn't see this as a con in Edinburgh)!

In the end the fun died.  I overstayed and can now see how inexperienced and silly the approach to software development was."

Paltry pension, lack of visible and consistent pay review.  Bonuses are only given to the favoured few.  Make sure if you are going there you get a ridiculously inflated salary as your chances of getting a pay rise are virtually nil.  Good performance is not recognised- you only know you are doing a good job if you are not getting shouted at.  If your face doesn't fit the CEO will fire you.

I have worked for this organisation for coming up ten years and I never would have thought that I'd have worked in just about every department, and with such committed, high-performing people. Committed, high-performing people can often be complete arses but not so here, I often find myself looking forward to being around many of my immediate colleagues as they're such good sorts. 

I've worked for FNZ in three Geo's, and if you have a transferable skill base (particularly in technology) then you can often arrange offshore transfers pretty much at your convenience. There's always something busy going on in another FNZ office somewhere...

If you're inclined to buy-in to 'the enterprise', what this company does is both genuinely exciting in terms of shaking up an often complacent (smug) industry, and beneficial for the ultimate end-consumer which, personally, is important for my job satisfaction. FNZ platforms cut margins, middlemen and inessential cost lines which is adding up to a better deal for Mr & Mrs Investor.","You genuinely need a thick skin and some tolerance for taking the unreasonable in your stride. This organisation doesn't always get it right with respect to people or planning and, frustrating as that is, if you're a shop steward or barrack-room lawyer I expect that this isn't for you. 

You also need, on reasonably regular occasions, to be able to drop everything else in your life and work like buggery. This doesn't suit everybody, particularly given that in some roles this is more or less expected and because of this seems unacknowledged. However, to be fair, no-one can actually nail your feet to the floor (in the current employment law environment anyway) and you are very much responsible for keeping your own work/life balance - this firm will not go out of its way to help you with this in any way.

If you are in a customer-facing role, you need to effectively manage your stress and develop some big shoulders, it can be very lonely and sometimes it can feel as though you aren't particularly well backed-up by the firm."

There is a culture of innovation supported by a can do attitude, people at all levels providing ideas and delivering results are acknowledged and well rewarded. This culture has resulted in products and services which are transforming the markets which we operate in and in turn drives more demand creating more opportunity.

I personally have had more opportunities at FNZ than at all of my previous employers combined moving through various technical, project and management roles. Taking advantage of these opportunities is a personal choice as it takes time and commitment but opportunities like those at FNZ come around once in a lifetime.

We have a stable of blue chip customers which is the envy of our competition and our staff have the opportunity to interact with these companies on a personal level, proposing and promoting FNZ’s ideas. Our customers continue to entrust FNZ with administration of their customers assets which is a great responsibility.","It is a difficult place if you want to hide in a crowd, there is little space for passengers. A lot of hard work is involved and sometimes you have to work a few extra hours. However that's to be expected in a growing company and there is plenty of opportunity to get the balance right. In my opinion, the rewards make it all worthwhile."

The company also does a good job in communicating what is going on within the organisation, which can be tricky given the changing environment and fast pace of the work.  
 
There isn't much red tape when you want to try something new and although there are the necessary policies and procedures in place, FNZ is not overly bureaucratic.  FNZ encourages people to take ownership of their role and rewards those that come up with new and better proposals for all aspects of the job.

- FNZ has a solid customer base of mostly tier-1 life companies and banks but there's still a real drive to bring in new customers (I think we've signed 5 or 6 in the 18 months I've been here...), particularly ones who unlock new markets or jurisdictions
- good exposure to management who are pretty approachable and surprisingly engaged with client pitches and solution designs
- in the last year there's been a focussed strategy to broaden the range of products/services offered on the platform, which has enabled good opportunities to explore new areas internally
- very good pay, but needs to be balanced against benefits package (weak) and potential equity (the big prize)","- questionable quality in the layer of management below the CEO, although rarely tolerated for long periods of time
- reasonably quiet on the social front (for London anyway...)
- benefits package is exclusively focussed on salary + equity, which suits some more than others (i.e. young and single)
- disjointed business between UK and Aus
- they took away our bread!"
529,FNZ,Actually a really good place to start your career,2014-07-23,4.0,Business Analyst,"- There is scope for quick career advancement, with high levels of exposure to senior management and a culture of giving responsibility to those who ask for it. People do quickly move up the ranks here. After two years of working here, I have found myself with far more responsibility and a far broader network than any of my year at university.
- The work is fun, with scope for original thought, and suitable careers for either generalists or specialists. Travel and/or relocation to Australia, New Zealand and Hong Kong are possible. 
-There is a huge element of team spirit and a ""can do"" attitude that drives the firm forward
- Pay can be quite high, though reviews are erratic. Its probably best to be ""bought in"" than wait for advancement pay rises though. The serious carrot that is available is equity, which given the firms likely future could turn out to be seriously valuable. 
-The holidays package is great","-There are essentially no fringe benefits (3+3 pensions and an annual call from a man who sells you cut price tesco coupons....). On balance i would have to say i would rather have the cold hard cash but it gets annoying when your friends over the road get their complementary gym membership+ bike + meals
-The management structure in opaque, and for a small company it can feel like a never ending bureaucracy
-If you want to ""get ahead"", don't go looking for a program that will get you there."
530,FNZ,"An exhilarating, fast moving company which is set to deliver innovation and change in technology and financial services",2014-06-24,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"A dynamic and fast moving environment with some incredibly talented, very innovative people who are doing amazing things in financial,services. It's certainly a work hard environment but rewards are good in terms of salary, equity and sheer career opportunities.",The business moves quickly and priorities can shift quickly - I quite like the challenges that this brings.
531,FNZ,A enjoyable and rewarding period in my working life which has allowed me to grow and develop.,2014-06-19,5.0,Investment Operations,"FNZ is a fast paced company constantly pushing for new ideas to improve the product - which in my opinion makes for an exciting working environment. There is a great energy about FNZ which always brings out the best in the people that work there. I always found FNZ a really open and collaborative environment which encourages development and creativity. It's a fun, friendly and exciting place to work and I thoroughly enjoyed my time there.","As the company is growing so fast you need to make sure that you develop all the time to keep up with your job. This requires a lot of personal development, but FNZ offers this in abundance. This may not suit everybody but is consistent with FNZ’s culture around challenging yourself and continuous improvement."
532,FNZ,A great place to work,2014-06-18,5.0,Manager,"I wanted to align myself with a company positioned for continued growth, encourages me to be all that I can be and unconditional support for my career ambitions. I struck lucky and got all 3 boxes ticked with FNZ. Did luck have anything to do with it? As I've progressed here at FNZ I'm beginning to think not. FNZ is without question a fast-paced environment to work in, non-stop action! You're kept on your toes but rewarded with positive validation for your efforts and a great benefits package. 

FNZ is a young company that strives for excellence in it's operational business and in its development of innovative products. You get the opportunity to work with all types of roles within the organisation and are treated with respect and consideration.

If you're looking to expedite your career no matter what profession in this sector, FNZ is the place to be!","There's no slowing down, once you've delivered one thing, your straight onto the next to support a very demanding roadmap. If you like a relaxed and easy-osy environment like a library, this place is not for you!"
533,FNZ,"Think very, very, very hard before working here...",2014-06-07,2.0,Manager,"There is no doubt about the fact that there are some really good people doing the ""real"" work at FNZ. The talent and commitment of some individuals is remarkable, and the team spirit to take on the challenges can be really good too (it needs to be to survive - read on...) 

Pay can be quite reasonable or very good indeed for some roles, although don't expect anything much other than base salary, so make sure you negotiate a very good salary if you think about working here.

If you are young, single, very energetic and prepared to work long hours, then the work can be interesting in some roles (e.g. business analysis or development). There are also often opportunities for international secondments if you are able and willing to move to the other side of the world at short notice. If you have any desire to spend time with family or friends outside work, then this is unlikely to be the place for you. 

This company has an incredible blue-chip client base, has pretty good products and is likely to continue to grow fast and be very successful, but you must be ultra-resilient to survive in FNZ and the working conditions can be generously described as very tough and demanding.","Working at FNZ is, in a word, a nightmare. Unless you are one of the special favourites who have been sucking up to the demented CEO for long enough to have a stake in the company and may one day get a sizeable windfall, the rest of the company's slaves will be bled dry. Those are probably the guys that will have written most of the positive reviews on this site by the way.

If you are in any kind of management position, be ready to tell more lies to customers than most people's honesty and integrity will stand. Expect long hours every day (core hours are 8:30 - 5:30, and expect most days to be longer and weekends to be busy too). Beware that contracts explicitly sign away any protection offered by the Working Time Directive.

For most roles, don't expect overtime or bonus payments. There are virtually no company benefits other than a paltry pension contribution.

If you are a senior manager joining FNZ, be prepared to be publicly abused, shouted at, sworn at and undermined by Durham at every opportunity - if you have any thoughts of being an independent leader, forget it. FNZ has a long history of churning through senior managers who clash with Durham. He may be a very bright and successful guy, but he is also an abusive, obnoxious, self-centred workaholic who will cast aside anyone he takes a dislike to at a moment's notice. He is not a family man and he lives for FNZ, and he expects everyone else to as well. His solution to every problem is for people to work harder.... errrr, how about having enough people to do the crazy amount of work in the ridiculous timescales that he promises to every customer?

This is a company that will suit very few people... beware and ask around if you know people that either have worked for FNZ or do currently, and you'll quickly realise the reputation that it is developing as one of the worst kinds of employer showing no respect or care for its employees. Turnover in some client-facing roles is astronomical."

The building facilities aren't bad.","Terrible senior management including a delusion CEO. Pay is average but work expectation is that of an investment bank. All the work and none of the rewards. A culture of disrespect to employees and an inability to hire top performers or hold on to those that it has. Constant redundancy rounds, a company barely hanging in by the thread.

Work environment here is one of the top benefits for me. I can discuss all the problems within the team and therefor we can easily solve them. Really appreciate it as I hate working under permanent stress.",Sometimes we're working pretty long on the same project and it's getting tedious.
