With 2021 end of year salary adjustment, it is slightly better.

Provides resources like linked learning for developers to use and even encourage developers to use learning time to learn new things.

Since covid, fully remote but has the options to go into the office if you want too.

The company follows agile practices and testing.

This is a great place to work if you want learn especially if you are starting out at a graduate/junior role but aftet 1.5 year, you should revaluate","Again some of these things depend on your team.

Even though salary was improved, it still was no where no competitive with other companies. However, I have heard new joiners salaries are better

Too comfortable. This is more personal but other colleagues on different teams felt like this. I was not learning towards the last 8 months at Factset but just cruising by. This was due to the project being boring and repetitive, and hardly any to things.

My team struggled to get talent that would help us move the project to a better place.

Management removed our dedicated QA team member, then push that responibility to our project manager resulting less affective testing

We had to wait for one senior engineer to approve our PRs for a particular project because of another project he was working slowing our process dramatically."

-What you learn isn’t very helpful when trying to find another job. Frontend engineers only do the node layer and Vue. There are different teams for deployment, database accessing, and even build tools.
-Complaints or suggestions for improvements frequently get lost or brushed off
-My engineering managers gave all prioritization power to the PDs so it was really difficult to address tech debt
-Lots of maintenance mode code isn’t acknowledged as such and still gets requested department-wide updates. Then you have to pray the build still works and you can install everything and know how to test it since they “shifted left” and got rid of the QA department.
-Most of the code reviews of fresh college grads falls on the senior members of the team, not the manager, and the amount of turnover means I rarely got to put up any code reviews of my own because we were constantly training new hires.

Many of the senior managers/VPs at Factset have been there for over a decade or more, so a steady career is possible for those who prefer stability. Factset had good benefits - 401k matching, fully paid health insurance, and, pre-Covid - a daily lunch reimbursement","The main problem with Factset is its technical debt that will hold back your growth as an engineer. Slow adoption of cloud concepts that have been around 15+ years, and even slower embrace of cloud-native workloads (containers, microservices, etc) means you'll working on yesterday's tech instead of today's innovations. Worst yet, because the root of this problem is a cultural one, you won't be surrounded by the best people whom you would normally learn and grow from, which is poisonous and a disastrous for your long-term prospects.

More broadly, this is reflective of finance as a whole, which tends to move slowly and conservatively and without much imagination or innovation. You would be better off working with the latest tools on products that scale at a fast-moving startup, than be stuck supporting legacy designs with no skills to parlay at a corporate dinosaur like Factset."

Entry-level work is engaging and develops young professionals well (take what you learn and find a new company to work for after a couple of years)
FactSet says a lot of the right things with a focus on inclusion, diversity, and its people (you don't see it in practice, but it is talked about a lot)","No recognition or reward for being a high performer - they've started doing stacked rankings with 85% of the company having to be ""average"". If you are a high-performer on a high-performing team, you will not be taken care of. FactSet seems happy to lose these high-performing players and teams in favor of this new system.
Benefits have eroded year after year - we pay little as employees to have the insurance, but we also get very little back medically (doctors hate the insurance we have, terrible Rx coverage, and the OOP costs are very high). Other benefits are just not keeping pace with the industry, like 401k, parental leave, and general flexibility.
We have what feels like constant organizational change, creating a lot of job uncertainty and unrest.
If you do not want to manage people, you will not be able to advance and you will not be well-respected. FactSet treats its managers very differently than individual contributors. As a result, we have a lot of truly bad managers here.

People like this become ERBP/Payroll senior managers/associate directors and directors in this company
Stop salary raises/demote these people, but they do not leave the company. There are multiple reasons for this: they established dirty syndicate of incompetent people.

861,,A good starting point on the city career ladder if that is your chosen career path.,2021-03-10,3.0,Consultant,"In many ways FactSet is a good introduction to the typical city based fintech/city firm, both in terms of company size, its HR processes, its targets and expectations, the working hours required and the likely salary you will get paid at the start of your fintech career. 

When I was there the company invested well in staff training, equipment and staff benefits. There was also some role progression available to those who the management considered stands out from the present crop of new hires. 

All in all a good immersion into the finance world and its idiosyncrasies. Working here is exactly what it is going to be like working at many large international companies and therefore a good litmus test as to whether that is your thing, career wise.","I would say this comment isn't FactSet specific but industry specific - finance can be an aggresive environment and you will face stiff competition from your co-hires, your managers will either be the type to support you extremely well in your career growth and firewall you from unreasonable treatment OR they will throw you under the bus in service of their own targets - this is unfortunately part and parcel of being in a large company rife with internal politics.

Clients, depending on the ones you get, can either be great to work with and open up an avenue for future career progression, or they can be extremely unpleasant - again this is more of an industry fault - it often cultivates people with overinflated egos who lose all sense of professional boundaries and think that abusing you over the telephone is a normal thing to do in the 21st century.

When I was there much of the client work was based on an internal, highly proprietary database query language - this boxes you in somewhat when it comes to having a skillset that you can apply elsewhere, but I suppose the general principles are transferable. It is possible that since I left this has been deprecated and industry standard languages are used."

868,,A case study in Corporate Gaslighting,2021-03-07,1.0,Consulting Sales,A handful of people came to work with good attitudes,"FactSet is an unfortunate case of what you see isn’t always what you get. For a company that touts a great place to work and its diversity, there were only a handful of BIPOC in North America in my 5 years, and even fewer women or BIPOC in leadership positions. In my time I was told I was a mediocre contributor, that I was replaceable, and was told to stay in my line when I wanted to achieve more. I didn’t trust upper management, the product, the clients, or the recruitment team to change the massive hiring issues. 

If you’re not a ‘chosen one’ your career is stunted from the beginning, and my door was blocked on the way out. I was threatened and told I’d never amount to anything and didn’t know how good I had it.

FactSet was a brutally damaging beginning to my career and I was in utter shock to find that other tech companies valued my opinions and encouraged my work. I cannot in good faith ever recommend that anyone work for FactSet."

Since FactSet is becoming a bigger company, they started to recruit externally and this has led to inconsistent culture across different teams.","Go to Twitter, search for ""FactSet"" and scroll down to June 5, 2020 and see for yourself how in less than 24 hours FactSet claimed their employee's Twitter account was ""hacked"" (a software engineer... hacked?!?! REALLY?!?!). This DESPICABLE RACIST behavior and FactSet's response is UNACCEPTABLE.

Most of the tech-stack is either in-house built or heavily deprecated(30-40 years). Stackoverflow will not help you - the only way to find answer on your question is by asking your co-workers, that do not have time for you because they have very strict timetables and are heavily overworked. At least half of the office stays late hours regularly. Staff is split into teams with minimal co-operation.
Training took a lot of time but was irrelevant. US office  seems to have problems communicating with rest of the world - especially London.
Not surprisingly, developers come and go at a high rate. Those who stay there are the ones who never worked in another company and assume it is like that everywhere."

I think management has done a great job at hiring the people that fit well in the group dynamic and allow for growth as a team. 

WORK LIFE BALANCE IS AMAZING. My day is always 8:30-5:30 no if's and or buts. 

Some perks are great, the time off (especially in CA) is awesome right out of the gate and allows for needed days off. 

Management is extremely accomodating and willing to work with you in any situation. This seems even more true now with the COVID-19 problems, management has been communicative and had a full plan set in place for such an event. They have been doing everything to keep us communicating, including virtual happy hours, fun email chains, etc. and I think one of the unspoken things that have been really good is their continued health care reassurance as well as continuously telling us as a whole that we have the ability to do free teleconferencing with therapists. Even before this though, when someone is sick, when someone just needs a day to themselves, everything is sorted no questions asked.

Overall, while I will list some cons, I think the Pros (many that I haven't listed) outweigh the negatives.","So these will more or less be my own thoughts and might not be the same for other consultants in other offices. 

1) While C-Suite has listened to us and given us a cost of living raise this past year, we're still considered low-income by more than 10k in NY, SF and LA-based on HUD guidelines.. I understand margins here, but if you don't want people to leave, you can't only give semi-annual raises that barely beat inflation. 

2) The system for promotions is awful. It's actually the main reason I am leaving. Every person who comes in knows the cycle, 6 months CSDP, 1.5 years of consulting, then off to sales or specialist role, then another 2 years. You're losing a lot of great talent because you're sticking to these arbitrary timelines that make people question why they'd stay somewhere with limited upside (albeit, guaranteed). It just feels like you should be rewarding people on merit, rather than on time alone. 

3) Healthcare and other perks: Healthcare, not great, 401K not great but not bad (4% match right out of the gate with vesting as time goes on), the lunch is most cities pays for like 1/2 to 2/3 but the options are so stale... It'd be more prudent to just give us per diem of the set amount and allow us to use it as we please (whether that be to buy groceries to eat healthier, etc."

* Stipend towards lunch, free snacks. Both could be improved but it was still appreciated.
* Some very smart, friendly people and good tech learning opportunities in some areas of the company.","* Pay is low, raises are often lower than inflation, bonuses are basically nonexistent, no RSUs. Compensation is much lower than big tech companies and more lucrative financial firms. My current pay is double what I made while at FDS.
* Headquarters are in a very expensive and rather boring area of Connecticut, at least from the perspective of a mid-twenties guy.
* Glacial pace of design, approvals, and development. And if you're doing anything involving people not on your immediate team? Expect it to take twice as long.
* Some very archaic technology.
* Expensive acquisitions that have failed to pay off, or are extremely challenging to integrate into the core FactSet platform.
* Upper mgmt does not communicate honestly - they generally act like everything is going great, lots of positivity, claim that they value new features or improved performance - but they pay their engineers so little. 

Overall, I'd say that FactSet is a great place to work if you are already well-off, or strongly prioritize travel/family time. But if you're early in your career and even a little bit 'hungry', I would recommend looking elsewhere.

To me, it felt like upper mgmt at FDS was satisfied to simply coast and continue making money from data and platform subscriptions before eventually slipping into obsolescence. I never got the impression that engineering work or new features were thought of as important or even necessary to the core business."

1368,,Great Employer...If You're in the Right Department,2019-11-24,3.0,Content Manager,"The company promotes a healthy work-life balance.  The hours were generally reasonable and each employee gets 20 vacation days when they start.  Additionally, FactSet offers generous benefits: $8.00 contribution towards your  lunch 4 days a week, solid insurance plans, immediate 401K enrollment and matching, and paternity leave.

I also loved my coworkers.  The firm tends to recruit people who are smart but not egotistical and driven but not overly competitive.","Broadly speaking, product management at FactSet is divided into two categories: application management and content management.  I worked on the content management side, and I'm not sure that I would recommend this department to potential employees.

For starters, the content management team doesn't have much of a culture.  The firm doesn't offer much training in key skills for the role like SQL querying, data analysis, technical spec writing, or agile project management.  Nor does the firm plan forums or events to discuss best practices for content management.  

Additionally, the compensation in this department is underwhelming.  The baseline salaries are somewhat competitive for the industry, but the raises don't provide strong incentives to work harder.  In previous years, receiving a performance rating of ""outstanding"" meant that you received a 3-4% raise rather than a 1-2% raise if your rating was ""meets expectations"".  This year, I spoke with several people who received ratings of ""meets expectations"" and  received 0% raises.  The low raises would have been less disappointing if FactSet had paid annual bonuses to its content managers, but it didn't.

The lack of professional development efforts and disappointing compensation lead me to recommend against working in the content management division of FactSet.  However, I tended to receive positive feedback from my colleagues on the Datafeed and Analytics teams.  If you would like to work for FactSet, then I would recommend that you pursue an opening in one of these departments."

1377,,Sales Frat House,2019-11-12,2.0,Product Specialist,"Name brand company.  FactSet is only second to Bloomberg in brand recognition for market data providers. 

Great outside opportunities.  FactSet's clients regularly poach their FactSet contacts and team members for roles at their firms.  If you're good at networking, you'll have a great job lined up for yourself when you're ready to leave.

Great exposure to the various facets of the investment industry.  You'll learn the investment types, the investor types, the technology used for investment processes, etc. but only if you have the initiative to learn that stuff yourself.  FactSet will only teach you how to use and sell FactSet.

Below market rate pay for most roles, but boosted by an employee stock plan in a high returning company.  Excellent compensation and perks if you're in Sales.","Management has zero appreciation for non-sales roles.  FactSet's product models are divided into Development, Support, Implementation, and Sales.  Only associates in the Sales function are valued, and if you are not in the Sales function you'll never be promoted to management.  You are a faceless cog in their machine.  You'll receive no praise, no senior management face-time, no career development guidance, and no bonus.  Sales are the cherished stars; company paid group drinking nights, exotic retreats of the Chairman's Club for the highest generating associates, massive bonuses, and of course all the promotions.  You'll be reminded of this fact pretty much every day, as every time there is a sale of any magnitude a giant metal gong in the office is rung, and the person who ""earned the sale"" will give a little speech and the whole office will have to clap for them.

There are only 2 metrics FactSet cares about: ASV and Meeting Count.

ASV is how much annual subscription revenue your clients are contracted for.  Only Sales earns credit for growing ASV; nobody cares how much ASV you supported, ensured didn't cancel, or helped the implementation team implement.  In fact, if you're not in Sales, management only tracks how much ASV you lose; you get no credit for growth or retention.

Meeting count is an obvious metric.  What isn't obvious to management is meeting quality.  Are you in Sales and you had a leisure 4 hour day filled with casual chats about nothing with various clients over morning coffee, lunch, afternoon coffee, and a dinner?  4 meetings, what a superstar you are!  Drive 3 hours to a client's office, spend 10 hours building and delivering a workflow your Sales team promised a client (without consulting their implementation or support teams to see if it's even feasible), and then drive 3 hours back home?  Only 1 meeting, what a garbage employee you are!

Turnover in non-Sales roles is frequent and horrendous.  I've never seen any other employer where roughly a third of employees quit without notice.  About once a month I'd come in and someone would have just left their badge on their desk and a pile of work that was promised to clients that wasn't done, or just not returned from a vacation the day they were due back until their job was considered abandoned, or just sent an email out of the blue mid-day saying ""bye, I quit"".  In truth, most of their managers don't deserve the courtesy of a 2-week notice; they’d usually bad talk their departed staff the moment they are out the door, talking about how incompetent they are, even if they're off to a much better opportunity.

Staff behavior is almost high school like.  Development is treated like unwanted nerds by Sales and was even physically located as far away from the rest of teams as possible, far away from common areas like the kitchen so nobody had to interact with them.  Only Implementation and Support members usually talked with them and treated them as equals; when Sales was forced to interact with them you could feel the awkwardness and pandering in how they treated Development."

FactSet is a great place to begin your career - from both a Consulting and Sales side of things, Regular correspondence with C level clients will begin early, allowing you to build up your sales and consulting skills (transferrable). Free lunch is pretty awesome too. Generally, the people you work with are smart, driven, and like to have fun. Some of my better friends  were from FactSet. The managers I had were superb. Overall, a great experience.","Having moved into another SaaS company, I have seen some light in regards to problems FactSet had. First and foremost - the pay. I know it's always easy to complain about pay, but FactSet's pay is well under what you could make elsewhere. In sales, specifically, there is zero commission. No commission and no real ties to performance (outside of a lofty 6 month review), does not incentivize the sales organization correctly. This will continue to drive people out if they don't fix this. Autonomy regarding freedom to work from home is also not really there either - which is just not standard anymore (for anyone that is in sales, especially, past 5 years experience). Lastly, internal politics. Luckily, I found myself on the right side of this line in my career at FactSet, however, I saw several people treated a tad unfairly (in their career progression and performance reviews) due to their lack of being in the optimal standing with the popular and influential group of people. All this being said, FactSet is full of wonderful people. It really is a great way to kick off your career and get some great, transferable experience."

1543,,Good for starters,2019-04-09,4.0,Software Engineer,"Salary, Benefits and Leaves:
Salary is great for starters with no experience. You can stay for at least 2 years to boost your salary as appraisal happens twice a year. Depending on your team, promotion cycles also happen twice a year and I can guarantee that promotion is fast. Benefits are also great (e.g. Medical, Internet, etc. Reimbursements, Health Benefits [HMO], dependencies, etc.). Work-Life Balance is highly practiced by the people too. You'll be granted 30 days of leave (can be used as SL or VL) not counting other types of leaves (e.g. Maternity/Paternity, Bereavement, etc.). For software engineers, you will be on-call which allows you to garner time offs or offsets which are multiplied (e.g. 1.5 times during weekdays and 2 times during weekends/holidays). This means if you work as on-call during the holidays for 1 hour, you can offset 2 hours in one of your next shifts. This is accumulating so if you have 8 hours worth of offset, you can use it as a 1 day leave (without using your original pool of leaves). Working overtime is also strictly prohibited and highly discouraged. If you work overtime, it reflects negatively in your performance. Sick leaves are convertible to cash (at most 10,000 pesos) and unused VLs (max 5 days) can be carried over to the next year.

Career Opportunities:
Depending on your team, you will be exposed in different programming tech stacks. Some teams offers a wide range of programming tech stacks while some use in-house tools instead. Not only your technical skills will grow, your soft skills will also be improved and worked on as the management focuses both on productivity for the clients as well as people skills to maintain a healthy work environment. This helps maintain a positive culture with the minimum corporate politics and less work toxicity. 

Management:
If you aim to be an individual contributor, your technical skills will be greatly sharpened and your manager will surely help you on that. If you aim to be a team lead or manager, your manager will also coach you on how to be one by providing leadership opportunities as you work with your job. Managers will also assess you objectively (or at least minimum subjectivity).

Minor Stuff:
Free shuttle (from glorietta to its offices and back, for 10 PM - 6 AM, a home-drop door-to-door service is provided). Unlimited Drinks, Free Snacks, Workshops, Sportsfests, etc. Company phone for on-call engineers with unlimited calls/text/internet.","Salary, Benefits and Leaves:
If you aim to boost more your salary, you may want to consider looking for another job after 2-3 years of stay in FactSet as a software engineer. Although there are a lot of senior software engineers who stayed for more than 5 years (some even part of the pioneer batch who work for FactSet with almost 10 years). Yes, leaves might be overflowing with FactSet but it also goes in the saying that it comes with how you manage your deliverables. Some offsets and leaves are left unused due to the number of deliverables which for me is a downside because it's your time who got lost in the overall process.

Career Risks:
While other teams offer a wide range of tech stack, some teams are working 99% of the time with in house tools which will make your programming skills stale. There is also a culture within these teams that as long as it can be implemented using the in house tools, it shall be done that way. Some even forcibly make it work even if code maintainability and quality is already at stake. Plus, you are really not programming with their in house tools but rather creating driver files for them.

Management:
Most of the times, managers forgot that engineers/reports are not just numbers in the charts. There are several concerns raised but neglected by the management. The management also do not listen to their subordinates emphatically and try to understand where they are coming from."

It's because you can take unlimited breaks unnoticed, you can extend whenever you want to, you can bring your bags inside the production floor, you can bring your cellphones with you inside the production floor, you can eat inside, you can watch YouTube videos while working, you can even watch movies, there are team who can finish their work early and just pretending that they are doing something. (I am not sure what the leaders are doing about this but you can actually maximise this time by helping other teams, evaluation is just based on numbers, the organization is results oriented - numbers-driven. There are free snacks and shuttle, In fairness they provide a lot of benefits to their employees.","The management should establish a good training foundation for leaders, as their role is critical.
The management should listen to new ideas and understand the new ways of working. Some are really open to changes that can benefit the organization.
The way they evaluate people can be improved as this is only based on numbers and results the behaviour must be incorporated here as well, yes there is a subjectivity part but I think there are items that can be added like if the employee has projects, initiatives, if they joined company activities, etc. The goals that they have must be aligned with the goals of the managers as well- What's the rationale? While the team members are achieving their targets the leaders are achieving theirs too at the same time.
They should look at the extended breaks happening in different teams, this unproductive time can be used by helping out other teams, or doing projects. The team leaders I think some of them are just letting this slide but if you compute it thousands are being lost in the process. 
I hate to say this but this is a group of undisciplined individuals who can just easily get away with things violating the code of conduct which they have created within."

1561,,Factset Philippines - worst job in my life,2019-03-12,1.0,Financial Analyst,Work-life balance is not too bad. .,"Had been working there for around 1 year in 2015-2016 as a ""financial analyst"".
Absolutely the worst job I have ever had and the worst company I've ever seen. Absolute majority of the management is unqualified, the company is extremely cheap, paying low wages to empoyees, while trying to pretend to be nice by giving employees insultingly cheap ""gifts"" like small packs of the cheapest you can find juice or unhealthy and pretty much uneatable by normal people food.
But the most important part and the reason why I want to leave the review, is the office. The company doesn't care about it's employees health. It's a typical closed office space with a lot of aircons. The aircons are not maintained right, no one cleans them ever (to cut cost, which seems like an obvious reason). This effects employees who get sick very often due to the constantly weakened immunity system. This is a well-known problem not just among the Factset employees, but also among employees of other corporations (I'm guessing they are also cheap and treating employees as an expandable material) occupying other floors of the building. It is very easy to see how a job in Factset ruins people's health, relatively slowly but steadily.
Advicing everyone NOT to consider a job in this company.
P.S.: oh yeah, forgot to mention - Factset promotes itself as a reputable American company. Do not be fooled. The Manila subdivisiin is managed primarily by Facset's Indian subsidiary. So expect indian ""high standards"" in everything."

1601,,"Came to Launch a Career, Stayed to Build One",2019-01-23,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"I came to FactSet several years ago to launch a career.  At the time, my plan was to build the necessary skill sets that would allow me the opportunity  to eventually work for a FactSet client. However,  having worked in other organizations prior to taking a job at FactSet, I came to realize what an incredible culture and opportunity I had walked into. I determined relatively quickly that FactSet was a place where I would  build a career. Several years later, I have never been more confident that I made the right decision. FactSet continues to be a place where I have challenged myself and grown personally and professionally. 

FactSet is at the forefront of Finance and Technology and is well positioned for growth, despite a challenging market for many of its clients.  Senior Management has a sound game plan to capitalize on increasing market share and driving the company forward. 

As the organization has grown and evolved, career advancement opportunities have accelerated for employees. 

The opportunity to work with smart, intelligent, driven, and team oriented individuals across management and individual contributor roles is the backbone of a strong and innovative culture.",The organization is playing a bit of catch up on core corporate functions as it evolves from a small to a larger company.

No disrespect intended (hey, I work here too), but if you’re a B- or below talent then you can find a stable and safe career here. 9-5 job and very little in terms of stress or repercussions in non-sales career paths.

Better perks (not pay) than most of our clients (healthcare, snacks, happy hours, vacation, etc.) but laughably less than comparable tech firms in the same cities.","Offshoring operations to Philippines and India all the while importing bodies from ‘western’ countries to offset lack of internal candidates in the States (lowers EMEA/AsiaPac talent pools as well as domestic morale and wages).

Compensation
* $60K ($70K in SF) domestically to start (college new hire)
* Rated 1-5 every 6M; 1=~$5k, 2=~$3k, 3=~$1.5k, 4=$0, 5=Fired
* Above is rough 3 year averages for raises 

* Ratings are on a weighted curve; eg: 10% of employees can be rated a “1” and they are trying their best to move to an annual compensation review (already done in the SBUs).

* Can earn near $100k after 5 years at top rating (again only 10% clip due to distribution and no one is rated 1-2 in first year); problem is every coastal start-up, large client, or reputable tech company pays that in 1-2 years for similar Customer Success or Analyst roles.

* Realistically not eligible for bonus until in Sales or as a ‘Senior’ Manager (still <=~$10k); have to crush goal or be fairly senior (10+ years) for anything meaningful. Stock options exist, but in 5+ years of being 1-2 rated I’ve yet to receive any, but your mileage may vary.

Much more not listed, but suffice it to say the cons greatly outweigh the benefits in the 2018/19 economy. Best thing that could happen to FactSet would be another recession."

- Free lunch 4 days a week and free snacks/drinks (Some people call it Fatset for a reason)
- Good benefits (Holiday allowance is good, benefits range is decent)
- Great work life balance
- Flexible working
- Despite some complaints of tightening up on expenses and some finance silly rules Factset generally has a good travel policy, decent hotels and an efficient expenses claims system","- Pay pay pay pay pay. Everyone complains about pay, salaries are low compared to the market average, and bonuses are non-existent for consultants and shrinking for Sales. Management decided to take away commission based schemes for Sales people, so no transparency and rewards not at all commensurate with performance.

- Factset is actually quite a political organisation despite being a nice place to work. Promotions tend to go to people who know the right people, but unlike other companies its not outward or obvious (i.e. people arent constantly front stabbing each other but behind the scenes there is a lot of political manoeuvring).

- Company is constantly expanding, with some big acquisitions but then has no clue what to do with what it has bought hampering the ability for the company to take out the competition.
- CEO has been at the company a long time but struggles with a vision that excites people."

Nice hardware is given to employes","I was hired from industry as automation engineer to be part of the QA of the main product of factset.
My journey so far has been full of surprises and disbeliefs about the things that happen in this team
Automation they have implemented is a disaster. Joke is a very small word to use in order to describe it.

Technically incapable and incompetent people are put in place as automation leads. They do not let people from industry do anything to improve automation, nor they have the capability to do it on their own. They are more worried about job security hence do not let new people with outside experience change things to improve and overshadow them.

About people management aspect, there is absolutely no process or professional approach. There are certain individuals who are at team leader level in QA Analyst teams. They do not have minimum communication skills, product knowledge, QA knowledge and management skills. They have established strong ties with associate directors and senior directors/SVPs from US office in this QA team and influence them. They consistently do not follow of process and professionalism.

People in local QA manager position in this team are hired from outside, and come with strong testing and automation background. But the team leaders bypass the managers to go to Associate Directors and Senior Directors/SVPs in US office, for all matters. The Associate Directors and Senior Director/SVPs are intentionally entertaining these team leaders.

Senior director level people in my SBU QA team are very good as people, but are underskilleed. They spent a decade in the company to build good relations with top management and grown to senior director/SVP level. They do not have QA skills, management skills, and lack automation and computer science background. Because of the lack of skillset, they are being regularly fooled by few individuals in the team"

It does have 9000+ employees, but the culture feels more like a medium size company. It's pretty relaxed and everyone was friendly. Really good vibe, and I loved my team and people. I wouldn't have a problem going back to work for FactSet.","It was difficult to switch teams and thus difficult to grow as an Engineer if you are in the same team for this many years. I couldn't switch teams and learn different technologies and stacks.

Also I feel that senior management is wasting a lot of money trying to bring in upper management talent and are not really giving enough yearly raises to the engineers and other employees. Also money is being wasted hosting presentation events in expensive places (That are not even in the US). The previous CEO Phil Hadley would have events that all of the employees could see directly from his desk wearing casual clothing. This costs nothing. There is no reason spending $30,000 on an event in Germany when all of the engineers could see senior management for free directly from a room at HQ."

- Work-life balance is alright, however, there is also on-call, so depending on the team you might have to carry your laptop around with you 20% of the time and likely get paged in the middle of the night. You are not compensated for days of free time lost due to pages of unstable systems.","- Unexcusably low pay raises for top performers.

1863,,Egotistically Driven Feature Factory,2017-11-01,1.0,Software Engineer,"- INCREDIBLE  Healthcare plan. I doubt I'll ever get a health plan this good again.

- Work life balance well in favour of the employee (unless you have on-call)

- Starting salary for fresh out of college employees is pretty good.","- Raises are poor, and our stock price was used as a justification for them being low.  (no mention of revenue or profits, which have been stable or climbing) No performance bonuses for younger employees (maybe it's different for more senior personnel, but I'm not sure), so don't bother working hard here, you won't be rewarded. On call is not compensated.

- Managers pay extensive lip service to quality engineering, that is not backed up with action. You'll in-fact be penalised if you're focusing on quality engineering over just shipping features, even if they're dangerous/flakey/poorly implemented.

- ""Developer Services"" is a division of the company responsible for maintaining infrastructure and tech for developers. They're awful obstructions to your job.  The test system is flakey (not counting the actual tests themselves), build system is slow and often incorrect, and there was no supported way to generate documentation using tools by senior engineers; you had to do it manually, and they didn't care. Your life as a developer is going to be made worse as a result of this division.

- Low motivation due to outsourcing, low engineering standards. Senior management lies about out sourcing (we were ""expanding"" into the Philippines and India), but many of the teams I depended on for databases/infrastructure were entirely in the Philippines. No documentation/brittle tests and no desire to change this.

- Most hires are new college grads. Many of these are non-native english speakers who form cliques around their native languages. As someone who only spoke English, I sometimes felt isolated or like I was walking into a different country.

- Satellite offices leave you feeling out of the decision making processes.

- Terrible managers, who do little to support you in your job, and your growth as an engineer."
1864,,"Good place to work as an engineer, needs a CTO though",2017-10-31,4.0,Senior Software Engineer,"- Exposure to a wide variety of technologies
- Generally smart, friendly, and helpful coworkers. Most employment horror stories don't apply to FactSet, everybody is decent here.
- A companywide appreciation for work/life balance. You won't be expected to work more than a standard work week (other than rotating oncall duties), but if you want to do more, you will find opportunities for that.
- Compensation is probably above average for software engineers. After a number of years you will also be eligible for stock options
- Good health insurance

Overall, I think this is a good place to develop a software engineering career. The only places that might be better are engineering-driven organizations like Google and Facebook, though every place comes with its own disadvantages.","I updated my review because I wanted to express my disagreement with the recent decision not to find a new CTO. Instead of a CTO they will have something like a Chief Product and Technology officer. Don't get me wrong, the product developers need a seat at the C-level. But even with the new SBU structure, there needs to be a single person who is responsible ONLY for engineering. 

I think this could end up being a very bad decision, because without central leadership engineering is at risk of stagnating/fracturing, especially since the engineers will also be divided into different strategic business units now. This also comes at a bad time, because solving stability issues will require strong leadership.

Other cons:
-  Engineering is seriously lacking in internal documentation
- There is some risk you could have a mediocre manager, though you can apply internally to change teams after 1.5 years or so
- Less cutting edge work than Google or Facebook, but closer to the cutting edge than most other companies and improving consistently
- Less support for H1B workers than some other companies (specifically I think they don't sponsor you the first year if you will have been with the company less than 6 months). Ask the recruiter for details on what to expect."

One day you could be telling someone how to shut off the mobile app and another day you could be building out entire performance reports for a whole firm. After few years of consulting, the bad starts to outweigh the good, but you have to go out and fetch your new job internally. 

Transition times between consulting and other jobs take too long, which means in addition to the forced 2.5 yrs in consulting, you can tack on another 3 months of transition time before you can stop answering your previous clients. Internally, the firm is seeking to change the consulting model, but that'll mean a good chance of trial and error for a few years before they get it right.

No one has any idea of what is data and research. People from non-finance domain manage core finance domain teams. Managers have no idea on what the data is, all they is play around with charts and show reports that are no way related to product or goal of the organization. 

The Management is comprised of 2 or 3 people (with one leading by just shouting). His vision of the company is more important than the Mission Statement of the company itself. With his outstanding methods of evaluation, the essence of research has been washed away. No one comes to work with a commitment, they come to work and leave. You have no idea of how you will be evaluated and you don't even know if you will get a reward or a PIP. 
Everyone is rated on a common sheet which has no logic. No one knows what operations is but everyone uses the term wherever needed. A lead need not know what his team does, he needs to know operations (God know operations of what). You will be evaluated based on your desperation at work and not output. Also, attractive females get perks like early promotions (if you are close to Management) reasons which are known to no one."

Therefore, compensation ends up uniform across teams, even when certain teams heavily outperform others.
-- Boring projects on old technology (if you work on the wrong team)
-- Significant effort underway to move engineering overseas - don't get in now.
-- They tend to promote based on tenure, not fitness for management or vision for the company. So middle managers tend to get in the way and make bad choices
-- Every year the raises get smaller, and fewer people get bonuses & equity. New CEO has prioritized hiring more C-level execs and spending more on marketing."
2106,,Great Place to Start Your Career,2016-10-22,5.0,Content Manager,"The company is still growing, which translates into generous benefits and decent salaries for the people who work there.  The free food and excellent health insurance plans are particularly noteworthy. 

The people who work here tend to be very smart, but still down-to-earth and approachable.  Additionally, they have a well-established system for internal recruiting, which allows employees to avoid getting stuck in the department that hires them.","The performance review system is too simplistic.  Consequently, many employees that slightly exceed their managers' expectations end up with the same raises as employees who either meet or fall a bit short of those expectations.  FactSet gives good raises to significant out-performers, but only if they work in departments that contribute significantly to the firm's bottom line.

Also, at least in my department, you need to get several promotions before you're eligible for a bonus."
2107,,Great place to work,2016-10-21,4.0,Consultant,"I think best parts about FactSet are the people and the exposure to the financial industry.
FactSet clearly hires certain pedigree of people and you will be guaranteed to be working with likely minded multinationals. There are plenty of informal afterwork events which enable you to connect with others. You will also be working with people who are brought up within the company since only a minority join the company without going through the initial ""boot camp"".

Depending on the team you work for you are prone, sooner or later, to get a fair amount of responsibility early on. This can be quite stressful to start with, but eases after the learning curve on product and content balances out. If you can develop into a person who truly understands banking, buy and sell side connections, and other links and megatrends within the industry - you will be very valuable.

The company benefits are great in my opinion, the schemes are generous and allow you to include your better half in them too.

Financial industry will need market data solutions today and in the future and there won't be a shortage of work on this field (think about regulation!).","Depending on the team your work can be rather monotonous after learning the ropes and your core tasks don't necessarily challenge or enable you to grow as a professional. There are career paths to pursue within the company, but FactSet still has the heritage of ""consultants going to sales"" and that's it. To be fair, the management is aware of this and there is genuine motion to change things.

Part of your role is also to build or heal relationships with your clients - and depending on the account there are plenty of them. Occasionally with your efforts to connect with clients you will feel as if you are trying to draw blood out of a stone. Having that said, consultants perform a wide variety of tasks and two days are seldom alike, thus it's also easy to lose focus on what's important.

I don't think communication is strong within the company; teams in my opinion are very siloed and sometimes I wish that division of labour and assignments could be better. Fair to say, any company would benefit from more efficient resource management."

The RPD tool is a fantastic Project Management tracking system, and they should look into selling this out as a product in addition to the workstation.","They aren't very flexible about position relocation within the company. It is possible, but isn't common/encouraged.  
Additionally, the specific manager/team you have matters majorly, so seeing (in an interview/phone call) if you could speak with your prospective manager to determine a proper fit. 
The work can get dull and repetitive quickly, and they don't push building marketable skill sets as much as other companies I have worked at, so this leads to a higher turnover rate, particularly in younger workers.

CFA is paid for and you can get bonuses (but you have to stay a few years until it's vested)

Benefits are amazing - 3 wks vacation, good dental, vision, health

Free food M-Th (or con?  this is a ploy to have you stay at your desk and work through lunch)

Excellent training -- you'll be sent to Norwalk or London for initial training which lasts a month, and then to accounts training a few months later which lasts for about a week; you'll get a stipend and your hotel will be paid for

People -- most are nice; there are a few nasty people and office politics is inevitable, but overall a good environment with smart and friendly coleagues","Know what you're getting into--this is NOT a finance job no matter how they spin it, it's a tech support job that revolves around financial data.  When I was working it was phones support all the time.  My friend who still works there says that they now have instant messaging.  You'll be on phones or instant messaging minimum 5, sometimes 8 hours a day for your first few months.  If you get a call you're expected to figure out the solution on the fly.  If you can't you'll have to get back to the client, and then go on ready for another call.  As you might guess your workload just piles up more and more unless you figure out a system on your own to stop that.  There's a app that monitor's everybody's time on phones, how many calls they took and other stats.  You'll feel like you're being micromanaged--because it's true.  If you are stressed out easily, DON'T apply here.

Once you move onto accounts and have your own clients, don't expect the workload to get any easier.  There can easily be 300+ clients that you're responsible for supporting.  If they have a question on how to build a formula or format a graph, the burden is on you to get it done.

For 90% of the time your clients are the ones who are doing the analysis, and you are the tool they'll be using to get that analysis done.  Many times you will feel like you are being used by your clients.  It doesn't come as a surprise that during my first few months working there 4 or 5 of my collegues who were hired around the same time as me left to pursue better opportunities.  I should have left earlier, as I was looking for a true finance related job.

For the first year you'll be working--a lot.  They may say during the interview that there's a great work life balance, but more often than not meetings/reviews/online classes will be scheduled during your lunch hour.  Lunch ""hour"" is more like Like ""half-hour"" as 4 out of 5 times you'll still be on phones.  If you get a call at 12:29 it's your duty to stay on until that call is done; if that call ends at 1:00, well, you're lunchtime just got cut 30 minutes.

I was easily working over 60 hours when I started, and I know some of my colleagues who were working even more, especially when their client requests piled up.

As many other reviewers said, there is little room for advancement if you don't want to go into sales down the road or product development.

Bad engineering practises and manager pleasing attitude is prevalent across all management hierarchy. Most of the people working in the company have no clue what company does and how they make money. The culture is like a financial bank where you have to report your manager with the monotonous work you are given every week. Creativity is not encouraged nor professional growth. 

I worked there for 2.5 years because I got used to doing nothing. The company just wants cheap mediocre engineers to keep things going on. Many people stick to the company because of their personal gain and have no professional interest within FactSet. Poor coding practises and legacy code is all over the place. Too much of internal politics to push back work. All managers try to please each other instead of focusing the real work done. There are always some re org changes going on. Upper management has no clue about their products. 

It's really a good company for mediocre people. Afterall not everyone is ambitious. 
All smart people leave the company in less than a year. Those who can't find a job are just stuck there."

* Pantry filled with free snacks and soft drinks.","* Huge inconsistency in how various teams and departments are run, so the overall quality of one's general work experience can be hugely dependent on the luck of the draw when one is assigned to a team (such as when initially applying and being hired).
* Engineers are generally kept very much separated and isolated from other departments, especially the sales side, so required interactions (to respond to client issues and the like) can sometimes be somewhat tense and unpleasant due to the general social psychological principle of communication with an ""Unfamiliar Them"" often being more difficult and more prone to misunderstandings and latent subconscious attitudes about dealing with another group that one perceives is treated wildly differently from oneself.
* A very outdated codebase that as an Engineer, one will frequently have to dig through to implement a requested change or bug fix, including, but not limited to, code written for an OS that is technically obsolete, with much of the current Engineering work being part of a multi-year effort to completely remove the reliance on this obsolete OS by re-writing code to be compatible with Linux.
* Company-wide move to converting all office space to open-floor plans leading to increasingly noisy and distracting workplace.
* Engineering advancement seems to largely fizzle out after one makes Senior Software Engineers, with a combination of hard work, managerial/people skills, and luck required to be offered any real expansion in role or responsibilities beyond that point."

- They do a great hiring process of recruiting the same kind of personalities who make the ordeal better.","The interview process was a giant lie, they go on about how you will have a great work/ life balance and only work from 8:30-5:30. In reality you are working at the office until 7pm or later most days. On top of this you also have projects and client work you have to take home and work on in your free time and weekends. They constantly schedule meetings during your lunch hour, which you don't get anyway because you have so much work you are expected to always work through it. 

The job role itself is a glorified call center agent with you often feeling you are chained to the desk. (This is not a finance role, no matter what they tell you.)They scare you to make you feel like you can not go on ""not ready"" making you feel like you can barely nip out to go to the bathroom. This only gets worse after Accounts Academy, you will now have 8 hours of phones a day plus clients. Every minute of your day is taken trying to juggle clients requests, phones, schedule client meetings, then manage trading your phones so you can go to these meetings.

Management is terrible, they lack communication and management skills. They promote in FactSet for how long you have been with the company not with what skills you bring to the table. Meetings with your manager can be painful and they take every opportunity to criticize your work.

If you want to work in Finance go somewhere else, no one knows what FactSet is, this job has very few transferable skills to help you get a job elsewhere. After being a consultant for 2 years you only have two career options in the company; move into Sales or Product Development. Most people are looking for other positions well before this. Most consultants I spoke with have one foot out the door after Accounts Academy, this is when they all realize the job, stress, and workload are not worth it. 

Do NOT work here, go somewhere you will feel valued, appreciated and intellectually stimulated."

Consequently, as an experienced engineer, I didn't have much opportunity to work on new things. I got stuck in a boring group working on boring libraries. I asked to be transferred several times to no avail. Since most of the people don't have much industry experience, they make some stupid design decisions.

It can get very stressful and aggravating handling 15-20 calls a day in which you are doing a lot of the work for your clients or answering mind numbingly easy questions. 

Management does little to inspire and motivate workers and will take any opportunity they can to criticize your work. Reactive is the best word to describe your day to day tasks as issues come up and clients call with problems. If you do not handle stress well DO NOT take this job.

2432,,Good at first - beware of the long-term,2015-02-20,2.0,Software Engineer,"Pay: The pay, at first, when I joined FactSet was generous as a graduate.

People: The people on your level are the ones that make FactSet a great place to work. I can honestly say that in the time I have had here, it has been an excellent experience and I have never had tension with any of my co-workers. Many of whom, have become friends.

Environment: As a Software Engineer you are not client facing so are able to feel comfortable in your working environment to get coding done. People are able to talk to one another and share ideas and have general discussions.

Technologies: FactSet, fundamentally built a lot of the tools creating in-house propriety technologies, however that is slowly changing and transitional tools and skills are being brought into the company.

Career: If you wish to have job security and a guarantee that you will be rewarded for loyalty - FactSet is ideal. Those who have been at the company a long time and moved into management are rather happy with their roles. I am unable to predict the future, but modern technologies are now being introduced to FactSet which may mean newer engineers have better opportunities.","Pay: After realisation of the competitiveness in other companies, I realised pay here is definitely not matching software companies in London. As years went by, I realised that people in other companies were receiving bonuses and also larger pay rises which made me sceptical of the salaries here for Software Engineers. Alongside that fact, in company wide meetings we were all told that Sales would receive a ""Chairman's Club"", which meant they would have luxurious settings in Europe, US etc for meetings when they met their targets - meaning Software Engineers were angered and frustrated by this.

People: Regarding the management, it seems managers are not assessed, they are given the role of manager when they have been here for some time rather than actually accessing their skills. I think a real interview process is necessary when deciding who should become a manager - not word of mouth or ""You have been here some time and proven you're a good Software Engineer"", leading code and people are two different things.

Environment: The company promotes a start-up culture but that is beginning to fade as policies are being put in place that is beginning to remove this kind of culture. 

Technologies: As a Software Engineer that had been in the company for many years, newer, transitional, technologies are now being brought into the company which I do not have much experience with - meaning when looking for new career choices in Software Engineering they are limited due to the older legacy technologies where most of the time was spent when coding. 

Career: Motivation is key, unless you are self-motivated, work can become mundane. At times exciting projects arise but if you demonstrate that you are a trustworthy employee, the company will rely on you to do tasks that are irrelevant to your personal goals and achievements you wish to reach."

The environment does not appeal to the most ambitious employees, many of whom leave FactSet after 1 or 2 years to work for more challenging companies. There is a TON of red tape involved in switching teams, and the company is organized such that many teams have work that is very unnapealling to younger engineers.

-loads of new things to learn
-Loads of Modern Front End Technologies 
-Work with multiple languages (Java, C#, python etc etc.. we use all of them in someway)
-Resume becomes extremely marketable very quickly (Thomson Reuters and Bloomberg will bombast your linkedin accounts)","-Inexperienced developers (Start an application from scratch with mostly recent grads, and no one on the team had serious experience working with any of the tools before starting the project)
-Heavy handed with H1B visas (Team of 8 people, 12 of them including both managers are H1B visa holders)
-Inexperienced managers. (Poor people skills, very unsympathetic, F.O.B. level foreign) 
-Too much bureaucracy (I need to go through 6-7 different processes and involve 10-12 people on the team in order to submit a bug fix or new 
-OLD ARCHAIC BACKEND, we have to write C++ code to compile with limited debugger and development tools on a OpenVMS cluster. HP is about to discontinue this server technology. 
-Nothing is documented. Not even 20 year old server technology that we invented. 
-difficult to relate to product (How sexy does ""Financial Reporting/Analytic tools"" sound to someone on a date?)
-too ""corporate"" in the NY office. No one is upbeat or energetic and when you try to spread that enthusiasm you are met with a wall. (I guess that's a introverted engineer thing)"

Free lunch 4/5 days a week (almost free stipend in $8, many meals go over)
Friendly co-workers
Great new e-learning modules
Decent salary increases year to year, above inflation rate, but at times use small bonus in place of salary increase.

It's a great first job. Consultants and Engineers get training before starting.","Vacation days are not rolled over, some managers are more lenient, but it depends who you get.
No initial training for product developers or for internal job switchers and expected to learn via RPDs. Consultants are help-desk and many PDs do QA instead of getting to do more interesting aspects of the job so their skills are not maximized.
Many roles are being off-shored

Employees promoted based on time with the company so that many managers do not have any management skills and do not know how to work as managers overseeing a team. The company tries to give them training, but managers behave the same after the training. Managers do not motivate staff and do not help them grow by giving them added responsibilities.

Many employees are moved around since the company has a lot of restructuring. This increases the likelihood of employees leaving or of HR pushing them out due to not enjoying their new roles, teams or managers. For example, some people with 6 years at the company may have 6 different managers in that time. Terrible managers stay with the company even with bad reviews because of the time they have put in while good employees get pushed out if the manager does not like them. 

Advancement is limited particularly around 3-5 years with the company.

Tuition reimbursement is a lie. Some teams can use it and others cannot but their isn't any clarity about the rules to request the funds or who can get it. Apparently their is a sort of wait-list, but it isn't posted so no one knows who is on it or not allowing for preferential treatment of certain employees to get it. In addition to the ""list"", your manager also has to approve the course as being directly related to your role, which some managers may not do even when your role requires the information from a job related course. The company prefers that employees work on the CFA although it can be less related to our job then a particular course."

-Dependents are now covered by medical reimbursement.","-monotonous job and very limited growth in terms of skills

-no training or learning opportunity outside the country

-hot desking

-I hate that they changed their sick and vacation leave scheme. It's a bit inconsiderate to have a medical certificate for one day sick leave. It is not every time that we need to go to the doctor just to have us check for something that can be treated obviously with proper rest and paracetamol. It is very stressful for an unwell person to go to the hospital/clinic and to wait uncomfortably for his/her turn in the doctor's office just to secure a medical certificate. I was even reprimanded by a doctor one time when I went to him in a sickly state just to secure a med cert. In the end all I got was an advice to get plenty of rest, water, and some paracetamol. Now just imagine the inconvenience it made. I just hope that someone would end the stupidity of requiring a medical certificate for one day sick leave.

-a day off from work should be filed one week earlier. it's a joke, right? A week of vacation leave should be filed a month earlier...WTH. And oh, emergency leaves are limited to two per year. Like, is that really a probability? 

-I won't consider free sodas to be beneficial. They are unhealthy. I think everyone would appreciate if they could change some artificial juice drinks to bottled waters instead. Water dispensers are not really clean."

They distract them with things like happy hours, free lunches, vitamin water in the fridge, etc. where the hardest workers continue to get pushed harder and are significantly underpaid relative to competitors.  They can also easily be distracted by internal politics for advancement opportunities meaning they will promote the more senior employee instead of properly staffing positions where qualified people with proven track records should be considered.

Many of the other benefits are also very nice.
- Employees start with 3 weeks' paid vacation.
- Monday-Thursday you get a subsidy for the cafeteria that is enough to cover lunch.
- Parents of newborns enjoy paid maternity/paternity leave.

The projects are interesting and challenging. FactSet is very goal-oriented, so others are motivated as much as you are.

The culture is healthy, and goals tend to be aligned from team to team.","FactSet has made some business decisions over the years that have put it in the position of needing to hire more engineers than it can.
- What FactSet was doing 20 years ago was state-of-the-art. The environment that we operate in today is archaic. Engineers have to put a lot of effort in to simply maintain what we have. They also will not typically get experience in what is the industry standard.
- We can't simply switch to what is state-of-the-art today because FactSet's clients do not like change. Over the years, bugs have become features. It is extremely difficult to make major infrastructure improvements, even if that means we fix bugs in the meantime.

Work-life balance is good, but more can be done to improve it.
- Many engineers have on-call responsibilities. Senior management and people in other departments do not appreciate how difficult it can be to work all night and then have to work all day.
- Having been at FactSet many years, I have seen perks diminish and go away entirely. I suppose these are natural growing pains, but I wanted to list these things anyway.
  - Home internet reimbursement for people with on-call responsibilities.
  - The ability to invite a date / spouse to the holiday party.
  - A summer picnic.
  - Lunch on Fridays.
  - The lunch subsidy is not increased for inflation.
  - Tuition reimbursement. (Used to be 100%. It went away entirely, then came back capped at what FactSet can deduct.)

These complaints are far outweighed by the positive side of working at FactSet. Overall, I am a happy employee."

FactSet hires creative, technical and sociable people, so be prepared to like your co-workers, minus a few rare exceptions.  They give quite a bit of responsibility off the bat, so you can sink pretty easily, but the people around you will help if you are motivated.  Also, roles tend not to have strict definitions, so it's not uncommon to wear multiple hats and juggle responsibilities.  The environment is pretty relaxed so managers are not far removed.  They also have a tendency to promote from within, which makes opportunities for advancement high.  Few companies can match their perks (insurance, 401K/IRA, ESOP, lunch, etc.).","-Tend to spread resources thin
-Too many simultaneous ""goal"" campaigns which are distracting
-Goals can sometimes be unrealistic, even for Pollyanna types.
-Either they jump into things or are slow to move
-They monitor markets and costs closely, so needs can go from just knocking on the door to running laps over your forehead before action is taken. Can create opportunity dry spells for both client growth and employee growth.
-Salaries tend to be just high enough to make it annoying to leave without becoming a banker, but low enough that you want something slightly higher and know is available if you actively looked.
-They don't provide raises for promotions, per se.  Comp is reviewed every 6 months.  You are eligible for a raise when comp is reviewed."

Company tends to hire people out of college (pro if you're out of college).  Lots of heavy drinking with peers.  Do not have to work hard/ stay late/ think outside of the box.  Compensation is very tight, and recognition does not sync with intellectual capital, or contribution.  Will look great on a resume for a few years of experience, or while you find another role with a client.  After you've been there for a bit, many come in late, lie about appointments in calendar, or work from home.  If you can get through the interview process, and seem to fit in with the culture, very easy to make a few key contacts, pretend you are an asset, and never have to really work.  Especially when you can choose the people who peer review you.","Two main downfalls I see.  
1) Very cliquey, non-flat/communicative, to the point of hurting business.  
2) The Peter Principle, people are promoted to their level of incompetence.

Managers largely are promoted who were decent at their old role, and with the company the longest.  Since the company grew rapidly over the past, you see this many places.  Leaving managers who can't really manage, think, or inspire.  A huge determent to the employees below them, and company as a whole.  To secure (or justify) their job, they create processes that are not the most efficient, and they are basically there to just barely manage personal relationships.  At the worst, they are not recognizing the talent below them.  This exacerbates the non communicative problem.  This has gone on for so long because of the practice of hiring people out of school, no one questions.  All of the best talent is hired away, left with the worst and least motivated."

- Sports events, summer outings, and team-building activities","- Depending on the department, work can be occasionally tedious and redundant.
- As a corollary to the previous statement, it is hard to pinpoint potentials for career growth.
- The compensation for OT, working, and nonworking holidays is rather inadequate.
- Branch is getting very crowded. People have to wait in line for a long time before finally logging in and out via the biometrics.
- Admin is slow at addressing employee concerns, especially when it comes to benefits and compensation."

2684,,"Unexciting, but fair",2012-05-14,4.0,Software Engineer I,"Excellent benefits and extremely flexible scheduling (i.e. if you need to work at home, take time for a medical appointment).  Engineering managers did a good job of filtering communication from Product Design and Consulting (i.e. all the facts you need, while protecting you from unnecessary interruptions from other departments).  Free snacks/drinks and free lunch (along with all manner of other free food) is a nice perk.  Excellent engineering tools in place (i.e. development environment, build system, source control).  Engineering department has a nice degree of autonomy.  Nice proximity to New York City (from Norwalk, CT location).  Length of work week is extremely reasonable (40-45 hrs. per week typically).","Not a great deal of creative freedom on projects, or places to input new ideas and/or suggest new projects if you're new.  Cafeteria food varies in quality, but free is free is free.  Fairfield County, CT can be expensive (although some parts are nice to compensate).  Pretty hierarchial in structure.  Engineers don't strike me as being miserable, but neither do they seem wildly happy."
2685,,"Complacent culture, cumbersome/menial work; More of IT support than consulting.",2012-05-11,2.0,Consultant,"Decent hours(don't work weekends), free lunch and free snacks, startup company culture. Colleagues are generally friendly, caring and helpful.","Most of the reviews on this website pretty much sum it up.

The work is cumbersome and trivial. None of the work is intellectually stimulating and there is no incentive/reward to try. The management team expects you to go the extra mile for every client no matter the  request. That is understandable, but you quickly realize that most of the required solutions make no practical sense.

This is a software company that tries to disguise it's ""consulting"" role as a finance related role. None of what you do is finance related. It is more backoffice IT support. You don't learn much after training as almost all clients call in with the same menial requests.

If you are a motivated/hardworking/smart individual this is definitely not the place to grow and develop."
2686,,Good and a learning experience.,2012-05-02,3.0,,Good environment.Nice people. Good managers.,Low salary base package.And small minded outlook among peers.

Interaction with some bright people in the finance industry. $55k starting base salary out of college, $2-5k salary increase every 6 months. Great collegiate environment.","The consultant position is very mundane work where you have to solve everyone else's problems. This position teaches you close to zero skills that are transferable to other positions in finance. In any position at Factset, but primarily at the consultant level, you are dealing with problems that wall st does not want to deal with. A typical problem is ""my numbers in Factset don't match Bloomberg's, can you help me?"" I would highly not recommend this job to anyone with any ambition to make it in finance. Do not be fooled when they tell you that you can move up in the company and that CEO Phil Hadley started at the consultant level. From the consultant level, you either move into product development or a junior sales role. I worked at Factset for a year, and while I was there, I watched 6 consultant quit their jobs to move onto better opportunities. In short, Factset breeds complacency and can not retain any talent within the company."

 they dont know how to treat financial engineers. Your niche skills are considered no better than a software engineer. Its a software company and its view of mathematical modeling is writing code!!!!!

Out of college, it's an excellent alternative to some of the other entry level jobs out there where you're stuck in a back room somewhere.  You're very quickly given a decent amount of responsibility and expected to get the job done.  Management isn't looking over your shoulder.",Company is getting bigger fast and red tape is increasing.  Communication from the top borders on dismal as the firm continues to grow.  Top of the company is a bit of an old boys club and the performance of some of that group is questionable.

No other place could you go and get the ability to work hand and hand with leading financial services companies on cutting edge strategies with direct interaction. The teams there were great and the company was going to great lengths with internal job fairs, internal training, working out of other offices(Tokyo & Sydney were a few that US based consultants worked)  and job shadowing to allow current employees to grow their careers.",Stay true to the vision of Chuck and Howard and avoid trying to change over to a Thomson model of personnel or acquisition.

2697,,Great Learning Experience,2012-03-06,4.0,Product Manager,"I was fortunate enough to have a manager who was very hands off and trustful of the work I did.  I was also given a decent amount of autonomy of the enhancements I released.  Management trusted my knowledge of the product and also my ability to work with the engineers. Because of that, I was able to put out many successful products.  When managers throughout the office have a little faith in your abilities, it can actually take you a long way.  The environment is very conducive for you to learn as much as possible.  The skills you learn there can be applied in many other companies.","Compensation, compensation, compensation.  I received a handful of offers and all of them were more then what FactSet was paying me.  To be fair, it's management strategy to keep costs low.  I don't fault them.  It's just plain facts.  Work/life balance is fantastic there so it's a sacrifice most existing employees are willing to make.  I figured I'd join the rest of the crowd who complain about salaries at FactSet.

On another note, I noticed employees who come through acquisitions are under qualified for the positions that were handed to them on a silver platter.  It's absurd to me how little some of those people know about FactSet.  There should be a yearly quiz on how to write a simple =FDS code.  You'd be shocked at how many ""managers"" in the company sneak by without knowing it.  Shocked.  You know who you are.  You shammers."

-You are basically a call center and will continue to be on phone support for your first 2 years
-No tasks in this position actually feel important (you answer helpdesk calls, email clients asking them to meet you so you can show them new product features - and most of them turn you down)
-""Client visits"" often make you feel unimportant because often times your clients simply do not care that they have FactSet on their computers and wondering why you insisted on showing up in person
