Executives spend a lot of time doing things that seem to offer little value 
Fannie Mae is in an awkward position where they are neither government or a public company, so management tends to do things for political reasons rather than making choices that actually make sense

Strategy around compensation and benefits is perplexing, company has made billions in profit the last few years, yet froze salaries this year and cut benefits which probably saved a trivial amount relative to the capital reserves needed  but had big impact on employee morale.

- Internal hire process is sketchy, people who clearly has no skills for the position he applied for and yet get to be teach lead. Often people who talks more gets promoted even with little technical skills.
- Lowballing new and old employees.
- process is PAIN. People will push responsibilities to each other and problems are often left unresolved.

Promotions are slow to a point to even become manager you’ll have to wait 4 years and forget about becoming director unless you’re closely attached to VP.  Very narrow view to adopt best practices and making things complicated is their specialty, don’t forget to ask about there remediation follow up process. People normally suffer in silence and there is no clarity on how to get move to next level since Managers would never leave there will never be any positions open.

What makes it worse is even when the team back fills a senior staff that has left, the opening is usually a junior staff position. Poor hardworking junior staff never get to move up. By saving a little cost in this way it lowers morale deeply and doesn’t help keep good employees."

319,,Great place to start a career,2021-04-21,5.0,Associate,"Overall I think Fannie Mae is a great place to work at. They provide a very competitive salary with some of the best benefits I have ever seen in a company. Bottom level employees start with 3 weeks PTO, 2 weeks paid sick leave (which everyone uses as PTO), 1 day a month to volunteer somewhere while paid, they pay out $10k to help you towards buying a home, great 401k match, the list can go on for a while. During covid no one received a pay cut which in itself is a true blesssing and also speaks to the resiliency of the business. Great work culture. They are committed to career development. I feel like my managers listen to where I want to go with my career and position me into projects that would support that. Any training i have ever asked for has been approved and paid for. Also with such a large company you are always working in a multi discipline environment and getting to work along side people of diverse work backgrounds has been such a great experience for my career. Definitely would recommend working at Fannie Mae.",There is a a lot of bureaucracy and political-ness amongst various business units. The company is so big that departments are operating as somewhat separate companies and will compete for similar business. Some coordination in this would seem like an easy way for the company to save money.

It's a 37.5-hour work week, and there are early Fridays.

Fannie Mae is big into work-life balance, as well as providing volunteer opportunities.","It's really slow getting any work done because of so many layers of approval. To sign something off, you may need up to fifty different eyes on it, plus government approval. Most projects take years to get done because of the levels of vetting and authorization. 

There's not always enough work to do, so several people coast in their roles. Most managers don't mind this, but for people that want to come to work to do work, this could be frustrating. 

Your experience at Fannie Mae can be totally different depending on the manager that you have. Some managers are great and promote great team morale, while others do not. So your experience really depends on which team, which director, and which vice president you have.

- work two weekends each month during month end and quarter close

- a lot of meaningless meetings and boring work, you copy/pasting excel, check excel formulas to make sure the data output is correct, have a TONS of meeting, making sure the input data was correct

- their SOPs are outdated, so you have to learn the process on your own and as you work. You can ask your friendly colleague (most of them are nice, only some are knowledgeable) if you have questions but manager will think you cannot perform your work

-my manager was borderline abusive. Calling and emailing you at 10pm and weekends. Force people to weekly training meeting with no end goal. No people skills. If you ask them too many questions, they will start judging your ability to perform your work

- their database legacy system are... legacy / outdated, makes it difficult to obtain data. You have to ask another team to get the data for you, which mean others will do the same thing. It makes the work frustrating since half of your time is waiting for data and it might be wrong

- they just change their corporate structure to make it harder for people to advance / get promotion. There are a lot more layers, more entry, middle, and manager titles before you will ever get promoted. for current employee, it's like everyone got demoted

- rotation program is selective and based on favorites, you have to go behind your manager to apply for other jobs within the firm
- promotion is based on position availability and favorites. 

- No bonus structure for employee (even thou they say they have one), management will always get their bonus

- you have a bi-weekly meeting w/ your manager and a monthly one with your director. Then you have a daily huddle 15 min meeting (if you are lucky, or it usually go over). On top of those, you might have one or two meetings every other day
- tons of employee surveys to fill out, management does not take them seriously unless  it's favorable critique

I loved my job, pay was great and all FTE's received a bonus.  The past 2 years, upper management has made it very clear that they will continue to get a large bonus, while the working class get little to nothing.  If you are not a manager or above, a bonus is a thing of the past

They are hiring contractors by the truckload as many people are leaving to go to different companies.    The brain drain is due to all the items above I noted.  Do not expect to get a bonus if you are just a normal FTE.  Upper management had protected their bonus structure and for anyone they are protecting.  Everyone else will lose thousands. 

Upper management like to push their product and leave the products that are actually customer with no updates or budget to complete improvements.  They only way you will move up in the company is being a yes man to anyone above you.  UM states they want to hear different ideas, but if you are not towing the line for their pet project, forget it. 

Fannie wants to be the google of the mortgage industry.  Google pays well, Fannie does not anymore.   Thankfully, I will be leaving soon, like so many others."

Things don't get done at the pace that you would expect things to get done. Too much control on technology and software in the name of security, which itself becomes a hindrance to progress. Decision makers at the senior levels sometimes purely get there due to seniority and may not make decisions that are always best for the organization/team from a long term perspective. Performance evaluation cycles are a sham and all attempts to make it better fundamentally have only resulted in changes to the software/user experience related to the self-assessment write up, which probably accounts for nothing significant at the end of the day.

Contractors have their own seating areas, equipped with smaller desks along the corridors. When employees get new DELL Precision laptops, contractors get used HP. By the way, contractors are prohibited from attending FM's team building activities. This rule is published on FM's website. I can see some employees do not hide their disdain towards contractors. I have witnessed contractors being yelled by employees. I would like to say, a sort history as a contractor at FM is a good experience, for it will teach you how to stay humble."

- Salaries are subpar for Washington, DC (prepare to have a roommate)
- Bonuses are miserable.
- Directors and VP’s get special treatment. They break all the rules and nothing happens
- Some VP’s abuse benefits. They will spend over $100k traveling and staying at hotels so that they can live the good life at a cheaper city while hard workers have to find ways to afford living in DC
- Performance Management tool is a joke. Everybody knows it, everybody complains about it and nothing is done to change it. Managers will sacrifice new employees to give more senior employees a better rating since a bell curve needs to be satisfied. So, you will not get the subpar 3% they “guarantee” even if you meet expectations. Same goes for the “bonus”
- I moved offices 3 times in under a year. Signed a year lease and was never told we would be moving prior. I found during orientation
- Management thought it would be fair to just give a $1,200 yearly raise to offset moving the office to midtown. That is not enough to cover gas and parking. Most people will need to spend an extra 30 minutes commuting and pay more in rent to live closer. 
- People are rude in the company as most people in DC
- VIP parking (within the same building) was assigned via a “lottery”. Two drawings and “surprisingly” all managers and above got a spot
- Serious ethical issues such as directors wanting others to fail to look good or just say “I told you so”
- Constant power struggle amongst management
- No one works on Fridays; they just keep Jabber active and pretend to be working
- No assigned offices. There is a 40% deficit in available seats in the new building. Let’s see how that works out on Mondays through Thursdays
- Life balance is non-existent. Managers will make you work on weekends and holidays. They will not explicitly tell you, but give you deadlines that leaves that as the last resort"

So do not expect leads to help you if you're new. You will be directed through lead, manager, and director. Directors and managers will back folks who have been there for really long time. You will be disrespected by other FTE in your department. This organization is completely dishonest with you from the day you're hired until you're laid off or fired. HR department is another joke. Call them and you will get someone who's barely passed high school and their attitude will be touching the sky. They say people who leave these kind of comments weren't doing their job. The truth is this organization will treat you like slave and you will be working 24/7.

841,,Not for everyone,2017-11-28,1.0,Product Designer,Compensation and certain team members.,"Mortgage industry subject-matter expertise is respected more than domain or discipline expertise. The organization has too many lifers who are unwilling to adapt or change. It takes forever to get critical software approved and you are expected to be grateful for what they can provide for you. You have limited resources as a designer to do your best work, especially when you are being asked to compromise research for the sake of shipping products.

Half of the company doesn't even know Fannie Mae has an internal design team, which results in duplicative projects all over the organization that may not even address the real needs of customers. Research is not respected and insights are too biased to be useful. They have product owners who used to be business analysts and they have no idea what they are doing. There are too many cooks in the kitchen on projects and designers have the last seat at the table, if at all. The organization has huge silos within silos and no one communicates. It is VERY hierarchical and executives are more like dictators. They expect designers to be magicians who will help the organization become more customer-centered, but they are unwilling to set them up for success. 

The issues within the organization are systemic and deeply ingrained in the culture, and it will take a LONG time to establish the conditions necessary for the culture to shift. Some of the senior leaders are incredibly arrogant, direct and impersonal, and the culture can feel very bureaucratic, regimented, and lacklustre at times."

845,,Human Capital Planning - who can we lay off?,2017-11-07,3.0,Director,"Benefits, compensation, work life balance","Continually changing priorities and approaches has the firm in a constant state of flux. Much is said about a human capital plan, which may sound impressive but is essentailly a constant re-evaluation of who could be expendable. Another buzz phrase is shape shifting, which boils down to replacing more senior middle management with lower cost staff. The CIO actually stated that employees should consider a 18 month tenure a good run in the ""current environment"". Below the officer (VP) level the constant churn is discomforting. At the VP level and above the brain drain is on. If stability is important this isn't the place for you.

After 9 years of conservetorship parallel business plans are about to collide. The Obama administration planned on winding Fannie down with a plan of bringing the capital position to zero by Jan. 2018. Not only is Fannie still in place, it's delivering billions of dollars to Treasure each year. Those dollars are generated from gaurantee fees collected on qualifying mortgages to cover losses related to loan defaults: essentially insurance. But all of the money collected in fees is transferred quarterly to the US Treasury, so there'll no capital to cover related losses. As a result, Fannie Mae would need to draw from Treasury to cover quarterly losses. This is exacerbated by a lower than 35% Corporate Tax rate. Fannie Mae is still writing off losses, but the writeoffs assumed a 35% tax rate. A rate any lower decreases the value of the write-offs, which increases Fannie's tax liability. With no capital in 2018 there's no money to pay higher taxes."

They grasp onto every latest and greatest development and organizational methodology “du jour,” reap all of the glory for introducing a fresh idea to the company, and then push deployment of that fresh idea to their hopelessly overloaded middle management without any guidance, support and, in many cases, budget.

The biggest challenge of the company is that there are far too many people in the wrong roles. Technical people are doing process/project management work and analysts are performing in technical roles. People are shuffled around the company with no regard to their skill set or even job preference. While in many cases this shuffling is done for budget alignment and/or to save an individual whose role was eliminated, in the end this practice serves only to disrupt the masses, resulting in poorly defined and communicated processes, excessive task complexity and redundancy, and a lot of ticked off staff who are frustrated when they learn that the very task they’ve been putting their heart and soul into has also been delegated to another team or staff member."
931,,Director,2017-04-26,2.0,Director,Fannie Mae had great pay and benefits,"But it came at a cost.  Say one bad thing and you're toast.  You cannot disagree with officers, and if you do, your career will be put on hold through nefarious means - fewer staff reporting to you, no new projects, no visibility, etc.  It's the slow death."
932,,Sr. Project Manager,2017-04-24,1.0,Senior Project Manager,"Pay is competitive, benefits are competitive, work from home policy liberal depending on your boss.","I worked for Fannie Mae for about 4 yrs, a little over a year as a contractor and the rest as an FTE.  My nick name for Fannie Mae is ""Stepford"" after the famous original movie and remake.  Everyone walks around there with a fake ""installed"" smile on their face.  They will drink the Kool-Aid or they will be gone!  I was pulled over by my boss in the hallway for coughing on a conference call.  If you have seen the original or remake of the movie ""Stepford Wives"" you will get the idea.  My professional IT career stretches 37 years and I've worked for many different organizations during that time.  Never have I worked for an organization more concerned about the slightest “real” emotion emoted.  No expressed frustration allowed, no expressed anger allowed.  OK, I can hear you, this is someone with no social skills or someone who doesn’t know how to behave at work.  NO, I can assure you I’m not some crazy overly emotional person who runs up and down the hallways screaming that the sky is falling or acting like my hair is on fire. I’m a real person, and real people occasionally get frustrated and angry.
I transferred to my 2nd of two positions during my stint at Fannie a year before I was “laid off”.  I had 4 managers during that 1 year period of time.  What you see on Glassdoor reviews about re-orgs is absolutely true ─ very frequent.  They also execute lay-offs about once a quarter.  Maybe not unlike some organizations, but hopefully unlike most organizations, they use this lay off cycle to get rid of people they don’t like and don’t want to be bothered with going through formal HR steps that are required “in writing” by the organization to work with the employee to guide the performance of the employee to be more in line with their position or with the desires of their manager.
I was told by a colleague that my boss told said colleague that he thought I was a horrible PM (20+yrs experience) and that he planned to “manage me out”, i.e. make me so miserable I would “self-migrate” .  My bosses actions had already started to mimic that kind of behavior.  He was visibly, with malice of foresight, getting in the way of me doing the job I was hired to do.  After 37+ yrs as a professional,  it’s not like I’ve never seen this behavior before, but it had never been directed at me personally.  If you’ve never had this happen to you, well, great for you!  If so, I feel your pain.
This behavior stopped at some point after I confronted my manager, but the giant had just gone to sleep.  Next lay off, yep, I was gone.  Three days later, my old job was posted on the job boards.  Never a single word was said to me by my boss that there was a single issue with my performance or any guidance to modify my behavior or deliver anything more or differently than the status quo. 
With the exception of my boss, and the director who must’ve been complicit, I loved the work I did at Fannie Mae.  I was a “one stop shop” POC for the service my team provided.  I received multiple service awards and multiple glowing emails from customers who were extremely pleased with the service I provided.  I believe the issue was that I wasn’t subservient enough for my authoritarian boss who went to military boys school and has no college education what so ever."

Management hires and portrays false image and is not clear what they want. They lack accountability and credibility and work in groups, coterie of old favorites.

Fannie Mae is headed in the right direction.  More work needs to be done on shaping the culture to be slightly less toxic and stop tolerating jerks, but there is heart there.","On the flip side of the great people described above, there are some truly horrible people who can sour the experience quickly.  You see typical managers who aren't very good at managing; leaders who clearly ascended the corporate ladder at Fannie (or elsewhere) without ever needing to show an ounce of leadership or strategic thinking; and colleagues who are complacent.

Too much process and procedure to get much done in an efficient manner.  Cronyism is run rampant.  Vendors are push down to development teams through the vast number of VPs in the organization.  Vendors tend to have high rates and no skills.  Literally most kids out of college with good leaders can do much better, faster and for less cost.   Simple projects in other companies that take 4 our 5 people to do in 6 months, take a team of 40 to do in a year.  Poor quality code and workmanship is everywhere."
1276,,Technical Role,2015-06-12,3.0,,Good benefits. Good Compensation. Most people are good to work with. Only reason for 3 star is due to the good benefits.,A ship that is sailing blind. Millions wasted on large projects that take years to deliver (with questionable quality). Senior management is simply patting themselves on the back while the regular employees toil along. Agile development is a joke here since even the most well meaning person knows the organizational processes do not lend themselves to Agile. Heavy SDLC & useless PQO processes probably cost 1/4 of dollars to implement for large projects. One has to hire a small army to do the documentation and submit it for various approvals. Too many directors and managers. Layoffs need to focus on that layer next. Finally in technology Fannie Mae hires quantity and not quality. Very political between teams and organization.

There are some departments that seem to function normally, but it is the exception rather than the rule. If you find a bright leader to work under, stick with them, because there aren't many to be found. Support for volunteer activities was a plus.","Fannie Mae is a company floundering in an overall lack of direction and an unusually high level of ineptitude in most levels of management. There were certainly some smart managers and employees, but too many were not. While many of the problems at Fannie are self-made, some are due to not being able to do much of anything without the guidance and approval of an extremely slow to react regulator, which is a political beast in itself. So in the end you have ineffective management trying to implement the direction from a regulator that can't decide what it wants to do. What you have left is a bunch of managers fighting for some kind of relevancy and trying to survive at the expense of others in the company."

Right after the firing he bragged about how he was bringing in a cohort of individuals who were trained for 12 weeks by a staffing firm. He ended up firing several talented people because they came in after 9:30 even though they worked late. In one case he made one very respected employee fill a higher position with more work and the same pay for about a year only to give the position to someone else. It was chaotic and unpredictable with the CISO in charge. He is building a work environment where the entire security organization will be in a large open area which will be difficult for all the people that need to concentrate. It isn't a Wall Street brokerage after all. He also has talked about a shark tank for employees, where you have to pitch ideas to management, who will proceed to rip you apart.

In the division in which I work, there is not a lot of risk-taking or ownership. Particularly at mid-level mgmt, there seems to be a lot of risk aversion. It's understandable, given the company's history, but it's frustrating.

I would guess that the federal government is going to milk Fannie and Freddie for all they, and not turn them back to their shareholders any time soon. Which means even more risk-aversion and a government worker attitude.

1462,,Surprised at how well-run this company is.,2013-11-18,5.0,Business Analyst I,"Extremely professional organization.  The people are very well-qualified and dedicated to their mission.  Fascinating to see the internals of how the mortgage industry actually works in this country.  Fannie Mae has been unfairly vilified as a cause of the mortgage collapse.  In fact, they are required to buy loans sight-unseen from the originators, which provided a great opportunity for fraudulent mortgage brokers.  Why the law was written like that is an enduring mystery!   Finally, it is a very diverse workforce demographically.","The employee evaluation system for non-managers is arranged so that 50% of the evaluation is based on a ""360 degree"" view, and only 50% on quality of work -- meaning that non-managers must be popular to stay.  When coupled with the HR ""stacking"" policy in which the bottom 5% of the staff is targeted for termination each year, and the heavy emphasis on using contractors and term employees, the result is that the permanent employee cadre are very homogenous in outlook and style of thought.    Which is ironic, since the demographics are quite varied. 

So, unfortunately, conformity is rampant, and divergent thinking isn't encouraged.  Also, the dominant culture is one of brevity in speech -- ""it is better to keep silent and be thought a fool, than to speak and remove all doubt.""  The result is a certain type of group-think, which is one of the reasons (I believe) why the organization was so easily defrauded by Countrywide and other bad actors who sold them completely bogus mortgages."

1573,,Can be OK depending on your Manager,2012-03-11,3.0,Manager,"Benefits and Work-Life Balance. Until the accounting scandal, housing crisis and the government conservatorship, Fannie Mae prided itself on its mission to provide widespread housing; its better-than-average employee benefits; its racial, religious, and sexual diversity; its philosophy that employees maintain a work-life balance through a 37.5-hour work week; and its overall treatment of employees.  This is exemplified by an exceptional on-site emergency child care center and free parking, that latter of is unusual for companies operating in the DC area.  Recently, the influx of former Wall Street managers has led to a diminshed pride in benefits and work-life balance, but if one gets the right department or manager, work-life balance is still possible.

Analytics. Fannie Mae uses a diverse set of predictive models and analytics and often gives employees much leway in conceiving and developing them.  If one is in those areas but does not want the pressures of Wall Street, Fannie Mae might provide a more interesting alternative to a commercial bank.

Security. Because of the risk-averse nature of the company, managers face a lot of scrutiny when dealing with employees.  This means there is some protection against being spontaneously fired by an incompetent or irrational manager, which Fannie Mae certainly has an abudance of.  Of course, such protection does not preclude layoffs, or necessarily ensure that manager’s support for a promotion or his discression when informally discussing the employee with other managers at his same level.","Hiring Process. The hiring process is slow and cumbersome.  Unless one can use an alternative offer as leverage, from initial contact to offer can take months.  And often, interviews are conducted but forgotten shortly thereafter due to a management change or restructuring, which happens much more often than it should.

Management Structure.  There is a caste system that exist at Fannie Mae between managers and “individual contributers,” and the management hierarchy is enormous, culminating with an exhorbitantly-paid group of executives who are regarded equal to royalty.  Because the goal of most of the management staff is to move up into the executive ranks and because the risk averse nature of the company means that promotions can easily be vetoed by just one person, a “suck-up” culture has evolved where any request from senior management no matter how ludicrous is treated as a royal decree with little pushback from middle and lower management.  This means that the “individual contributors,” the ones having to deal with such requests, can sometimes find themselves overburdened as the brunt of “tall tale” directives that may have begun as a casual request but grown into major “fire drills” as they have been delegated down the chain.  

Management Competence.  One often wonders whether the push on diversity has succeeded at the expense of competence, particularly at the Director and Vice President levels.  It is completely mindboggling how some of the most complex and innovative analytical models can be rejected by managers because the results to not conform to the managers’ preconceived notions.  Isn’t that the point of having models to begin with?  I can personally recall having to create a spreadsheet with numerical examples for a Vice President to explain why (A*B)+(C*D) will not equal (A+C)*(B+D).

Status of Tech Workers.  There is less formal heirarchy at Fannie Mae with Financial and Risk at the high end and technology at the low end.  Generally, technology workers are not regarded very highly because senior management does appear understand technology.

Morale.  Because of the government has plans of closing down Fannie Mae, there have been waves of layoffs.  As a result, the morale is low and most people are looking for some type of work outside Fannie Mae, in spite of management reassurances that Fannie Mae will be around for a while.  This should cause one to consider the reliability of management guidance at the company."

1581,,Free-Fire Zone,2012-02-14,2.0,Senior Database Administrator,"I had a very idealistic view of Fannie Mae and its purpose for our housing market.  I came to Fannie Mae based on the recommendation of two colleagues, who I would indicate are top performers in the area of Technology.  The director to whom we reported was highly competent and produced results.  I worked with the organization for approximately 5 years, demonstrating results.

At the beginning of 2011, a series of re-organizations toward Shared Services/Managed Services occured which I strongly supported.  Seeing the lack of competence and inexperience throughout the Technology divisision, I thought this would be an opportunity to make progress to benefit the organization.","It seems like the management became introspective and ceased to operate in the best interest of the company and its purpose.  When you have such a large, multi-tiered organization, there's an inherent risk for individuals to focus more on their career than on their purpose.

During the past year, my experience quashed any hope I had for the health of the organization.  Time and time again, I saw management who were more concerned for their career or their ""emprire"".  When confronting apparent conflicts of interest and potential ethics concerns, management tried to supress and mis-direct.  There is a lack of character leaving the Technology division as a soul-less shell.  

There did not appear to be a clear direction for the road ahead.  Instead, morale is at an all time low and everyone is ""going through the motions"".  The talented resources are either replaced through SS/MS attrition or they lose hope.  

When it was my time to leave, I was given 4 NEW projects during my last 2 weeks and I was prevented from wrapping up work with my current customers.  That was an absolute kick to the head.  I left wihout securing a replacement position ... as a customer observed (a manager), ""its a bad sign when our best and brightest will chose to work no where, rather than working here"".  

Fannie Mae is nearly complete in its transformation:  A government bureacracy in every sense of the word.

BTW:  I found a replacement position within my 2 week transition."

- Decisions about people are based on perception and not fact. If someone is very vocal in a meeting and ""appears"" to be knowledgeable, they seem to get all of the recognition.  However, the folks that talk less and work more are not respected as having knowledge of their jobs.
- Too many meetings and not enough action."

Depending on what group you're in, some managers and above are a lot of fun. They recognize hard work and reward performance. 

Fannie encourages volunteerism - but the down side is they're CONSTANTLY asking for money for something they're raising funds for. WE DON'T HAVE ANY MONEY! We haven't gotten raises in two years.","Geez, where to start. No raises two years in a row while executives collect millions in salaries and bonuses. Horrible wasteful spending on travel and ""negotiated"" rates that are often much higher than every day rates. 

We get a quarterly full color magazine - probably 100 pages. I don't read it, right in the trash. This should be electronic, very costly to print. 

We also got technology mousepads. Another waste of money - how many of us didn't already have a mousepad.

Over Christmas we got a Fannie Mae Healthy living color calendar. Mine went from the mail to the trash. More wasteful spending. Take those 3 items and give me my cost of them in the form of a pay raise!!

Did we need poinsettias all over the offices? They just die - more wasteful spending. Yet we weren't allowed to do any company paid holiday lunches or parties. Hmmm..okay

Almost everyone is eligible for quarterly bonuses except the admins. Why? Do they not work as hard as the rest of the employees to help attain the company goals? Talk about treating people like bottom feeders. So demoralizing.

Good luck moving up in the company if you come in at an entry level position. Even the HR VP said it's almost impossible. There's little to no training either. Everyone's too busy with all the cuts to help you most of the time. Better be able to do it alone!

It's really become a downer to work here but we're stuck. The economy is so bad it's hard to go elsewhere so even with no raises again, we stay. Well most of us. The CEO just quit and took his multi million dollar salary and recently announced million dollar bonus and hit the road. NICE message to send to the rest of us peons.

A lot of VP's have left recently, I don't blame them. Now there's a moratoreum on spending - no lunches, dinners, meetings, events, etc. Just work, work, work no reward. Oh, and they raised the cost of our insurance so technically we are all working for less money than we have in 2 years. Ugh."
