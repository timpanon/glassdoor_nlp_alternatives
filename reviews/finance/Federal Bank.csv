3) Employee motivation at the lowest. No employee engagement activities at offices. 
4) No freedom of thought or respect for fresh ideas - have often got the remark as ""my experience is more than your age"". You have to do exactly as you are instructed. Mechanical work, more like a typist than an actual decision making/analytical work

290,Federal Bank,Manager,2019-09-17,1.0,Anonymous Employee,The company and it's employees are highly unethical.,"The company has intro an scheme of increasing its loan portfolio by extending education loans to people for training at Manipal and employing them at bank after completion of training.

People after completion of training are posted as probationary officer. The seniors at the bank know that the probationary officers have availed loan for completion of training, hence they make them do all the unethical work which will theses probationary officers chargesheet at a later stage.

One of the instances is making probationary officers do clerical job of handling cash and going to clearing house. Clearing house has strict rule of allowing only clerical staff. Seniors at the bank make probationary officers lie in clearing house that they are from clerical grade. The same needs to be registered with clearing house which will further add trouble to probationary officer as they are forcibly asked to lie in clearing house.
Seniors at the bank ask probationary officers to handle cash of customers without passing them through note detector machine for premium customers which is against the guidelines of Reserve Bank of India. The reason behind doing so is that the customer will replace the complete bundle in case counterfeit note is found which is again against the guidelines of Reserve Bank of India.
In case the probationary officers deny doing so, they are terminated and are asked to repay education loan at prevailing rate. The bank and it's senior management are completely unethical.
Please don't get into trap of this kind of employment."

485,Federal Bank,Distasteful & dreadful regrettable career option,2014-06-01,1.0,Branch Head,There is no much pressure business. Salary and allowances are good. Best place for lazy people over forty five.,"No uniform talent pooling.Large differences exists,Biased.  An individual's role isn't defined. Lot of confusion. Confusing schemes plans rolled out. Main portfolio is Gold which almost makes you feel like a pawn broker rather than a retail banker. Worst infrastructure in Rural branches. No adherence to ethical banking practices.
Almost no leave option. Worst HR management."
486,Federal Bank,Worst HR and Senior Management,2014-05-22,1.0,Assistant Manager,One of the best salary provider among private scetor banks.,"Lot of mis-communications. No mails are answered and most of the communication is done over a phone so that there are no proofs of their communication in future. Whistle-blower is punished and the guilty is forgiven. No work life balance. Worst transfer planning, employee is never sent to the desired location. Lots of favoritism, politics and partial toward employees of Kerala. I have an example too : I wanted a transfer to my home town. At the time of joining I was said by the HR that I can apply for transfer to the branches in my home town itself. No mails to the regional or corporate HR team were answered. Finally I decided to quit. Got a call from a senior HR official and this is what he said me ""Company is giving you more salary that any other bank. So it expects you to make some adjustments and not bother the company with such demands"". I was surprised to know that the HR official wanted me to choose money over family. This was very depressing and disgusting. I resigned the very next day....."

498,Federal Bank,Bonded Labour,2013-08-08,1.0,Officer,For those who don't have a proper qualification or don't have the intelligence or skills to shape a career in any place can join here. As long as you can sell their worthless insurance products without thinking much about ethics or the customer you have great career in this bank. They have your certificates safely once you join. They safety is so assured that you yourself can have access to it only after paying the bond amount of 1.5 lakhs.,"Probably the place which has got worst HR practices. They force us to submit the original certificates and sign a bond for three years for the job and if we are not satisfied with the job and their policies and if we are not ready to work against the our ethics, we can get our certificates back only on paying 1.5 lakh bond amount. I paid the entire amount and the notice period amount of another 90000 for getting back my certificates. This is the wrost place for qualified people to work for. The provided a trainning for just 15 days and it is of no great use. definitely they wouldn't have spent 1.5 lakhs for training an employee. But there was no other options left out for me other then paying thay amount to the bank to get abck my certificates. There is no proper job mapping and too much of mallu domination. The attitude of the seniors are also absolutely unprofessional (except for very few well-educated people). They have promoted even a bankman to the level of GM without expecting any qualification."
