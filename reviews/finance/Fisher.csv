9,,They need to change A LOT,2022-03-31,2.0,Anonymous Employee,"- The people I worked with were great and became close friends. 
- Opportunities to move into any department you want , regardless of your degree or experience, once you have your foot in the door.
- Great benefits and 401(k) match
- Rewarded based on performance, not just tenure.","- Mandatory 10 hour workday (5 days a week) for most employees. They changed non-exempt employees to 8 hours without reducing their compensation. But, they refuse to move exempt employees to 8 hours unless they get special approval AND agreed to a pay cut. It sends a message that they really don't care about their skilled workers or work/life balance

- D&I is a joke at Fisher! They haven't actually done anything to improve since Ken's comments back in October 2019. Senior leadership is also extremely out of touch and can be very politically incorrect and almost offensive at times when speaking about D&I items.

- Their response to COVID-19 was and has continued to be terrible. They have repeatedly put their employees at risk, treated offices differently (ex. California came back full time in July 2021 but Washington didn't return until 6+ months later), didn't provide many accommodations to those who needed them and just were not understanding to people's mental health at all. Sure they have resources, but they basically forced people to quit because they wouldn't let them work from home when there was no reason they needed to be physically in the office despite Fisher saying they have to. (Btw, I don't think being in the office is an ""essential function"" of a majority of your jobs and I doubt that'd hold up in court).

- Ken Fisher should not be allowed to speak. He sent out a memo to employees basically saying that they need to just get over COVID and that anyone who quit because of the company's response to it is wrong and is never welcome back. Terrible. 

- It feels very cult-ish. 

- They don't change. I worked there for almost a decade and had been hearing about change -- more flexibility with work/life balance, dress code, etc. and nothing has ever changed. They receive endless feedback but just don't listen."

- Great benefits (100% employer-paid medical insurance, etc.)

- Good mobility, can try out different roles once you become experienced in your first role - i.e. you can go from client service to marketing without prior marketing education
- They can train you on any finance-related knowledge you need; not necessarily required to already be a finance major 
- Decent pay with bonuses/opportunity for salary growth
- Beautiful campus with walking trails and space for eating outside","- Response to COVID pandemic was quite unfeeling - at first they wavered on letting employees work from home despite major concerns from those working at FI. Then later on forced many employees to come back to the office regardless of the fact that many considered it dangerous. I personally jumped through many hoops to ask for accommodations due to mental health and was disregarded and denied the possibility to work from home moving forward, despite the fact that the particular job that I was doing did not require being physically present in the office. I have heard that they are shifting to have more flexibility to work from home now, let's hope that sticks, since they phrased it as more of an experiment last I heard and less of a permanent change.
- Culture of over-work is prevalent. Often associates are worked to the bone with little reward. When I worked at Fisher there were a number of employees that would work on the weekends to keep up with work, with little pushback from management and little done to actually improve workflow.
- There can be an emphasis on quantity rather than quality of work. Can be difficult if you are not naturally the kind of person that robotically gets a lot done.
- Historically little flexibility in scheduling, although I've heard that they do offer employees to shift to part time if need be, on a case by case basis.
- Mandatory business professional workplace attire for the most part, during the pandemic they did allow in-office employees to dress casually and sometimes during inclement weather they'd allow for casual dress, but most the time when I worked there it was mandatory business professional dress code."

Having left fisher, I’m making more money and have better flexibility without having to have sacrificed good benefits and retirement matching. My new gig has way better technology, actually does things to improve D&I, and isn’t afraid to make changes based on employee feedback. It turns out, it isn’t normal or healthy to work somewhere that thrives on a culture of fear, ignores the needs of their employees by working their people til complete burnout, and being managed by an echo chamber of straight white men.

I experienced a really bad mental break while working here and honestly they do a really good job of making you believe the grass isn’t greener. I feel sad for those who consider themselves “lifers” because they don’t think they can find better elsewhere, because they can. In fact, they can find MUCH better."

49,,Good for first job. Don’t stay for more than a few years.,2022-02-02,1.0,Investment Counselor,"The people. I made what I hope are lifelong friendships and professional connections while at FI. That is the long-term value proposition of being a non-manager level employee at FI. The people you meet are so incredibly bright, talented, and personable.

Total comp, of which I mean your full compensation package (salary and benefits), is also fantastic. Insurance—you pay no premiums. 401(k) match is unparalleled in the workforce at 50% up to IRS limit. People complain about pay but forget they’re getting a ton of value in the total benefits package. To the other reviews’ credit, salary *is* low relative to the work you do. This becomes the central issue and weakness of the experience as an employee at FI, as you’ll read in a moment.

As a tertiary consideration, you learn a lot. You will learn a lot about market philosophy and how to think about capital markets. Additionally, the firm is almost second to none at communications. It’s rare that a firm can align its messaging to thousands of clients within a single day. The firm is a great test case of being able to scale a PR and communications strategy within a short window of time given the rapid changes in markets and current events.","Fisher Investments is a sales company that manages portfolios. Once you start with this premise you begin to understand why certain decisions are made. For some context, the current CEO of the firm comes from a sales background within FI. 

There is constant tension between service and sales which can really be boiled down to a wide disparity in pay. If you are reading this and thinking of working for FI I would be explicit with your recruiter about only hiring into a sales-focused role. You will be setup for disappointment otherwise. Being a core IC (not NCC IC) means being incredibly underpaid relative to the value we offer to the firm.

Gone are the days at FI when ICs could make a very generous salary. People who have been with the firm for a long time, if they are open, will regale you with stories about how IC compensation was materially higher in year’s past but the firm explained to them they couldn’t justify it if they intended to scale the firm to a multi-trillion dollar AUM firm. Many older employees carry what amount to golden handcuffs, high salaries they acquired while the company was very young and were subsequently grandfathered into in other back office departments. You’ll meet a small number of people at the firm who won’t leave because they will not get paid nearly as much for the same work at another firm.

Compensation issues pertaining to the newest cohort of employees (past ~10ish years) of course leads to high turnover. If you’re a client reading this review it’s not uncommon for a new IC to inherit a book of clients who have already seen two, three, even four new ICs in a few year’s time. The firm can glide on its marketing and sales successes for a short time, at some point I would believe the issue of IC turnover will come home to roost. As of this writing it doesn’t appear to be much of an issue or affecting money coming through the door—perhaps that’s why it is so often overlooked."

-I enjoy everything about my current role. They often create roles to fit exactly what you like to do.
-They often, though not always, will give higher pay to people who perform better","-They pay everyone less than market across the board for the responsibility each person has. Many are stuck in the Portland HQ where there are no other Finance jobs to apply to and they know that. 
-They did give a large pay increase & more work-life balance to associate-level employees, but most professional level jobs require 10 hour pay, often for less $ per hour & no overtime, in roles that in total are paid well, but much less than other firms out there.
-They're just now testing WFH possibilities. They are very reluctant to give any work-life balance.
-As someone who's been professionally patient with the firm for over years, and has been a top performer with some of the largest pay increases, I'm still considering other firms since you can get the same or better pay elsewhere for better benefits & potentially less hours. You'd think with a firm their size they could compensate extremely well, but they just don't share the profits they recieve.

- The room to fail and explore complexity.
- Ability to share ideas as long as they are in a respectful and data backed manner.
- Have real upward mobility to grow if you perform in the role you get hired to do and communicate clearly what your goals are.
- Use the amazing network of talent around you and do not get dragged down by the negative people.
- Your background does not matter here. You will be judged on the merit of your work which I really enjoyed! 

Overall company benefits are pretty good:
- 50% 401K match is great if you make enough money to contribute to it.
- All healthcare premiums covered.
- Incredible maternity and paternity leave if you are planning to start or grow a family.
- Values oriented company that is looking to improve since it was not perfect in the past but it is constantly improving.

Overall, I gave this company four stars because it is a great place to work if you have the right team and boss. Ask good probing questions and find out if it is the right fit for you!","- Technology is atrocious and this company loses one star for that. Here are some specific ways they are bad along with some context of how things are improving.
 - Some servers are still using software from 10 years ago or older. The excuse was always they can pay you more because they are saving money...but they realized everyone was working way more because the efficiency of the old tools are so bad and the bandwidth is always topped out.
- Scheduler is not allowed to be used outside of IT so you are refreshing scripts and datasets manually each day! Say hello to the early 2000's and listening to that dial up sound! You are going to experience some amazingly arcane practices.
- Want to build a SQL table that multiple dashboards and people use each day? You have to submit a ticket to get it done and hope something that takes one line to write will be approved in a month if you are lucky. 

I could go on for a long time here but it is bad.

On the other side there are improvements being made. 
- Old CRM is being upgraded to something new. We will see how long that takes.
- Cloud infrastructure is being added.
- Sharepoint website was upgraded a year ago.
- JIRA was added for most teams to use.

83,,A company trying but failing to have a great work environment.,2021-12-15,1.0,Investment Counselor,"-Great relationships with your immediate team members.
-Pay CAN be good depending on your location.
-Great training.
-They hire really sharp people...which makes their turnover a shame.
-There are some in mid/upper management who seem to sincerely be fighting to make FI a great place to work.","(For those of you considering FI, take a look at some of the positive reviews, and see if you notice some eyebrow-raising similarities.)

-In the IC role, they start you off with what seems like a great income, but you learn that it ratchets up very, very slowly. You can be an outstanding, dedicated, hardworking IC, but if you have a couple bad quarters, your income potential WILL take a big hit...in the current year and at your annual comp review.  And there are plenty of quarters where you have little control over the outcome.
-It's a stressful place to work. Don't let the improved hours fool you. You will constantly be battling to keep your to-do list under 30 items. And management will regularly heap more work on you via their many ""test"" campaigns. And it's not the type of stuff that's easy to just ""leave it at work"" once you end your work day.
-Their client base is growing WAY too fast. They can't keep up with hiring to accommodate this growth...and are now testing out some, uh, interesting ways to address that.  Because god forbid they slow down growth as a remedy.
-They will constantly tell the overworked associates, ICs, and analysts--who have little stake in the growth of the company--that the break-neck growth is ""a good problem"". The client roster each IC now has to service--and the rate at which they're having ICs take on clients--is unreal. 

-This one is really important:    Once fully built out, ICs EACH manage a roster/book of business that would make most RIAs in the industry blush.  And the justification for why ICs don't get paid more for this huge workload is that we ""specialize"" in just service...and supposedly don't have to do any selling, operations, research, etc.  This is false.  No, we do not do the initial sales or marketing, but our job with the client starts as they're being onboarded and continues for however many years the client stays.   And when clients have complaints or market fears or any other difficult stuff happening...it's the ICs they call...not the sales people or anyone else.  Furthermore, there are many OSPs that throw unsold clients at ICs and expect us to essentially close the deal...then those OSPs get paid--in a single shot--what some ICs make in a quarter.  Fast forward several years in the client relationship, you've developed a close relationship and counseled them through some extremely difficult times...and because of your relationship with them, they've decided to move the rest of their assets to FI.  A major decision for any person.  What do you get as an IC?   You get a pat on the back, and the addition MIGHT help your bonus.   But that OSP who, years ago, spoke with the clients once or twice, may get paid handsomely AGAIN for doing nothing.  FI has a very warped sense of the value of sales v. relationship management.

-Technology and procedures to service clients are absolutely shameful. Cumbersome, terrible.
-It's my opinion that the future does not look bright for the IC role. I get the sense that they've decided the benefit of the role isn't justified by the cost.
-As a counterpoint to there being managers who do want to see change, there are some at the very top who seem to be fighting it tooth and nail...and it's evident in the employee turnover.


Now--amazingly--despite all of this, I actually have a lot of hope for the company and believe they COULD very easily turn things around.  I think there is a stale leadership element that needs to be removed first."

If you are ambitious and a hard worker intending to do your best, prepare to be worked to death. The amount of work in client services is unreasonable. Management are all puppets/ clones with different faces repeating the same thing over and over to the employees. There is some attempt to make their people feel valued, but actions don't match their words as there will always be more new client relationships coming in through sales than what service can handle. They don't care if they burn people out because they intend to hire fresh blood constantly, knowing there will be continuous fallout. They say of the people who leave that they decided to go surf or galavant, or that the firm is better off without 'that person' when the reality is, they're losing a lot of good people because they're running them into the ground with work. Their diversity and inclusion efforts are painfully forced and uncomfortably awkward. If you really need money and experience, it can be a good place to start but if you stay too long you will suffer."

The company has a very old, fear driven culture; this will never change as long as the circle of senior management remains the same. Forget about what you might have read that they value diversity and inclusion. The push to improve only happened after the hot water the company found itself in from the inappropriate comments made by the founder.

Join them if:
-you find the compensation reasonable
-you can ignore unreasonable demands from the company and put up with untrained managers
-this is just a spring board for your career
-you are always agreeable, willing to follow instructions and can keep opinions to yourself.

They desperately try to paint a picture to show what a great company it is to work by entering surveys is almost laughable. Many companies chose not to participate in Top Work Places surveys because they don’t have to. Opportunity, support, recognition are the very things they lack which drive employees away."

Unlimited half-days, though depending on your manager, use may be limited

Pay is competitive, depending on your role and skill level

Firm encourages rotation between different parts of the firm, which is a good way to gain exposure to different business operations","Old-fashioned finance culture that rewards loyalty and bravado over competence. Few managers are well-regarded, especially in middle management. Extremely political.

Honesty is in short supply as groveling and false promises to superiors are effective strategies to get ahead. Expect to be lied to often.

A feeling of paranoia pervades throughout the firm. This leads to a hawkish, micromanagement culture where employees are not trusted and are treated like children.

Discouraged from pursuing any outside education and seeing the world from a non-Fisher viewpoint. Limits exit opportunities for professional-level roles and above, as the knowledge and skills aren't always transferrable to other firms.

Extremely sales-driven. This has led to Fisher's success, but it doesn't make for a good place to work if not in sales. Other groups are expected to bend over backward to meet their needs, accommodate their whims, and clean up their messes, all while they get paid 5-10x the amount.

Incredibly lack of diversity throughout the firm and especially at the upper management level. So far, the firm's promise to improve DEI efforts has been mostly empty. The firm did launch affinity groups which is a step in the right direction, but in line with the firm's paranoid disposition, they are run by corporate and not the employees.

The firm's stance on work from home and flexibility is tone-deaf. The firm has continued pushing the return-to-office date back every two weeks based on Covid data, only giving a few days's notice each time. The employee-friendly thing to do would be to set a date further in the future and revisit it when appropriate. But because of the firm's obsession with getting everyone back into the office and fear that employees are traveling, they have not done that. The firm has also made it very clear that work from home is prohibited in the future. If this is the case, they should be consistent and prohibit managers from telling employees to bring their work laptops with them on vacation to do some work."

2) Work/life balance - you're expected to work 50hrs/week for most roles, but you won't work late nights, weekends or on vacation

3) It's an okay place to establish a foundation if you're coming out of college or new to the financial services industry. I've seen many people use their experience from FI and eventually move on to big tech or finance firms.","Examples of why this has been the most toxic work environment I've ever seen:

1) They will find ways to not pay you a significant portion of your bonus, regardless of what group you belong to. I've seen investment counselors who finished quarters at the very top of the retention and revenue metrics, and still get paid 70% of their bonus because of management politics.

2) They favour relationships over employee performance. Fisher's CEO has acknowledged on numerous occasions that he hired friends instead of people that were actually experienced for the management roles, which he regretted. 

3) FI's antiquated investment strategies can't compete with the likes of their competitors that have a much higher market share. Most of their investment policy committee's outlook is based on regurgitating what sell-side firms like Deutsche Bank tell them to say. Their entry-level research analysts can't keep up with algorithmic machine learning that the likes of Goldman and Merrill Lynch have implemented years ago.

4) Fisher investments is an HR department's nightmare. 

Ask recruiters about Ken Fisher's sexist comments. You can find articles on Forbes/CNBC/Bloomberg and I'm sure they'll try to downplay the seriousness, but be aware this actually happened. 

As an investment counselor in the Woodside and eventually Camas offices, I've seen countless instances of sexual harassment where tenured males would cross the line verbally and physically with female counterparts. 

During my 5 years at Fisher at the company holiday party, I witnessed a manager of my good friend from Fisher's institutional research group physically assault him at an employee afterparty with 20 associates. This same manager sexually harrassed another employee the same night by slapping her butt. This was escalated to Fisher's HR and exec teams and nothing happened to the manager. 

5) Instead of hiring tenured work veterans, they rely heavily on new college grads and internal transfers because they can't/won't pay employees accordingly."

Very high turnover of good people that will not put up with the culture, lack of support or the way management reward failure and mediocrity.

145,,Glaring lack of Diversity,2021-09-19,3.0,Associate,"Fisher Investments does genuinely care about its clients in terms of providing the best in my opinion retirement and investment strategies. The term fiduciary really applies to this firm. I have witnessed this first hand coming from a previous firm which was solely about what new product can be sold to client to generate profit. 

The benefits package is truly one of the best in the industry.","The companies lack of diversity, equity, and inclusiveness is truly glaring. I must admit there has been a heightened awareness of this deficiency since the Ken Fisher mishap when it comes to gender equity. There has been an emphasis in seeking more diverse talent. The issue is data can be manipulated to present a different story. Yes, there is a solid representation of women across the firm but if you delve further into those numbers you will see that roles held would in most firms and institutions be considered more customer service type roles. To further make things worse the representation in terms of racial demographic even amongst the numerous women at the firm is predominantly Caucasian. Further emphasizing the obvious lack of diversity. 

The gender diversity is one aspect. In terms of minority diversity amongst both male and female in leadership roles or roles generally considered to be the creme de la creme of roles there simply is little to no representation AT ALL. This has been the case since the firms existence. To further drive home the point, there is a US sales force in excess of 300-400 individuals and minority representation stands at less than 1-2% and this may actually be a generous figure.

The most concerning issue comes down to leadership diversity in managerial and executive roles. It’s difficult for a company to stand on a hill and claim to champion diversity when you can’t even see any minorities in any key stakeholder like positions to impact the supposed change the firm is focused on. 

Simply put this firm will continue to struggle to claim to be a leader in having a diverse talent pool from TOP to BOTTOM if it doesn’t take on an even more aggressive and genuine approach to changing from within.

- COVID handling has lacked clear a concise messaging. The hope was that the company would have learned how to rearrange logistically the office layout to be more health conscious but this has not happened at all. 

- flexible work from home scheduling is non existent which this day in age with all of the advancements in technology is quite baffling. The firm simply put is behind the times.

- bonus and compensation criteria is extremely vague and subjective to how a manager feels as opposed to clear and concise metric based criteria."
146,,Not as advertised,2021-09-17,1.0,Investment Counselor,"Good benefits, base compensation is okay.","No flexibility- The job description of am Investment Counselor ""focus on the relationship building part and let the sales people handle the sales stuff"". Seems like a dream come true but is virtually non-existent in actual practice. Most sales people will say whatever they need to to get the client to sign on the dotted line. Then they kick it off to you as the Investment Counselor to do the selling. Which is great because the sales person gets the paycheck for your hard work and you get a pat on the back. 

You're told that you have autonomy to handle your book of clients however you like, as long as the clients happy and not firing you management will be happy. But performance metrics are set up in such away that if you want to get paid you better do what you're told and stick to the script. 

Bonuses/metrics- Your job as an Investment Counselor is to not get fired by the client. Which is inevitable. You can do everything right and leave no stone unturned in trying to keep the client on board but sometimes no matter what you do the client will leave. Every term you get you will have to explain to management why it was your fault. Even if the client's reason for leaving was something you had no control over it's your fault. At the end of the day everything is your fault. Sometimes you're lucky and if management likes you enough maybe they'll toss you a bone and wipe that term off your record. Or if you have the right connections maybe you can off load a client that's about to term you on to some new unsuspecting investment counselor and let their metrics take the hit instead.

Management- Say what you will about KF, but he genuinely cares about the client experience. Unfortunately as time has gone on he's taken a less active role on the business side of things to focus more on the investment strategy. I equate Fisher management to Congress. They say they care and will say the right things to get your buy in and win a little bit of your trust back but then almost immediately drop the ball and start pointing fingers. There's no accountability within management whatsoever. Now of course there are some good leaders but they are few and far between and usually don't last very long in the role. If you want to survive in the company you better be quick to find out which managers are in good standing with upper management and stick close to them. If not then your experience will be much harder."
147,,Great Business!,2021-09-16,5.0,Regional Sales Associate,"Competitive pay, great upward momentum, ability to carve out your own niche",long hours; strict dress code.
148,,Most People Should Steer Clear,2021-09-15,2.0,Client Account Coordinator,"I will say that portfolio performance for clients is ...good. They benchmark against the MSCI World Index and regularly perform just high enough above that to break even on their large management fees. So, if you're rich enough with >$500k AUM, you can get good customer service for essentially a breakeven compared to MSCI World.

Pay is good, and benefits are great. Can be a good place to build soft skills, especially if you don't have much prior experience.","I worked at Fisher Investments for just over 3 years. I was a Client Account Coordinator for the majority of that time, which meant I onboarded new accounts and had lots of exposure to both the sales department and the account management (Investment Counselors) department. Previously, I worked at a boutique wealth management firm. I've been out of Fisher for just over 3 years now, so I'd say that I've had time to recover and give a somewhat objective idea of what Fisher is like now that I have other experiences to compare it to.

To be brutally honest, my time working at Fisher was the darkest time of my life to date. In fact, it bummed me out so much that I switched industries completely. Company culture is very 'culty' with a heavy focus on always defaulting to Ken Fisher's wisdom. His books are treated as gospel, and employees are praised for ""bleeding Fisher green"". He regularly makes off-color, insulting, frankly just straight up weird remarks in company meetings. Very old-school finance bro culture. Lots of cocaine and leased BMWs. Lots of internal HR issues. Lots of people skipping their children's dance recitals. Lots of people with massive amounts of unused PTO. They conveniently leave the fact that 50+ hour weeks are standard (and required for most roles save Investment Counselors) out of the recruiting process until an offer is extended - even then, it's in the fine print. In general, you can build some good soft skills, but like others have said the Fisher culture, processes, systems, investment approach, etc. are all very specific to Fisher and not very transferrable.

Most portfolios are very heavy in equities regardless of time horizon. As an Investment Counselor, you spend most of your time defending Fisher's dictated strategy to clients and talking them off the cliff of liquidating at every negative headline. Decent place to build client retention chops, not a good place to get exposure to portfolio building, risk assessment, etc. - not much room for investment strategy discussions/portfolio management from what I saw.

On the sales side, they are very very aggressive. We're talking like daily calls to prospects until they either snap or ask to be placed on the do not call list. Once they are sold, they bring in Client Account Coordinators (me) to move assets under management as fast as humanly possible to ""strike while the iron is hot"", but also so prospects don't get cold feet. I saw several examples of portfolios with huge unrealized gains being liquidated before proper guidance and time to consider the taxable effects were ever given to the clients. When myself and colleagues would push back on salespeople or bring this to management, those concerns were brushed aside and we were slapped on the wrist for interrupting the sales process.

All in all, the place left a bad taste in my mouth. You can do worse than Fisher - pay is good and benefits are great, but you can do way, way better."
149,,"Amazing Co-workers, amazing culture",2021-09-12,4.0,Client Operations Associate,"Fisher Investments is a place where you can easily learn how to excel at what you do. Fellow Co-workers are always willing to give guidance, advice, and tips on how to get your work done. Plus, the work life balance is great.","To be honest, none that I can think of just yet. It's a given for most financial firms, that you lose the power to trade stocks. For some, that can be a total turn down."
150,,Just Avoid - Go Elsewhere,2021-09-09,2.0,Vice President Sales,Healthcare and 401k match are good,"We preach that we’re different than the rest of the industry but we’re just as bad or worse. Just announced a major change to the comp model for a part of our sales team that drastically reduces overall pay. How do you do that to employees and families!? They’re heartless and only want to work their employees to death and reap the profits. If you want to join a firm that will move the goal post out of nowhere this is the place for you!

Also, our systems are atrocious. They make your job so much harder than it needs to be. It’s actually pathetic for a company of our size. It’s never the firms fault though, always the employee’s!!

No work from home option which is ridiculous in today’s world. They will go to the greatest lengths to prevent people from being able to work from home. If you saw how close employees are seated next to one another during this pandemic you’d be appalled. 

The overall morale and sentiment is so miserable and senior management is either so oblivious or they just don’t care.  

I would be blown away if I ever left a meeting with senior management and was impressed or surprised to the upside at a change they were making. It literally never happens. Employees always come away disappointed or deflated."

*Management is fear based culture, where you will not know if you could be fired at any time. You will compete with not only yourself, but your team, and other teams. Meanwhile, because of their separation of service / sales, most of the money will go to the sales people, who's general belief is; ""Do you have a pulse and $500k? Sign here!"". 

* You are expected to fight every possible termination to the point of angering the client, and having them hang up on you. If you do not, you could be fired for it. All terminations will be reviewed by senior management and your actions audited to ensure that you did EVERYTHING in their mind to save the relationship.

Then years and years pass and nothing has changed. They intentionally overwork people and string you along with some bonus money and words that they will hire more people.

- It is common for managers to yell at you and demean you. It is not unusual to find people crying in the bathroom.
- Extremely sexist workplace. I reported creepy interactions I had with a senior manager, and was told ""oh that's just 'Bob', he didn't mean it that way"". This was after Ken Fisher's media debacle, to note.
- The place is held together with bandaids and popsicle sticks. The technology stack is laughable (mission critical Access DBs and Excel sheets written by 22 year old business majors 10 years ago), and workloads + headcount are upscaled to make up for this. 
- Fisher on a resume can be toxic in Portland. Recruiters I have spoken to dislike placing Fisher employees, as they come out underskilled for their experience. This might be less of problem in today's strong market, but in a downturn expect to find it difficult to get out of the company.

207,,Out of Touch Firm,2021-05-31,1.0,Analyst,The benefits are the only thing keeping employees around. it's the main reason employees stays for 2-3 years till they vest and realize they can move to another firm with comparable benefits but significantly better pay and work life balance,"This is a reactive, not a proactive firm. It's currently pumping as much money as possible into sales and not spending nearly enough on the infrastructure and support staff needed to run a firm of this size. Most of the supporting staff is working over 50 hours and struggling with technology constraints that were created in the 90s. The firm also did not take diversity seriously until Ken's inappropriate comments and alienated most of the females in the firm by requesting they pose for photos for their ad campaign to try to save face. Loyalty is they key factor to succeeding in the firm. A lot of these ""positive"" reviews sound like the typical white male colleagues who fail upwards by ""just keep your mouth shut and head down, it's not that bad'' mentality. These co-workers are often the reason why there is little to no improvement to the work environment and culture of the firm. There is little innovation occurring in the workplace, often times by talent being burned out and getting poached by larger firms with better hours and pay. The result being mediocre employees rising to management since they've been at the firm for so long and are just yes men to upper management."

As a fresh college grad, either stay away or work 1-2 years for the name on your resume and save yourself.","FI had no COVID plan. We all carried our desktops home one day when they realized COVID was actually a real thing. They are stuck in the Stone Age when it comes to technology and job flexibility. 

Hard set 9 hour work days 1 hr lunch. You can’t pick your hours, doesn’t matter if you get your work done you’re glued to your desk till 4:30pm or 5pm then everyone rushes to their cars like it’s a jailbreak. 

In most departments people are overworked with not enough time in the day to meet their goals. Management just assumes you’re lazy if you give any kind of feedback. They reward “loyalty” and throw that word around a lot like this is some kind of cult. 

Promotions and pay raises solely depends on your manager. I saw a 5% cut in bonuses and pay raises once I got a new manager who didn’t know what he was doing. He had zero prior management experience and our team really felt it. The group culture became toxic. 

Working with ICs can be brutal and management will look for any opportunity to throw you under the bus in order to save face with their department.

I still don’t understand how people with families work here, I was out of the house 6am-6pm everyday. 

Their D&I initiative was a bunch of PR crap after Ken got caught being misogynistic. There is zero diversity at this firm, it’s a white mans show and it’s blatantly obvious in every department.

Every role is extremely siloed, making it difficult to grow your career outside of Fisher and find another role at other companies. 

CSA’s (COPs & CACs) are nothing more than expendable paper pushers. During the interview they flaunted this place a “gate way” into the finance world. It was a gateway into hell, anxiety, and low self esteem. 

Employee’s crying and having panic attacks are an everyday occurrence. Only thing getting us through the day is all of us joking about how much we hate our lives and our managers."

220,,Horrible Experience - Worsened Mental Health,2021-04-27,1.0,Client Service Associate,"401k benefits and Healthcare Coverage, great bonus and raise schedule.","I worked at Fisher Investments for around two years as a Client Account Coordinator, and working there severely damaged my mental health. It was common that I would burst into tears or have a horrible panic attack in my car, in the bathroom, or even just at my desk. When this would happen, no one would be surprised because they felt the same way/understood why it was happening. On top of the already required 50 hour work week, we were often told that we would 'have the opportunity to work on Saturdays to get caught up on work' because of the firm's poor hiring practices. However, if you did not work Saturday's you would be asked why you were so behind when you had the opportunity to work overtime. There is very little respect offered to entry level employees, and sales people have in the past treated CACs and COPs extremely unprofessionally, with no consequences when these instances were brought up to management. We were still expected to come into the office throughout the COVID pandemic, and many people were denied working from home 100% if they asked for an exception from HR. The only way you can move up in the company is by staying there and 'doing your time', not by working hard or being a stellar employee. Leaving Fisher Investments was the best decision of my life, and I would never recommend this employer, even to my worse enemy."
221,,Decent pay at the expense of your mental health,2021-04-26,2.0,Investment Counselor,"Pay, 401k, Good Colleagues, Locations, Health Insurance.","Management is poorly organized and low-tenured. The lack of experience across the organization is obvious. The company is growing, which is great, but it shows in the lack of attention that any non-sales support group is given. The only thing the company focuses on is growth rather than focusing (at least some resources) on the employees and customers that they already have. Investment Counselors mental health is a known problem in management though they are unable or unwilling to make changes to better their employees' experience. 

The place is put together with bubble gum and popsicle sticks. Employees are overworked and morale is generally poor."

Expect to see 15-20 yr professionals become 'clock watchers' who leave at 5:01pm versus actually working on projects like a regular company. 
Only white men move up in the organization, expect to work with guys that have failed upward and are now VPs . They value loyalty above skills or successful track record. Specific divisions are worse than others - 401k is run by the owner's son and should be avoided.

224,,Self Serving and Behind the Times,2021-04-22,1.0,Vice President,- Solid pay and good benefits,"- Culture: Incredibly fear based culture and behind the times in terms of diversity and inclusion. After Ken Fisher made inappropriate comments in 2019 there was a large push to improve the culture but it does not feel genuine. Since then you'll see under represented groups plastered on job postings and being shown as a public face of Fisher in a thin attempt to hide the fact that in reality they are behind the times in all regards and you are expected to fall in line and buy in or get out.

- Management: Management at Fisher is not on your side as an individual employee. Not all managers are created equal, and while some truly care about you, more care about advancing their own careers far more then they care about your well being.

- COVID handling: Fisher's handling of COVID was completely lacking in care for their employees well being. Between doing all they could to keep employees in the office even though they had the equipment to work at home, to a constant denial that any cases that popped up could even remotely be linked to the office, it was clear Fisher did not care at all about their employees and cared only about the company.

Overall working at Fisher is like being a free range farm animal. You will get some organic feed (good benefits and pay) but they will try to harvest you for all the production you are worth and unless you are in upper management and immune from punishment, will be taken out back and put down once your production stops."
225,,Overall not bad.,2021-04-21,4.0,Analyst,"Great medical, dental, and vision benefits that honestly would be hard to match somewhere else. They also have a full 50% match of your 401k until it caps which is unheard of. That alone us huge.","They use the good benefits as a reason to not pay as much as they should. The company likes to hire new college grads as they can pay them much less. You will be given the ""keep working hard, your next promotion will be the pay increase"" talk a lot.

That sucks, but what is worse is that this role is not a career. I recently came from a good college thinking that, ""hey its operations, but there should be good opportunities for internal growth"" but there is none. There is no real career here. The culture is bad. I am not being overly dramatic, it is really that bad. I remember reading these comments after accepting my offer and thinking I could make an ""impact"".

273,,Fear and Loathing at Fisher Investments,2021-02-12,1.0,Associate,"-Fisher does provide industry-leading benefits. It’s one of their biggest selling points. It’s also one of the crutches they lean on most as they continue to defend mandatory 10-hour work days and refuse to offer work-from-home (WFH) capabilities. 

-Fisher does a good job at recruiting kind, genuine, hard-working individuals. Because of the high turnover rate of the company, you will meet a lot of new faces. You’ll end up bonding with them over how much you hate your job. 

-Fisher hires from all backgrounds. No experience? No problem! Hence the very high turnover rate and all the new faces.","-Fisher Investments is largely built upon a fear-based, metrics-driven culture that pushes many employees to the brink of nervous breakdowns and pure exhaustion. The company often recruits individuals that are fresh out of college or looking to get their feet wet within the financial services industry which oftentimes proves to be young people that are willing to bend over backwards to meet the lofty demands of the company. This includes working beyond the mandatory 10 hour work day because the company would rather squeeze more juice out of their current employees than hire more people to meet the needs of the company. Additionally, many entry-level employees are often mistreated poorly by salespeople that are viewed as demigods in the eyes of Senior leaders of the firm. There is no essence of accountability for rude or downright cruel behavior at the firm and you should absolutely expect to be disrespected at least once during your time at the firm. Middle managers, or as they’re called at Fisher - Team Leaders - hold such little weight at the firm that they are often verbally accosted by the same said salespeople and higher-ups. Most Team Leaders are vastly under qualified to actually “lead” and suffer from the same burnout that the rest of the firm suffers from. Your Team Leader is simply at the mercy of the middle manager that sits above them in the long chain of command. 
 
-Separately, you will be made to feel like you are never doing enough at Fisher. Every single department that you work in will very loudly broadcast your metrics to the rest of the department, requiring you to have consistent conversations with your manager about whether or not you are pulling your weight based on metrics alone. While projects and additional responsibilities are often preached as something that adds value to an individual's overall portfolio of work, they are often brushed to the wayside when it comes to compensation reviews. Free-flowing thought is often discouraged and if you have any desire to make ACTUAL meaningful change at a company, Fisher is not for you. 

-You are simply a number to Fisher. Largely showcased in their handling of Covid-19, Fisher cares very little about the human element of their employees. Many employees are still required to go into the office during the Pandemic even though they were given the equipment needed to work from home starting in 2020. A fellow coworker of mine passed away due to complications related to Covid-19 and it was simply “business as usual” at the office. Combine this nonchalant approach to a global Pandemic, along with the consistently passive aggressive emails sent by the head of HR about employees jeopardizing the state of the company, and you see Fisher’s true colors. Any company that prioritizes profits over people should seriously take a good, hard look in the mirror. 

-You can do way better than Fisher. Trust me. I gave years of my life to this company and they didn’t bat an eye when I walked out the door because of their poor handling of the Pandemic. Leaving ended up being one of the BEST decisions I’ve ever made. If you crave maintaining the status quo and drinking the kool-air, Fisher is probably for you."

276,,Good salary,2021-02-12,3.0,Research Scientist,"Work environment is good 
Friendly staff","Work load is high 
Less organized"
277,,A job to put on your resume,2021-02-11,1.0,Account Executive,"Benefits, 401K 50% Match, Learning how to cold call.","Where to start? Have you ever seen Boiler Room? Imagine that movie, picture it in your head. That beautiful line ""let me tell you what's required."" The suits, the parties after work, the comradery . It could all be so sweet, until, you remember how the movie ends. 

Orientation: ""Beautiful Rose Colored Glasses""
You show up in a suit, hair slicked back (or curled, if you're of the women employed as sales executive)  ready to make it to the big leagues. They'll put you up in a hotel, feed you, tell you that this is where you want to be. You'll hear from ""regional outside sales"" people with custom suits, rolexes, and keys to that blue Porsche you saw outside. ""That could be me right?"" Sure, it can, and they'll show you how. Not to mention, free benefits, 50% match on your 401k. You're working for a company that outperforms the S&P 500 year after year (wink). A company that works with their customers to create custom portfolios (wink) Sounds pretty awesome right? Now, here is the important part, go ahead and pledge your allegiance, along with the other 30 sales people in your month class, to the machine. The Fisher Machine. You are now hereby a cog in that machine and you best not waver from the belief in the system. Now go forward and get that life you always dreamed of.

The role: Glasses ripped off.
Remember those promises of wealth. Well, I'm sorry I mislead you. I was mislead too. Let's get to the first concern, 30K is the base. Unless you're living with your parents, get ready for ramen and PB sandwiches every night. 
""But commissions anon?"" Yes let's talk about that. I realized the allusion I was sold when I asked my ""boss"" (just another account executive with a ""senior"" in front of his name) what he's making on a yearly basis. Not the best question to ask, but hey I was right out of college. He proceeded to tell me ""oh 6 figures easy."" I didn't expect him to lie, I mean I was bought in. I drank the Kool-Aid willingly. I started doing the numbers in my head. An average deal will net you about 1K in commissions. That means in order to hit 100K, that's 70 deals in a year. Mr. Senior's deal count? 34. You do the math. Six figures is not an easy number to hit here, you won't be driving a new car anytime soon, and no that promise of wealth is not real. 

That was my first red flag. Then came the phones. You'll hit them everyday and you won't stop for even your bladders sake. I once was asked by a boss ""who goes to the bathroom that long?"" Your lunches are timed, your every move is watched. You are a cog in the machine and you best sit your butt down and dial. Dial those promising leads. High-net worth investors, which are passed around by 600+ sales executives, that have been called on for years. Scroll down the call log and you'll see ""NI.. Told me to never call again.. NI... Said he would never switch."" Well, guess who gets to be the person to call them again? You. Let me just paint the picture. You're not selling a product, you're selling for someone's life savings. Practically begging them to invest all of their money in Fisher, blindly, for a 1.5% fee. You have no idea what the investment strategy is. How their life savings are going to be managed. You just know what you're supposed to say. Now hopefully you say the script better than the 100 others before you, otherwise click-""NI""-Log Call. The script will tell you, you're selling a ""wonderful customized portfolio. Tailored to the individual to best fit their needs"". It is not a customized portfolio. Let me repeat. It is not a customized portfolio. You're selling a mutual fund. The returns of that fund? Those are confidential, sorry kiddo. They can't have you knowing ""the secret."" I did some digging I mean I pitched my own father on this stuff. I had to know and what I found out was, to say the least, disturbing. They shut down an older fund to hide performance and in the year 2018, I found the fund underperformed the S&P 500. For the year, the S&P: -13%, Fisher Fund: -28%. That's a quarter of someone's life savings, gone, seeing as that's all they can invest.

Now let's say you have the mental strength to ignore all of that. Call 250 people a day. Get berated by your boss about bathroom breaks and number of dials, sit in one chair, in a hot suit, and block out all of the frat culture. (There were two girls hired into the office in sales, two. Rumors of one, were that well, she was hired because she was a pretty face for the guys to look at). Let's say you can endure all of that. You would hope that through it all, dealing with the mundane groundhog day life, it eventually would lead to some reward. It eventually will! To be exact.....only just a measly 8-10 years. The fastest person ever to be promoted from account executive to outside sales position? That guy, the Michael Jordan of Fisher, took 6 years. That's the cream of the crop, and hey if that's you, congrats. For the rest of us, that means years of dialing away, arguing with people about how dumb they are for investing with other firms, while your manager yells at you for your talk minutes because you got hung up on 20 times that day. You will become a one trick pony and your one trick is picking up the phone and speaking the words someone else has written for you. Let's hope while doing this you can maintain your mental health everyday. For me, it lead to depression and exhaustion. I wasn't myself during my time at Fisher, and it's not like I had the support of management to figure it out. 

This review is harsh, I'll admit that. I say all of this as a warning. I hate seeing posts on LinkedIn of young grads excited about their new promising role. Being duped just as I was. I look back at this part of my career as bittersweet. Am I happy I went through it? Actually yes, I learned an important lesson: Never to be fooled by the allusion of money. I tell this story to say, don't make the same mistake I did. Your college degree is worth more than Fisher Investments."

284,,Trust the negative reviews. But you will succeed here if the right type of person.,2021-02-03,2.0,Client Service Associate,"Decent pay, not factoring in hours worked. Benefits that seem also too good, maybe to entice new hires from out of state and get them stuck there if the benefits are a big help with families. Benefits buying power I suppose? Lots and lots of new hires all the time. Intense, time-sensitive environment helps with soft skill development that I've found very useful at other firms, like being responsive to the correct people, crafting CYA-type emails, and working on tricky situations like the worst case scenario is possible (which happened at Fisher a lot because of the large workload).","50 hour work weeks. Outdated technology. Didn't have any WFH when I was there, I doubt they do during the pandemic, which is concerning given the emphasis on open floor plans. Specifically target state school undergrads, which is an interesting recruiting model- maybe they want a solid base of loyal, unquestioning entry level workers, with the more thoughtful ones leaving after a year or so. Your LinkedIn feed will soon be populated with paragraph posts from recent grads from colleges you hadn't heard of before announcing that they're taking base roles at Fisher, liked by your managers and try-hardy coworkers. People from target schools do get hired, but for more technical and higher level positions. Those that stick around percolate up, sometimes surprisingly high, with new recruits immediately replacing the promoted and departing. Only a select group actually work on selecting investments for clients. Creates a very triangular corporate structure... almost like a pyramid... Say they are politically agnostic, but culture is very similar to a recent U.S. administration. This was a few years ago so take with a grain of salt, though the point of having a conservative work environment is that things don't change very quickly. No beers during lunch, heard that it got some folks fired. Very bad maternity leave policies supposedly (strange because of how good the healthcare, retirement etc benefits are). Refrigerator theft is rampant. I heard a funny but concerning anecdote from a colleague who caught a then unknown-to-them fellow FI employee redhanded, eating their stolen pizza in the cafeteria. When confronted about it, the rando coworker said that they were ""having a bad day"". That's sort of Fisher in a microcosm: not a lot of integrity, but you can get what you want pretty quickly and you don't have to feel bad about it that often, or at all if you don't get caught."

You must “drink the Fisher Kool-Aid” to keep your sanity and survive. Managers will confront you about rumors about you that display a lack of loyalty to the firms direction. Upper level and mid level managers have no time to understand the experience of entry level associates. Responsibility for morale falls on the lowest level managers, who are overworked and too often burn out or transition to another part of the company.
Metric based roles are extremely competitive and based on vain, meaningless awards. Many jobs teach skills that are so niche to fisher the hard skills acquired are not transferable outside the firm. Fisher penny-pinches when it comes to employee experience and thus it create and secretly bitter culture amongst employees.

Inefficient process- The fact that the firm doesn’t have a client portal log in should tell you everything. Centralize a database for all your employees. You have to send 50 emails to get a client on boarded or check updates. Those 4 other teams review and cross check each other. 

Culture again- Everyone complains about any job, but it is clear most people stay for the money."

369,,Steer Clear Women and POC,2020-06-23,1.0,Client Service Associate,"Due to the idealistic marketing Fisher attracted some extremely intelligent, kind and hardworking people.  I met individuals that were genuinely invested in the client experience and who really want to make the world of finance a better place. However, the connections that I made with these individuals were mostly centered around our general dissatisfaction with the firm and its direction and we stuck together to help cope with both the mental and moral toll of working here.

Benefits are extremely comprehensive, however what they don’t tell you are the terms in which you will receive your 401k match. You are not fully vested until you have been with the firm for ~3 years. This is understandable since it is so generous, but the lack of transparency is just a micro example  of the general lack of communication as a whole. 

The campus is also beautiful which makes the walks you take at lunch to maintain your sanity more enjoyable.","First and foremost associates are treated horribly. While I can understand from a professional standpoint that we may hold less initial value due to a lack of experience, given Fisher’s staunch believe in farming talent you would think that there would be more opportunity for associates to grow. There is also a general acceptance of more tenured individuals treating you with blatant disrespect. It isn’t uncommon for CSAs to be abused by salespeople. 

In terms of professional development the skills that you acquire as an associate are not transferable at all, if you are making the decision to start a career with Fisher you need to mentally prepare to tough it out as an associate to be able to be then be transitioned to a position that will further your career.

Aside from the role itself the working environment can be harmful. As a POC and a woman it wasn’t uncommon to have two co-workers make problematic comments or engage in inappropriate work conversation although Fisher preaches that it is politically agnostic, there is no question where the general population of the firm stands on things. When I first started I also was relentlessly harassed by more tenured Investment Counsellors. There is an unmistakable fraternity energy that envelops the majority of the more tenured roles and as a young woman there isn’t much of a choice except to grin and bear it because you know that any recourse will only harm yourself. My own experience made Ken’s comments only more poignant especially when it fell to the women of the firm to essentially absolve the company of any wrong doing. 

Currently with the recent social unrest and the COVID pandemic Fisher’s reaction has continued to be reactive versus proactive. The Diversity and Inclusion committee (which seemed to be directly formed as a result of the comments earlier this year) has done little to address the concerns of BIPOC and women as well as create an environment where individuals actually feel welcome (managers often also participate in non work appropriate conversation). The confidence that I had in Fisher to do the right thing has completely dwindled and I wish they would understand that the issues that do exist are not going to be solved with a few passive emails.

Accessibility is also an issue, because of the 10 hour work day, abundant workload and lack of flexibility the firm seems to lose amazing female talent when someone makes the decision to start a family. It is a pretty jarring and uncomfortable power dynamic. A pretty even split of men and women (depending on what you do) fill the associate roles but as soon as you move on to something more lucrative or more important like being an Investment Counsellor or being an analyst there suddenly seems to be a steep drop in female representation. If work from home could be accessible all times not just as an exception during COVID then maybe that would change. 

Technology is also a huge pain point, you often work with databases and portals that seem to lag by decades. It is hard to efficiently and effectively help clients when you are working with something obsolete. I think investing in more relevant technology would have a huge ROI.


I just also want to reiterate how late to the game the response to COVID was, it wasn’t until recently where the attitude wasn’t ambivalence. They general messaging was I know there’s a pandemic but you need to be in office (even though we have WFH technology). It is by grace that Fisher offices did not become epicenters of the disease not by careful planning or safety. 

Overall my heart is heavy, I really bought into the narrative that Fisher was selling and I am disappointed in the reality."

373,,Avoid this Place,2020-05-28,1.0,Investment Counselor,Decent Pay and 401K match,"Independent and thoughtful ideas are not encouraged, and in many cases, downright punished. I don't consider Fisher's Investments to be a wealth manager...it's more of a pushy sales organization full of young kids and cheesy salespeople. I always provided thoughtful, intellectually-sound advice to my clients, and was well respected by them as a result. However, the middle management at Fisher are jittery syncopants living in fear of their eccentric boss, Mr. Fisher himself. They excel at aggressive sales and retention tactics, but ultimately are not the brightest bulbs in the universe ."
374,,"Borderline Hostile Work Environment, Proceed With Caution",2020-05-21,2.0,Associate,"Benefits are great (401k match, paid premiums, good PTO) and so are some of your immediate co-workers (but most of the bonding is because you're miserable). 

If you truly want to work in wealth management, then this isn't the worst place to be. Otherwise, proceed with extreme caution.","If you want to work at a place where management has no empathy and are highly skilled at micro-managing, then you may actually like working here. You will develop little to no skills that would be transferable anywhere outside of this company. 

Fisher promotes people based on subjective metrics that are vague versus those who are actually competent and show leadership abilities. If you speak up then you're penalized for not showing a ""will do"" attitude. Basically, they want you to act like a cog in a machine and never question anything, which hinders innovative thinking. That's why the company is literally run by part-time junior associates, since most of the jobs is pressing a button rather than using any type of brain power.

It's all fear-based tactics to make sure you get your work done and associates are always overloaded (even though you work a REQUIRED 50-hour work week, with absolutely NO flexibility unless you're in sales because Fisher treats them like saints). There have been times where I've seen associates crying in the stairwells because of being disrespected so it's not the most psychologically healthy environment to be in."

Pay is decent but many companies have caught up/exceeded Fisher in recent years.","Do yourself a favor and don’t work here. I’ve never witnessed a company that treats its employees more like elementary school kids in my life. 

Very little flexibility is offered. They are stuck on this archaic mandatory 50 hour work week which is unbelievably flawed and stupid. No one, and I mean no one, needs to be there for 50 hours. The ones that play the game well pretend like they’re busy all the time but the truth is they’re just terribly inefficient with their time.

No work from home opportunities. There are a few employees who have the luxury but the CEO needs to sign off! This is just one of many examples of how no employee is trusted to actually make a decision, regardless of high up they may be.

Co-workers can be very sneaky and conniving. They’ll go behind your back to your boss the minute they think something is off. God forbid people talk to each other and figure things out. 

The company has been hiring younger and less experienced (no experience) people into the investment counselor role which creates so many problems throughout the company. Imagine giving a company over $1 million and you’re given a 24 year old recently promoted ops associate as your main point of contact tasked with helping you reach your financial goals. HA! 

Fisher has also been going through a crisis management experiment due to the founders comments. This has created a lot of internal dissatisfaction amongst both men and women. Women are being asked/forced to vouch for the company and men are being passed over for promotions so the company can fix a problem that never really existed in the first place.

398,,Smile and Dial,2019-12-14,2.0,Account Executive,Great place to get a high volume of sales touches,Over 100 calls a day made my fingers bleed
399,,"Kind people, good vision, poor systems and a quick fix mentality",2019-12-13,4.0,Investment Counsellor,"There are definitely structures in place here that really allow for clients' interests to be placed first.

Everyone in the team genuinely felt they were doing something positive for their clients and this aspect of the job was very rewarding. They only hire people who truly want to ""better the investment universe"". I could proudly stand up and look over the floor and feel confident that everyone out there had their heart in the right place. We all truly worked our hardest for the clients. 

You get to evolve in your role and quick progression is definitely possible if you do your job well.

Well-paid considering the good work/life balance. Only management has access to email off-hours so when you are done for the day you are done - flexible schedule was also introduced but as at most places top performers started early and left late.

Benefits were terrible at the start but after experiencing high turnover in entry roles they held focus groups and to my knowledge implemented every reasonable aspect that came out of those sessions - 25 days holiday with the option to buy another 3 (increases when you've been there 5 years as well); superb pension (5% match + 9%); cycle scheme, season ticket loan, perks at work scheme, £50 monthly gym subsidy, and more. This shows management try to act on the feedback they get as well.

Ken is like this legendary mysterious figure who has the occasional entertaining appearance. He is not always politically correct, but he is truly a genius in the way he has built his firm and an amazing storyteller. He does not have a bad intent and recent news stories have been way overblown.

From a client perspective you essentially get a transparent MSCI World core-satellite(ish) fund that with an ounce of luck can outperform the BM insignificantly (net of fees). Given the service provided, I would recommend it to friends and family who are in their target group: people close to, at, or in retirement who don't know much about the markets and are being sold expensive funds and products by their traditional banks. The main selling point is not beating the BM, it's about the client avoiding hurting themselves by being ""active managers"" despite lack of knowledge about the markets. Being able to discuss psychology and market behavior and educating clients on current affairs and portfolio drivers on a daily basis is definitely a highlight of this role.","The process is very chopped up and intently focused on task specialization, enforced with extremely detailed metrics. This creates a great client experience where there is an expert along every step of the way, but as an employee every role gets very repetitive after a while. They know this and promotes ""depth and breadth in individuals"" rather than just depth - essentially meaning if you are good at what you do (or been in a role long enough) in one area of the business (e.g. client service) you can continue your progression by moving into another area (e.g. operations or sales). This can be good for people who are keen on trying new things and switching career paths as opportunities arise, but it doesn't provide much clarity in what options are available for someone who wants to progress to the next step in their current specialization. It also causes people to become middle managers for various groups they know little about, just because they've been with the firm for a long time. This creates a strange dynamic and at times incompetent middle management. In the end, if you don't wish to proceed to a managerial route you are left with quite non-transferable skills on the job market if you've been in just one, highly specialized, role. 

There is a sense that the Account Executive role is the lowest level of entry at the firm - extremely tough, but good performers are quickly promoted so they are kept within the firm. Again, same as above, these people, many times with little qualifications other than a short time span of successful internal metrics, step into managerial roles where other internal or external hires would undoubtedly be better fits. 

The insane praise for quick fixes. If someone comes up with any solution it is quickly labelled ""will-do-attitude"" (regardless if it is working or not). It became a bit of a joke because many aspects of the business's operational processes seem to be built on ancient platforms with so many temporary plasters put on them it is mind blowing. Constant quick fixes are not sustainable solutions to be praised, it is simply enforcement of the many laborious manual work tasks that could be automated to make every role, especially the entry roles, less mind-numbing.

Everything is built around email, and there is a separate system for everything you wish to process. The company is modernizing its IT-infrastructure and is working hard to replace old systems, but for me the mindset has to change towards a longer-term focus rather than constant quick fixes even when new systems are in place.

Management keeps on reiterating how transparent they are and how they share all the information they can because they want to be transparent. Many times, they claim competence and knowledge of situations where there is none, simply to appear to be in control. At times there are certainly more transparency than many other firms, but other times managerial decisions are just as opaque as to be expected in financial services. You show transparency by being consistently transparent, not by emphasizing ""now we're being transparent"" only when it is appropriate for your own agenda."

As a first generation American, my parents didn't understand the American system to help guide me towards my future. Fisher Investments took me in with open arms after I graduated school, and has given me countless opportunities and support; some of the pros I’d like to highlight:

•	Company Culture – diversity is heavily promoted, regardless of your ethnicity, educational background, gender, sexual orientation, etc. you’re provided opportunities to be successful and move into a role you desire
•	Management Support – management provides support to its employees both inside and outside of Fisher Investments
•	Women Empowerment – 3 of the business units at Fisher Investments are led by women (at the very top of the business units)
•	Grooming from within – the firm promotes from within
•	Employees – the firm genuinely cares about its employees and their well-being which extends beyond the walls of Fisher Investments
•	Clients – the firm puts the client first, I’ve worked at banks/insurance companies prior coming to Fisher and they put numbers before their clients, it was a refreshing change that makes me very proud to this day
•	Benefits – 50% match on your 401K and medical/dental insurance that covered by the firm in its entirety 
•	CEO – highly approve of the CEO, his first order was to meet with the majority of the firm to understand pain points and what we can be doing better as a company, which has resulted in various teams working to implement change employees want to see","•	Technology – the tech used in the firm is outdated and slow, which can make certain assignments frustrating at times. I’m glad to see there is a plan that is currently in the works to transform this aspect of the company.  
•	Hours – One would expect hours to be long, but the flexibility provided at other companies should be considered here. Not that flexible
•	Work from home – working from home isn’t really allowed, which would be a great benefit"

I have a BLAST every day - everyone I work around is charismatic, driven, fun, and means well. The people who work here truly enjoy aiming to improve the financial services industry by being transparent, accountable, direct, and well-intention. There's a pretty clear reason FI is the most successful RIA in the country. Everyone who works here has molded this company into a firm that legitimately wants to deliver the absolute most they can to the portfolios of their clients.

You will wear a suit everyday to cold call individuals who do not want to answer. The whole role is to combat individuals on how they mistakenly invested their life savings. You will sell against mutual funds for “customized portfolios” when in reality it’s just one mutual fund with the ability to say you don’t want a stock or two for personal reasons.

454,,CSA Department,2019-03-16,4.0,Client Service Specialist,The training and  structure of the role is great and sets you up for success. I enjoy the dynamic of being on a part of a team within client service - it helps a role that can make you feel isolated give you a sense of togetherness. I also enjoy that there are opportunities for growth and it is encouraged by your manager. I better not forget to mention the AMAZING benefits of the job.,"It is a 50hour work week which can be draining but the company is constantly looking for ways to make the time there more enjoyable. We get a bonus 2x a year, our managers will sometimes buy lunch, and there are company events that are always enjoyable."
455,,Happy Hire,2019-03-15,5.0,Business Engagement Associate,"The hiring process may have been long, but it was very organized and after being with the company for a bit, it is apparent that it's long for a reason.  The culture is super important and it's protected in part by taking time with each candidate to ensure it's a mutual fit.  The onboarding and initial training was organized and professional.  The benefits are great.  The leadership is great.  Opportunities are abundant. 

I read a lot of bad reviews before starting and I definitely want to comment on that.  Now, it's totally possible that those bad experiences are department specific and I'm just not exposed to it.  That being said, I think that many of those reviews were written by recent grads without any comparison.  Sure, 50 hours is slightly longer, but that's a reduction/same for a lot of folks coming from jobs that expect you to answer/read emails or take calls outside of work hours.  Fisher work can't be done off campus and no one expects you to work late.  Sure, it's hard to call a lot of people all day.. but it's a job.  Easy jobs don't pay as much.   Sure, they don't have pingpong or nap pods, but they have a killer 401k and healthcare (which actually matters).  This is all to say, to you the reader, if you're a seasoned professional, you'll probably feel great here.  If you are a new grad with big expectations and no experience, you will inevitably get a reality check somewhere and if you're lucky, it will be here.",The big con for me is that is not on public transit.
456,,Good Opportunity with major Drawbacks,2019-03-13,3.0,Research Analyst,"-Pay is good, especially in the Portland area. If you work hard, track your accomplishments, and present them to management, it's possible to get raises often and be at a comfortable base pay.
-Bonuses twice a year reflect both your current work success & the company success. These can be large, which is an easy way to save up large chunks of cash or max out a 401k.
-50% match on 401k. That means you can max out each year and Fisher will add an extra $9K to your retirement. That's huge!
-Benefits are incredible. You pay $0 out of pocket for premiums (some people pay up to $600/month for this) with excellent vision, dental, and health insurance. Some of the plans even include 12 massages per year.
-Unlimited Partial PTO gives a teensy bit of flexibility for daytime appointments or half days on Fridays. 
-20 days PTO is pretty good, however only 8 or 9 holidays so you need to take PTO on Christmas Eve, NYE, and the Friday after Thanksgiving to live a normal life.
-Unless you're a director, you will never work week ends. Though you will be asked to stay late.
-In general, the company wants to do good and takes care of their clients. 
-Career changes. It's possible to switch roles every few years to gain a lot of experience, though it can sometimes just build a scattered resume.
-Most employees work hard, care a lot, and are generally great to work with.
-Campus is gorgeous with tons of trees & nice places to enjoy lunch outside.","-Mandatory 50 hour work weeks. Such a headache that encourages employees to stretch out work to fill the hours.
-Inflexible hours. I worked 7am to 5pm every day. 
-No remote working allowed at all. Really tough when the hours get really long and you have a family at home to take care of.
-Some more tenured employees are overly fascinated by Ken Fisher & it's weird.
-Diversity is lacking. IPC is made up of 5 wealthy white males. There are more women in management compared to the industry but still not enough.
-No part time work options mean the company loses a lot of women when they start families. (apparently a new 8 week paid maternity leave has been added since I left)
-Technology is so painful. Everything is a decade old with no upgrades in the foreseeable future.
-Headquarters are in Camas, WA (about 30 mins outside Portland) so the commute isn't ideal but at least it's against traffic.

(This review is only for Camas, which has the best culture of any of the offices in my opinion.)"

463,,Good First Job... But Beware!,2019-02-20,3.0,Anonymous Employee,"This is a good first job for those straight out of college and/or new to the Portland area for a number of reasons:

- They supported my move and provided a relocation fee (which you have to pay back if you leave the firm in your first 12 months)

- Their benefits are outrageously good. 50% 401(k) match, full health/vision/dental benefits with no premiums coming out of your check, short term and long term disability, unlimited PTO, 20 days PTO per year, food trucks bi-weekly, car wash service, dry cleaning, free coffee and tea, lots of Fisher gear, and a beautiful, clean campus.

- Everyone here is young. 95% of the employees are in their 20s. This is great for people moving to Portland with no friends!

- Competitive pay and bonuses

- SLIGHT flexibility with hours (I only say this as a pro because some places do not allow you to alter hours at all. A con regarding this will come later)

- Gated

- Quiet, safe neighborhood with plenty of restaurants to go to during lunch or after work

- I do enjoy the open culture. I like that managers have the same size desks as associates and interns and I like that all meeting rooms are made of glass.","With that being said... there are definitely cons to working here.

- Long days. I am busy (as we are severely understaffed) and can fill my 10 hour work days just fine (most days), however after these 10 hours I am completely wiped. Some days my brain feels fried. Other days when it's slow, it absolutely drags by. There is NO NEED for my position to be in office 100% of the time. I would much prefer coming in office for 80% of the day, with the option to work from home for the rest of the day if there is work to be done. After 2:00pm, when all the salespeople leave and the East Coast salespeople wind down for the day, it can be incredibly slow and boring. It is unnecessary to be there that long.

- Upper management, and employees who have been with the firm awhile absolutely worship Ken Fisher in a really weird way.

- The technology is a joke. The firm uses Office 2010 still so things freeze... often. Nothing is automated. And there are no plans to make it better. Keep that in mind.

- Fisher is loyal to its employees. Think that's a pro? Think again. Ever had a co-worker that did absolutely nothing? Fisher won't fire. Ever had a horrendous manager that did not deserve to be in a management-level position? Fisher won't fire them, regardless of the feedback given. This can be incredibly toxic to a professional environment.

- Feedback is frowned upon and a lot of employees get their feelings hurt too quickly. For this being a ""firm"" with a ""corporate environment"", it sure does feel like an elementary playground.

- The parking lot is a joke. Whoever designed it has clearly never driven a car larger than a sedan. Trying to back out of those spots are horrible? Also since we work such crazy hours, we get there before the sun rises. As a result it can be hard to see the BARELY PAINTED lines and cars get parked over the lines. Security will send a passive aggressive email to your department VP with a picture of your car telling them to tell you to move your car. What?? Just let them know. OR PAINT THE LINES SO WE CAN SEE THEM??

I have a lot of qualms with my particular position but will not get into it. The retention rate is incredibly low and that is for a reason. People come to Fisher to get the experience, then leave. You can accomplish a lot at a young age here, but it comes with a cost."

-  Most senior managers have spent their entire career at Fisher. They lack outside perspective to their detriment.

This is the first financial firm I’ve worked for where I can see the clients come first in everything. The structure is so unique here and the opportunities for those who work hard are endless.  The concept here is pretty simple. Work hard while you’re here and put in 100% each day and the firm will pay you a ridiculous amount of money and give you a ton of time for your family. First of all they have the best benefits I’ve ever seen. They fully pay for your health, dental, and vision insurance, give you a maximum 401k match, and all compensation is based on the effort of how hard you work for the firm.  No other firm can even touch what they compensate you here. I have worked for Fidelity, Edward Jones, TD Ameritrade and this firm beats them in every area.

Perhaps most attractive is the promise to allow employees to leave work at work, after the schedule day ends, work life balance is guaranteed.  As if this wasn’t enough, Fisher also offers fully paid Maternity and Paternity leave.  This is an amazing benefit and commitment from Fisher to support their employees with expanding families. My advice to anyone considering Fisher reading this review is to explore Fisher opportunities yourself before making any conclusions or judgments.  If you rely solely on Glassdoor reviews you could definitely miss out on an amazing opportunity.",I don’t know of any cons.

I have worked here for 7 years and have had a number of roles in that time, whilst the company has grown and expanded into continental Europe. The service that is provided to clients is second to none and everyone genuinely believes in what the company is trying to do.

McDonald’s managers get paid more than you, honestly pretty awful pay for entry level, you can probably qualify for section 8 on their salary. 
Horrible technology and efficiency
Incremental raises barely cover inflation.
Culture is very blame oriented 
Entry level positions learn absolutely nothing important from their roles or responsibilities, you have to go out and seek knowledge yourself from older employees. 
People are fisher fanatics and think fisher is an end all be all, very very culty, feels like people are almost brainwashed
The smart ones usually leave quickly, the mediocre/people with little confidence to take the leap of faith into another company will stay forever because their comfortable and have some odd sense of pride that is associated with the sad incremental title promotions management gives to keep people happy, it’s honestly pretty sad.

501,,Human Capital Specialist,2018-08-10,5.0,,"There are so many reasons to begin working at Fisher - benefits, 401k match, an opportunity to be a part of a rising RIA, but there are a lot more reasons to stay. Fisher's culture thrives on young, driven employees and allows meritocracy to be the driving force of high production and growth. Regardless of business unit - introspective, competitive, team-oriented mentality is key!",The lack of schedule flexibility

505,,Good if you're willing to make sacrifices,2018-07-29,2.0,Associate,"The reasons to work at Fisher are obvious - the pay is amazing and you get free benefits. The campus location in Camas is beautiful and you have the opportunity to relocate if you're in specific departments. It's a great place to work if you're in your 20's-30's because you're working around so many people who are your age, thus you have a lot in common. Management is very direct and feedback is straightforward. Innovation is appreciated because many of the departments were started off a simple idea. PTO plan is generous and the 401k plan is matched graciously. 

Fisher has a lot of celebrations and seemingly a blank check for team events/food/function and we are well fed/entertained there.","- Work/life balance is non-existent with 7AM-5PM hours as a standard schedule for all employees except Investment Counselors. Some departments offer schedule flexibility in terms of 6AM-4PM or 8AM-6PM schedules, while many departments do not and many employees are left to wonder why they cannot get this option. While you are given partial PTO if needed (leave at 2PM, get paid for the day) many departments do not offer it, therefore rendering the policy useless. 

- The culture is largely quite toxic because people have been allowed to use their positions and titles to treat others as if they are dirt, and management allows this. Even the CEO knows that we have employees who believe they are entitled and walk all over colleagues. There is a great mentality at Fisher of seniority, rather than being a team and understanding we are all in it for the client, and only the client. Admittedly the CEO is aware of this and doesn't like it. I do not exaggerate when I say people sometimes tell lower-level employees ""you are useless"". Yet when you try to stand up for yourself, you are chastised. 

- Software and/or programs are either old or broken. Everything is so manual that it takes 5x as long to complete most tasks. There are many growing pains yet the company has been around for a few decades. 

- Company is completely uninvolved in anything related to the community. We do host internal food drives/donation stuff for school supplies, but we do not offer community service in the name of Fisher and it is disappointing. 

- Great talent is often overlooked because they do not ""drink the koolaid"" or subscribe to the cheerleading of the firm. Great talent in my opinion are people who come to work, do their job (and do a great job at it) and go home. Those people are overlooked and not generally eligible for promotion. 

- Metric based work in every single department can sometimes be difficult. There are never specific numbers you're required to reach, yet you can easily not meet those specific numbers. 

- Very confusing bonus structure, but bonuses nonetheless."
506,,Terrible place.,2018-07-29,1.0,Anonymous Employee,If you are lucky and get a good team then the money is worth it.,"Unprofessional, arrogant is how I would describe my team. The entire team quit in a matter of 12 months."
507,,Decent place for a first job out of college,2018-07-29,2.0,Anonymous Employee,"The people - Fisher hires great people. During my time working here, I met a lot of interesting people who I will hopefully stay connected with for years to come

Benefits - one of the best 401k matching programs I have seen (despite long vesting period) and insurance plans (full premiums covered)

Internal training - internal training is very structured and rigorous. Be prepared for multiple hours of training sessions in your first year at the firm to teach you things like time management and client service.  

Upper management - Upper management has a very good reputation among the firm. It is evident that they have a lot of respect among employees. Unfortunately, at lower levels you have very minimal exposure to these leaders.

Work-Life balance - FI touts work-life balance constantly as a central value propisition for its employees. At work, you are completely cut off from accessing personal websites while at home, the opposite is true (no access to work email at home). This means that once you leave the office, you will never have work to do at home. The downside here is coming into a flood of emails every Monday.","Role selection - as an entry-level employee, you have very little input into what your position/title will actually be. Interested in research? Have fun in QC. You may be expected to move horizontally multiple times before you are promoted to a higher-level (and ultimately, higher paying) role

Pay - pay is below the market average, I would imagine this makes living in the SF market very difficult

Enthusiasm - You will see the same tired talking point that this is a ""meritocracy"" - a place for hard workers to perform highly. For the most part, this could not be further from the truth. There are some very motivated employees, but it seems like many are here to collect their paychecks and do the minimum amount of work possible.

Hours - mandatory 10-hour days for a majority of employees. Early start time to match NYSE hours.

Job duties - be prepared for a lot of mindless, repetitive tasks in whatever role that you are in. FI is all about ""specialization"" meaning that your job duties can be quite limited. I often felt constrained and that they were holding off on teaching any useful/transferable skills. At one point, I had my manager attempt to dissuade me from pursuing an industry certification . For working in the financial services industry, I gained very little knowledge of the financial services industry.

Culture - During orientation, multiple presenters said that in order to survive here you must ""drink the kool aid""... I think that this is pretty self explanatory. A lot of unneccessary drama and gossip among employees here. People will not be afraid to talk about you or stab you in the back to further their aspirations.

Resistance to change- During my time with FI, I experienced a culture that was heavily resistant to change. When I voiced my concerns to my superiors, I was essentially told that things are the way they are because ""thats how upper management wants it done"" - no room for healthy discussion or improvement.

Internal systems - a good deal of employee frustration at FI is due to recurring IT issues. It seemed like there was constantly something breaking and even management knows that they need to do something to improve the extremely old internal systems they use. This has been on their ""5-year plan"" for years!"

517,,Excellent company,2018-04-20,5.0,Account Executive,"The work-life balance is great, employees are always able to leave at 6pm and not expected to work at home. 

The remuneration for the Account Executive role is superb and reflects the amount of work you put in without any kind of capping system. Also of note is that the service you are introducing to potential clients is always an improvement to their current situation (the company will not take on new clients if it is not in their best interest). Having previously worked for companies  that will sell products to potential clients without regard for whether or not it will actually help them, it's surprisingly important to know that this is not the case. 

Good benefit package - Pension, Medical and Dental package etc, 25 days holiday + bank holidays.","Honestly, if you have experience of similar roles at other companies you will understand the comparative benefits of this job. Should you not work hard or invest time in improving, or if you are expecting to be a portfolio manager at the age of 23 then you will find faults."

519,,Talent Acquisition,2018-03-28,5.0,Talent Acquisition,"1. Work/Life Balance is great here...depending on the role and division you work for. They have set hours which is from 7 AM - 5 PM with an hour paid lunch. In my department, there is a mass exodus at 4:55 PM and no one is left in the office past 5:30 PM.

2. Educational Opportunities- Fisher has done a great job formulating a robust curriculum that allows employees to move laterally and vertically within the company, regardless of where or what your degree is.

3. Benefits- 20 Vacation Days with 9 Paid Holidays, 50% 401(K) match up to the IRS maximum, Growth opportunities, Work/life balance

4. Culture- Fantastic culture to be in! Everyone is incredibly intelligent and eloquent and constantly thinking forward on how to improve the company. What I will say is that it depends on the division and team that you work on for overall experience. 

5. Growth Potential- Lots of opportunity to move within the company to any role or division you like. Associate and Analyst level positions seem to be much easier to rotate into as opposed to management level or higher. Historically has promoted primarily from within.","1. Work/Life Balance- my experience has been a very positive one in terms of work/life balance. It would be nice if all of the positions were a standard 8 hour work day as i think it is unnecessary to have your employees scheduled for 10 hour days. My understanding though is that it depends on the type of role you are in. The sales division has shorter work hours than we do, but if you can't accomplish your goals in the allowed time, you most likely will have to put in extra work to keep up.

2. Benefits- Not much cons for this. The only thing would be to have sick days seperate from the vacation days. I feel like I am splitting hairs though because 4 weeks vacation, accrued immediately on your 1st day, is phenomenal for starting a new role.

3. Culture- I love the work culture here. A couple of drawbacks I have seen though is diversity. While my particular division is very diverse, I have found the sales division to be predominantly the same demographic. Employees here tend to be more up and coming in their careers and are white males. It would be nice to see not just my division, but the whole company as being very diverse. 

4. Growth potential- While there is incredible opportunities to advance your career, the position you want must 1st be open and you must gain permission to shift out of your role from your current manager. If they feel like you are needed where you are more than the role you want, I have seen requests denied to rotate out. It's not that you won't get a chance to try a new position, it's just that it might take longer than you originally planned.

5. Technology- Fisher feels a bit behind with the tech programs they utilize. We are a step behind the leaders in technology and are constantly in catch up mode."
520,,Portfolio Management,2018-03-26,4.0,Anonymous Employee,What I loved most about FI is that everyone I worked with held themselves to a really high standard and worked *hard*.

That's about it.,"50+ hour work weeks, an incredibly mismanaged UK Group, very much a man's world - most of the higher paying Investment Counsellor roles are held by men, whereas the much lower-paying admin/CSA roles are held by women. The hours don't allow women to advance as easily as they want to start families - it would be impossible for you to drop your child off at daycare before the mandatory 6 am start time and there is ZERO flexibility for work-from-home arrangements. Many women self-select out of the firm. It also is bro-ey at the entry level, given that the firm recruits heavily from out-of-state schools and by nature of the hours, many people bond with each other as their primary social network and re-create their frat days with heavy partying. Had a few ""me too"" moments there, no one I knew ever reported them because HR was deeply mistrusted."

The firm is always pushing forward so those that apply themselves find plenty of opportunities and ability to make an impact. It is extremely satisfying to work for a company that prides itself on bettering the investment universe and not becoming complacent. I work with a lot of bright people that also have a solid moral foundation—doing right by clients. I’ve worked elsewhere and attest there is a big difference working at Fisher in a good way. This became increasingly apparent the longer I worked here and moved up—it doesn’t happen overnight. It’s a two-sided investment, and one that pays off over time with more experience and perspective, but most importantly an experience one feels increasingly proud of as accomplishments are attained.","There aren’t superficial bells and whistles. It’s a place to work hard and be rewarded with compensation and increasing responsibility. Everything is earned. The parts of the employee experience that matter most are solid. To me this is not a bad thing but for those just looking for a job and cruise along will find it difficult and frustrating. Make the most of any job here—there are silver linings to any situation—I’ve faced plenty of tough ones, but I always felt a sense of personal growth and accomplishment afterwards.

546,,Account Executive - PCG,2017-10-12,4.0,Anonymous Employee,I valued my time at Fisher tremendously. The CA office puts AE's in a basement together tucked away from the rest of the office. I got really close to a few individuals and there was time in-between dials to get to know your peers. The department trains people how to uncover investors needs and sell them on an opportunity to learn about a different approach which I did not value until I left. The pay is pretty straight forward  -$1200 for every million dollars you bring in. By your second year your expectations will be around two to three million a month depending on your tenure. Even if you are a low producer you will can 3-5k checks every few months which is very nice. Semi annual training trips to WA were a lot of fun too - all the AE's would head out to Portland at nights to let loose. Overall this company is the absolute BEST PLACE to be trained on how to sell. I came from a banking background starting out as a teller and worked my way up to a private banker managing 50mm+ in corporate deposits. Having FI on my resume has now opened doors for me to become an Advisor for a lot of the big warehouses out there and management positions at banks.  Without my FI experience those firms wouldn't even look at me so I am extremely thankful for what they have done for my career.,Culture in the AE group was a bit too loose for me. Most AE's are fresh out of college so their mentality is borderline juvenile which is tough to be around day after day in a basement.

- Macroeconomic Strategy and Goals: Fisher has a noble goal of providing it's customers with conflicts-of-interest-free investment services. Their founder and former CEO Ken Fisher is acknowledged as one of the most successful long term investment strategists in history, and they specialize in fundamental, equity only strategies. No derivatives, alternatives, or flashy hedge funds, and no expensive insurance/annuity products. As one of the largest registered investment advisors in the world, their institutional relationships give them a great deal of leverage.

- Structure: No conflicts of interest. They do not custody assets, and therefore can not steal them. The client's name is on the certificates so the client knows they truly own the assets. They also do all their research internally.

- Fees: In line with industry average -  %1 of the total invested portfolio.

- Service: The investment policy committee makes all the important investment decisions for the client, protecting the client from making mistakes. The client is assigned an Investment Counselor, who helps explain the goals and gives the clients a sense of ease.","For integrity's sake, I will use my own personal story to outline some of the larger issues with the company. 

I applied to Fisher Investments four times for the Account Executive role, waiting six months in between each time, per company policy. During this time I sold insurance to get experience in the financial services industry. I have a BA in economics and although I only had a C+ Average GPA, I am an intelligent and hard working person. I also had several years of solid business and sales experience during college to bridge that gap. 

After each time I applied I did not get any feedback on the interview process - also per company policy. I would make it past the phone screen and into the in-person interviews with the AE team leaders (people who often had less management and sales experience than me at the time, again due to my previous experience). It wasn't until the fourth and final time I was interviewed that I actually made it in front of the AE hiring manager. 

Shortly after finally being hired, it became painfully clear that I was overqualified for the entry level sales role. It also became clear to me that the company had grown too fast, and their HR department had made mistakes with my candidacy. This posed a problem for the AE hiring manager, who had overlooked me as a good potential hire. 

I was also unsatisfied with my position after a short time, realizing just how little the position matched my skill level and experience. The AE hiring manager had also talked me into a salary that did not match either of those categories. I accepted, only because I'd had so much trouble getting hired in the first place. 

I quickly demonstrated my aptitude, gaining attention from upper management. This put even more pressure on the AE hiring manager. But instead of offering me a better position, or granting my request for a higher salary, or providing me with greater resources to close more lucrative sales, I was met with platitudes, empty gestures, and department-wide demonstrations intended to highlight my insignificance. 

During one floor-wide monday morning meeting, the statistics on the number of department interviews, hires, and transfers were posted on a large whiteboard while the AE hiring manager stood in the back of the room and stared intimidatingly toward me, as if to make the point that I was just another pawn, unworthy of such consideration by his superiors.

I was then caught between fulfilling my obligation to the original position I was assigned, or attempting to side step the AE hiring manager's authority to gain a better position. Normally this would have been an easy choice, but I was never directly offered anything from upper management. Keep in mind, this is a company that promotes itself as one where people can move laterally with ease.

The COO himself did tell me a story in a small group setting about how he had climbed the ranks by taking his bosses job. Another upper level manager told a similar story to a larger group about his path within the company, from sales to research to upper management, right before saying that loyalty and intelligence was the best way to climb the ranks. (This message was of course antithetical to the ""metrics-based"" merit system propagated by the AE hiring manager to low level employees.)

""Loyalty to who?"" I wondered. My aim was indeed to eventually move into research. Did the upper level manager know this when he made his speech? 

The later COO summoned me up to his office on the condition that I felt the AE hiring manager was being unethical in his dealings with me. He was, but I did not want the AE hiring manager's job, and did not go.

When I decided to stick it out in the position I had worked so hard to obtain instead of applying for other positions in the company, I was told to take a vacation by a colleague. I left for Hawaii the next day. When I got back, I was fired for not ""obtaining the proper approval before leaving."" I had accumulated enough PTO to cover my vacation, but apparently did not give enough warning to my lower level team leader and floor manager, despite looking them both in the eye and telling them I was going. 

All of this happened in a span of four short winter months, and in the weeks leading up to my ""un-excused absence,"" I'd come down with a terrible case of bronchitis, made worse by the constant talking required of Account Executives (200+ phone calls a day). 

The week before I was fired, I was prescribed a hefty dose of a prescription steroid, which really messed up my sleep cycles. This combined with all the drama and stress from unwanted attention culminated in a lapse in my judgment, and I can see how my lower level superiors felt miffed from me not asking them, but telling them I was going on a vacation. Up to this point, I believe they had been pushing for my success.

Regardless, the person who fired me was the AE hiring manager himself. I'm not even sure the COO or upper level manager knew prior to it happening. In fact I am fairly certain the upper level manager told my colleague to tell me to take a vacation. I thought it was intended to give me some time to heal my lungs and think over what position I would be happy with in the short and long term. I guess I was wrong.

Now, to outline the issues:

1) Big Brother. Everything you say and do can and will be used against you. There are dummy cameras, designed to distract you from the real ones. Someone is listening to every word you say to prospective clientele. If you say the wrong thing, or say something with the wrong tone, you will hear about it. In fact, I am fairly certain I was followed on numerous occasions outside of the office. I may sound paranoid, but its true.

2) Use of indirect communication. Outside salesmen will pose as prospective clients, just to see how well good you are at selling stuff. When I say I ""demonstrated my aptitude,"" what I really mean is that I knew who was real and who was fake. Ken fisher did it to me himself and I made it clear that I knew something was up. However, I did so indirectly, also showing that I knew how to play the game. That's what got upper management's attention. 

This helps the company avoid liability issues - Like when an employee is indirectly told to take a vacation, management can then fire that employee for not ""following proper protocol."" Said employee then has no way to prove that he did indeed have proper approval, and cannot claim wrongful termination. 

3) The ""Metrics Based"" merit system is a load of bull. Just like with any sales role, there are better territories than others. There are also better outside salesmen that others. SENIOR AE's (i.e. the loyal and tenured) get special relationships with outside salesmen who are capable of closing in affluent areas. Lower level AE's are nothing more than sorting machines, filtering higher quality leads out of the trash and sending them upstream.

4) Office Poltics. Ken Fisher often writes about his loathing of ""Poli-tics."" However, his own company is rife with a cacophony of brown nosing, backstabbing, and downright hostile people working in management. I was literally yelled at once by the AE hiring manager for eating burritos. I am not kidding. Many of the people I met there were bright, hard working people, who genuinely wanted to help others. I was one of those people, but I was also too smart for my own good. Instead of putting me in a position where I could maximize my talents, I was pushed out because I posed a threat to the old guard. The irony is thick on this point. 

5) Performance. The actual performance of their portfolio has been lackluster in recent years. Shortly after I was let go, Ken Fisher resigned as the CEO, although he still remains the chairman of the Investment Policy Committee. Hopefully this has allowed him to focus more on the portfolio's performance. They also recently opened a new home Office in Texas."

Philosophy toward helping investors is sound.","The company culture is terrible.  I work in client services and the moral is poor.  This stems from the fact that the company is addicted to finding fault.  When problems occur, rather than banding together, and fixing the problem and moving forward, the managers first try to figure out who to blame.  Opportunities for advancement are very limited beyond Jr. level management so all managers are paranoid and worry more about covering their own ends rather than actually providing value to those who they are supposed to support and advocate for.  They manage upwards rather than managing downwards as is their job.  There are a lot of managers, but very, very few leaders.

Upper managers are all paranoid as well but for different reasons.  Ken Fisher is an amazing macro-economic forecaster, but a terrible manager and prone to childish temper tantrums.  As such, when issues occur, down to the minutia, Ken has been known to scream at his senior managers but this depends solely on his mood.  This could happen, or nothing could happen. As such, when errors do occur, everyone scrambles to cover their ends.  So much time is spent gathering information to defend yourself that literally hours can be spent researching what happened for even the smallest mistake, all for not.  such a waste of time and energy.  Just in case Ken is in a bad mood.  All the managers are scared to death of Ken Fisher.

You will be asked enter any error or incident in an internal system for ""learning purposes"" but this is really a mask so they can assign blame and take it out of someone's bonus.  Make a mistake to cost the firm 50 bucks?  That's okay, they'll take 500 bucks off your bonus.  Managers refuse to accept that these errors occur because their technology, management, motivational structure, workloads and culture are terrible. They refuse to ""learn"" this fact.

On the upside, if you are a talented sales person, you can do quite well here.  Sales support seems to be very good and compensation is truly based on production which is a direct result of hard work.  In client services, the bonus structure is very ambiguous and not at all transparent.  There is no rhyme or reason to it which leads to much politics and cronyism. My hope is to move to the sales side as I have a background in sales.  If not, I am not long here. 

If not interested in sales, I would not accept an offer from Fisher Investments.  Client services is a terrible place to work.  There are other places to get experience and if you already have experience in financial services, you will be very disappointed.

- Half-hour lunches. And you were timed. You think you're on a salaried payroll? Nope. It's hourly. You have to fill in a timesheet every week. If you come back late from lunch, you better make sure that reflects on your timesheet.

- Bad pay. My base was $50K when I started. Five years later, I left with a base of $55K. Ridiculous. 

- I worked with some of the most egotistical people in this place. A couple in particular stood out. Kicker was that the most egotistical ones also tended to be the stupidest ones too.

Access: No automated systems here.  Clients speak with humans (and generally the same person each time) who can help them with anything and everything—UPS pick ups, drop offs, travelling notaries, referrals to CPAs or estate planning attorneys in their area, etc.

Most of the middle management isn’t very bright, nor perceptive in matters of capital markets. Ken Fisher is a good author and perhaps an industry visionary, but independent thought and analysis on the part of Investment Counselors (ICs) is not valued at FI. Fisher is a sales company first, but even so, ICs are expected to preoccupy themselves with burdensome administrative items that should be left to a support group. If you’re a seasoned professional in financial services, do yourself a favor and look elsewhere. There are many companies that offer much more decentralized investment decision making, client roster management, and client engagement. 

ROLE POLLUTION: WAY too much time spent on operational nonsense. When you’re dealing with “high net-worth” clients, the last things a quality advisor should worry about are pesky tax/documentation/logistics issues. I recall countless instances of wasted time seeking approval to simply carry out client requests that could have taken 10 minutes. Then, a goofy 22-year old calls you up because they don’t understand very self-explanatory documentation for the account boarding process- what an incredible waste of time.  

Instead of strictly adhering to an arbitrary $500K minimum, Fisher needs to be thankful for any money entrusted to them. They posture themselves as a world-class manager, but are far from an exclusive club whose clients are discerning royalty. In fact, they are not even a true wealth manager. Think Walmart, not Saks. When someone offers you $300K, you take it. 

STIFLING ENVIRONMENT: There is NO reason for most ICs to be at the same desk for 8 hours/day when their core function is calling most clients 1x quarter for the sole purpose of ""not getting fired."" This is a tremendous waste of resources. SOLUTION: hire experienced and motivated people, incentivize them properly, and allow them to work where/how they wish. There are smart and effective people at Fisher, but there are also many lazy/inexperienced people floating around that bring the collective IQ down toward room temperature. 

Those with sales and analytical savvy would be better off working under the traditional commissioned model, or even better, away from active management altogether. Fisher trashes commissioned sales brokers as ""jack of all trades"" types, but the freedom to advise, make investment decisions, and pursue additional business w/o checking boxes in order to meet a regimented call schedule is much better. 

FEES: FI hasn't met, let alone outperformed, its benchmark index for most years since 2000. FI is a very expensive way to achieve mediocre investment performance. Clients' money would be better placed in an S&P 500 index fund. ICs and field sales reps deliberately avoid performance discussion. 

SUMMARY: Allow ICs to prospect freely and further reduce the administrative and operational creep.  Restricting an IC’s focus solely on the deals assigned to him/her can feel like drawing blood from a stone. Allow ICs to unburden themselves of clients that shouldn't have been clients in the first place."

Upper management asks for feedback on how to improve the role, but does very little to implement said feedback. Work on the entry level is very monotonous where one is rewarded for quantity of work completed instead of quality. There is no reason for a 10 hour work day, and if there aren't improvements soon, the company will experience a higher turnover rate than the existing 25% at entry level. Expectations should be clear during the interview process regarding what the role is and the average time frame for a promotion.

It seems like they are trying to reach their investors or potential investors. They put up a good front of trying to ""serve"" employees as well.","It's all a front. This is a self-serving organization that refers to itself rightly so as ""the cult on the hill."" This is the name others gave Ken Fisher's first office in Woodside, but it is still a fitting title for an organization that overlooks every big elephant and continues to operate as if it were 1963. The leadership is incompetent. The middle management is brutal, leading like dictators, over sheepish victims that it controls with politics and fear. 

They talk openly about ""drinking the Kool Aid"" and caution about those who do not drink the Kool Aid. If you don't drink, they will take you down fast. Therefore, the remnant are career Fisherites, including its CEO, Damien, who started there as a twenty something, and now 20 years later, knows nothing else but the warped culture he grew up in. When he goes around asking people how things can be improved, he is deaf and doesn't understand change management. All he knows is the propaganda he was raised on and what he spouts off now, so it is all a game face for everyone there.

The next downturn in the market will take down the firm. The organization is not capable of change. If someone talks of change, everyone else circles around ready to stone you, if not literally then at least with attacks.

Human Resources is actually the antithesis of what we know of as HR today; they actually  take out any naysayers or those who do not ""fit the culture"" very much like a cult, while there can be verbal abuse and assault reported and they will protect the aggressor while taking down the victim. I have never seen anything so bizarre in my entire career.

The environment is terrible. People swear at you and point fingers. You will be in the cross hairs of blame for stuff you never had anything to do with and could have never predicted or avoided. The only people who stay are those who have no other options or who grew up here and do not know any better. This is hell, people. Get out! The work life balance is terrible; you are required to work 50 hours a week with no flextime and no flexibility. You can work longer too. You will not be given adequate tools, software, or resources to do your job. Fisher is cheap about everything as if they were broke, but they have valets outside not utilized just in case a client in a Ferrari comes over one day on a blue moon."

Outside of the IT department I get the distinct impression most of the jobs are great and the people are wonderful.","If you have extensive experience working in IT, then working at FI's IT will feel like spending your days on a completely different planet.  The department cultivates an attitude of distrust amongst employees.  They say it's because they make choices to do things differently and they will elude to it being because of security requirements unique to them and/or their industry - but that's simply not true.  Without divulging anything particularly proprietary, suffice it to say they do things unlike any other sizable IT shop I've ever seen.  It's as if they run things like IT is a 5-man show, and it just never matured.  They think small.  Their change management is a joke, management is bias and antagonistic, nobody reaches across the aisle to help, everyone is not only looking for ways to make themselves look good, but to make others look bad.  All information is veiled in cloak and dagger security walls and you find out in time it's not because there's a secret sauce they're looking to protect, it's because if you pull back the curtain and see what's there, the skeletons in the closet will make you run for the hills.  You're frowned upon by asking questions and absolutely everything is predicated on how long you've been with the company.  The more tenure you have, and been indoctrinated and brainwashed, and are unhireable anywhere else, the more you are trusted - thus the more access and permissions to do your own job you are granted, no matter how incompetent you might be.  IT management are clock watching nay-sayers.  ""That's the way we've always done it"" is their mantra.  And ""you should have seen it 5 years ago"" is the rationale for staying as bad as it is without any proactive efforts to fix broken process, procedures, and policies."

you don't have to pay for insurance but that's pretty standard for the Bay Area so nothing that stands out","No work/life balance. You start work at 7am mandatory. Then of course you get people coming in earlier, 6am even 5am and it's seen as normal. I don't know how people can say they have a work/life balance. There is no flexibility. No working from home. If you can't trust your employees to be productive, then why are you hiring them in the first place. 
HR and all of management see the perks offered by other companies as childish and unproductive (regardless of current research proving otherwise). 
Attitudes are archaic in every respect, from the hiring of minorities to their attitudes towards women.
They brag about their contribution to your 401k but it's not that much more than what other companies are offering (because there is a cap of $9k) and you would have to max out your own contributions. 
There is not one person who I have spoken to who is happy. When I ask why they stay they say because of either bonus or to have their 401k vest. So sad. 
The office in Woodside is just so depressing. San Mateo not that much better apart from the fact you can actually escape at lunch time.
People have been fired in the most unprofessional manner- in front of your other colleagues then they clear their desk in front of everyone. What a horrible situation. 
It's also full of the ""Alpha Male"" type in management, so a lot of ego stroking and talking down to other people goes on which is horrible to be around.
Be wary of all the positive 5 star reviews. It's unrealistic to think these are a true reflection of the company. All companies (even those with the highest employee satisfaction) need improving. I know for a fact they instruct current employees to leave good reviews. 
There is also a major internal disagreement on the culture. I heard one person during an interview describe it as the following and in a positive way...""have you seen ""Wolf of Wall Street""?... yeah we are like that"". Then others say the complete opposite. 
Oh and looking forward to that once a year company event... yeah, it will take place on a Saturday. 
Their health insurance plan... they grandfathered in their old plan. So all the good stuff that companies and insurance plans legally have to offer now... well they don't have to. 
They underpay people who started out their careers there, and pay much higher (for equal positions) to new recruits."
613,,Summer Intern,2016-10-07,5.0,,"Young company with high energy, lot's of mobility and they promote based on performance. The company is a fiduciary so they are always aligned with their clients' interests and have a reputation for being one of the only honest players in the finance industry. Amazing benefits for employees and the area is beautiful.",The company has outdated technology compared to competitors.
614,,Account Executive,2016-10-06,1.0,,"If you have over the phone sales experience and are very confident in your sales experience- this is worth the shot. This is the only role at the firm who is only required to work 40 hours per week. You're not allowed to work a single minute over that. The best thing about this role is the culture of the department. It is exactly like Wolf of Wall street but a more G rated group. There are about 120 people on the floor with maybe 5-10 of them being women. 
This job is a glorified telemarketing job. You can make a lot of money doing it but you're cold calling prospects who have once upon a time ordered the CEO's books. This includes people who have ordered the material from today to 15 years ago. You're expected to make about 200-400 calls a day and will hopefully speak to 20 people to then set a meeting with how many ever are willing to with one of our Outside Sales People (who closes the sale). You just make the initial call, schedule the meeting and then do as the OSP tells you after the first meeting. 
The base salary is 30k, all deals you have are at least 500k. For an AE, your commission rate is .00125%. So if you set a meeting for a guy with 1million dollars and IF the OSP closes the deal, you pocket about $1,250.00. Keep in mind commissions are taxed pretty heavily in general. For this role the recruiters will sell you really really hard on this role and the 'uncapped commission'. This is an extremely difficult job. Most people do not get their first deal until 3-6 months of doing the job. Most people by their first year have about 10-20 deals.. if management doesn't kick you out by then. With that, do not expect coming into the job and making the potential right away. For those who are moving for this job- take that into consideration that you might be living off 30k for a while and with commission, nothing is guaranteed. 
The training process they give you for this role is about 2-3 weeks will additional help always being offered. 
This is the highest turn over job at the firm. 
If you are good enough to stick through 5-6 months, they will start having you study for the series 65. They provide online classes, the study book, and the test no cost to you. They have a rule to where if you cannot pass it in 3 tries, you're let go from the firm. I knew many people who this happened to. 

Overall, if you're taking a huge salary hit to take this job or are sacrificing a lot (moving to this side of the country)... this is an extremely risky job, security and income wise.","This is important to a sales role in general but an overall Fisher complaint- every little thing you do and do not do is taken into account with your metrics. For example, each morning as an AE, everyone gets an email listing the AE's from the best to last on who 'worked the hardest' the day before. This means how many minutes you spoke, have many dials you made, how many people you talked to, ect.. Everyone can see your personal metrics. For each role at Fisher, it is like this. Unless you are a very small percentage of people who THRIVE off that type of measurement of performance and want to have it shoved down your throat daily, this job will burn you out quickly."

621,,Marketing is a MESS,2016-09-11,1.0,Marketing,"You get to put marketing experience on your resume. It doesn’t matter that the marketing you learn at Fisher Investments isn’t real marketing. It’s a complete joke, but no need to get into those minor details when interviewing for your next job.","This company is so backwards it’s unbelievable it’s still standing. The thinking and processes are so archaic, I felt like I was in a time warp. Lots of extra work and time is wasted because of the multitude of inefficiencies. Lots of smart, capable people are being severely underutilized and stunting their career growth potential. The company praises itself on innovation but I didn’t see evidence of that. Many good ideas are dismissed because 1) stuck in their old ways 2) limited knowledge and talent 3) limited resources to implement them 4) woefully incompetent management, all of which leads to 5) people just don’t care. 
Only a few people in the entire department had real marketing experience when I was there. Those people got quickly frustrated and bored once they realized what they’re going up against is a no-win situation. A large majority of the department had been at the firm for a year or less. This meant there wasn’t much learning to be had. It’s the blind leading the blind. Instead, you take up valuable brain space with the quirky methods of Fisher that are absolutely useless anywhere else. Heavy turnover is a huge red flag. During my time at the firm, many employees quit, some fired, this includes EVERY level of management – entry level to the top. 
A lot of new hires come into the company believing their role to be one thing, but then they get pulled in so many different directions they end up floundering with no direction at all. For a lot of transitioned employees from other departments, Marketing ends up being their last stop at Fisher Investments. It’s unsettling when you realize your job has been reduced to a laundry list of the most random tasks because no one knows what they’re doing and what to do with you. Another major problem is when people leave, they generally take their knowledge with them and leave everyone else to pick up the pieces. I can’t tell you how many times I heard about so-and-so from back in the day who built some database that no one knows how to work, or no ones understands the logic behind a particular process, and too bad they never taught anybody because they haven’t been able to find a replacement. Marketing falls right back to square 1 over and over again. It’s a vicious cycle and from what I hear, it’s been like this since the beginning so it’s unlikely Marketing will ever learn from their repeated mistakes.
Limited resources is a major problem. Many employees are overloaded and yet somehow made to feel like they're not working hard enough. Having no life is like a badge of honor for a lot of managers. Working late night hours and weekends is something to brag about. So is missing lunch and eating from the vending machines all day long. Ten hours is a supremely long day, no one else I know in the Marketing industry works these forced hours. Long hours are a necessity from time to time, but mandatory? How about expanding the talent pool and hiring more people instead of running employees ragged? How about offering a little flexibility to demonstrate trust and respect for your employees? These rudimentary concepts are foreign ideals to Fisher Investments and they look down on such things as employee satisfaction and work-life balance. On top of this, every group always seems to have their token micro-managers who have no other skills but to play babysitter and track their team's comings and goings and stand over their shoulder to make sure they're working every single second of that 50-hour work week. Why doesn’t anyone ever tell them that their overbearing personalities is creating an unpleasant work environment? Do they not realize that all their irritating and condescending comments only serve to provide fodder for water cooler gossip and inspire job searches? Probably not, as these types are typically power-tripping egomaniacs who think they have dazzling personalities, beloved by all. Even some fellow teammates would make nasty comments about others and their schedule or workload, I had never experienced such all-encompassing negativity anywhere else before. All it takes is one person like that to make life hell at work. Whenever these people are around, there is palpable tension in the air. Having to constantly watch your back is never a good feeling.
The Fisher culture is inexplicably weird with no sense of camaraderie. There are some nice people, but I never got the sense that anyone was particularly willing to share their knowledge. It was like pulling teeth to find someone willing to help you. My manager was largely unavailable and never provided an ounce of support or direction. Much of it had to do with the fact that my manager was completely unknowledgeable about my work and showed little interest in my career, so what would I learn from them anyway? Many meetings were ignored, emails unanswered, or I received snippy and vague responses as if I was a nuisance for trying to do my job. There were only 2 semi-competent managers I felt I could rely on, but they soon left which was unsurprising given the oppressive environment. After a while, all these things weigh down on you and only serve to demotivate. A lot of the higher-ups have an arrogance about them that oftentimes gives one the feeling you’re not important enough to be spoken to. It was a very stand-offish group that thrived off of excluding people they deemed unworthy. I was only spoken to if they ever needed anything from me, all other times I might as well have been invisible. Hearing people lose their temper or treating employees poorly was not uncommon. I found the environment to be so unprofessional and unwelcoming, that I never felt 100% comfortable working in it."

Feels like the culture is stuck in the 90s or early 2000s. The technology provided to employees is below modern standards or slow to update. There is a big brother feel to how management treats employees. Depending on your role some employees aren't allowed to have full interest access and are limited to only a few websites. The company does an excellent job specializing labor for a more efficient business but this leads to very repetitive and mundane work. For most roles you will have very little variety in what you do every day which can get very boring after a short period of time.

This is something that the firm is working on defining, but many of Fisher's managers do not know how to do their job. Currently, many of the high performers are ""tapped"" to become a manager, but a high performer in a very operational role does not always equal a great leader.

636,,Junior Associate Position Review,2016-07-26,4.0,Anonymous Employee,"Fisher is great for what it does, it's relatively large for being privately owned. I got a lot of mixed reviews for the company while I was there, some people liked the direction that the owner takes and some don't. But it basically comes down to whether you're fit for a wealth management career, and if you are then Fisher can be a good place to start.","Junior Associate is a part-time position, that you can do for as long as you please, but it is not an easy path from that into Wealth Management.

639,,Intern's Perspective,2016-07-12,4.0,,"Interns are extremely well received by most employees at Fisher. It isn't your typical bottom of the food chain atmosphere, you learn a lot and meet a ton of people. The program itself is designed very well to give a different day-to-day while also adding value to the intern experience. There is a feel of a ""cultish"" culture; however, people do seem genuine in how much they enjoy working there. 

Great stepping stone out of college, associates complain about pay but there's no income tax if you live on the Washington side and it's extremely affordable. Generally, those pouting about low pay are trying to keep up with the city lifestyle Portland provides.","The company culture is slightly alarming to an outsider, some say it's a ""drink the kool-aid"" mentality. The pay for hourly intern is awesome, but we essentially get paid as much as an associate (which is bad for the associates). The tasks are menial that interns essentially are able to work at as an associate for some tasks. There is a lot of room for growth, it seems like they're wasting bodies by giving them tasks that could be automated instead of training them to do more sophisticated work.

There is a disproportionate male-to-female ratio depending on the department you're in, but that's just the nature of the financial services industry."

Nice facilities, beautiful location.","My job could honestly be done by any intelligent kid with a high school degree. They seem to hire a lot of Midwestern college grads who are content at Fisher because they've never been anywhere else, and feel lucky to work 50 hrs/wk for mediocre pay. There's a lot of indoctrination in the ""Fisher vision"" and culture, but most of the qualities they hammer home are ones that successful employees anywhere should already possess. I can't say I'm learning anything at all about finance, capital markets, etc. and it seems to be forbidden to question (even rhetorically, with the aim of understanding) any popularly-held beliefs. For someone with a lot of drive and ambition, it's tedious and frustrating."
644,,Great Place to Build a Career,2016-07-05,5.0,Team Leader,"Fisher is a place where you can work in lots of different areas over the course of a career. So, unlike so many of my friends at other companies, I don't have to seek out a new employer every few years in order to earn new responsibilities or learn new skills. The firm also prides itself on education, so there are ample opportunities to learn about finance, the industry, and world events from a capital markets perspective. I've worked at other firms where that is absolutely not the case.","Fisher is definitely not for everyone, and I would encourage anyone considering a job here to really get to know the culture--ask as many questions of the recruiters and interviewers as you can. The day-to-day can be tough for people not used to intense environments, and the formality of the office will be a culture shock to anyone coming from Technology or other similar firms in Silicon Valley."
645,,In depth review - please have a read,2016-06-21,1.0,Account Executive,"Salary:

2nd year - £48k - £72k
3rd year - £55k - £90k
4 or 5 years onwards - potential to earn £100k

Client offering:
There are a lot of poorer intermediaries out there in the financial industry and for the last 20 years Fisher Investments UK has performed very well","Progression:
Put simply, it does not exist at Fisher investments UK. The same cannot be said about the USA where all decision making is done. So try not to get ""sold"" in the interview that a reason to leave your current job is because of Fisher's career progression (it happens all too often)

Management:
Very poor and do not fit their respective roles. Many senior and middle managers can only be described as comical in the way they lead various teams. This is especially notable in the Account Executive (AE) team where managers immediately lack any respectability or integrity in their actions.

The Fisher ""Sell"":
Be prepared from the first minute you enter the building (interview or first day) to be sold by most employees. The interview itself is a sales process for Fisher and this is an obvious approach to most things throughout the firm. The best proof is contained in negative prospect feedback online, whereby people are hassled constantly and ""forced into the diary"". The salary, working conditions, flexibility and study support are always embellished by Fisher, or are simply flat out incorrect. Therefore it is up to each individual to make their own decision, but be extremely skeptical from day one!

The job:
If you want to earn money and do it in the simplest way possible - Fisher could well be for you!
Your role is to ask people for a meeting. Nothing more, nothing less.
What that therefore entails is a learning curve of around two weeks training and then you can do the same thing, everyday for the rest of your Fisher days (i.e. progression is incredibly rare from the AE team). You are led to believe you are an executive salesman, but quickly you will realise all you do is cold call and ask someone for a meeting. Nothing more, nothing less. Furthermore you will do better making lots of calls rather than relying on the quality “pitching” . Therefore if you haven't sold your soul walking through the door on the first day, you soon will be lead to believe you should slave away until 7:30pm trying to make a fast buck.

""Whats your extension""
This quote comes directly from the ""sales"" floor whereby managers will ask to directly speak to you. However at Fisher it works a little differently. Frequently you will overhear a conversation with the person next to you, whereby they are gifted HOT leads. Although some people may say ""such is life"", this is your golden ticket to earning money at Fisher. 
DO NOT believe for one second the AE team is a meritocracy, it is far from it. If you go down the pub on a Thursday and find yourself into the same music as a manager, you will probably  find you earn £75k+ in the your 2nd year.

Fisher needs to learn from its mistakes and I suggest steering clear until that day comes. This will always be the worst company I will ever work for and I feel relieved to have ceased employment with them."

No healthcare deductions

Most important lesson I learned was sales and business etiquette. A very good skill I learned from my team was to get people to talk about themselves (since most people will like doing this) and they will do anything for you(e.g. promote, higher bonus). I watched many individuals promoted/bonus using this method.  This is a skill that can be applied at other jobs or general meet and greets.

Extreme professional growth in Microsoft office programs. Most of your future professional careers will rely on this knowledge. 

Lots of power points presentation. Presentation skills in general.","The hours are terrible. 10 hour minimum work day. Add in long commute since the peninsula is expensive to afford.

There is no office space. Your coworker is in a chair next to you(imagine United economy space). Open work space is ok for some folks, but generally the old timers there were worn out by it. Caused un-necessary stress on some individuals. Imagine working there 10 years and you decided to buy an item on Amazon(if the website isn't blocked) during work hours. Most employers are understanding and can compromise when some employees decided to take care of a personal task on company time(especially if you have no time since your working there all day). Not at Fisher, your boss will often be staring at your computer to ensure they are maximizing 10 hours out of you.


Also some of these 5 start reviews are initiated by the company(through employees). This is a fact. Just a heads up when reading very positive reviews."

People hired right out of college 10 years ago when the firm was small are now the leaders and managers of a much larger firm and are way out of their depths. FI has to accommodate for this fact by hiring highly qualified individuals into terribly demanding roles with little management leadership or ability to effectuate drastically needed organizational change. The data governance is laughable to border line non-existent. Ultimately this is a 2,000 person organization that supports an investment management system that emphasizes a passively managed all equity portfolio.

But I told myself it couldn't be that bad..it is.  As an AE you are basically starting out by calling cool/dead leads.  Everyday I speak to people who we have been calling for years who are not interested, we basically harass people by sending out ""free literature"". They expect so many great results from horrible leads.  It is also extremely monotonous, mind-numbing work sitting there calling and being hung up on 40+ times a day.  Most of the department is men who previously played sports, it has a very strong culture.  Fisher also has a million different meetings throughout the day where they teach you things like ""how to reach your destiny"" or ""how to act like a professional"" it's so cheesy it makes me want to barf.  If your working for a finance firm shouldn't you already know how to act like a professional? They never told me before I started that you have to get your series 65 license.  After I started they said ""we'll give you plenty of time off the phone to study"" but then you get an email from you manger saying that you still need to keep up production and produce the same results as if you were on the phone. They bring in new batches of people every month like a factory and they must have super high turnover.  I looked at out production board and 67 new people started out of a 100 people in the department just in 2015. They honestly lose deals/prospects from bad reviews online, so I think there's been a big push for people to give good reviews, which are so over the top enthusiastic it just is so false.

I have served in many capacities and continue to be challenged, trusted and rewarded based on my output, just as they explained to me up front, and just as I've come to expect through their merit based compensation and talent management model.

I came to Fisher and have stayed at Fisher because they are unlike the rest. I know this because I interview hundreds of experienced industry pros ever year and meet with thousands of prospects each year. I have also met with thousands of Fisher clients and listen to their feedback compared with past experiences. 

The service model is unlike any other RIA. They don't sell other firm's products, they do their own extensive research and build client portfolios based on need, not outdated and subjective risk based broker models meant to sell product. This helps clients increase the likelihood of meeting their stated goals. They do extensive research well before making decisions for their private client and institutional portfolios.

Fisher's investment committee and large research team keep their client's interests first even when clients become overly myopic and try to mortgage their own futures at the first sign of short term volatility. Fisher innovates regularly as the rest of the industry sticks to the same business model designed decades ago. You can see this very clearly in their investment process, forward looking outlooks and tactical portfolio positioning as they evolve during each changing market cycle.","Even after 14 years I need to produce every single week.

I've been able to hold a number of different positions in which I continue to grow and learn and be challenged. I'm not a frat boy, nor do I have a pedigree from a fancy college (as other posts suggested you need to be successful), I'm just a hard working, ambitious, optimistic person who believes in what FI does.

Now, FI is a demanding place, no doubt - but it's been a great place to build an actual career and track-record. Yes, there's been up and downs, yes I've considered leaving to other firms in the Bay Area, yes I've made mistakes and my managers have held me accountable for results; but when I think holistically about my experience here, I'm so glad that I've stayed. 

 If you're thinking of joining FI out of school, you should be prepared for a bit of real world experience where metrics and business results are tied to compensation, and you should be prepared to not only think about what you want from a career but also what you're willing to do (or give up) to make that happen. A career takes time to build and if you're expecting to manage clint portfolios because you got a A- in your Portfolio Management class at Berkley, you'll want to re-set your expectations. What I can tell you is, if you come here, work hard, continue to learn and push yourself, there will be opportunities for you.

New Account Executives start by calling 'cool-dead' leads, which are often individuals that looked into the firm anywhere from 9 months to multiple years ago and only requested literature. Now they are hounded by an entire team on a rotating basis and newer account executives have to essentially find the few and far between diamonds in the rough while tenured execs sit on virtually unlimited leads of the highest quality, usually people that are requesting a meeting with an Outside Salesperson (OSP) within their area because they are already sold. Understandable model, but when you praise the tenured folks for their 'success' which should be a given considering their lead quality and condemn the others, it's backward and makes for a large hole to climb out of in your first year.

No consideration for their employees commute or time. They will hire you and let you start at the San Mateo office, and the next thing you know, you're off to Woodside. This is the CEOs old home nestled away in the hills of Woodside, CA. It is a nice lengthy drive from just about anywhere in the Bay Area. For a financial firm, that specifically helps their clients outpace inflation, they haven't updated the 30k a year salary for over a decade. With that being said anyone who lives in the Bay Area knows, you literally can't live anywhere, probably even with your parents for 30k a year. So if you don't hit the ground running, plan on eating canned food for awhile until, you get it. Technologically one of the most unsavy places to work in the Bay Area. You would think for being drop dead in the middle of the Silicon Valley, that they'd work out a deal, and get a decent software system. For a 65 billion dollar wealth manager they are awfully cheap when it comes to everything but your 401k and benefits package.

No ifs and or buts. One portfolio.  In theory it should work, but it has been under performing since 2012 and can't seem to catch up.  Even including bullish leveraged instruments in the portfolio.
While clients are assigned to you, it is still your responsibility to bring them in.  Should the initial salesman place a crappy client and he does not board, it WILL count against you.
You will be manually calculating peoples fees.
You will have to do HAND WRITTEN know your client surveys.  They don't seem to trust computers much at this firm.
If you come from outside, you will NOT be heard until you have served a sentence of at least 2 years.  They tell you they want you for your outside experience.  I did not see a single manager who had come from external at any given point.  They breed a culture of EVERYTHING IS AWESOME like the LEGO movie...and for those that are dumb enough, or stuck in life and need the job enough to believe it, great.  For anyone with outside experience, run for the hills.  You will not be heard and you will be in hot water when you question management on their archaic processes.  
Management will tell you this is a client facing role.  It is not.  This is 90% back office, operations job, with some phone contact with clients.  

This was my experience.  To be fair to the firm what they do works.  However turnover is very high due to the fact that this is just a giant RIA, with a bunch of overly dressed college grads banging over 100 people per day.  They focus on core affluent clients who don't know any better.  However it does result in new clients everyday.  This firm works.  For top management. Not for any employee with any real ambition. Clock in, clock out and don't ask questions.  And since of senior management  have been around since the founding of the company, dream on if you think there is a chance to move up in this firm.
Lastly when things do start going wrong be prepared to be lambasted by the founding father and told how useless and stupid you are in a full conference room, like a scene from Wolf of Wall Street.  But hey, as they say in the company...it's his firm, he can do what he wants."

They foster innovation, give loyalty, and most importantly, they treat you like an adult. You are entrusted with a lot of power and responsibilities and they give you the tools you need in order to do so. Managers seem hand-selected and are not only managers, but leaders. 

Fisher completely and wholeheartedly is invested in your career path and after several months, it is expected that you will start venturing off into a new type of position at the company, or higher level - assuming you're not already in a career position.","Like another reviewer said, there is a ""kool-aid"" culture and it's hard not to be part of it because everybody speaks so highly of the company...it's almost scary.

With great benefits come a sacrifice. There is a minimum of a 50-hour work week so it's hard to do anything when you're working until 5PM every day. They're pretty flexible (at least in my area) on leaving early, going to work late, etc for appointments.

Now let's take a look at the cons.","Seriously, if you ever wanted to know what it would be like to work for Darth Vader with a delusional paranoid complex, well, that would be Ken Fisher and his Empire. To say that promotions outside of middle management only happen after Vader chokes someone for a minor mistake would be an understatement. Much of management has been here longer than Emperor Palpatine's rule. Let's face it, the only way you will get a raise or make any real money in this company is if you are Boba Fett or as we like to call them OSP's (i.e. bounty hunters)--and the Force will not be with you if they or their masters even think you are getting in between them and their commission. You know that moment when the Emperor is huddling with the Prophets of the Dark Side? That this company in every aspect.

This workplace is about as diverse as an army of Stormtroopers---so many white frat bros in uncomfortable suits going through the motions after drinking the Kool Aid. Don't get me wrong there are female executives to run the trash compactors and oversee the new outposts on Lotide and Yavin Prime. Racial diversity in the Imperial Army is lacking. No surprise when every few years the Emperor goes on a rant telling Shadowtroopers they would be better off if their forbears had been locked up on Kejim long enough to avoid the war that led to the destruction of Yavin 4's economy.

But diversity doesn't matter much when the clone army is used as cannon fodder. You're ground up for a year or two before you start telling yourself that you're a little short to be a Stormtrooper and you toss yourself down the garbage shoot looking for an escape. Luckily there are lots of recruiting Jawas out there who will scoop you up and find you a home somewhere else. And boy is life better on Coruscant. 

Luke is doing some cool stuff though. Things are looking up with him around. That boy is our only hope. But until Emperor Fisher trips and falls down that long elevator shaft you are better off working for Watto on Tatooine unless you want to end up like TK-421."

737,,Great opportunities for those that are willing to work for it,2015-06-25,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Here are my Top 3 reasons for working at Fisher Investments: 1) Amazing benefits! Seriously, Fisher offers some of the most competitive benefits I've ever seen. The company pays all of your premiums, plus offers a 50% 401(k) match. 2) As mentioned in my title, Fisher offers growth and opportunity for those that are willing to work for it. To earn your place, you have to be willing to put in long hours and demonstrate loyalty. 3) You get to work with very smart, competitive people. The environment incentivizes both personal and professional growth. 

Every company has their faults and Fisher is not absent of them. They are not your Bay Area start up so don't expect catered lunches and game-filled break rooms. However, they provide great training, a really competitive salary, and the opportunity to work amongst very driven people. They have high expectations of their employees so be prepared to demonstrate what you're made of. If you're the type of individual that likes to skate by or expects the world handed to you, don't bother. I actually appreciate their old school work ethic and wouldn't be where I'm at today without the structure they've provided THANK YOU FI!","They have plenty but I'm not going to dwell on them here. If you've ever worked for another employer, you know that every company has issues. I've found that Fisher's issues are worth putting up with for the sake of my career."

Younger work environment with a lot of great people below the management level. This place was fairly decent and promising a little over 3yrs ago, but has really gone down hill.","They only teach Fisher. They give preferential treatment to people that have only worked here or readily drink the FI kool-aid. Don't speak your mind here, you'll regret it. Some very weird practices like forcing folks to handwrite forms and ask clients questions that have nothing to do with their finances."
741,,I wish I listened to the reviews before accepting the offer,2015-06-09,1.0,Account Executive,Benefits. They have AMAZING benefits.,"Where do I even begin. From my experience. everything was awful besides the benefits they had. 30k base pay is really low. Most AE positions starts at least at 40k in the Bay Area. You really have to enjoy sales in order to succeed. The environment was not healthy for me. I felt very uncomfortable at work and dreaded work every morning. 

People are very eager to help if they're having a good day. After they get a set or two, then they'll be more than happy to give you advice etc. But if they're not having a good day, they will just give you an hour lecture about irrelevant topics. Unfortunately, it's more common to have bad days than good.

There are obvious favorites at the office. They always talk about what they did over the weekend together and how drunk they got together. Very unprofessional. It's great that they developed a friends but it's not very considerate for them to talk about what they did outside of the office when they don't invite everyone. It's quite discouraging actually."
742,,Run Away,2015-05-28,2.0,Anonymous Employee,"Decent benefits, younger atmosphere and some cool clients to work with.","Hmm where to begin? Well for starters, senior management is a JOKE. You couldn't assemble a better cast of incompetent characters if you tried. Is the CEO brilliant? Yes. He is the farthest out of touch person you'll ever come into contact with? Yes. He basically will go on a rant and break down every couple of years and punish his minions by making all employees engage in a completely pointless exercise. This company is doomed over the next 5 to 10 years. They can only ride the victory of the tech bubble so long until their utter incompetence unravels the business. On top of all that, flexibility is almost non-existent. To sum it up, do not work here unless you enjoy being treated like a puppet. Don't make the same mistake I did."

744,,Best job I have ever had,2015-05-21,5.0,Anonymous Employee,Many of the disgruntled employees on this site are really young and this was their first job.  They don't know what the real world is like and think they should be paid well for limited experience and mediocre performance.  Fisher provides a ton of upside and demands excellence.  The average millennial coming out of college is entitled and lazy.  Work hard and you will be rewarded.  Benefits are solid... I'm not micromanaged.  I know what is expected of me and where I stand.,"This job isn't for you if you just want a good pay check to coast through your day.  Discount brokers like Schwab and Fidelity are a better fit.  Don't take a job like this unless you are ambitious and willing to work really hard to get where you want to be financially.  In fact, maybe the financial sales industry as a whole isn't a fit for you with that type of mindset, that's ok.  This industry isn't for everyone.  Financial sales in general has a high fail rate for careers compared to other industries but it also can be the most financially rewarding for the amount of education required for entry.  Very few career choices require just a bachelor's degree and you can be making 6 figures within a couple of years.  It's a results driven industry where you don't have to play politics to get where you want climbing that ""corporate ladder""... trust me, that can be very frustrating. Be honest with yourself about your personality and what your strengths and weaknesses are when you decide your next career choice b/c a Fisher job is the type that you will either love it or hate it depending on who you are as a person and the easy thing to do is blame Fisher when you just weren't a good fit to begin with."

747,,Look Elsewhere,2015-05-13,1.0,Regional Sales Associate,"It is easy to get a job at FI. They have an extremely high turnover rate, so they're always looking for more inexperienced employees. They try and recruit recent college graduates that might not know what they want to do with the rest of their life. They’re able to offer full-time jobs before graduation and broke college students should and will jump at that opportunity. FI also has an extremely structured culture. If you like process and hate change, this would be a place you’d love to work.","I started at FI a week after graduation and loved it. Quickly, I realized that the 10-hour days (that often turned into 12 or 13) didn’t allow for any sort of life outside of work. I wanted nothing more than to succeed so I often skipped meals and bathroom breaks just so I could get more work done. I was given raises and bonuses, but now after leaving FI and working elsewhere for over a year I realized that those minuscule raises and bonuses were almost nothing compared to the hours I put in daily. But, I must admit, at the time, I really thought that I was being treated fairly. The culture has to be one of the most restrictive aspects of FI. I worked in a department that was expected to be “high-energy” but was often scolded for “having too much fun” or not being as focused as I could be. There is absolutely no personal development or L&D opportunities at FI. There is no emphasis on growing team members because they don’t want to invest in people if they’re going to leave in a year or two. Unfortunately, this creates a down hill spiral and people leave because there is no investment in their growth or future.  The reason I left FI was because of unequal pay between men and women. After being a top-performer  (we were ranked weekly and stats were sent out to the team) for almost a year, I learned from my male coworkers that myself and another female coworker were earning a smaller bonus than the men on our team. During my exit interview I shared this with the HR professional and when I was packing up my box to leave the HR professional shared this information with my GVP that was standing feet away from me. Not only could I see the name on his desk phone, but I could hear the conversation over his headset. I’m so thankful for where I am now that I can’t regret working at FI. But, I promise you, you will be so much happier working somewhere else. I still feel so bad for all of my friends that work there that don’t know any better (FI was their first job out of college). It is incredibly sad that a company like FI can treat its employees with so little respect and gratitude. If you have the opportunity, please do yourself a favor and go somewhere else!"

752,,Thrilled Account Executive,2015-04-08,4.0,Account Executive,"Take your seats, everyone. Fisher is truly a great place to launch a career, and I promise you this isn't Bloomberg propaganda. If you're competitive, accountable, talented, sharp, outgoing, and have a good sense of humor, then look no further! 

I'm a woman who has never felt disrespected or been made to feel uncomfortable in this work environment. Why did I feel the need to mention that? Well, I noticed that there are scathing reviews from self-entitled ex- and current employees who feel validated by trying to smear the FI reputation. There are happy female employees everywhere in the firm. I haven't even come close to witnessing the previously mentioned complaints in action. Bear in mind that those who don't do well in their respective roles are more driven to be vocal and tend to create caricatures of the actual respectable people and managers who keep the firm going. 

I love my role as an Account Executive. I get paid based on my performance in addition to my salary; I wouldn't have it any other way. Correct me if I'm wrong, but management discusses compensation with you BEFORE you accept the offer, no? That goes over some people's heads. Hello? It's a sales role. If I don't get a decent check, then I have no one to blame but myself. Isn't that how it should be? 

There's extensive training, and I feel like FI helps me put the pedal to the metal with my career. I love the energy on each floor. My coworkers are awesome. Benefits are unmatched. I get all the support I need and ask for. Bottom line--this is your second home if you're a go-getter.","Technical issues can be resolved more efficiently to improve overall production.

THE PAY - seriously... $30k base in the Silicon Valley? They pay the same to the folks doing the same job in Camas, where that would be equivalent to about $50k here. No food, no drinks, no catered lunches. Catch up with the times... we are in the Bay Area, try to compete a little."

If they tell you that it is not a telemarketing job in the AE department, they are lying to you. It is that simple. You get a list of hundreds of people who, most likely mistakenly because they are typically old people, gave their contact information to fisher in order to get what they thought was some sort of investment information. You are then the annoying person to call them and try to solicit their business. Also, you are probably the 50th or 100th person from Fisher to call them, so they are really annoyed to be hearing from Fisher again. This is because we just recycle their phone number. You being the bottom of the barrel, will have the pleasure of calling them for the Nth time, and they will let you know on no uncertain terms how terrible Fisher Investments is. You should listen to them. Honestly, if you are halfway competent, it's not too hard to sell to these people. But you will feel slimy for doing it, because Fishers performance is honestly terrible. And their fees are so high, that the customer usually always is better off without them. They fill pass the kool-aid to you and try to convince you of the benefits they offer their clients. If you are able to think for yourself, you will see through it all as puffery and know that they are just like leeches. Got out of there as fast as I could. The place is a cult, and people who like to have an immature high-school type environment thrive there. If you are this type of person, you will find a home at FI.

770,,In for the long term,2015-01-08,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"I have been with Fisher over 15 years.  Started in CA, now in WA.  I came to Fisher because of its investment approach and focus on client service.  I have worked for large financial institutions and private firms that were eventually sold or now out of business.  In did not see myself having a life long career at these firms - I do at Fisher.  I like the fact that Fisher is privately owned with no plans of going public.  The firm controls its own destiny. 

Another huge reason i chose Fisher was growth.  The company was very small when i started versus today.  Growth over the last decade has been tremendous which means lots of opportunities for current and future employees.  The firm is also expanding outside the US.  Of course more opportunities which makes it a great place to launch a career if someone is fresh out of school or transition to if you've been in the industry.  

We continue to innovate and test in order to better the investment universe - always looking out for our client best interests.  Having been in the industry over 20 years this is not the motivation of most firms.  The industry is full of products that are sold not needed by clients, high commissions, fees, with little to help them achieve their financial goals.  I believe most people are better off with Fisher than their current adviser or self managing their portfolios.

Probably one of the most under appreciated things about the firm are its benefits; unparallelled 401K plan, healthcare, dental, vision, and other perks!  Things that most people have to pay for at other firms that we don't.  People must factor this into their total compensation.  Having the option to relocate from CA was huge improvement to quality of life for my family and I have no regrets leaving.  With the money saved from no WA income tax, lower cost of living, we go back to visit CA, travel whenever we like.  More pros than cons for me...I'm in for the long term.","What i like about the firm is also a challenge, growth.  Change everywhere, new employees, polices, procedures, multiple offices/countries, effective communication, and ensuring we are all contributing positively to achieve the firm goals."

788,,Decent company but behind the times for perks,2014-10-18,3.0,Analyst,"Good place to start a career, but it will be difficult for you to increase your earning potential to comparable rates within the Bay Area, there are just too many employees and the company is pretty cheap overall.  If you are willing to work/live in Washington, the salary will be reduced compared to what it is in the Bay, but you will most likely have more opportunities to advance to Management positions if you stand out.  

The people are really what make this place a nice place to work.  Considering how much time you see them, you really develop good relationships with most of your coworkers over time.","There is no work-life balance, and that's not going to change.  Working 7am-5pm at a minimum, then other times it could be a 12 hour workday.  Add in the 1 hour commute each way out of SF and you are giving up a lot of your time to work.  

The company specializes so many departments that you really only develop a particular skill set unless you rotate frequently.  This can potentially make it difficult if you ever decide to leave the firm and look for work elsewhere in the Bay - you are at a disadvantage in some (not all) aspects/skills compared to others who are more well-rounded.  

The perks and benefits are mediocre.  401k matching is very nice, but 20 days max vacation time for any tenure employee is a joke.  They just don't value life outside of work, you are expected to devote a lot of time to this place."
789,,Do Not Stunt Your Career,2014-10-17,1.0,Client Service Associate,401K Benefits and Health Plan are good,"1. Horrendous Culture. Leadership views employees like robots, not actual people who have emotions that need a sense of purpose and motivation. The culture is one of toughness, competitiveness, and machismo like some sort of frat house. Those that cannot tolerate this type of environment should not apply. Many people lack common courtesy and are unapproachable. All instruction comes from the top and there is very little input or collaboration with lower level employees.

2. Do employees really believe in the product that Fisher is selling? Compare the Fisher portfolio to it's primary benchmark over any length of time and you will see that it has underperformed dramatically. Yet we see the marketing machine in full effect on the web promoting Fisher books and wealth management to the unsuspecting and uninformed clientele. Is this a service that you would recommend to your friends and family? No.

3. Look at the alternatives. Within the Bay Area there are hundreds of companies who collectively have helped create the greatest economic and technological growth in the history of mankind. These public companies (who by the way are accountable to a board of directors and shareholders) will bend over backwards to keep their employees happy. Why? Because they know good people are a scarce resource and they know they will have to invest a lot of training, time, and money into developing them. This is not the case at Fisher where employees are disposable. The job sites are full of Fisher ads because of high turnover. They can get away with high turnover because they invest so little into each employee.

Employees in the Bay Area live in an area of the greatest economic and technological growth in the history of mankind, yet they choose to work at Fisher. It's like being next to the greatest chefs in the world and deciding to eat at Mcdonalds. 

No, the grass isn't always greener, but in this case based on personal experience, not only is it greener, it is quite lush."

-Great compensation IF you are willing to put in the work
-Upward mobility (.....again, if you work hard)

I've never understood most of the negative reviews on this site of Fisher. I've been here almost 8 years and worked at a few very large corporations prior to FI. My guess is 90% of the negative reviews on this site are from people hired right out of college or otherwise very young that weren't prepared for demanding work in a structured corporate setting. In the real world at a job that pays this well, a lot is expected of you. You should be prepared for that. 

For any associate level position, if you can stay disciplined, professional, work hard, and not become an HR nightmare, you will be rewarded. Simply put. Fisher is metric based (to a fault in some cases) so much so that success does not go unrecognized. It is phenomenally rare that someone who shows up on time every day, stays positive and professional, and works hard would not get the recognition, respect, and compensation they deserve. For that reason, be weary of overly negative reviews - they are probably from someone who was bad at their job.

I definitely would (and have) recommended Fisher to several friends.","Fisher has all the cons of a large, developed, HR sensitive corporation. Having experience outside FI, I find you just get used to this, it comes with the territory. Yes, the company can be slower moving at times. Yes, you may not have the flexibility you thought you would have. Yes, there is red tape. Get used to it."
794,,Very flexible and good to employees - Room to grow,2014-10-08,5.0,Sales Operations,Lots of opportunity for new and long term employees to move into different departments. Hard work and success allows you to run small teams and ability to manage larger groups if you desire. Incredible training programs if you decide to move throughout the firm. Fantastic benefits with solid 401k plan. Compensation is great for longer term employees and good for newer employees. The firm messaging is usually very clear and direct. Managers are approachable and will get you answers if they can't tell you on the spot. Camas location is new well designed and comfortable.,San Mateo location older but still ok. Longer hours but this is normal at Fisher or at Intel. They offer different hours for most departments if requested. Some departments are quiet and lower energy and some higher energy make sure to find your home and you will do well and excel.  This industry in general is long hours and this company demands quality work and it can be hard on those with thin skin.
795,,Hard work pays off,2014-10-08,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"I have worked at Fisher Investments for almost 8 years, and I have held different roles at the firm, working with almost all departments at the firm, in one way or another.  One thing I can tell you from experience, is that if you are willing to work hard, be open minded, do well with constructive criticism, (i.e., you WANT to get better), and you want to personally succeed; you will have a bright future here.  Now, on to some of the ""Pros"":

-Excellent Benefits package (the healthcare benefits and 401k are top notch here!)
-Meritocracy:  You are rewarded for doing a good job, and adding value to the company is recognized and rewarded 
-Promote from within:  FI likes to hire from within, and rewards people who have done a good job in their current role 
-Work/Life balance:  We are in finance, right?  Instead of working 70-80 hour weeks, most work under 50 hours total, we get weekends off, and the firm encourages time to ""recharge"" and use our PTO days.
-Management is always available: No corner offices means that your boss (or your bosses boss) is just a quick walk over if you want to chat
-Environment:  FI attracts great talent.  Not only are there amazingly talented people at the firm, the PEOPLE are mostly fun, and great to work with.","-FI is very ""by the book"" meaning internal changes sometimes take a while.  However, I have learned that patience pays off."
796,,Another cog in the wheel.,2014-10-07,1.0,Analyst,"-Mediocracy is tolerated

-Can eventually make good money","-Everyone is viewed as a replaceable cog in the wheel. 
-High turnover in certain teams is never viewed as an issue with management but people's impatience. 
-They praise challenge ideas but management is the first to say their hands are tied.
-People are promoted on time spent in Fisher, not actual experience.  Therefore your boss likely is a sales guy or doesn't know what you actually do. 
-Managers can't manage, they are promoted because of how long they have worked at Fisher.
-All time, energy and value is spent on sales and operations, makes it easier than actually outperforming or adding value. 
-If you want to move up basically need to become an IC at one point.
-You are pushed into another department/team every year and a half."
797,,Not the Best Nor the Worst,2014-10-03,3.0,Account Executive,"- Modern campus

- Young culture","Fisher really is a mixed bag. I was an Account Executive in the Washington office. It takes a solid 6 months before you are able to call the ""investors who have expressed interest in us!"" like they claim during the interviews. Until that point, you are stuck calling the dead leads and people who said ""No Thanks."" The GVP of that department is extremely vindictive and callous. Most of the Team Leaders are fairly friendly though. Training is top notch and you will become an inside sales pro after you are done working here. As everyone else says, FI is 90% sales and marketing. Be careful before you pack your bags from some college town and move to Oregon for this job, though."
798,,"a lackluster comp environment that neither dazzles in company culture, nor does it promote retention w/ competitive pay.",2014-09-30,2.0,Anonymous Employee,"I had a WONDERFUL boss, which is the main reason I stayed onboard for as long as I did.","no upward mobility, exposure to roles within the firm, sense of culture/belonging"
799,,Great Employer but caveat emptor,2014-09-30,3.0,Investment Counselor,"You can develop a great deal of capital markets knowledge and sales skills that will help you succeed in the Fisher environment.  They definitely give you the tools to succeed and expect a lot of you which I saw as a great thing.  Consistent and constant coaching to help you get better AT FISHER.  Training is really thorough and the culture among employees is pretty great.  It's easy to build a strong network between departments.  Benefits are genuinely great . . .it all makes the ""cons"" part of this particularly hard to point out.  But before accepting an offer you should know the intangible things that make Fisher are pretty lousy career choice. Hard work directly correlates to how you are paid. However....","A huge con is that if you decide to find yourself laid off or fired or quit to find more lucrative employment you will find that you have basically learned one skill set.  You have learned to sell, yes, but you have learned to sell Fisher not money management.  Since they are so incredibly laser-focused on their own strategy (plural was not used for a reason) you will find that other potential employers will see you as behind the game.  So while Fisher provides great opportunities within Fisher you will be pigeon-holed.  Financial employers in the Portland metro specifically have a bias against ex-Fisher employees and it is difficult to blame them.  I was told in my interview that Fisher does not hold value in Master's degrees or designations like CFA or CFP. As a matter of fact I pointed out that I was pursuing my MBA and the GVP told me ""that is garbage, it won't help you.""  Thank God I didn't listen to him. .you should still pursue goals like these because basically every other employer DOES care about those.  

Group-think is a huge problem at Fisher which is pretty funny because they will specifically tell you on your first day that they pride themselves on avoiding group-think.  

It is slowly being weeded away but the culture of fear still exists at Fisher.  That is a top down thing.  It's just burned into the corporate personality.  No matter how well you do, you should always be looking over your shoulder.  Some Team Leaders and GVPs are notoriously vindictive so if you screw up once you essentially never exit the dog house even with superior performance.

Also, you will be told that you have x bonus potential and you will literally never receive 100% of it.  During my tenure there I hadn't heard of a single employee who received their max bonus.

There are opportunities to take on new projects and tasks to showcase my skills and get noticed. Many of the managers I have encountered have been good about giving credit and praise for a job well done. There are also lots of opportunities to expand skills with training.

You don't have to worry about working late into the evenings and weekends.","50-hour standard work week (for most roles) gets really long. One hour of each 10 hr day is for lunch and is paid so that softens the blow a bit, but it's still long. It's hard to do much outside of work during the week.

The healthcare benefits are all employer paid, and they have truly stupendous vision benefits. At the end of the day, when you leave this firm, you will have realized you are much stronger than you thought you were, and you will have survived one of the worst experiences ever.","Work hours are insane, they demand a 50 hr week and demand that employees report at 7AM. They also factor in the overtime that they are legally required to pay you into your base salary, so the average hourly amount you earn is ridiculously low. There is no eye to specialization of role, so if you are working in a department or role where you would make more because of the focus you have, at Fisher they would just consider you an entry-level associate and pay you the same as an entry-level doc processing client services associate. They have no adherence to industry averages for salary, it is quite possible that you will be receiving about 20K-30K less than your peers in similar roles at different companies and doing about 3x-4x more work. 

The way the company presents itself to the outside world is a haphazard mess, they get employees because people are desperate for work or just out of college. Then they trap them at the job by demanding so much that the employee quickly becomes over-exhausted and over-stressed, and does not have the time to breathe let alone look for an escape route. Also, they require you to be at the firm for 3 years in order to fully vest in their 401(k) plan, so lots of turnover happens at the end of year three. 

There are one or two good managers, but they usually leave once they can take no more of the ever-present constant stream of utter BS. Most managers are micro-managers with no rhyme or reason to what they are doing or chaotic disorganized messes who are as hamstrung by the senseless instructions coming down from the top. 
Most employees who you befriend will feel the same level of utter hopelessness that you do. Panic attacks and dreading going to work are not uncommon occurrences. 

People get thrown under the bus all the time. There is literally no logic to the way that the firm operates. A tremendous amount of effort is placed on teaching new employees the ""Fisher Way"" and about the ""Fisher Difference"" - another term for these sessions is brainwashing.  The only way to survive is to drink the koolaid and buy into the crap that permeates every level. But if you have half a brain it is impossible to do that."

823,,"You'll walk away knowing a lot about operational procedures, but that's about it.",2014-03-23,2.0,Client Service Associate/Institutional Sales,"I intentionally held off writing a review immediately after I left Fisher for a couple reasons - one, I didn't want my written feedback to show signs of malice toward the company and two, I was interested in seeing what skill sets transferred to a new firm within the investment industry. 

I agree with most of the less favorable reviews, but with one caveat. Now having worked at another firm for over a year I find it surprisingly ironic that what made me leave Fisher, actually has helped me in ways I didn't expect.  

I'd wager if you ctrl. ""F""d the word fear in these reviews your page would suddenly be highlighted by yellow - now try searching for kool aid.  

Clearly former employees, me being one of them, have proven the perpetual state of paranoia is in fact a symptom from drinking the Fisher kool aid. The active ingredient to this kool aid is a heavy dose of fear.  

Fear drives results in this company, and it drives employees away from this company. Wait for it...a pro is coming out of this response, I promise. Fear somehow seeps it's way into every nook and cranny of this organization. I was fearful of my managers, because my managers were fearful of their managers, who were fearful of their managers...you get the point. I was so worried about messing up that I had to come up with processes that forced me to triple check everything, every single thing. One could be certain that any mistake would be reflected in my paycheck. And my manager made sure it was reflected in my paycheck because if it wasn't, he/she knew his/her manager would be asking why. 

The point I'm trying to make is the micro-management, the red tape, the finger pointing, the fear induced stress that percolates through every fiber of ""The Fish"" is what drove me away. But what it also did, was force me to create and fine tune processes that I now use everyday. And made me realize what being detail oriented actually means - Bingo, transferable skill set! 

Sure, I'm now in a perpetual state of paranoia, and should have probably signed up for a counseling session or two, but best believe my current boss sleeps at night knowing my name and ""slipped through the cracks"" never show up in the same sentence. 

If you're young, and you want your first job out of college to be around a bunch of other young people similar to yourself, it can be a good gig for a little while. As you move around Fisher internally, whether it be sales, marketing, research, client facing, portfolio analytics, you'll find each position requires a lot of operational/admin work. Operational backgrounds are good building blocks when you first start out in any industry, and they're often under appreciated because surprise, surprise, it's all the back end stuff that nobody sees.","If investing is your passion, and you want to be in research, don't apply here.

826,,A very disappointing experience,2014-03-06,1.0,Client Service Associate,"Great benefits 401K, health plan, dental and visual. The pay is okay for the work you do as a CSA but low for the industry.

The company is growing at a very fast rate. It is very willing to try new test and experiments to  become a better company. There are a lot of job of lateral opportunities within the firm. Very client focused. I heard it is not so bad outside sales and client service departments. They are trying to get better and the company is full of young people.","I did not believe the reviews when I first applied for Fisher Investments. Please believe me when I say they are very true. Stay away from CSA or sales. Turnover is very large for a reason. 

The culture is all about extreme micromanagement, secrets and lack of privacy. I learned to be successful in the role once I learned how to be scared and micromanaged by many people in the department.

Although management will publicly states they care about their employees their actions do not back up their words. During my time as a CSA, I was thrown under the bus multiple times, forced to point fingers, got yelled at multiple times, had to argue with Investment Councilors ( every day)  and had threats directed towards me. I set up multiple meetings with my manager to discuss this information but they made it seem like it was my fault or I was not pushing hard enough.  A manager can manage without experiencing the role in the past. All the dark water goes to the bottom. It is always the CSAs fault. It was not until my third manager in 6 months that I felt someone wanted to help me be successful and wanted to collaborate with me to help our clients. 

PTO: You are forced to take PTO for any time you are away from your desk. I pulled aside for a quick meeting with my manager because it became an issue that I was 3 minutes late to my desk. She later announced in our team meeting to submit PTO if we were away from our desk for more than 5 minutes.  You will not get any sick days and you will be expected to work during a holiday. 

Job Description: this was the true deal breaker for me. Fisher Investments will try to sell you the CSA role as an Investment Associate role. They will be very vague about the job description during the interview process and they will even mislead you to believe you will learn about investments. My day to day work consisted of filling out paperwork, creating cover letters, and sending out correspondence.  All your work will be checked by your mentor, your manager, the investment councilor and the review team before it goes out to the client. You do not need a college degree to do the work of a CSA. Your performance statistics will be affected if a fax does not go through or if you forgot a period on a document. CSAs live in daily fear of making a small mistake like not checking off a box. You are more or less a glorified secretary but less trusted than one. Although the company works will securities  and investments a CSA will rarely ever learn or hear anything about stocks, finance, economics, the market or how the company picks out securities. You will be expected to spend almost 2 years of your life filling out paperwork before you move to another department. 

Compensation: low for the industry. Although it was more of a personal experience they lied about bonus percentage during the interview and while I was working. 

Location: remote location. Most people live in Vancouver WA but its just a bunch of poor suburbs. Winter weather is horrible. You wont see the sun for 2 weeks at a time."

830,,Great job (unless you're in sales or client services),2014-02-22,4.0,Anonymous Employee,"After reading about the ""culture of fear"" and poor management, I thought I'd add my two cents. I have never experienced this on the portfolio management side of the firm, but can see this happening on the sales/client services side. Those jobs probably aren't worth the pay, but I'd definitely recommend research/portfolio management/operations.
The pros, in my experience: 
 - Excellent benefits and PTO
- Management interested in your success. Just mention that you're curious about another team, and a few days later you'll have an interview or shadow session with them.
- Young, intelligent, interesting coworkers
- Open-plan office
- Easy access to higher management
- Good place to learn technical skils: programming in VB, SQL, general finance knowledge, etc","- Long hours without the corresponding raise in pay
- Ultraspecialized teams may leave you without a broad base of experience
- Yes, there is a FIsher kool-aid."
831,,Miserable place,2014-02-21,1.0,Investment Associate,"Benefits: 401k matching, good health, vision, and dental benefits (no additional perks though)
Co-workers: Many people here are are genuinely nice to work with
Workday: No work on weekends","Believe the stories. 
I thought these reviews were ridiculously far-fetched when I interviewed, only to find, to my horror, that they are all true. 

Culture: This firm does not care about its employees. Fisher condones and supports hostile behavior. I have witnessed and experienced obscenities, degradation, backstabbing, finger-pointing, and threats directed toward me and my coworkers. Management will not defend you, they will tell you it's your fault. Fisher is built on a web of lies and secrecy. Everything you do is policed by your manager and other departments. For associates, tenured advisers or sales people will report you to your manager for a scolding if they are even the slightest bit displeased with your work. You will be treated like a child, they will demand you to perform and work over capacity without any extra compensation. When you leave, Fisher will not provide any recommendations. So no matter how well you did, they won't say squat about you if you pursue roles elsewhere. 

Hours: 50+ hour weeks, which is not too bad, but there is no flexibility. You will need to request PTO from your manager to take off 30 minutes early to make a doctors appointment. Hours are also very early (7AM-5PM, 6:30AM-4:30PM, 5:30AM-3:30PM). You will also often not have enough time to take lunch, this is frowned upon as those who take lunch are considered to have no ""will-do"" attitude.

PTO: There is not enough. 15 days PTO includes both holidays, sick days, personal days, everything. If you run out of PTO and are sick, you will not be paid. Expect to work through holidays (Christmas Eve, Black Friday, New Years Eve, etc...) 

Work: If you were sold as an ""Investment Associate"" like me, you will be shocked to find that your work will consist of creating paperwork, filing paperwork, and calling clients about paperwork. It's more customer service representative than any type of investment role. This is not a true finance firm, there is no ""prestige"" in working here as another (corporate-sponsored) ""reviewer"" claimed. No one on Wall Street has ever heard of Fisher Investments. As a college-graduate, I am embarrassed to speak about my work with friends, as it is extremely menial and unrewarding. Depending on who you're working with, forgetting a middle initial on one form can get you a conversation the GVP. The stress level for some associate groups are also very high. You will be asked to churn out more than you can handle. Some managers are terrible, stealing credit for your work, lying to you for their gain, throwing you under the bus so they can look better to upper management.

I tried not to drink any fluids so that I would not have to take a bathroom break, as this is also frowned upon. You will have more work than you can handle and then be told that you are not good enough. Fear based environment. Managers loved to tell us that they could fire us at any moment without reason.

They hire a lot of kids out of college and mold them into little clones. If these kids were to go to another firm, I believe they would have a hard time adapting and being successful because they have been so screwed up by Fisher. 
They operate in a manner that is inconsistent with the high level of ethics that they preach. For example, when I worked there, management came out with a center of influence questionnaire- asking clients who they knew (politicians, lawyers, etc). If they knew someone you were required to run it up to management. Management would then go through a separate process for the allocation of the clients funds. Invariably, the allocation would come back more conservative than it would have otherwise. 
Another example is that they removed volatility from the plans that the portfolio analysis team would put out. They claimed it wasn't very accurate and it shouldn't be relied on. When it was pointed out that they felt comfortable relying on the performance numbers that the plans had in them management fell silent.
Finally they spend millions of dollars a year in SEO to bury anything negative about them on the web. 

They claim to outperform the market but the S&P has handily outperformed them since inception and while they benchmark against the MSCI World I would imagine that they are underperforming that benchmark too. Ask them about 2012 performance."

You are expected to follow a very strict process - if this works for you and you are successful then great, you can earn a good salary. 

However for many this doesn't suit. The FSA Register clearly shows many Private Client Directors last six months or less. Training and Competency (other than instruction on selling the proposition in the correct way) is minimal and anyone who isn't performing will not last twelve months (the point at which employment legislation kicks in). This means a highly pressurised selling environment with the constant threat of sacking hanging over all newly recruited PCD's.

They are upset when its time to go home and they are asked to complete their work and leave?  -- Doesn’t that beat pushing employees to work 75+ hour work weeks?  These complaints seem to me these are over privileged kids that never had to hold a job and at least we gave them a chance.

Our customer support and service is held at such high levels that I have trouble interacting with other companies at time… whether it be the dry cleaners, the local restaurant, the dentist office, etc.  I hold everyone else to our high standards and it is tough sometimes.  Customers come first, every company should think this way, as we know without the customer we employees do not have a reason to get up in the morning.  I have the best job in the world, I work with the folks who have pushed the limits of capitalism and have succeeded… for that I am grateful.  If these complainers have time to sit around and type negative thoughts about us then maybe no other firm found a reason to hire them so their leaving our company was likely a blessing in disguise.  Fisher Investments is a GREAT place to work!",Not a place for all.
862,,"Limited Career Opportunities, Low Morale and a Company with an Uncertain Future",2013-04-08,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"Company matches employee 401k contributions. 
Health insurance is better than average financial firm. 
Company office is located immediately off the freeway.","I was a longtime employee of Fisher Investments (most recently as an Investment Counselor) prior to recently joining another financial services firm. There are some talented individuals at FI, and management has been able to retain them by using fear and intimidation. If someone is disappointed with career opportunities, company culture, compensation, etc., it'd be common to hear ""try to make this money elsewhere"" and ""the grass is not always greener at other companies."" I've worked at other financial firms before and after FI, and I can confidently say the grass is not only greener but quite lush too. 

- Company morale is low. There is little confidence in management's ability to lead, manage client portfolios or proclivity to consider/address employees' concerns.  The environment is the most toxic I've ever been around.    

- Employee turnover, which has always been high, has dramatically increased the past few years, especially tenured employees. Turnover is typically highest immediately after employees receive their bonuses. 

- Ken Fisher controls all decisions. With no shareholder accountability and management unwilling to challenge him, no changes can be made. Everyone is terribly afraid of Ken Fisher.  

- Complete obsession with its public image. FI proactively attempts to remove negative online FI content while promoting internally-created positive content (FI articles, reviews, etc.) They even provided us with ""training"" on how to defend against negative reviews to clients and prospective employees. Plus, there are efforts to proactively encourage any satisfied clients to post positive reviews online. Employees have also been ""encouraged"" to post positive reviews online on Ken's books and purchase his books to boost sales. All this money and effort would be better spent on improving the company rather than covering up to outsiders.       

- The most respected senior executive, presumably the next-in-command after Ken Fisher, has decided to leave the firm. Not good for stability or employees' confidence in company's future when the smartest guy in the room leaves. And this was with already below-average portfolio performance.     

- What's the career path? Few options outside of Sales, Operations and Investment Counselor roles in lower/middle management. These positions are cookie-cutter with no ability to impact their departments or the firm. 

- Investment Counselor position. Internal employees no longer want the position, and the company now has to consider and hire candidates who previously would not have been qualified. (May be a positive for notoriously tight company as these new hires are lower-paid) 

- Portfolio management (supposedly FI's main responsibility) has consistently been poor.  Defending the firms' constant underperformance to clients over the years has been exhausting.

- Management monitoring and critiquing (a.k.a. ""micro-management"") your work daily via a slew of reports is even more exhausting.

- Teamwork? Compensation structure pits teams & employees against each other, so your colleagues performing worse is more beneficial. One team performing ""well"" means another is performing ""poorly"" on a monthly basis. 



- Fisher training is non-transferrable to other financial firms, and FI and the other firms know it. FI's industry reputation is that of a marketing/advertising boiler room rather than an investment firm. 

- Graduate degrees and outside education/certification is discouraged. The lack of tuition reimbursement, and the attitude of management is that higher education adds no value to the firm. 

- Workday begins at 7am sharp. Managers track your daily arrival time, so don't think of being late because it may literally cost you. 

- Perks: No sabbaticals. No annual holiday/company party. No parking half the year (or having to ""compete for parking"") in San Mateo. No company outings. No ability to work from home. No flexibility in work schedule, even if you have young children (better hope your spouse does not work). Work space is 3ft x 2ft (seriously), kitchen space is minimal and bathroom situation is much worse. No work anniversary acknowledgments (even after major milestones). 

I did learn and hone some professional skills in my time at Fisher, but realistically I would have done the same anywhere else. I don't necessarily regret working at FI, but I would never consider again and would recommend against it for anyone else.  I do regret not leaving FI sooner because it is possible to believe in what you do, have an impact on others and your company all while making good money. Management reminds us that we are just ""cogs in the machine,"" and their complete disregard for their employees is obvious. For anyone looking to work at Fisher Investments, can all these reviewers be wrong?"

You benchmark against your direct (mediocre) peers instead of the disruptive entrants in your market.

IT sends out a memo that says anyone using unauthorized cloud services will be fired.

Spending and hiring decisions are ""approved"" by an entity outside of your group, even if they are within existing budget.

No one can answer, ""why work here?"" except to talk about the dental plan.

Executives are shuffled around the company to new roles, but outsiders don't ever seem to be brought in to raise the bar.

When an exec quits, their next in line is automatically promoted to their bosses' job, even if they weren't that great and there would have been better candidates  elsewhere.

867,,Green Grass?,2013-02-19,4.0,Anonymous Employee,"Working hard, doing well for clients, and increasing the firm's enterprise value will only make you succeed.  This is true in any good growing company.
All of the below are true and exceptional relative to the industry: Work life balance, pay (including bonuses), 401k, insurance, location, opportunity, and employee growth (if you seek it out).
90% of the industry will ask you for your list of 100+ closest friends and family who have money. FI never does that.  Same thing goes for potential clients.  We never ask clients what they would feel comfortable buying, we ask them a thorough set of questions regarding their goals and objectives for their money.
The firm is always open to new ideas, all the way from what other business avenues should we pursue, down to how can we service XYZ client better.
I have seen multiple instances where FI has been supportive of higher education.  The complaints on here are people who have asked for FI to pay for their higher education and have been denied.
As with all online review sites, keep in mind the people that have a negative outlook on FI are generally people that don't understand what is on the other side of the fence. People that have only worked for themselves (and presumably failed so they came to work for a large company), people that have little outside experience (straight out of school), or people that have never been in the finance industry which is horribly self servicing (brokers working on commission).
Take all pros and cons with a grain of salt, and this is coming from a previous insurance/investment broker.","Corporate Culture has been a drag on the company over the last 2-5 years.  Some clients hire us thinking we are invincible and some candidates choose us because of the same.  Both groups have false pretenses for choosing a money manager. The reality is that no manager will see relative out-performance of a benchmark over a long enough period of time. The majority of employees (or former) who have a dour view of Fisher think the grass is greener elsewhere.
They fall into two camps:
1) someone who has been at FI longer than 7 years and rarely been promoted while their 'peers' have moved up in their career. This person fails to realize their increasing bonus and salary because their peers have had larger increases and been given greater responsibility.
2) someone who has been at FI < 2 years and was 'sold' on a Utopian like money manager based on meritocracy.  Meritocracy is true, but it embodies more than just showing up and getting promoted in <2 years.
Many of the frustrated (ex)employees that complain about pay are in the Bay Area.  Move to Camas and make a better decision for your family and/or yourself. Your chocolate cake isn't fat free. Sr. Management has said on multiple occasions that the best management candidates at the firm are in WA.  That is probably because they make better financial decisions.
If you are an (ex)employee that has complained about your manager, when was the last time you made an effort to reach out to another group and showcase your ability?  If you are an introverted worker bee, don't be frustrated because you didn't show yourself to someone other than your manager.  Ask for projects or other responsibilities, bet you'd be surprised who would listen.  Most other managers only see their own employees under them so that automatically gives you more exposure.
Ken is a firm believer in real life experience, and while he doesn't look down upon higher education, he does say he won't pay employees to go get an MBA.  I know plenty of people who have only taken a job at a company just so they can get an MBA and then leave the company on their dime.  Ken is SMART in not paying employees for useless higher education only to leave with better 'credentials'.  My wife has an MBA and wrote a thesis on how to run a kite building company.  Does she have better credentials than a manager who has successfully grown their division's net income with a real budget faster than 75% of the company?"

870,,A Great Life Choice,2013-01-17,5.0,Various,"I joined Fisher 11 years ago. I’ve worked in many different capacities and departments and have been given more and more responsibility, more so than I would have received elsewhere. Prior to Fisher I worked for a competitor based in NYC. During my 11 years at Fisher Investments, their AUM has grown ten-fold. I joined FI in my late twenties when I was single, hungry, well educated and underpaid. I was full of promise as far as I was concerned. Fortunately, Fisher thought so too and they’ve put me the test. 
 
I’m now closing in on 40 years old, I’m still hungry for more and greater success, far more talented and knowledgable now than when I joined, and continue to stay at Fisher to build on an already 17 year career that’s been both financially and personally rewarding. 
 
Everyone at Fisher, all the way up to the CEO and Founder, Ken Fisher remain open to good ideas and feedback from their employee base. I frequently share my candid thoughts with my manager, and others too. It’s through this sort of frank discussion that we fix issues, challenge perspective and better myself and the firm. Alongside my candid criticism and input, I typically share solutions, innovative ideas and learn the ins and outs of running a complex business. 
 
Fisher has had its ups and downs through the years, less so than most firms, but they’re certainly not perfect and don’t claim to be.
 
My thoughts are the following:  Fisher Investments is world class when it comes to money management and employee talent. They manage money for some of the world’s largest organizations and thousands of America’s wealthiest private clients. FI is fast growing, hard charging and cutting edge. I wouldn't work anywhere that wasn't. Fisher is all of this because of the employees they choose to hire, not in spite of them. I know and am reminded of that often by my manager and his manager. I share this often with the candidates I interview for a variety of roles. I consider Fisher and me a good personality fit. I’m a firm believer that work is meant to be challenging, but also rewarding. At Fisher I get both. My genuine enthusiasm for working at Fisher hasn’t come without me being critical, vocal, and occasionally even difficult. I manage up, sideways and down and 11 years later, it's served me well. I encourage our younger employees to do the same. The management team has embraced this and has come to expect it. There have been more than a handful of times where Ken Fisher, Jeff Silk and other members of the executive team have called me after receiving feedback I’ve shared with my direct manager to further discuss my viewpoints and views of those lesser vocal employees who sit around me. They do so because they care to see their business thrive and I can attest they want their best employees retire here.
 
My trust and confidence in the firm and their trust in confidence in me has been mutual. They know and expect I’ll work hard for our clients. I have. I know and expect the firm will work hard to keep me. They have. Fisher has provided me with financial flexibility, a well cared for family, work-life balance and the best life has to offer. My time at Fisher has exceeded my expectations. 
 
Lastly, I interview several hundred potential employees (10+ years experience) each year from the investment industry. Through my interviewing efforts I am further reminded everyday why Fisher isn’t only a great launch pad to a successful investment management career, it’s the end game for me.","See my comments above, it's comprehensive."

I have been with the firm now for some time and happily plan to stay until I am ready to retire.   This is a first class organization with the opportunity to interact with any level of the company (CEO on down)and the pay and benefits are significantly better than other opportunities.  Sure, we work hard and the expectations are high, but what else would be expected in a multi-billion dollar money management firm?  We are one of the few firms that actually care about each customer and spend a great deal of time and resources on this. I am always surprised when I see someone leave the firm seeking “greener” pastures because I know what is out there in the finance industry – good luck swimming in that 60-80 hour per week shark tank.

Some people have listed the pay as good but it's really just on par with the industry, so don't let that be a major motivating factor.  Other people have said the people working at FI are young and fun and they've made lots of great friends.  Don't let that sway you either.  You'll find friends wherever you go.  FI isn't some special friend finding place. You end up becoming close to your co-workers mainly through commiserating about your job situation. On second thought, there is a pro for working at FI. When you leave, you will be so grateful and appreciative of your new job, your new company will think you're the happiest person they've ever met.","There are way too many points to mention in great detail, but here are highlights from my experience at FI:
- You'll be shuffled around from one position to another, not gaining the so-called ""depth"" they preach.
- Your manager will likely be an arrogant 20-something with zero experience. Don't expect to learn anything much.
- Get used to receiving only negative feedback delivered in the most condescending way. ""Thank you"" is a difficult phrase for most managers.
- Prepare to be heavily micro-managed and feeling like a disobedient schoolchild always watching your back. 
- Big brother is always watching. All emails are read. Everyone has extremely limited access to any websites besides Forbes and CNN.
- FI makes you paranoid as is a lot of secrecy going on. Managers spend the majority of the day whispering in conference rooms. Team members end up feeling excluded and targeted.
- Teamwork is virtually non-existent. Communication is poor. There is a lot of backstabbing and project stealing. A lot of credit taken away and throwing under buses. Not a supportive, encouraging environment. Everyone is out for themselves as employees are always competing against each other.
- As much as they tell you FI is a meritocracy, it really isn't. There are plenty of good hard working people who get lost in the shuffle because they don't fit the FI mold for whatever reason.
- Get used to being overworked. You will be required to work at least 50 hours a week in most departments. 7:00am-5:00pm. Despite the long hours, there is no flexibility whatsoever. Consider yourself lucky if you're let go by 4:15pm on Christmas Eve.
- After 5 years, you will accrue 20 days of PTO per year. You will never accrue or be gifted any more. 
- There is no tuition reimbursement. Higher education is looked down upon.
- Don't expect any sort of recognition on your work anniversary. No ""congratulations"". 
- FI doesn't care about work/life balance. It will be a struggle if you have a family to take care of.
- Speaking your mind only works if you're telling managers what they want to hear. You run the risk of being blacklisted/""off board"" for voicing your opinion.
- You will succumb to the many levels of bureaucracy. Many are averse to change. Most of my ideas to improve processes were shot down or never followed up on. Becomes so frustrating you just don't bother anymore.
- Nepotism runs rampant. Good for you if you have a relative or close friend or fraternity brother in management. Or maybe your parents are clients. You will do well.
- The offices themselves are outdated and cramped with no privacy. The break rooms are uninviting and dirty. I don't even want to get into the bathroom situation. I'm legitimately embarrassed for clients to visit the offices.
- The San Mateo location has parking problems. Not because of the city itself but because FI gives the other building tenants preferential access to ample parking in the lot. This forces FI employees to park in the furthest spots in the lot or even on the street in 2-hour spots. If you're caught parking in the lot when you're not supposed to, you'll get a ticket and sometimes a talking to by your manager.
- The Woodside office is depressing. Sure it's nice to go there for a weekend drive but being stuck up on the hill for 5 days a week will make you stir crazy. It is foggy for a good part of the year and the commute can be treacherous. 
- If you're looking for perks, this is the wrong company. FI will only give you the bare bones they are legally obliged to.
- If you've got an HR complaint, expect for it to be quietly swept under the rug. Their loyalties lie with the company, not you.
- When you do eventually leave FI, you will be bombarded with resumes from your fellow co-workers who are all of a sudden your new BFF.

- Some of these issues are bigger than others but all things you deserve to be aware of if seeking employment here. As you browse through these reviews, it should be pretty easy to discern reality from puffery and draw your own conclusions. The bottom line: FI doesn't treat its employees well. I have yet to meet a fellow employee who is actually happy working here. This includes managers. Everyone I know feels unappreciated and taken for granted. These sentiments are expressed by new and old employees alike. So don't expect things to get better. There are absolutely no incentives for long-term employees. In fact, you'll be worse off the longer you stay."

Very cheap company with no detectable interest in the well-being of the employees, and no perks whatsoever -not even a token holiday party to pump up morale.  
Zero adoption of technology or modern business practices.  No laptops, no tablets to take into your meetings, and if you happen to get a cell phone its a Blackberry.  The business literally runs on software  technology from the 80s.  They don't even throw out a wifi signal so you can bring your own Ipad.  Internet access on your desktop is denied for virtually all non-management or senior employees.  
The business has two directives 1) manage investment portfolios to beat a benchmark index by a few percent each year for clients and 2) take clients out of the market during a big downturn.  The company did neither the past decade -in other words, a complete failure to execute the primary business directives.  Fisher has had horrible portfolio performance on a 1,3,5,7,10 year annualized basis, they've lagged their benchmark as well as the S&P 500 benchmark, and missed the biggest bear market of the last 50 years in 2008.  They kept clients fully invested in stocks in 2008 leading to massive losses.  
As of 2012, the company is seeing record attrition by customers and employees.  This all leads to the worst morale and work environment where everyone is jumping ship around you, and those that stay are on the phones all day making excuses for the horrible performance. 
Multitude of lawsuits/arbitration cases and media scandals that the firm fights hard to bury by publishing fake articles and ""research reports"" in order to trick the algorithms of search engines. 
Company buys thousands and thousands of Ken Fisher's own books upon publishing to pump up the title on the best seller list.  Goes as far as having the employees buy the books as individuals from multiple etailers and ship to their homes to throw off the scent.  
Giant ethical question marks..."
877,,"Incredibly Challenging, Incredibly Rewarding",2012-12-09,5.0,,"Fisher offers an environment where you will be challenged and stretched every day.  It’s a place where you are constantly being encouraged to reach higher, move faster, think bigger, be bolder, and challenge conventional thinking about business practices and the finance industry.  As a result, the company attracts people who are driven, intelligent, and opinionated.  

This is not a company for people who want to come to work just to put in their hours, and do the bare minimum for their paycheck.  This company is for people who want to make a difference in this industry, and be heard within their organization.  If you are someone who has big ideas and strong ideals, and you have the work ethic to match; then you will likely be happy here.  

One of my favorite things about the company is the ability to have an impact on how the business is run.  If you see something that needs innovation or improvement within the organization, or if you have an idea that could completely alter the way the firm does business; there will always be someone in management that is eager to listen to you.  Then, if the idea has promise, there will be someone there to help you develop that idea and get it implemented – IF you’re willing to put the work in to refine your idea and follow it through implementation.

If you have a strong work ethic and the courage to speak your mind, and you have results to show for it, the company will reward you.  I’ve been with the company for 2years and 3 months, and I have worked hard and spoken my mind when I thought I could improve something around me.  As a result, I’ve been rewarded financially but also with opportunity (three different positions within the firm, in less than three years).  It hasn’t been easy.  It has been incredibly challenging, but the sense of accomplishment, progress, and upward mobility is more than enough reward to feel fulfilled and respected at the firm.  

If you want to come in to shake things up, and do everything you can to move the business forward and stop at nothing to ensure that our clients are getting unparalleled service – then you will enjoy working here, and you will be rewarded for your efforts.","Commute to the San Mateo and Woodside offices is tough, but the company now has a fully up and running (and growing) presence in the Portland Metro Area office where that isn’t a problem and where cost of living is exponentially better.

Your every step and anything you do will be monitored and questioned.  My team leader has even his own spy, the person that sits next to me who has been there for years always monitors me and passes everything to that person. 
Moreover, I really dislike the fact that the firm claims to care about its employees. THEY PLAIN DONT.  They have a ridiculously high turnover rate of employees.  I am leaving the firm in 2 weeks and as I talk to my coworkers they ALL seem to want to leave as soon as they get a chance. We already have about 4 people leave our team this year. 
Everyone in the management just worships Ken. Nobody dares to say anything to his words. YOu will constantly get emails saying KEN said this, he said that. He is on TV. 
Also,  Ken will always email and congratulate personally when an institutional client is signed. Common folks in the firm will NEVER recieve such emails.  Despite the fact that other teams do equally important if not more important tasks.  That just tells me a lot about Ken`s attitude toward his employees.  He cares only if you bring him more money. 
Salaries are not that competitive either, dont get fooled. My coworkers who have been here for 2 -3 years have not gotten a bonus or a raise since then. 
Most of my coworkers are very nice people, but they are not by any means smarter than average college graduates.  Even if they make the mistake of joining the firm, really smart people wouldnt stay here for too long.  There is no prospect in staying. 
Lastly,  people in the very senior management constantly talk trash about other companies. One time, a very top manager told us in a meeting that its not worths sending your kids to school these days. Moreover, he talked trash about companies like Google, facebook and other tech companies for providing all the benefits of food and gyms and stuff. In his eyes it was WASTE and loss of productivity.( FACEPALM) .  He went on to say that Fisher instead gives money to employees instead of those benefits.  WHERE IS MY MONEY??   
NO they dont, they have very average salaries, needless to say much much lower than those of those tech companies. 
Fisher is not company that values your educational degree, qualifications, or any other skills. They have their own way of doing things and they are not willing to change that. I have people with masters degrees and CFAs in my team and I graduated from college recently. We do exactly same work.  They wont listen to you. THEY DONT CARE ABOUT YOU.  SO STAY AWAY"
885,,"Not a bad place to start, but opportunities are better elsewhere",2012-09-30,2.0,Research Associate,"Pay is competitive for recent college grads, and early positions are good for building general business experience.","Fisher is comfortable with high turnover and treats employees accordingly. Morale is quite low, with a high percentage of workers looking to leave the firm. Weak hiring in financial services has kept turnover somewhat in check, but as the financial job market improves turnover is likely to accelerate.

The company represents itself as a meritocracy, but that isn't the reality. It's quite difficult to get fired, but just as difficult to be recognized for high achievement. Compensation is almost entirely based off of tenure. Employees are paid a base salary and a bonus. While exceptional employees receive a higher percentage of their  bonus every 6 months, their base salary and total potential for a bonus increases at the same rate as a sub-par employee - meaning that they likely get paid slightly more at the end of every bonus period but make no significant headway in moving themselves forward in the long run.

Overall, FI isn't a bad place to start working right out of college, but the company has consciously chosen to accept high turnover rather than improve working conditions or compensation. Don't expect that to change in the short run."

887,,"Decent place to start a career with great benefits, but happiness depends on managers",2012-09-17,3.0,Anonymous Employee,"Great place to start a career and make some good bucks. Get to move around to different teams based on interest (or where they want to move you), and there are some young, fun people working here.","Conversely, there are some terrible people working here, who want to put the blame anywhere but on themselves (e.g. on you). It's high pressure pretty much all the time, in most roles, because of that fear of failure and being reprimanded. Also, there is no parking here."
888,,A company that only pretends to care about its employees,2012-09-03,2.0,Anonymous Employee,Fisher is a good place to start if you are looking to get into a corporate work environment. The benefits are fantastic.,"The company is not friendly towards employees with families. The work schedule is inflexible and you must arrive by 7 every morning no matter your role at the company. Employees are not allowed time during the day to drop off/pick up children at day care and are chastised and sometimes penalized financially if consistently arrive after 7am.  Further, employees often work over 9 hours daily but do not report overtime out of fear of disciplinary action from management.  

Only some employees are allowed to park in the company parking lot while others park on the street and have to move their car every 2 hours to avoid parking tickets. There is no public transportation near by so each employee must own a car to get to work by the 7 am start time."
889,,"If you have low expectations, look elsewhere",2012-08-23,5.0,Associate-level Role,"I guess some of these reviewers would call me one of the ""robots"", but what I've seen in just over two years at this company is about as positive as any reasonable employee could expect.  And there's the rub-- the fact that the company has a lot of opportunities for entry level (read just out of college) workers means that some don't have the frame of reference needed to allow for a more fair comparison.  Having worked in several full-time post-college positions other than at Fisher, I can attest that some of the ""pros"" are substantial.  For example:

- You pay no medical care premiums (only copays); the company pays for your health insurance and has a generous 50% match, instantly vested, into your Healthcare Savings Account

- The fact that it is a metric-based environment is great for anyone who has ever been maltreated by an arbitrary boss.  The fact that the company has a laserlike focus on performance means that if you are consistent, methodical, accurate, and otherwise smart about how you do your job, you will never be bothered by management.  In fact, you'll be praised often, given opportunities to work on other projects, and usually, promoted within 1-3 years.  In many jobs there are also performance bonuses which many of the individuals railing on the company here apparently failed to receive

- Rotating jobs (""building breadth and depth"") is a certain cure for occupational boredom.  If you don't enjoy challenges or aren't a driven type of individual, admittedly, this is probably a nightmare.  For workers who loathe having to learn new things or changes in the work environment, though, there are other financial industry jobs (bank teller, for example).

- The company is selective to an almost absurd extent (which is why you'll see this remark again in the Cons section).  This means your office neighbor at an entry-level job is probably intelligent, accomplished, and have an engaging personality.  In part because they are intelligent, they will usually be busy, but you'll have some pretty awesome lunch and watercooler conversations.

- The company has undergone tremendous growth, even since 2008.  If you've ever been laid off or worked for an organization in decline, you understand that it is important to hitch your wagon to the right star.

- 401K match is 50%, and this is up to the legal IRS maximum, not just a small percentage of salary

And for me, perhaps most importantly, the company seeks to be ethically impeccable, aligning its incentives with that of its clients.  The company doesn't push bad packaged derivative and mutual fund products on unsuspecting retirees just to earn a commission.  They are fee-based so their goal is portfolio growth-- but not at any cost.  They've steered clear of risky investment choices to focus on long equity, bonds, and in bear markets, good old cash.  And as someone with an advanced degree in the financial field, I always heard that nobody beats the market.  Well, most of the time Fisher actually has over its history, even after fees, usually by a modest margin that is the whole point of hiring them instead of going with an alternative.","- The company is selective to an almost absurd extent (if you get a callback, your resume portrays absolute rockstarness)
- The office locations are mostly off-the-beaten path, meaning a sometimes lengthy commute for most entry-level people in the City, depending on your location and traffic conditions.  
- No frills (no climbing wall, arcade games, Swiss ball chairs, keg Fridays, on-site gym or other Silicon Valley accoutrements)
- Sometimes head-spinning amounts of priorities to juggle in some roles, mostly those related to projects and innovation initiatives
- I don't think it's a ""con"" but many seem to so I'll include ""high expectations"""

891,,Client Service Associate,2012-07-22,1.0,Client Service Associate,Very military style based company - you learn to just obey and do work non-stop. Definitely learn to manage time effectively and cover your butt whenever there are break-downs.,"Managers come from other departments, who have had no working experience before - many inexperienced and bad managers.
You get paid very little for 10 hours of work per day ( not to mention it starts at 6:30 a.m.)
No transferable skills
You can get stuck in one department, and if the manager doesn't like you, you can never go into department that you want to go in

892,,Decent beginner experience,2012-07-11,3.0,,"Was able to work in a professional environment, learn how basic wealth management firms are run.  Good people, fast paced.  Select own hours, work as you like.  Learn a lot about sales, useful later on in different areas of employment.  Good first job to try out, but not the best for the long run.","Pay was not that great, little chance for upward movement within organization.  Job was essentially cold calling individuals for extended periods of time.  Wish I could have learned more about the research aspect of wealth management."
893,,Robot factory,2012-06-19,3.0,Project Manager Associate,"Work with a lot of smart people (employees and a lot of the clients too), which is nice. Most employees are clever, ambitious and fun outside of work too. Good 401k package (50% match) and benefits. They offer a pretty good product for their market place.","No internet access for 10 hour (minimum) days. A lot of corporate catch phrase stuff: head down-chin up, it is what it is, living the dream. We were required to memorize the 3 paragraph 'fisher vision' and people would chant it in a weird jingoistic show of loyalty. Practically all the employees live in SF and the commute to San Mateo every day is miserable- makes every day at least 12 hours. Also, they don't let their employees all park in the lot because they want to rent out other floors in the building so you'll have to park your car in 2hour parking on the street half the time and walk past hundreds of empty spots. It's really dumb and kind of indicative of a lot of the management's philosophy of screwing over employees in favor of potential short-term ROI."
894,,Competitive,2012-05-13,4.0,Regional Sales Associate,Good pay and benefits. Room to move throughout the company if you work hard.,"Very metric driven. Much of what an individual does goes unrecognized by weekly metrics. Favoritism by some members of management for those who attended ""good"" schools."

896,,Competitive,2012-01-10,4.0,Investment Counselor,"Great base pay with great benefits especially if you have a family. Did not have to pay for insurance coverage, only small copays...its like getting a raise. Very open environment where everyone is accessible. I sat 20 feet from the CEO Ken Fisher and could go ask him a question  if I wanted. Set work hours and easy to get time off.","Overly competitive - cutthroat. Completely metric driven with quarterly bonuses drive strictly by metrics. This can lead to some looking out  for themselves and not as a team. All investment decisions are made by IPC and  when  they are  wrong clients get upset and fire the  firm, but high term rates can lead to lower bonus or dismissal when the client is not disappointed with you, but the IPC."
897,,"Great career opportunity, but physical workplace is way below par",2011-11-27,2.0,,"The firm is growing rapidly so there is opportunity to learn and advance.  Organization is quite flat, which allows you to interact with GVPs directly and independently.","The open workplace gives you 0 privacy.  Physical workplace at Woodside is quite unsatisfactory.  There are very limited lunch options and the lunch run doesn't quite cut it.  Break rooms and restrooms are gross.  If the training room is busy, you have to walk outdoors (even if its pouring).  
In most companies, floor where upper management sits is usually the best.  Not at the Fisher - its the worst.  The drive up the 2 lane mountain is painful (increases your commute by 20mins) and if you have cat allergies, watch out!"

If you're not motivated and outgoing, you shouldn't be in this role or in sales in general, but if sales doesn't scare you, there exists some serious profit potential at FI.","VERY bureaucratic!  They say it's a meritocracy but in reality it's just like any other large firm where tenure outweighs skill, aptitude/intelligence, and production."
