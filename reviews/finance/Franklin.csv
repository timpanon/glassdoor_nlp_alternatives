And employees don't grow at a personal level. They stay selfish and work with WIIFM (Like what's in it for me) Performance management is pathetic. Saying this with experience. No team bonding, nothing. They also cheated me with my offer. Like, they added my hike when I joined the company very tactically in variable pay. So eventually I joined the company with no hike.

2. Supportive Managers and they make you feel special
3. Freedom of Expression 
4. Great Pay
5. Scope of work is niche
6.Plenty to learn","1. Skilled Leadership - At times your manager might not understand anything what you do (since the leader is not skilled enough due to lack of knowledge) however the assessment of the individual is based on client feedback, hearsay and perception. So perception management is key here. Appreciation mails are given too much of importance.

2. Some leaders only try to find their clones while hiring rather than inclusion of diverse skills and thought processes not being able to eliminate conscious and unconscious bias. Some leaders are not cognizant of their biases and I believe that is an important trait of any great human capital organization. 

3. Lack of result oriented outcome

4. Lack of direction from managers and they don't take the ownership and responsibility of the team member's growth and aspiration since some of them are too busy shaping their own career.

5. A culture of you scratch my back and I will scratch yours is sometimes present in certain pockets and best person to do a certain job is sometimes ignored. 

6.Senior leaders who lack the knowhow even to create a presentation for themselves and might not know how to create a pivot might end up assessing highly skilled team members. What it does is that an average work from somebody might be blown out of proportion purely based on perception and hearsay which is easy for some people to strike great rapport with internal and external clients. Likewise a great skilled team member's contribution might not weigh that much since the manager does not know the value and effort going behind it."

1) Management - these are usually analysts that suddenly become managers. You will not find out why, but these are usually people who do politics behind the scenes and make themselves visible without actually doing any impact. They usually do not posses social skills and empathy or any sort of management skills. 

2) Old technology - innovative solutions are killed because no one (including IT) wants to take responsibility or risk if something goes wrong

3) Lack of support from IT - they basically do not care if you face any software issues and cannot perform basic daily tasks. At the same time, you are not allowed to solve those issues on your own (even if something is quick and easy), because they will not grant you admin rights

4) No chance for promotion - you can perform very well for years but at the and you will be told there is no budged for promotions or someone did better than you

5) The responsibility is usually pushed on associates, sometimes they are left alone and told they have to figure out on they own.

6) They will be talking how awesome they are but they always miles behind main competitors

7) Do not think because that can put you in troubles. Your job is to DELIVER."

Long-term (old school) workforce and mentality. Pretend to be interested, but ultimately not open to new ideas. Fear-based work environment. People are all out for themselves - mostly trying to ensure their own job security which continually suppresses progression on anything. New ideas and thinking are met with instant criticism which ultimately enables a 'beat-down' work environment. Mostly a ""just do what you're told and nothing more"" workplace. It's a perpetual cycle - ""let's act interested to be better"" - but continually fail on execution (again, falling back on old way of doing things = little-to-no progression). Executive management is oblivious to what is really happening as they are too busy trying to retain and grow the business externally - leaving the the internal environment static, stale, and rather toxic. Be aware - frustration abounds and awaits you at FTI."

Opportunities and visibility is low. They are also firing resources and outsourcing the work to other companies. The knowledge level of current staff is highly low compared to the market standards. 

My immediate manager had poor knowledge about the process which resulted in high politics and lost control within the team. The only way for the manager to get the work done was through micro managing and not by helping with process knowledge.

There are lot of vintage staff in the team due to which they have more control and say in everything. It is highly discouraging for a new employee to blend in the team and face so much politics. Many new joiners leave the GRC team within a year. 

I regret joining the GRC team and had to leave in a short span, which also took a hit on my career graph, as I atleast stick for few years in any company since starting of my Corporate Career."

Franklin missed the ETF boom, and is losing assets to index managers and other low cost providers. So, assets and revenues are moving backwards.

There are few opportunities for promotion because the Edinburgh office is not expanding (and I don't think the company as a whole is, either).

Many people have worked there so long that they are institutionalised and don't realise that the Franklin Templeton way may not be the only way and certainly isn't best practice (this includes middle and senior managers).

The outside of the buildings look prestigious but inside you have cube farms with bland bare white walls and tan carpet that's better suited for an overseas call center.  The appliances in the break rooms became obsolete when Reagan was in office. The office chairs may have been bought at a liquidation sale when Circuit City went out of business.

Management and culture match the motif.  It's very much a ""don't rock the boat"" environment. Innovation is not valued nor encouraged. What little does change is at an incredibly slow pace.  Next year they may upgrade to MS Office 2013...

Nobody hangs out after work.  It's very much a punch the clock environment.  Some groups try to organize quarterly fun activities but those events make watching paint dry seem like a rave.

If you are looking for a clear career path, feedback on your performance, or mentorship look somewhere else.  Management strongly believes in career ""self-guidance."" Its very much a pull yourself up by the boot straps, make it on your own environment.  That style fits the 80s appliances nicely.

The training was superb and taught me all of the basics of mutual funds and policies behind them. Co-workers were very supportive and many were really down to earth.,"The pressure to deliver in this department is apparent. Most of the new hires are new Graduates but many do not hold a college degree. Salary is set at $30,000 with a possible bonus of $1000. The next direct promotion is only a $3,000 upgrade in your salary. If you want to make more than $40,000 a year then you would have to make a lateral move into a different department besides customer service. Great benefits but must be vested with the company for a full 5 years to receive all of the retirement benefits you put in. Overall, it is a great place to work and get your feet wet if you have no other place to go. It is a call center environment so you must be on your toes to be answering call after call all day long. It is a high-turn over job."

Work life was well balanced and positive. People leaders actually earned their positions and paved the way to a prosperous future.","Now, those that have paved the way have either retired or told to leave by being granted roles that would discourage them to stay on. End result- when the mass lay offs occurred, supervisors that got the position because of connections are left crying- exposed for not knowing their role, even having been in the company for over 15 years. There's a great handful of these arrogant rude leaders that only act tough as a false facade- terrorizing those that know the business, discouraging them to even think of advancing in their current position. Sabotaging their performance appraisals, and making the most loyal of all staff feel lower than dirt. When Sir John passed away, a lot of the humanity and spirit died with him. So too have the loyal customers passed on. These leaders think it's some kind of farce. Instead of solving problems and leading, they make mischief and tomfoolery on their staff, lowering their self esteem and quality of work. Firing left and right just to cover and sweep things under the carpet. Now the company is a circus, shuffling current staff to cover work of a different department. Retention of knowledge is lower therefore more mistakes and fund losses. Vacations can't even be planned- we have a skeleton crew!  The specialists are only assuming on conjecture- not knowing the departments from which they are writing procedures and policies for. The total focus is lost. And when someone does something spectacular to save the company all they are given is a $5 Tim Horton's card. While staff from the US are given a plane ticket ,accommodations and acknowledged for their contributions and loyalty with a spectacular celebration. Shame!"
