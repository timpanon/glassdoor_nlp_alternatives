1,,Influential connections over merit and hard working employees,2022-04-09,2.0,Information Security Analyst,"The Employee Benefits are great! 
Fortunately my team was great!","The environment is extremely toxic, this stems from management feeding fear into employees that they will lose their job if they don’t do this or do that; a constant pressure to perform. Also, although the culture “promotes” work life balance etc. the fear of losing a job that’s put upon the employees comes with an underlying message of basically giving up your personal life, work late nights, after hours etc (This is from personal experience). The next unfortunate part is after putting so much into a job, the natural expectation would be that you be recognized for this work or at the least be appreciated for it. Unfortunately if you look at the history of employees, people do not get promoted till after 5/6 years and that too after somehow pleading for it. 
One thing that is VERY VERY clear is that, the higher ups (CIO, CISO..etc) have been hiring people that they personally know and then promoting them 2/3 positions higher within a 6 month timeframe (consultant to Sr.manager or Director within 6months) . I do not doubt the capability of these individuals that have been promoted however, what about the employees that have worked for YEARS, and have been loyal and contributed tremendously? This is the unfortunate truth but this system very well lives within Freddie and I hope someone is able to bring a change."

- diversity 
- Freddie offers arguably the most opportunity to quickly learn the multifamily industry and quickly gain exposure and unmatched experience. 
- opportunities to travel 
- opportunity to move up quickly - top performers can be quickly recognized and rewarded accordingly","- Culture - Team hierarchy was constantly challenged by subordinate employees or other teams. Company politics often played a significant role in all decisions, whether the decision was made by a department head or team lead. It was surprisingly apparent how the direction of the department or section of the department would change based on internal politics. 
- Competition - Iternal competition can be healthy, and encourage strong performance. However, competition between employees of similar positions was frequently highlighted and used as an intimidation tactic, versus to reward or encourage. Office/Company politics often played a larger role and heavily influenced internal competition, leaving employees with the impression they were fighting their co-workers for promotions or compensation increases. 
- Transparency - Many times pertinent information about operations or important decisions made by senior management was released to the public before the firm’s own employees were made aware. On more than one occasion, external clients or partners would provide an update that had not been delivered internally yet."

1. Easier to get promoted if you are in lower levels. I worked with two good managers that left because after 10 and 13 years they hit the no promotion wall. Both of them left as hot promo jobs at new companies. This does not make my future seem bright. I guess after year 10 I should leave if I want more money.
2. I am Hispanic, and there are very few of us. Sometimes “diversity” is a lip service.
3. Directors and VPs that have been there a while are yes people and do anything to not rock the boat and keep their lofty jobs. They hire their people or bring them from previous workplaces to run their teams. VPs are unreachable for day to day communication."
177,,Work life balance,2021-08-11,5.0,Controller/Director,Flex schedule works the best especially during Covid. Management listens to employees’ requests and reacts quickly.,Annual performance evaluation process should be more transparent and guidance should be provided to all people managers.

186,,Covid response is terrible.,2021-07-27,1.0,Analyst,I like the people that I work with.,"1. Management is all over the place and inconsistent with Covid message. Some areas are working from home and others are coming back 1, 2, and 3 days a week.  There is no consistency across the company.  Other people are working from home remotely but others have to go back into the office and risk their lives and their families lives. It’s also unproductive wearing a mask all day so I see it hindering communication.  Upper level Management has offices they can separate themselves from the general population of employees. 90% of all other employees are working in common areas and exposed.  Where will people eat.  Can someone wear a mask for 8 hours? If I get sick or my family gets sick what will they say, “We are sorry”.  They are asking people if they are vaccinated or not.  Even with a vaccine you are not 100% vaccinated so that question is irrelevant.  They also had you agree to how many days a week you are coming into the office so it is as if you submitted it and agreed to it.  No this was forced by management to fill out or you would have to have a conversation with your manager and was not a choice. So let’s say you do get sick and something happens they will say you agreed to come into the he office and assume the risks. 

3. New CEO is part of the problem and making bad decisions related to employee health. Covid is not something you experiment with.  Not a good way to build trust with employees."

236,,Fm,2021-05-10,5.0,Technology Analyst,Just started and so far awesome coworkers!,None as of right now

239,,Freddie a great place to work,2021-05-07,5.0,Data Analytics Manager,"Good culture, great opportunities for advancement.",really no bad con at this point.
240,,Who you know,2021-05-05,3.0,Anonymous Employee,Hire a fair share of minorities,Very political environment. Diversity does not represent open-mindness and stuffy atmosphere considering it's a mid size company.
241,,Agile is Fragile and so is Management,2021-05-04,3.0,Software Developer,"Great food and facilities (gym included), great pandemic response, laid back atmosphere, tuition reimbursement, good benefits, decent pay, they hire good, smart people at non-management positions","1. Most managers manage upward (aka always trying to impress/appease higher-ups). That's not to say they don't care about their own employees, but most of the time, any pressure from above trickles downward.
2. Most business personnel and management don't seem to understand the Agile methodology, using it to excuse bad planning, poor foresight and requirements and even whole pieces of functionality changing at an alarming rate based on feedback from above.
3. Product analysts and owners are not trained properly in how to write proper requirements or how to perform real data analysis. I was told this by multiple product analysts who left the company or went to other parts of the company, and it really shows.
4. More often than not, developers are asked to do everything. Anything that requires actual troubleshooting or problem solving within a product team is passed off to developers. As a developer, you will deal with QA testers, product staff, business and management whining about environments that are down at any/all hours like helpless children. After several months/years, it does grate on you. 
5. Developers receive a ton of blame for things that are out of their control. For example, if requirements are not fleshed out/wrong, it is because the developer did not bring it up in the grooming session (before they actually analyzed the requirement). If an environment goes down (which its IT, it happens sometimes) and someone can't meet a sprint goal or deadline because of it, the development team is blamed. 
6. So much legacy work. I'm on a modern delivery team, yet my management has told me that knowing the legacy Weblogic systems gives me more job security than the Spring Boot API I am working on. 
7. The product ownership/business will not take responsibility for bad planning or lack of foresight. It is our job as the development team to adapt on the fly even if it requires duplicate work, weekend work and late hours to complete the sprint goals. 
8. If we do not complete our work for the sprint for whatever reason, it is called out as problematic, but they will do it in a passive aggressive way. 
9. Hard work being left out of product demos because ""the business wouldn't be interested in that,"" so why are we doing it? 
10. The scrum master role has no power to influence anything at this company. You are given a crown from Burger King, and you are told to make sure the sprint goals are met with little/no support.
11. Most developers get burnt out due to lack of interest, too many (non-paid if you're Professional or above) overtime hours and trying to please higher ups that will turn on you in an instant for something like time entry (even though you're a salaried employee).
12. Some technology is old. Too many legacy apps still, but they are working on it.
13. Blame/shame culture surrounding administrative tasks or not completing work on time for whatever reason."

Once people here get to Director, but especially VP, they typically don't leave until retirement or a reorg. Getting to Director is often quite subjective and politically influenced (or luck). 
To advance you need a lot of ""perception"" value, and often need a VP or Senior Director who pseudo sponsors you, etc.

Upper management is controlling, corporate bureaucracy, limited opportunities for growth, back-stabbing, and culture around consultants is the WORST. People treat consultants like they are less than employees and there is a huge negative culture about being a consultant. You are removed from the rest of the ""real"" employees in almost every way. 

My first day on the job, I sat through a 4 hour orientation (normal freddie mac employees got 2 days), and each consultant was supposed to be picked up by their supervisor. My supervisor LITERALLY FORGOT ABOUT ME. ON DAY ONE. She never came to get me and I had to CALL HER. My new colleague gave me directions on how to get there, and once I found the building I walked with her to where I'd be working. I passed Freddie Mac employees working at their nice cubicles and got very excited to see where I'd be sitting. She led me to a long crowded table with 7 other people - and the spot where I was supposed to work was cluttered with old food crumbs, caked in dust, and had wires and was completely cluttered. They hadn't cleared off a space for me or cared one bit that I would be arriving. My new colleague left me to get situated and I spent the rest of the day thinking I had made a mistake.

After half a year of working there, I was given one hour's notice on a random Friday afternoon to pack up my things and go. No one was in the office and my supervisor and her boss were not there to walk me out. My full time co-worker had to and they felt super awkward escorting me out of the building."

Flexible work schedules work only for a few teams, the rest is just a clown fiesta every day. 
The supervisors/seniors are picked based on who they’re kissing up to rather than merit. Pay is on the low end/below that of the industry along with their benefits.
The recently updated modern work areas should work in theory, but there is no culture for it. People are loud, nosy and perhaps smelly. I have seen people spitting in the break room sink. I will stop here but The list goes on.

Only some teams get the coaching and structure required to function as a true Agile team. Bureaucracy for IT processes makes performing duties external to your team at best incredibly slow and at worst nearly impossible. You need approvals for EVERYTHING. Work life balance is far better on the business side than the IT side from what I've noticed. Management will overload you with work if pressured from above or by the business side.

I was an IT generalist and hired for first job out of school.  The IT side was 90% indians and filled with Indian H1b bodyshops.   I don’t understand how this is allowed.  It is the opposite of diversity.  Didn’t understand what H1b visa is until working at Freddie.

The CTO left after 6 months.  From my cohort of entry level people , maybe 75% have left after discovering what the actual situation was.  Very few remain. 

If you are a college grad looking for a job only go to Freddie Mac if you are desperate.  

We had lots of PowerPoint slides and weekend work.    It was just a negative and sad culture.  The code was very poor quality, we did better code in school projects.   Agile is a joke.  Product owners refuse to use the agile tools.   Project managers are used as product owners.

I've read some of the posts and you've been answering with the same platitudes for literally years and if anything, this place has gotten worse.  No humoring is necessary.***

IT is rife with dysfunction.  If you love pointless meetings that never end, processes upon processes upon processes upon processes, complete risk aversion, management just passing the time with horrible decisions, alternate lifestyles constantly jammed in your face, lots of weekend work, relatively low pay, more PowerPoint decks than you can possibly imagine, and mostly sad or angry people jammed together in uncomfortable tables, then this is your place!!  However, if you’re a talented IT person who does not like to be mired in endless, pointless processes, wants the tools they need to get the job done, takes risks and is generally a high-performer, stay away.  You will not fit in here.  Plus, they probably won’t give you the pay you want, anyway.  

Passive aggressiveness is a virtue here and it is punctuated by people manage by intimidation and scream the loudest getting promoted.  This place generally has the saddest people I’ve ever seen.  I thought it was me when I would pass people in the hallway and nod or say “hi” and get no response in return.  I talked to others and apparently, this is a thing here!!  Go figure!!  It’s not surprising…read on.  

Promotion, pay, and hiring have been hijacked by processes and there is too much HR involved.  The mind-numbing process in getting people promoted takes way too long – so good people give up and leave.   What we have left are people that are willing to put up with this and generally do just enough to not get fired.  What this means is that everything is a fire drill.  Why?  This is the only way to get people to do actual work.  They won’t read emails, answer phones or respond to texts so the only way to get work done is have a fire drill.  These fire drills are constantly happening and it is so very annoying – yet it is strangely necessary at Freddie Mac.  

You also can’t get the people you really need because Freddie doesn’t want to pay market rates.  HR says they do studies and blah, blah, blah but all of us IT folks know that Freddie is at the very low end of the pay scale.  So what happens is that you have to settle for your 3rd or 4th choice (if they're still waiting because HR/recruiting moves at their own pace, which is to say S-L-O-W) or you engage a consulting firm that will not hire Americans.  Not an ideal situation.  

This place claims to be diverse but IT is the least diverse place I’ve ever seen. Freddie Mac is government funded and it’s a mystery to me why our tax dollars bailed out a company that is so in love with foreign consulting companies.  You mean to tell me there are no US Veterans that would jump at the chance to work at Freddie?  I know for a fact there are - but this company turns their back on them in favor of foreign consulting companies.  Also remember that FREDDIE MAC WENT BANKRUPT and if it weren’t for the US Government, this place would not exist.   Without government intervention, a place as dystopian as this would probably would not exist at all – it couldn’t!!  Market forces would drive it and the rampant dysfunction out of business.  If our tax dollars are paying for a place like this, there should be preference given to US Veterans.  In true Freddie fashion they SAY they want US Veterans but their actions say something else.  Believe me, I am surrounded by people who 100% no way could even possibly be US Veterans.  Maybe they served in whatever country they came from…who knows.  I do know they are not US Veterans.    

There has been a recent completion of a “space modernization” effort.  I’m not sure what they meant by “modernization” but the definition I know of “modernization” does not involve cramming the most humans together in the most uncomfortable ways.  Our desks are long tables with many people, so you have loud talking, strange smells, and distractions everywhere – and no privacy.  There are so many people crammed together with giant rows of tables, our bathrooms get overcrowded.  They make stadium bathrooms look pristine by comparison.  They’re always packed and usually disgusting.  Oh and when someone gets sick, it spreads around like wildfire because we’re all jammed in here together, having to share our disgusting bathrooms.  That was an unexpected bonus!!  Yay Freddie!!  

This “modernization” effort started with Freddie Management asking us to select what we preferred to have.  My long table desk with 6 people on it was NOT even a selection.  This was just foisted upon us.  I imagine the folks who decided that this horrible arrangement is great for Freddie employees don’t actually have to work in it.  I’ve never seen a VP at one of these sweatshop tables.  Great job, Freddie!! 

I could go on and on about many other things but you get the idea.  It’s not a habit of mine to do something like this but the story has to be told somehow.  Complete corporate dysfunction like this should not be allowed to continue.  You would think my thoughts and many others’ thoughts on this site would get through to management.  I am, BTW, IN Freddie Management so all this stuff is right in my face - and I’m sure I could be more of the solution but the culture here is such that open, honest information sharing is a big risk if you’re not a VP (I mentioned Freddie’s HUGE risk aversion) so you can only do it if you’re willing to lose your job.  This is yet another indication of Freddie’s toxic, dysfunctional culture.  

Anyway, It looks like someone reads these because someone from Freddie (I guess) answers them with the same template-like words speaking in the same platitudes and HR-speak, but I really don’t think they care – they SAY they do but I think that’s more for themselves and they really don’t - otherwise, things would be getting better and they are most definitely not.
 
Management has meetings to ask for feedback and we do endless surveys but most people don’t dare complain because if you do, you will not be promoted, or you will be slowly (or sometimes quickly) removed from your job.  They say the surveys are anonymous but no one trusts that – nothing is anonymous.  I know that as I am typing this. 

So people put up with this nonsense and Freddie management says the same things over and over to make themselves feel better.   They have talked endlessly about culture this and change that but it’s getting worse, not better.   I don’t expect anything to come from this note because it’s just been lip service for years - but Freddie’s actions show what management really thinks.  Actions do speak louder than words.  Well, I certainly hear you!!  

These huge, entrenched, cultural problems will only get better after a thorough house-cleaning and a reboot of how we treat our employees and contractors – and the US taxpayer - but I don’t expect anything to happen soon on that.  Clearly, there are other motives at play and I have no idea what they might be.  At least I can warn those of you thinking of a career here."

587,,Ok place,2019-02-10,3.0,Anonymous Employee,"Salary, benefits, great co workers. Flexible schedule","Can be too many managers in one group. And they will cover for each other rather then help or protect their direct reports. Some managers have been with the company for way to long and refuse to learn the new technology or procedures. They will just ride your coattails instead of trying to adapt. Too many contractors as well. Number of contractors outnumber actual full time employees. Lack of accountability. HR makes it difficult to get rid of bad employees. Especially ones that are constantly late, still take extra long lunches and cannot perform their job to a point where other co workers must go behind them and double check their work."
588,,"Best Place I have worked, but there is room for imrpovement with telework culture",2019-02-07,3.0,Communications Manager,"I love working at this company.  They really value their employees.  I find the pay competitive, and there are great benefits such as an onsite doctor, gym, and a five star cafeteria. I find my work interesting, and I have ample opportunity for training and learning.","As a working mom, I need a company to have a flexible, telework- friendly work environment.  On paper, Freddie Mac has this, but the culture and technology does not support it. Most senior leadership do not have a polycon system in their offices to support conference calls, which would allow remote employees to better participate in meetings.  What's worse is that most conference rooms do not have polycons or even telephones at all.  Many times, we have to use our cell phones and pass them around so who ever is speaking in the room can be heard by remote participants.  This is just not in line with other consulting, financial, and technology companies in the area and is a big downside to recruiting staff, especially women.  Another example of the culture is that, in most cases, I have to request the addition of a conference line to meetings.  The expectation is that you be there, in person.  

The other thing I wish senior leadership would listen to is that their student loan repayment program is not working.  It sends payments directly to your loan holder, at random and different days every month.  Therefore our student loan repayment benefit is going directly to the banks (applied towards interest) and not towards the principal of our loans.  It is very frustrating. 

Finally, they need to increase vacation days and maternity leave days.  They aren't keeping up with the times."

Good benefits and work life balance.,There is still lot of beauracracy and politics even though it is improving. Often reports is very disturbing
601,,Not a Good Place to Work as an IT Contractor,2018-12-08,1.0,Senior Systems Analyst,Good cafeteria. Upper management encourages telework though leaves it up to managers.,"1) Contractors are treated like second-class citizens at Freddie Mac in some key ways. For example, you can’t park in the garages of the buildings you work in, but rather have to park far away in a contractors garage. Before that garage was built, you had to park in a rented lot and take a shuttle. In contrast, regular employees got  to park in the garages below the buildings they work in.  As a contractor you already know that you don't get the same opportunities regular employees do, but this particular inconvenience hits you every rainy and every cold winter day. If you're lucky, your manager will let you telecommute a day or twice a week,  but not all managers allow their employees, especially contract employees, to telecommute.

2) Freddie Mac is converting over its regular cube-type spaces into very open office spaces on steroids. They claim it's to improve productivity, but really it's to pack more people -- more contractors -- into less space. The result is a noisy, crowded, very low privacy work environment with almost no dividers or barriers. You don't have desks anymore, you have work tables with computers. Freddie  has added some nice features to the renovated areas, like more ""huddle"" rooms on the edges, but it doesn’t make up for the lack of desk privacy. If you are a person who likes a quieter, less distracted work environment, you will absolutely loathe this setup.

3) The Freddie Mac IT workforce is very un-diverse, as it is about 80-85% Indian immigrant H1B visa holders  in their early to mid 30s. There are plenty of women among them, though, and so gender diversity is not a problem at least. As my last job had been a work environment with more diversity not only in ethnicity, nationality, and culture but age as well, it was an unpleasant shift to come to work in such a nondiverse environment.

4) Contractors greatly outnumber regular employees, and do more work than regular employees. I felt at times the role of Freddie Mac contractors is to actually do the real work and keep things afloat while regular Freddie Mac employees spend 25-30% of their time out on training and at conferences."

Believe me or not, I enjoyed the best time as a Consultant where there is more to do and lots to learn than employees working for 10..20..30 years who have more politics to do than good work. That will make you severely frustrated, a lot happens behind closed doors and most of them are good to keep the rumors and noises alive. They will never knowledge share which shows their insecurity for not doing anything worthwhile for years.
2. Workspace is shrinking every year. Forget cubicles, i.e. three people sitting next to each other in same team cannot attend same webex meeting from desk as there is echo due to close proximity. Privacy is something which don't exist and attending a meeting over webex in peace is remotely possible. Business area still manages to get better sitting arrangements but IT place is crowded and considered out of class.

3. Food in cafeteria is over-priced considered to the pay Freddie gives to its employees. Advice to HR will be to survey the apartment rents within 4-10 mile radius of Freddie Mac. That will give them some ground level reality of where the Freddie Mac office is located and what's the pay scale offered.

4. HR's encourage to apply to internal jobs thru portal. So apply to as many internal positions as possible but you wont be interviewed unless the manager has opened the position specially for you. In other words the manager should know you personally to work with you. This is an unspoken truth.

5. Policies are out-dated and HR is trying to get them straight. An interesting policy to share, unless you are full time for an year with Freddie Mac, you are not entitled for three weeks of family leave(paternity) to bond with new borns. So plan it wisely. 

6. Its a Trillion dollar company but it does not trust you straightaway after joining, so company contribution for 401K will only start after you complete an year as full time.

7. Work overtime for nothing extra.

8. Most departments give two days remote work due to traffic and other considerations. But employees need to check that before joining because the work from home is at the discretion of the department head. So nothing for granted. Check before you move."

Very limited privacy - conversations can be heard from across the hall, huddle rooms are monopolized for those that are seeking to concentrate."
646,,Please with decision to join Freddie Mac,2018-08-10,4.0,Anonymous Employee,"Very nice facilities including free parking, onsite fitness center, and great food options in cafeterias.

Very active employee resource groups. Many to choose from and ways to become involved. 

Stellar leadership of HRDI, in particular Jacqui Welch & Dominica Groom are very personable, connected, and make you feel appreciated. 

Flexible work options that encourage and support telework where possible. 

Strong onboarding program.

Although a GSE, recognition and effort to remain current and relevant within industry and outside industry is apparent. There are opportunities for best practice sharing and capability building though conference attendance and other external events.","No flexibility of offering additional vacation as part of offer process for management level position.  This is not consistent with blue chip companies.

Technology such as webex is inconsistent at best.  

No formal mentoring/coaching center of excellence to help embed relational learning. At this time, employee resource group mentoring circles are the only visible offering which are inconsistent in their methodology. Having a CoE would help provide  greater structure for offerings.

The Employee Assistance Program (EAP) seems dated and underwhelming. The only tangible evidence of existence seems to be offerings for chair messages."

839,,Honest Opinion - from current Manager,2016-10-16,2.0,Technical Manager,"Decent pay (average , sometimes lower than industry standards), average benefits and nice gym.  Freddie Mac is a place that is good for right out of college, the company has a big push to hire young talent , which is awesome, only to fall short in the retention practice.  Freddie Mac is slowly creeping towards newer technology- but still uses old technology for a lot of its practices (Lotus Notes). 

For new managers and upcoming leadership - it is a good place to get your feet wet, but not much after.  It seems to get stale and the career growth is very much limited by the 20-30 year veterans of the position/title above yours, keeping the promotion out of reach. 

There have been accusations of the work environment being hostile, and I would agree to an extent.  It largely depends on what team you are hired onto and who your direct Manager is. 

Overall - I would recommend Freddie Mac to a newly graduated young professional who is looking to start out their career - but not much after that. The industry (Banking in general) has far better opportunities that pay better and offer better benefits.","The accusation of leadership being ""disconnected"" is completely true - Directors and above seem to be oblivious to what is actually happening below them, which often times leads to a severe disconnect between staff and the ""higher ups"".

Embrace change - this is very big, Freddie Mac has a culture of not introducing change or embracing new technology.  Sure - they ""preach"" about the idea of embracing change at the top level, but below that there is no action. 

Slow Career Growth - again, teams have leadership roles that sit stagnant for 10+ years, often times with the same Directors/Managers.  This leaves little room for growth or advancement."
840,,Honest Opinion - from current Manager,2016-10-16,2.0,Technical Manager,"Decent pay (average , sometimes lower than industry standards), average benefits and nice gym.  Freddie Mac is a place that is good for right out of college, the company has a big push to hire young talent , which is awesome, only to fall short in the retention practice.  Freddie Mac is slowly creeping towards newer technology- but still uses old technology for a lot of its practices (Lotus Notes). 

For new managers and upcoming leadership - it is a good place to get your feet wet, but not much after.  It seems to get stale and the career growth is very much limited by the 20-30 year veterans of the position/title above yours, keeping the promotion out of reach.

862,,REO Professional,2016-07-27,3.0,Anonymous Employee,The best reason to work for Freddie Mac/HomeSteps is because of the people/coworkers. They all feel like a large family and assist each other to make the day to day easier. There are events and groups to join to give the work life balance and to assist the community with donations.,The management needs more training. There wasn't a HR office in my location which made it difficult to get assistance from an HR representative. Working in a regional office is very different from working in corporate.

870,,Freddie Mac has many areas for improvement,2016-07-05,2.0,Anonymous Employee,"- Freddie Mac has good 401K benefits, as it will match 6% of your 401K contribution.
- Some teams at Freddie Mac have good work-life balance.  The key here is to find a good team.  A good VP, director, and manager help a lot with achieving proper work-life balance.","- Unfortunately, Freddie Mac has no process for providing anonymous upward feedback for managers.  As a result, Freddie Mac has a lot of mediocre managers who aren't good people managers and/or managers who don't properly train their subordinates.  This fosters an environment of complacency, and those weak managers will continue to operate this way until Freddie Mac provides a tool to inform them of their opportunities for improvement.  
- Freddie Mac is in a state of conservatorship and is not growing, which along with a state of uninformed self-satisfaction among managers and directors, provides few opportunities to advance one's career.  If Freddie Mac instituted an anonymous upward feedback tool and encouraged its use, managers would improve and Freddie Mac would be able to rotate or remove below average managers, which would provide additional opportunities to advance.
- Every year Freddie Mac employees are provided with the opportunity to provide feedback/recommendations about their work environment to HR and upper management.  Sadly, during my tenure here (2 + yrs) upper management has never specifically addressed the feedback/recommendations they receive.  There is no acknowledgement that Freddie Mac is working hard to improve in areas that the surveys identify as areas for improvement.  Employees are given NO insight into what upper management thinks or believes are legitimate areas for improvement or areas they are working on.  As a result, employees may write the same recommendations year after year, with no reported progress being made with respect to those recommendations.
- There is an uneven distribution of work outside of teams and within teams, this results in some employees having little to do, and other employees being overworked.  
- I agree with the other reviews that suggest that Freddie Mac is not the best environment for recent college graduates due to the lack of growth opportunities, below average managers (many of whom aren't interested in properly training their subordinates), and uneven work distribution, which can result in some people being overworked and others with an abundance of idleness."

The Tech Analyst program needs considerable improvements. 
For one, the program is NOT rotational, which means that new hire do not get to experience different positions; each new hire is stuck in a position for the whole year.
Next, there was no on-the-job training at all. We spend the first two weeks learning some basic concepts...and that's it. After the firs two weeks of on-boarding, we are thrown into projects.
Third, mentors are not assigned to the new hires, we had to seek them out on our own.

Maybe good cafeteria and covered parking for full time.,"Before I realized what a backward company I was in at Freddie, I recommended a friend for an open position through my contracting company. This guy was/is a seasoned Java developer/applications architect who had been through high profile contracting gigs starting with MCI. He had a strong resume Verizon/AT&T/IBM consulting gigs, etc.

He was interviewed by the Indian director and three of his peeps. There was **no** cultural diversity in the interview panel who proceeded to pepper the candidate with the most obscure, irrelevant technical questions you can imagine, at a rapid non-stop pace. To his credit, my friend ended the 'interview' early and excused himself.

The director complained to my contracting company that they were sending him sub-standard candidates. Well, here's the 'breathtaking' part - the successful candidate was Indian, and he was the cousin of a member of the interviewing panel. He was technically weak and his written/spoken English skills were rudimentary.

But this guy was connected and although we were under whip-cracking deadlines by management, our new team member was given a free ride to float off to two hour lunches three or four times a week with his peeps.

There are talented IT pros out there that are US citizens that can't get a break and Freddie would bend over into impossible positions to make sure ""H1B""  Visa candidates were treated royally. That's breathtaking."

There still seems to be a very thick and clunky org structure. As a result, in some areas of the business, more seasoned non-managerial employees may feel micromanaged.

To be permanent you have to apply direct outside staffing agencies. One mistake, you are let go.

That's about it....","The company culture is to 1) own the technology by not the responsibility for effective use and deployment of that technology; 2) hire consultants to do the lion's share of the work with little to no guidance; 3) operate without a grand plan - they completely lack vision and E.A. mission .

The CIO should perform an internal audit to determine how many of its fulltime workers are using and enforcing the use of ANY ITSM framework.   They have their own waterfall model, which no one uses.  They are also trying to adopt Agile DevOps but very few have been properly trained on it.  There is CONSTANT change in process, procedures and tools...  They claim to not differentiate between fulltime and consultants.

Even during our orientation program, a few of us were still switched around without any input from us. For some in the cohort, the positions that they ended up in were a perfect fit. For many, not so much. The program used to be a rotational program, but the phased that out due to complaints of people having to sit through 6 month rotations in areas they did NOT want to have a career in (e.g. someone looking to be a Project Manager having to do a Developer rotation). Now, you are placed into a role, and unless you make a very hard effort to be switched within the first 3 months, you are essentially stuck in that position for the rest of the year. In this latest cohort, it has led to numerous people leaving the company after <1 year of service due to the difficulty of moving laterally."

GMAC ResCap (Residential Capital) was a financial service company that focuses on residential estate loans that went bankrupt in 2013. It was part of General Motors' finance group GMAC which was then taken over by Ally Financial.

Change has ground to a halt. There is no domain knowledge in the existing group.   Our IT leaders upgrade email to Outlook and think they have solved an immense problem.

Many leaders have hired consulting teams to just make the presentations and a handsome speaker with nicer slides equates to the best idea in the room. There are about 200 VPs for less than 5000 employees and the lust for kingdom and fiefdom creates hierarchy that is rampant with sycophancy and thus the talent sulks. It is not the work but how one moves the parts is the theme. Most of the projects are inflated by at least 1000% and take longer and longer to execute. Managers of failed projects get promoted while the ones who took risk and innovated get bypassed. Unable to attract talent from outside, it has to hire lame people at a better position at the cost of further demoralizing the workforce. Management speaks a lot but just can not communicate.

Good managers play it fair and push back some, but many feel powerless and do what they are asked to do regardless if it is the right thing to do or not!!

Senior management's comp is governed by law and the FHFA -- they are not ""fatcat executives"" -- at least not when compared to executives at financial institutions that are not in conservatorship.","In the past few years, Freddie Mac has cut employees and benefits.  They terminated the pension plan.  They reduced the severance plan.  Yes, they got rid of free soda.  Compensation is stagnant (raises of 1% - 2% per year).  They eliminated matching contributions for employee's charitable contributions.  They have increased the employee's share of the cost of health insurance premiums.  Notwithstanding their promotion of flexible work arrangements, many managers frown upon the practice.  They have revised the compensation system to favor ""above plan"" employees to the detrimiment of ""on plan"" and ""below plan"" employees and, at the same time, they have instituted an employee performance system that forces managers to rate 10% of employees as ""below plan.""  Consequently, some ""on plan"" employees will be rated ""below plan"" and will received reduced compensation without any justification for such a rating or reduction.

Difficulty in finding native English speakers to work has resulted in dropping communication standards in hiring and more and more frequent language barrier issues, particularly in technical areas. Bureaucracy and controls and audit frequencies have grown since government takeover and seem to be a permanent norm now.

If you have a good manager they can shield you from much of this and allow sometimes interesting work and great benefits to all work in your favor. If you have a mediocre or bad manager (more common since very hands off seems to be the norm) you're left to fend for yourself in an increasingly bad environment.

Bottom line, if you're considering working here ask who will be your manager and get a clear sense of them first. They will make the biggest difference in your job quality."

Limited access to management training that could help you with career advancement within the organization.  Management takes forever to get approval on projects.  Signatures from the director level can take months.  Pay scale is not competitive.
1196,,Good/bad work experience depends on a lot of things,2013-04-24,4.0,Technology Analyst,"I know some people have had bad experiences at Freddie Mac, and it seems to be more likely that people who have bad experiences at a company are more likely to write a Glassdoor review than people who have had good experiences at a company.

I've had a very positive experience working at Freddie Mac. I know some of my other colleagues in similar positions have not encountered as much exciting work (or as much work in general) as I have, so I understand why they are not as happy. The underlying culture, people, and benefits are good. I think a person's day-to-day working experience changes their opinions about the company as a whole rather than just their position/work.

Some teams are better to work for than others here. I feel bad that some people haven't had as good of an experience as I have had. I guess it's hit or miss.

• Most teams allow flexible work arrangements. This includes teleworking and choosing your own hours within a certain range (e.g., start between 6:00 AM - 9:00 AM, end between 3:00 PM - 6:00 PM). Also the minimum amount of hours a full-time employee needs to work is 38.75. An extra 15-minute paid break per day helps keep the doctor away.

• Amicable and productive work environments. Most employees are friendly, cooperative, hard-working, intelligent, etc. If you treat others with respect, patience, and benevolence, you will generally receive it in return.

• Tightly-knit, engaging teams. I've had the benefit of working with various teams under various managers and have seen a beneficial team dynamic that exists in them. I've also seen this as an outside observer while working with other teams on projects.

• On-campus benefits. There are pretty decent cafeterias in all but one of the main offices in McLean. There's a gym in the main home office and a smaller exercise room in one of the non-main offices in McLean. Although there is no on-site day care service, Freddie Mac partners with a day care service nearby to give employees subsidized family care services. Also every break room has a refrigerator, microwave, coffee machine/hot water dispenser, and a fountain machine.","• Contingent Workers (CWs) are not treated as well as full-time employees. They can't use every parking garage, they can't use the on-site gym, they don't get benefits, they typically have to share cubicles/desks with other CWs, etc. I feel like this could absolutely be better. I know other companies do not treat CWs the same way as Freddie Mac.

• High-level reorganizations have been happening somewhat frequently as upper management comes and goes. It doesn't necessarily have a detrimental effect on the rest of the company, but it can make things confusing sometimes and can evoke anxiety about the near-term future of the company.

• As has been stated in other reviews, salaries are not as competitive as other companies in the industry. This is to be expected, though, when you consider where Freddie Mac was a few years ago and its current conservatorship with FHFA."

I work part time and I have fantastic benefits and a salary that could not be beat in 2009 - however, the conservatorship/government has not allowed raises, nor bonuses, for the last two years. So you get the salary you get. Also, for those being hired on in 2012, the benefits will be far less generous than what those of us hired prior to 2012 have.
When I started at Freddie Mac I was taking the job just to have a job (graduated from college in the middle of the recession). They even paid for my 3 remaining college courses to complete my degree in a completely unrelated field from normal FM'ers. But I quickly loved the people I worked with, a small group of expert underwriters, and my director was absolutely awesome. Very patient and ecouraging of moving upward within the company - something I wasn't interested in doing, because I loved my job and my group. So instead, when I ran out of things to do (because I finished my given tasks much more quickly then my predecessor), she would hunt for more resposibilites for me to take on. This worked in my favor, because I have a far wider range of responsibilites and skills now. 
Good for promotions if you know the right people - my predecessor went from being a Loan Processor, but got in good with the VP and my director and moved up to a Project Manager, and then on to working in Fraud (something it normally takes years to accomplish).","I can only speak for my department, but being a company that's good for promotions when you ""know the right people"" can sometimes be damaging. Especially when the person you are putting in place is completely inexperienced. Basically, my department had a reorganization and my director took a new position to remain in our old department. The director she was replaced with was very friendly and obliging to our needs, but completely unfamiliar with anything that my group did. At the same time, a new VP and a new Senior Manager were hired. All of which directly oversee our group. Luckily my group is completely self-sufficient (all have worked at FM for a long time) and did not need a lot of oversight, or direction. However, having a supervisor who does not understand what you're job is, or what you're doing on a daily basis, can be very frustrating. And lately our department has been all about ""changing for the better"". Combine this with the government breathing down the company's neck, large layoffs, no raises or bonuses, poor company image, little information being shared concerning our future and, well...it wasn't long before half the members of my happy little group were leaving for other departments they believed to be more stable. You essentially have 3 people telling you to do things that don't make any sense and do not understand what it is you do in the first place (at least not in depth). They are definitely trying their best to learn and understand, but it's just as frustrating. I still am very satisfied with my job, because I'm also self-sufficient and know what I should be doing, on top of being allowed to work from home, great benefits, etc."

They care what the executives make and how much their ""deferred compensation"" in.  Oh yeah....we aren't allowed to call our bonuses, ""bonuses""...they are either short term incentives, long term incentives, or some other long-winded way of saying bonus.  And if you work here, don't expect to get one.  At least one that's worth a darn.  Ever see Christmas Vacation with Chevy Chase?  I would be happy to get the ""Jelly of the month club"" gift certificate.  
If you change jobs (internally), don't expect to get any more than a 5% increase in pay, even if that increase doesn't put you anywhere close to where Freddie's own internal pay scale says you should be.
