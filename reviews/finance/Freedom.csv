1,,Great place to gain experience,2022-04-13,3.0,Recruiter,The ability to work remotely is great. Opportunity for growth is there,Pay is not in line with current salary trends. The 401k match is not a true employer match.
2,,Eh,2022-04-13,2.0,Mortgage Underwriter,Starts off as a good company who cares about employees,Mass hires and mass layoffs
3,,Growing my career and having fun and being appreciated,2022-04-13,5.0,Vice President,Employees are often celebrated and advanced for success,Layoffs with interest rates in flux

Inclusivity, Diversity, and Meritocracy.",Be ready not only to identify procedural and service disconnects but to provide resolutions. No cons.
5,,Bittersweet,2022-04-13,5.0,Oversight Analyst,FMC is an amazing company to look into if you are thinking of a change in career. The onboarding and hiring process was seamless even with being 100% remote. Getting in touch with IT help during any issue is quick and usually resolved within the first call. Leadership team within FMC are always going above and beyond to lend a hand when needed and definitely keep the team engaged throughout the day. Being remote is a challenge of itself and although you aren’t with your team in person the use of zoom and teams helps build that bond you would get in an office setting.,"Honestly being here for a year I haven’t had any real “cons” that I have personally ran into. Any issue or concern that I brought to leadership attention would be immediately addressed. If I had to have a con it would be give more to your employees. It is amazing to see all the volunteer work and charitable deeds FMC participated in, but it would be nice to see a year end bonus, or even some small gift of gratitude not just during review time."
6,,"Empowering bosses. Smart, kind and motivated employees",2022-04-13,5.0,Funder,"Great health benefits, family oriented, and opinions regarding work and process are welcomed.

8,,"Potential to be a good company, stay away for now.",2022-04-13,2.0,Sales Manager,"Good base that is comparative to the industry. 
Good benefits. 
Strong culture for a remote company.","Communication is lacking from executive level management. Freedom is riddled with politics and it’s all about who you know. 
Not geared for the rising rate environment. 
Lack of products will hurt future growth. 
Not much care for talent retention and irresponsible hiring that ends with layoffs in a very short period of time (these are peoples lives). This creates a toxic environment where everyone is always living in fear of what comes next regardless of talent level. 
Technology for sales and ops is backwards and counter intuitive. 
Loans that should close in 4 weeks end up taking 3 months because of low level internal communication. 
No accountability in taking care of clients and everyone feels it is ok to pass the buck. 

Best of luck to anyone still employed here as you will need it. This company has a ton of potential but for now is one that I would recommend against till they re-evaluate their business model."
9,,Not recommended.,2022-04-13,2.0,Customer Success Agent Tier II,"Decent pay, fun and friendly team members, gain some entry-level mortgage experience.","Rude supervisors, unreasonable expectations such as time spent on a call, minimal or no training for the subject matter of the phone calls, let go with no issues or warning whatsoever."
10,,Bottom line is the only concern. Save your sanity.,2022-04-13,1.0,Information Technology,"Remote work. 
Market pay.
A compensation package....which is actually benefit, not a right.","Sales Managers - are abusive, demanding, and expect technology to have the ability to educate and train how to sell loans (yep...sell loans) to a potential customer. In my experience with this organization, I have witnessed an entire team of bright, educated people (myself included) be degraded, insulted, and implied our jobs were in jeopardy due to not 'doing what someone wanted.' and trying to understand the overall problem in an effort to provide sustainable solutions. Any self respecting person will do what every person on the phone call did and adjust their resume as well as provide their own horrid experience to everyone so to ensure this organization understands Sales and Originations may need an overhaul,"
11,,Don't waste your time,2022-04-12,3.0,Anonymous Employee,"Pays for SAFE exam, good training for new hires.","The entire company runs on nepotism and sexism.

22,,I wouldn’t recommend-,2022-04-02,1.0,Senior Loan Advisor,"I used to say the pay was top notch, but that changed in September of 2021. They pulled the rug out from Loan Advisors to cut costs and many of us left.","Senior Leadership makes rules as they go based on how well Loan Advisors are doing. They cut OT and increased benefit costs for employees to cut costs. They micromanage more than ever now. Middleman’s are all about giving back, but unfortunately not to their employees."
23,,Just Don't,2022-04-01,1.0,Manager,"Fast hiring process, easy work, micro managing mitigates having to actually lead",Terrible corporate culture; gaslighting; bad leadership; and unethical business practices by HR and employer relations

-they don't reward work ethic, no progression"
28,,Ok Employer,2022-03-31,2.0,Director,Overall for the most part Freedom pays well and allows remote work.,A lot of layoffs recently. Medical benefits are expensive with not the best coverage.

Flexible Work Schedule",Uncertainty due to market conditions
33,,Great,2022-03-28,5.0,Email Marketing Specialist,Great place to start career,"None so far, I’ve been doing great"
34,,Pathetic,2022-03-28,1.0,Loan Advisor,Remote work but that could be changing soon,They tell you in your interview that you can make 200k a year but neglect to tell you that only the top seasoned loan advisors get inbound leads. Everyone else gets to outbound dial customers that have been called by Freedom Mortgage 3 times a day for the last 3 years. Majority of which have asked to be put on the do not call list but we continue to harass them daily so we can hit our dial expectation metrics. After getting told to stop calling they aren’t interested 55+ times a day you will then get fired for not performing. Kind of ironic they give you no opportunity to succeed with the trash leads they provide you with then bully you and talk to you like you’re stupid for not performing better. Don’t waste your time with these lying crooks. Just another shady mortgage company who only cares about money not their customers or employees

The compensation is competitive with most lenders out there —WHEN THE MARKET IS DOING WELL","-when the market is not doing so well the company is one of the most toxic work environments I could imagine
- 95% of the the leadership at the company is unqualified and it baffles me how they got there jobs 
- work life balance does not exist here. they have little to no care about your life outside of Freedom and they don’t even hide the fact that you are purely just a # to them"

52,,Great place to work,2022-03-16,5.0,Mediations Specialist,"Freedom has a solid training program, positive culture and excellent work-life balance. Managers are available and knowledgeable. Their goal is to help one succeed. Teammates are the best, and more than willing to share their time and expertise. Kudos to Stan, a great CEO.","Too many meetings and town halls. They truly do not accomplish anything. If it’s that important, send a blast email. Also, if you must hold meetings, please provide an agenda ahead of time and start and finish on schedule. Meeting minutes would be nice.

In these meetings, some employees go off on personal topics. I respectfully ask facilitators to stop personal ramblings that have nothing to do with work. Vacuous meetings disrespect those who have a heavy workload."

59,,Churn and Burn Portfolio,2022-03-15,3.0,Loan Advisor,Loan servicer so they have some built in leads.,"Freedom likes to churn and burn new customers acquired through servicing. Freedom's marketing or lead management fails to identify who would be a viable prospect. Instead, they just cast a wide net to newly service transferred who have no reason or benefit to refinance - not customer focused. Systems are outdated, slow, and extremely inefficient. . . have to schedule a follow up call instead of a one call close because the systems are so slow to run credit, aus, and pricing."

Have to listen to Stan tell us how many billions of dollars we are making while laying off half his company. They pulled 60 of us into a zoom call and told us too bad so sad in the middle of the day. HR here is the biggest mess in the planet, I’ve never seen any HR as terrible as Freedom’s and they know it."

78,,Great Company,2022-02-25,5.0,Anonymous Employee,Great work life balance and people to work with,Must be available to work weekends
79,,Not a good company,2022-02-25,1.0,,remote working. not much micromanagement.,they would rather lay you off than find another department or assignment for you to work in when rates go up.  the don't pay out PTO when you get laid-off which is really cheap.  Roundpoint was a great place to work. I loved my job at Roundpoint. Freedom came in a took that away. Then laid me off a year later.
80,,Average work environment,2022-02-25,3.0,Anonymous Employee,"Very good cooperation between teams. The business and the development teams are very helpful. The company itself is always having company meetings to list general updates, to keep all of their employees involved and they recognize employees from time to time, for certain achievements. Working from home has made this job easier to manage and to take on challenges a lot easier. The company does great job to provide for 
you with the necessary tools, such as software and hardware, in order to best suit you.","The benefits are not that great if you are a lower-tier employee, first of all. Also, expect to work extra hours, expect to work busy hours, and expect to work unnecessary hours. There were times when the manager(s) would schedule meetings or certain projects during irregular times such as 6:00 p.m. or after 5:00 p.m., when employees are expected to sign off. There were also times when I had to work at 11:00 at night, even though they knew that I had work early the next morning. For the topic of work density, there have been times when I was unable to take lunch breaks because of the heavy workload or because of unexpected meeting invitations. I have also missed dinner a few times. Expect to be briefly praised when you get the work done and get the work done effectively, but expect that phrase to wear off and eventually get criticized when you make mistakes. There are also more cons which I will not go into detail about, but the work culture is very average for someone who has been in my field for a while. I would not work here again, this company is for someone who is looking for the experience in mortgage and sales, to get exposure for their career."

87,,Long term career you’ve always wanted,2022-02-21,5.0,Operations Risk Manager,Freedom provides full autonomy to get the job at hand done while producing with ample amount of resources to grow within correctly.,"Honestly, haven’t found one yet. Freedom is extremely employee focused while giving us every opportunity to succeed. I would heed, if you aren’t in this for a long term career I’d consider somewhere else. You become what you put into it."
88,,Quantity not quality customer service,2022-02-19,2.0,Mortgage Loan Officer,"There are some good people there, but like with any business, the environment is set by those at top.","It’s about the bottom line, as per usual, with most companies. So it all the usual issues that crop up with that type of work environment. 
I also saw some really great employees get let go, at the drop of a hat, in my 4 years of experience there. I will say, in general, that mortgage sales is not for the faint of heart."

If you have a shred of dignity or self respect, plan your exit as soon as you begin working there. Overall FMC has a record of a toxic company culture: parasitic, micromanaging leadership. Inept on-boarding, entrenched in fear or threats. Everyone is jaded, miserable or fake. Most managers or leadership abuse their roles, are snarky or play favorites. You’re treated like a robot - expected to have high morale while taking back 2 back inbound & outbound calls. The outbound calls are on an auto dialer and you feel like you’re harassing people. The customers by large despise Freedom as the mortgage servicer they’ve been switched to. A typical call is an Important angry borrower yelling, or unhappy one, due Freedoms record of poor communication, quality or service provided. It’s par for the course to hear about how we’ve screwed up something or this is their umpteenth time calling us about it. Freedom is the antithesis of the greedy corporation, putting profits and policy over humanity and intergrity."

I was laid off before that day came. I appreciated their approach to taking care of us. They also moved us around the company as best they could to keep us onboard during the pandemic, until I suppose the business became too dry.

The lower level management was typically very understanding and did their best to help and be personable about things.

There was an attempt to provide fun remote activities over Zoom, particularly around the slower times of year, but ultimately those slow times just led to layoffs. The company balled out on activity rewards, so if you were a creative participant, you could get some good stuff.","The position I was shunted into after the pandemic began was a brand new position helping refinance sales, and the front-line of contact for customers trying to refinance. We had to deal with repetitive problems internally, repetitive lies told by our sales team to the customer that we had to take the blame for (or receive poor QA scores if we didn't). The position became incredibly overbearing and stressful, with managers listening in to random calls, QA listening in to random calls, strict scheduling of breaks and lunches, other departments who would dump angry callers off on us even if we were the wrong department and an abundance of angry customers who wanted escalation, of which we weren't allowed to do."

137,,Be careful ... they lie,2022-01-23,2.0,Customer Service Representative,"starting pay and bonus structure
diversity day 
community service day","The training is bad .... they need a serious revamping of that. HIRE CONSULATANTS NOT FORMER PHONE AGENTS!!!! 

The systems and system processes are horrific ... they need hire to better coders and UI designers. There software is like template based and it looks terrible you have to pull up a different screen for everything you do to help the customer. You shouldnt need multiple screens to get to one thing 

management isnt helpful very much and they dont connect to there team members at all its all about if your hitting metrics. You will be expected to do outbound and inbound calls and pitch refinance on some calls. words like picthing and rebuttals are sales words. You have to pitch if the system has an indicator that the customer is eligible for a refi and you have to transfer the call. You are held accountable for this. They move you to a different department without notice as well. So be aware of that. Also everything is a darn warm transfer call except for sales !!! its annoying. It holds up calls because agents from different departments hardly ever want to deal with these calls. 

The turnover rate is high when interviewing ask them to explain that. They have a hard time keeping people because the company lies a lot and management is never on the same page with each other. 

Management cant focus on really helping or strengthening there team skills because they are pulled into meetings all the time and pulled into the help line. The attendance policy is a joke you get 7 points PER YEAR !!!! and you dont get them back for another year if you loose them and they take it away from your vacation time. Its like they dont want you using vacation.

One more thing....if you have concerns dont bother mentioning them. they dont listen to the employees anyway. Even if its a valid concern. Upper managemrnt is a joke for this ... give your management more freedom to connect and grow there team and stop micro managing them so they can stop micro managing employees.

All in all terrible company that needs a redo. They need help and someone at the top is either to subborn to get it done or they have no idea it needs to be done. Either way they need to make changes and make them quick. Dont work here until they have made big changes enough to make it easy to want to come to work daily"

After a few months, I was asked to enroll in the Loan Office Training Program where I learned the technical product knowledge of the mortgage industry and had to take a national test to be licensed as a Loan Officer - and Freedom paid for all the training and licensing for me!
I was so proud to work for a company that was willing to train and develop me, I recommended to my son to join Freedom and today, he is one of Freedom's successful Sales Managers.

159,,Do not work there,2022-01-07,1.0,Loan Officer,Unfortunately absolutely no pros to report.,"You will make telemarketing calls all day long. You must make at least 130 per day, or have at least 5 to 10 applications per day depending what lead campaign you are assigned to. Generally new people get the worst lead campaigns which have been called beyond comprehension. Lead campaign’s generally are called by somebody new every week throughout the entire year. You will call the same leads at least four to six times per week, sometimes the same leads multiple times the same day. Once you do get an application you have to have the customer sign all there paperwork and send on documents because by day 5 you will lose the application and any commission. Freedom has an entire department they call the shark tank that will call the customer and offer a lower rate and you will lose that deal. Freedom will get the deal but you will not, but they do not care about you. The esigning per customer is generally 30 to 40 minutes of your time plus any documents that need to be sent in. You can write application’s all day long, but you will get paid on a small portion as there are not enough hours in the day and the shark tank will get your applications. You will be micro managed and you will be reminded of being put on performance improvement plans, which once you are on you are pretty much done. You will not be paid on any holidays in your first 60 days of employment. You will not be paid for a 2 week notice. You will never get your previous months earned commissions. Paid time off PTO is few and far between. Your benefits will be expensive compared to other large companies. Your management support will be very limited and almost nonexistent and you will be ridiculed daily. All the managers will offer support but it is just lip service and nothing more. You will be instructed to be on a call for no more than 10 minutes and will be instructed not to spend time on disclosures to customers especially when it comes to recoupment of fees in terms of years. The thought process is the customers get everything in writing so let them read it. You will be told that once you complete everything you need to do and it is submitted to processing that you are done, but that is not true by any means. They have multiple systems for the life of an application that is joke. Most everyday one or more of the systems are not working or just plain down for hours and days at a time, You will be instructed not to offer the best rate to a customer or the lowest rate available as Freedom churns the same loans and if you drop to the lowest rate that customer is one and done generally."

They also want you to pitch refinancing on top of all the other things expected on a call. Customers are always short on their escrow accounts and this is a huge problem...not to mention the amount of calls I get wishing they never switched to freedom read the call center reviews they do not lie.

You will switch departments constantly with 0 notice or training but you're expected to know it all right off the bat - and don't ever ask for help because you will be met with mocking and disappointment. You'll never truly do what you were hired to do and if you're not a jack-of-all-trades who will grind as hard as you can to make things work - you will be mistreated and undervalued. As seen in many reviews - it's all about who you know. If you bring it up to management, the nose goes right into the air and they will tell you what you feel or are experiencing is simply not true. You will be micromanaged and forced to call poor customers over and over and over again just to be screamed at by customer and management any way."

234,,Absolutely awful,2021-11-09,1.0,Servicing/ Customer Service,It’s currently mostly remote. That’s absolutely it unfortunately.,"Entire ordeal.
The interview process is shady and there’s a lot of promises and things stated that are in fact not true. Whatsoever. There is so much random mandatory overtime. Every single week you’re forced to do this overtime. Zero work and life balance. Managers are terrible. They’re over worked under paid and flat out mean. They are extremely unorganized and lose documents all over and are extremely unprofessional. Management has often “accidentally” negatively and disrespectfully discussed other members of management in public teams chats for everyone to see. There is zero communication on anything. The training is good but does not relate to actual job. They “promote you” and you “level” up to the next group but with zero additional compensation except for an additional opportunity to work even harder than you were before, have even more responsibilities, less support, but a shot at a higher unattainable bonus. That’s your compensation for promotion. They will have you take calls for months before actually training you for them and then write you up for mistakes made when you’re left in the dark. People are extremely rude. They tell you attendance doesn’t matter in regards to doctors appointments, children, life, being a few minutes late etc in the your interview yet they give you an occurrence for being under a minute late clocking in. HR is very unorganized and have no idea what is going on. Most stressful position I have ever held! The other departments don’t sound as bad , but servicing is an absolute nightmare. You are forced to handle every other departments calls and issues (whatever doesn’t require a license to some extent) yet are paid pennies. The amount of mental stress you are placed under is sickening. Calls are back to back with not a moment in between. The stats are unrealistic and entirely unattainable for the work load you are given each call. They’re a revolving door and no one at all cares. Jobless is better than working here. I wouldn’t recommend this job to somebody I hated."
235,,Not a very positive one.   I find my questions go unanswered and help is just not there or unknown.,2021-11-09,1.0,Poor Management,So far I don't see one.,Management style is learn the hard way.  A passive aggressive tactic is used by management.

People leaving due to the incompetence of the management who got picked without any experience to these rolls. Upper management giving shout outs to newly hired personnel who might know nothing about the industry leaving behind the ones who have experience.  Being successful in this department means not knowing anything and making sure to always smile and say YES to the higher ups. Management skills of the new managers are very questionable to say the least.

You can get easily used and they like promoting without giving you a raise.

HR does nothing about anything and simply ignores your concerns when you voice them.

Lies, lie and more lies."
253,,Great for learning the ropes but never stop applying. Yell first ask questions later mentality. TOXIC.,2021-10-25,2.0,Network Engineer,You will work with the best technologies.,"Your efforts will never be enough and they will constantly remind you that you're extremely valuable then lynch you in front the the team in daily meetings. Its always WTF why did you do this, this is not how we do things, etc then you say I followed the SOP and they realize they made a mistake over and over again. They use misleading terms such as hard work instead of overworked. They claim they have a fun team environment which is really upper management making inappropriate jokes in the meetings to lighten the mood before they drop bad news. Bad news is always you're going to be working more than expected even though you're already overworked. One small blimp on the radar and now there is a new tool to manage for a 1 off scenario. The list of tools is ever growing which is cool until you make a 30 second change and spend the rest of the day on paperwork. Its constant patch work plugging what would be non-issues at a healthy company. Your nights and weekends you must volunteer away or you will be looked down on. If you work a standard 40-50 hours a week you're looked down on. It is truly a culture of trying to be the person who gives away all of their personal hours for almost nothing in return except a good job mate in the morning. Everyone laughs at the fact that they drink at least a pot of coffee every morning, skipping lunch, and working long into the evening hours. I've never worked at a company making so much money and having this sort of toxic corporate mentality. The CEO is so amazing and upper management down ruins it for everyone. This place used to be a mom and pop shop that grew so fast and since they haven't brought in the right people the culture is lots of firing of long term employees for making 1 mistake in 15 years. The best engineers on this team are super stressed out about their futures even though they carried the company. I'm honestly not sure why they stay. High turnover because people can only put up with their toxic environment for so long before they decide anywhere else is better. Don't expect any sort of professional development. There might be an impromptu meeting on a new process and it might only be halfway explained but the expectation is that you have total recall and that you are now a expert after a partial explanation. If you're desperate for work or experience please by all means take this job but keep interviewing with other companies because I promise you will want to leave sooner than later."

I never anticipated loving a job in the mortgage industry, but Freedom is a great company to work for. The pay and benefits are excellent. The company itself values diversity and corporate social responsibility. I feel like I work for a place that really values the impact it has on its community, and that is something I didn’t expect with a job in the financial sector. They are good about getting employees the technology and resources they need to do their jobs and are consistently improving technology and processes for efficiency.","I think training could use some work.

My manager actually told me the wrong statistics the entire month (for my production during my final month), making it sound like I was exceeding the minimum criteria. Than a few days before the end of the month he informed me that I was 5 qualified closings short of what I needed to keep my job. I got 4 of them and the 5th came in the day of the start to a new month. I come in the following Monday and they let me go."
333,,Great management,2021-07-26,4.0,Documentation Specialist,"Since I started the job, first as a temp, then as a full-time freedom mortgage employee, everyone is welcoming and friendly. Management is very approachable anytime you need help or have questions. Weekly department check-in meeting so everyone is on the same page and everyone knows who they can go to for help.",Overtime is a normal thing while the department tries to catch up on intake. It can start to feel like you are always there.

Micro management to the nth degree. I was a glorified assistant for my boss (yes, boss, not leader) no empowerment, never enough, never paid any praise other than a thank you out of habit. No training once in the department just “good luck, learn fast”. HR is not helpful or friendly."

Freedom did an awesome job of training me and everyone else who started at the same time as me. We had daily zoom calls and had over a week or so to get adjusted and work at our own pace while we tried to memorize the process. My tasks are pretty much muscle memory at this point, as my procedure is pretty repetitive for each loan. The pay is good and the people that i communicate and work with are always kind and friendly. My boss was very accommodating with me allowing me to keep my job but go part time when august rolled around and my college classes started back up. I'm so thankful for my job here.",I have no such comments .

340,,Read before you apply- 5 star reviews are requested from management and are only from current employees,2021-07-15,1.0,Loan Officer,"The base is $40,000 but base pay does not matter to an experienced Loan Officer","1. Freedom Mortgage does not pay commission well. Only the top 5% of Originations are paid the most but that is still half of what other companies are offering top producers. For the remaining LO’S you can expect to be paid more at your local Walmart. 

2. You are micro managed here. The pay matches the culture. The managers micro manage you as if you are not there to make money. The reason being is obvious, over promise and under deliver. 

3. You have to know someone who knows someone in order to get favoritism. The leads are horrible. This is the only place that I have ever worked where you are compensated more for transferring purchase loans to other departments than you are for your loans. The marketing strategy matches their way as well. Have our employees market for us so that we can save money and have them work harder for incentive. 

4. 1/2 Saturdays per month 8 hours are required here. There is no work life balance especially when rates are low, you will find yourself calling lead after lead to offer a .5 rate drop to save 20 bucks and you are penalized if you do not meet their unrealistic quota that pays you a few hundred bucks per month. 

5. The 5 star reviews left here are mostly from current employees who are either a friend of someone requesting or looking to help Freedom in some way. Instead of Freedom Mortgage actually dealing with the issues they try to cover them up. This is dangerous for a company who hopes to stick around."

Literally can either go from 3 day training or a month training and still not told exactly what is expected. All the leads that did the trainings gave different answers on what is needed for auditing and the regulations. No consistency. Took management almost a year to decide to set a zoom meeting to actually meet their employees. Even when they did that a week later set a webinar zoom meeting for half of us in the department to lay us off. We were not able to ask questions, or have enough time to request leads for referrals. This also happened after consistent months of telling us that business was going to get busy, over and over again and told us that our jobs are safe. No need to overly sugar coat something that wasn't realistic. They provided no severance or at least a whole last paycheck. Also just looked as a number in their system."

Resub Underwriters are expected to complete 11 resubs per day. Streamline Underwriters are expected to complete 20 loans a day. With absolutely no overtime, no consideration taken for breaks, meetings, compliance, or required communication with Brokers and others involved on the loan! 

The managers are rude, degrading and speak to you as if you are a child. It's not my first job in mortgage so I've had some pretty tough managers but these managers at Freedom, from the very top all the way down to the team leads, are just flat out unprofessional and put a whole new meaning to micromanaging! They leave you feeling incompetent and make you feel as if you are stupid for asking questions. 

How did they ever come up with these ridiculous numbers!? They can't or flat out won't answer that question. All they say is, ""you'll get there."" They don't even consider the industry standard because it's more like a sweat shop here and you're trained to push loans! If I sacrifice the pride and quality I'm used to producing then I might be able to meet their ridiculous demands. Quality over Quality is huge here!

399,,Not a healthy place to work at,2021-05-17,1.0,Scheduler,There is nothing positive to say,Lack of professionalism and resources. Their systems are outdated and crashed all the time. Management is all about micro managing their teams and they’re always telling you how you could do better and schedule more loans. While on group meetings the teams are compared to other team members and you're made to feel inferior in your job role. Extremely toxic work environment.
400,,Hire and fire work culture,2021-05-17,1.0,Manager,Benefits arent too bad. They're a slight notch above average.,"I was with the company for many years. It's a constant cycle of mass hire, mass fire then arbitrarily change how the depts run. It doesn't matter how much they try to improve processes because once it gets busy again. A large number of new people with almost no experience will get hired, the experienced employees will be out of production training these folks. Then once the volume drops off, another mass layoff and it's back to square one. It's been like this for almost a decade so even though I've survived the layoffs. I have no faith this will improve, so I left."
401,,…,2021-05-16,1.0,Loan Advisor,They do keep their promise of a work life balance…to a certain extent. Sometimes the management listens. Equipment is provided. States are given and  or paid for which is great.,"Where do I start. 
1. You’re only in one specialty doing one specific product. If you get anyone else, you have to pass them along and HOPEFULLY they get a call or even answer
. 
2. You’re cold calling like crazy  at first it was nice. Some days you will get a lot of loans  but sometimes there will be three, four days of calling and you’re getting nothing. They ask you to work more hours after your 8 hour shift of calling 150-250 clients that either have been called way to much or have been requested to be put on the DNC list. Did you know freedom that if they say that we don’t want to be called that WE ARE REQUIRED BY LAW TO PUT THEM ON THERE AND ACTUALLY DEPOSITION THEM CORRECTLY! IF WE DONT THERE IS A FINE 500 dollars for the first call then 1500 after.

3. You ask for 1 on 1’s asking for call reviews to listen to your calls with your management and they won’t do this. They will just send you an email explaining what you did wrong. 

4. You tell your management that lead flow is not the greatest. They will say to “ keep dialing. It will come” also, you say that you don’t want to be put on a PIP (performance improvement plan) but they will put you on one of you don’t reach your monthly goal. 

5. Metrics for qualifications on getting Into higher tiers ALWAYS change. No matter what you do it’s just not good enough (personal feeing) 

6.Underwriting does not know what they are doing. You will get loans in process for two months and not have them close and then get an email with you included saying “oops, sorry we can’t do this” leaving the borrower mad not only at freedom mortgage but the LA as well. That’s our name on the application as well as the company. Guess who they are going to bash more to other people…you got it. The LA. 

7.You have to wait 3 hours to get an approval to meet recoup time when the cost of the loan is to high. Even then it probably won’t get approved even if it’s a 6 dollar adjustment. 

8.INBOUNDS are only allocated to the best producing people getting the best leads. Will other people get the chance. Nope. Can you ask. Sure. But will it help. Probably not. 

9. I feel like you’re just a number  

10. Training is not that great.  They train you not even on the correct speciality you are doing so then when you actually work you are left to fend for yourself. Then when you get on the floor they say something completely different voiding the training because you get docked on points from the QA team and you can’t get that back.


My personal advice, do research and if you do that and think this is a great job for you then I would apply. Experience it for yourself. We all have our own opinions and maybe you might have a different experience."

418,,Company requested employees go to Glassdoor to leave positive reviews due to company's low ratings.,2021-05-10,1.0,Call Center,... ... ... ... ...,"About three years ago the company went through a lengthy layoff streak that lasted about 4-5 months that massively lowered employee morale. Since the company doesn't offer severance packages and many longtime employees were laid off to be replaced by younger cheaper college grads, an (understandably) large stream of one star reviews were left on Glassdoor over an 8 to 12 month period. This severely lowered the company's average rating on Glassdoor.

It was eventually brought to the company's attention that prospective employees were apprehensive about working at Freedom because of so many one star reviews. In order to reverse this trend the company started outright requesting employees go to Glassdoor and leave a positive review about working at Freedom. Numbers don't lie. The company's rating on Halloween 2017: 3.6. A year later same time after layoffs, below 2.5. The company started requesting positive reviews be left starting in early 2020 and, surprise surprise, the average rating is back up to 4."

They had a 10 minute power point presentation of what happens now that I was terminated (a whole group of us) and then completely kicked me off of the system with no other directions.

The executives seem to always thank everyone for their work,"Training is a big problem at Freedom. They don't fully give you the support you need once you start working loans. Hard to get in touch with team leads and Managers for assistance.  In the wholesale group they don't believe in meeting with employees 1 on 1. Even the review at the beginning of the year no one went over the results with you. You just had to read it, their excuse was there were too many people.

All they had to do was give us training on purchases and we would've been good to go. Found out after the fact that we were hired to take some work off the top, with the intention to be let go shortly after. Why they didn't hire contractors is beyond me. Management takes hours (I've once waited 5 hours on an override) to respond to questions that result in a hard stop, lowering productivity. Overall very mismanaged."

They are having a hard time finding Los , lying deceitful managers that just want to fill thier pockets with more and more greed money . 

I would never work for freedom , too much red tape, you have to get approval for everything , even have to ask 2 weeks in advance to use my EARNED PTO . 

by the way , they nickel and dime you , and increase metrics every month , processors and uw, are dont know anything, dont know how to process a loan.

Oh did I mention they outsource processing overseas to a 3rd party.. 
and you cant even talk with the processors . horrible system .

Cancel your loans , and they wont fund.
how are you not hiring staff in the U.S , why outsource, cheap labor and they cant even process a loan...

They will train you briefly on how to work the Sales Portal/Stream systems but never train you on how to sell. Everyday there is a tech issue, but they expect you to still reach your goals. Doesnt matter how much Overtime you do, if you still cant reach your app to goal for the month, your job is on the line. They will not give you a verbal warning if you are going to get fired the next month due to dipping below the stack rankings. Managers suck at updating your rankings daily for you to know how well or not so well you are doing. They are lying when they say if you do well in a campaign that it will reflect 2-4 weeks later by placing you in a better or as equal as a camp. They def have favorites and the ones that are top dogs they will make sure they are getting the best of the best leads. They will not be afraid to randomly let you go because of not reaching goals.

Very poor structure and when brought to high level employees attention, we are continually told it’ll be addressed but never is. So in the mean time you’ll close 34 loans in a month which translates to zero commission for you."
441,,Great Company but Low Pay,2021-04-28,1.0,Senior Loan Advisor,This is a great company to work for if you're tired of working over 40 hours per week as a loan advisor. They keep their promises on how many hours you're required to work and everyone is friendly.,The problem with this position is that they promise you a great earning potential but its impossible to earn a commission check because even if you hit your required goals its still not enough loans.

443,,I feel bad for Freedom Borrowers,2021-04-26,1.0,Loan Advisor,"-Great training/licensing program
-If you don't care about people, you will do great here","-Call center hell
-If you are a borrower with Freedom then prepare to be telemarketed nonstop
-Does not encourage or value communication or customer service 
-If you do not pressure your borrower into e-signing in the first 48 hours, your loan can be stolen by other loan officers claiming they are your manager (sleazy sales 101)"
444,,They will steal your loans,2021-04-24,1.0,Loan Officer,Not having to come into the toxic work environment because of covid,"1. Crazy complicated pay. Purposefully complicated so they won't pay you correctly. Difficult punch in / punch-out time card. Impossible to get the time card corrected and paid right. The compensation plan has changed 4 times in my 9 months with the company. The old bait and switch. Pay structure is lower here than competitive lenders (you won't know that until you accept the job because they're not upfront about the pay).
2. Bad communication between loan officers and operations. No accountability anywhere.
3. Waves of mass hiring and layoffs. Whoever was working on your file most likely won't be halfway through so balls are dropped everywhere. When they cut loan officers, the files go to management, not other loan officers. That's confusing to the borrower. That's not fair to the loan officers whose bulk income is commission. That puts extra work on management because now they have to work as loan officers instead of managers. I thought it was ironic how much of a cheerleader recruiting process they went through but none of the management has been there longer than a year.
4. The brown trickles down. Micromanagement is the worst here. Managers are miserable and take their frustration out by 45 minute daily rants they call meetings. 1 minute late = late. Metrics for everything and outdated systems with insane latency so they make you provide logs and lists of stuff because their 1990's system can't tell if you took 1 call or 100 calls. Unattainable metrics that force you to put taking the next call to get your Metrics up over follow-up and follow-through so customer service suffers. Ethics crumble when the status is never conveyed to the customer and their file is closed.
5. It's dog eat dog. Your loans will be stolen by other loan officers through the shark tank after 3 days. My manager steals my loans before they can be stolen by other loan officers so he can get credit. There's a ranking system and leads are based on ranking so no one helps or likes anyone because everyone is fighting for the top to get the best leads. 
6. The leads are a joke and no regard for the DNC rules. A tiered lead system where only the top 5% of loan officers get quality leads. Everything else is telemarketing outbound calls to old dead leads of people who don't want to or can't refinance. The leads are scrubbed and put back in the system to be harassed again by an unsuspecting loan officer who will then be chewed out by the customer who got 6 other calls in the past 24 hours."

They have great incentives, it can be tough to hit the goals but overall I don’t have much to complain about.

493,,LO’s Nightmare,2021-03-18,1.0,Loan Advisor,Clients know the company so no branding. But it’s a double edged sword.,Micro management everywhere. The managers are paid on apps! They will push you till you work 12 hours shifts and also every Saturday if they can get you too do it. One Saturday automatically required. These cons would not be such a big deal if the compensation was solid. But it is far from it. Pay scale is very one sided. You will consistently get stuck below the minimum closings which won’t make you money. Processing and underwriting is almost non-existent in a way. You will need to pre-process your apps and get them through to an underwriter. If docs are needed after getting it to the processing desk you will have to chase them down instead of a processor emailing or reaching out. Once you have those it still will need to go back to processing to be reviewed and pushed through to underwriting which can still be kicked back one more for you to fix again. All while this is the case you will need to get more apps from cold calling old leads. The leads are recycled and they clients will tell you they’ve already spoken with 2-3 reps before and didn’t think it was worth it. Management will be late to the part to tell you anything besides they are changing the comp plan for the lessor. 25 loans or less a month will not make you money! I advise you look at other shops as this company is stuck in the 07-08 era and still thinks they are the best company to work for the other system issues every time you run a app and with outdated application it is a backwards uphill battle that everyone has lost that I know I’ve known 10 plus LO’s to come here and leave within 6 months or less. If you take this job good luck! You’ve been warned!

Tech systems are very unreliable, break down all the time, and are ancient - it takes at least an hour to put in an app, lock the rate, and send the documents out. There is no secure portal for borrowers to upload their docs, instead they have to send them out via unsecure email and pray their personal info doesn't get intercepted. 

Marketing could be better - for as many serviced customers the company has, marketing should be able to flood the phones with inbounds all day for all teams."

We don't fight over loans and just make sure we get everything done.","There is no opportunity for growth. You will do your job and in turn will eventually train the new hires. Leads will be chosen despite coming from a completely different background. Internally, once you are a coordinator you stay one. The growth that has been promised in upwards of a year has continuously been pushed back. At first it was due to us not being in the office, then it was for the first of the year followed by waiting on management to decide who to train you and eventually getting pushed back a few more months."
509,,Don’t do it,2021-03-10,1.0,First Flyer Program,The pay just to train is nice,No freedom. The SAFE training is so intense and they only give you 2.5 weeks to study and cram material down your throat

514,,Facts you should know,2021-02-28,2.0,Mortgage Loan Officer,"Commission can be great, 
The systems are super easy
 You can work from home
PTO , Benfits","The reporting systems they have that put you in campaigns can make a difference in your commission and there quite unfair and faulty. If you get stuck in a lower campaign you may never get out to make commission. You need to close 40 loans a month to make decent commission. People that are taking a 100 to a 160 apps are only closing that many or just over around 55 loans. They compare you to people in higher campaigns that are much easier. They expect you to work like a dog, a robot. You will be tied to a chair 8 to 10 hours per day and some Saturdays. You will be punished for taking time off, (PTO) demoted and have to climb your way back up. The micromanage you to death. Your health will decline. You can close 20 to 30 loans per month and they pay you no commission but they still make thousands off your work. They try to keep your EARNED commission if you are not employed on the day they pay the commission."

2. Most co workers are great people
3. Very nice equipment provide all materials to complete tasks.
4. If you start off hot here you have a chance to make some serious money. This is also very hard if your training with 20 other people and need to get use to the systems and can’t get questions answered for 20+ min during the day.
5. They educated me a ton about the mortgage industry and how different loan products work. This is going to be super helpful for my future.",I got stuck on the wrong side of the leads. Sometimes that’s how it goes. I never complained but for months at a time I was calling people that had been called every 3 hours of their life. If you are working for a company like this you have access to all their portfolio which seems great. The leads you are calling are most likely still recycled. So you get what you get and it’s hard to convince someone to refinance that has already told you or others NO 10 times in the last 15-20 days. Everyone has to start somewhere but I guess calling these unfortunate people that you have already denied a loan to was my last straw.

They give you the tools that are needed. My managers were a God send and helped me all the way. They encouraged me and gave me hope and that I could do it.

During the Covid Pandemic, FMC handled the company gracefully. As soon as it started back in March 2020 we all immediately work from home. They have us all the stuff that we need for our job. There's tons of assistance do you will never be alone. Fast forward to now, when the Pandemic is over and when the time comes, they gave us an option to continue to work from home, do both or you can just go into the office.",Lunch is only a half hour

593,,FIRST TIME WRITING A REVIEW,2020-12-10,5.0,DE Underwriter,"I started with Freedom Mortgage with the DE Fast Track Program and please keep in mind that I have never wrote a job review before until now.

I was hesitant at first and cautious because those who works in Mortgage knows the risk of being laid off. 

I accepted that risk and UNDERSTAND fully what may happen. I can't stress enough how many reviews I read and how many other job interviews I completed after accepting the offer with Freedom - Freedom out beats all of them and most importantly this whole experience have been nothing but PHENOMENAL.

I'm sorry to hear about others experience and please by all means, I don't dismiss them BUT at the same time, FREEDOM have been so great to me and the training is amazing. 

I would say that it may be tough juggling pets/kids while working remotely because AGAIN - this is a 6 weeks FAST TRACK program. Therefore it ain't easy. I've spent countless nights reviewing and learning the material BC I want it bad and  definitely earned my bonus. 

You get what you put into it. I'm  33 year old male with no kids BUT even I was struggling with the materials because it is intense BUT so rewarding.

I started with a group of 20 people and only 7 survived.... the others literally just bailed because it got too hard. Those people didn't have the integrity like the ones that are standings.

I'm a believer and FREEDOM changed my life.",Honestly (and I've looked) .... nothing.
594,,I hate the merger,2020-12-10,1.0,Customer Service,So far I don't have nothing nice to say about this company. I'm Round Point employee Freedom mortgage bought the company out,"It seems like Freedom mortgage does not care about their new employees they got from Round point mortgage. Today we received an update on PTO and holidays for 2021. roundpoint employees will be losing five holidays that they had before Freedom mortgage bought the company out and they are forcing us to sell our PTO since they only rollover 5 days. ( they never told us into 3 weeks before the year is over that PTO will need to be use. unfortunately why did the learderahip team made the decision to pay us out our PTO. Many people were not able to use PTO due to covid19. it was not our fault why not have the PTO carryover for next year ) Round point employees are losing more with the merger we were informed that it was going to be business as usual but they dropped this big bomb 3 weeks before the holidays. I guess this CEO does not care like Kevin did. He definitely was a true role model

 Definitely don't work for this company"
595,,Keep job hunting,2020-12-10,2.0,First Flyer,"Work from home (pandemic related)
Paid licenses training and tests (have to pay back if you leave)","Horrible horrible communication with first flyers from managers
Huge lack of organization
Lied about being salary when it’s hourly
Lied about level of overtime offered
Most first flyers are looking for other jobs
Not given definitive rotations when you start and lines are pretty blurry throughout process (communication is not good)
First flyers aren’t integrated into company
Busy work like a project that time isn’t given during work day
No flexibility for work hours at all
Some managers are very rude to FF and it’s an issue

598,,Disappointed,2020-12-06,1.0,Collateral Specialist,Only had a few pros which was that some of the employees there was kind. Also they give employees food every Friday.,Overall my experience was unenjoyable. I had a huge lack of job security at the position. Management was rude and only cared if you brought in enough numbers. If you didn’t bring in enough numbers they are quick to get rid of you or treat you very poorly. Management has very evident favoritism when it comes to approaching certain employees . I would not recommend this position to anyone.
599,,Awesome Company,2020-12-05,4.0,Mortgage Loan Closer,"Remote, Good Pay, Great Culture, Benefits","Training, Development, Growth, Structure, Etc"

Great place to bring in new ideas.,Sometimes there is duplication of work. This could be because of remote working and challenges with communication.
608,,Yes,2020-11-18,5.0,Specialist Customer Support I,"Management is awesome, pay is good and Freedom have excellent benefits. My first year has been a great experience and I hope to have many more years to come",I don’t have any cons to report

613,,DO NOT RECOMMEND,2020-11-11,1.0,Senior Loan Advisor,The company does offer time and a half once over 40 hours,"The company states that they have been around for 30 years more like 30 days. The work culture is terrible. Customer service is even worse. Clients complain that once the loan is in underwriting that no one called them to give them any updates or tell them why the loan is not making it to closing. Or the closing agents don't show up to the home to close the loan (for the 3rd and 4th time). Even as a LO, I would try to get in-site on why a loan did not close and reach out to the underwriter, processor, or customer advocate..... No response. Honestly, I feel bad for the clients because their mortgage was sold to a company that can't honor their service. The technology is ancient as it takes 30 minutes to write and loan. Or even longer because the system crashes daily. The managers are clueless and don't offer assistance just want you to keep calling clients even when the system is down. This makes things more frustrating because we are working from home. Overall the company is very disorganized. I think the company needs to some internal developing before trying to hire at exponential rates."
614,,Not it,2020-11-05,2.0,Customer Service,Work from home due to covid,Micro management employees don’t know how to do their job.. care more about numbers than anything

620,,Amazing Company and Supportive Management,2020-10-26,5.0,Loan Processor,"Management and coworkers are extremely helpful and attentive, even while working from home. Great pay. Lots of opportunity to move up within the company. I have never had a job that I look forward to every single day, freedom is truly a different experience. You can tell the company really cares about their workers happiness and comfortability - doing giveaways, contests and lunch vouchers. The town hall meetings give us a chance to all come together and reconnect with how the company is doing. I just passed my first year with Freedom and plan on staying for many more to come.","Some outdated systems are still used that are constantly breaking, however IT does a good job fixing these issues in a timely manner."
621,,interesting experience,2020-10-21,3.0,Data Scientist,"got to learn a lot about mortgage, finance statistics",compensation and benefits are limited
622,,Established industry leader with  the energy of a startup,2020-10-21,5.0,"Director, IT","A leading industry player, #1 in FHA and VA lending, willing to invest in the resources and talent to move to the top of the rankings in overall origination and servicing. The company leadership understands that technology is the key differentiator between operating at that level and being a second-tier competitor, so the company is committed to building disruptive capabilities with the energy of a startup firm. This is not a ""maintenance shop"", but an innovator that challenges the employees to continously take a fresh look at what we do and how we can improve it. Talent and contribution are recognized at every level, and the culture is collaborative. It's one of the hardest-working places I've ever been at, but that offers opportunities that can define a career, and contributions are recognized & rewarded in meaningful ways. Work-life balance is recognized despite the pace, and Freedom was a leader in pivoting to working remotely under COVID to put safety and effectiveness first.
I've recommended jobs here to friends and former coworkers, because it's truly a step up for the right kind of contributor.","If you're a clock-puncher or averse to change, this is not your culture. It's not a grind, but an industry disruptor which recognizes that there's a once in a career opportunity to do what's in front of us, and limited time to do it. Hitting ambitious targets can mean working extra hours, and performing critical functions off-hours so the day-to-day operations are unaffected. The company's operatiing on a mostly work-from-home model since Q1/2020, so while each employee is provided with office-quality equipment from day 1, people working here need to be adept at getting things done with virtual interactions and driving communications with others themselves when they need to."
623,,Great company,2020-10-20,5.0,Mortgage Underwriter,"Loved the company. Management is awesome, fully supportive.",Lower base salaries when compared with the competitors.

They have done an excellent job taking care of all employees.,It gets crazy adapting through all the changes but Stan and team always do an excellent job navigating through the challenges.
629,,Gives false promises,2020-10-15,1.0,Mortgage Loan Processor,Remote work is okay at this time,"The company gives false promises to have people sign up for the job. The job is too stressful to be receiving a pay that is below industry, and so much responsibilities as well to get work done by the end of the shift."
630,,Review Loan and make sure they qualify,2020-10-15,5.0,Loan Credit Advisor,"Training was hands on even know it was virtual. Everyone in the company is very responsive with whatever I need whether is HR, LA question or supervisor. during the pandemic, Freedom has made work life a lot less stressful during this time",I would say only thing that is bad is that you don’t have a closer relationship with some of your people team members or leader because we are all ok a different state.

That is really great, shows how friendly this company is.

642,,Great Corporate Culture,2020-09-29,4.0,Senior Mortgage Closer,"The corporate culture at freedom is like no other. Monthly goals motivate everyone to work their hardest to try and exceed the goals and set new records. There’s also monthly contests with awesome prizes to keep everyone enthusiastic and positive about work. I’ve never worked for a company more transparent than Freedom. Weekly updates and town hall meetings keep everyone on the same page and inform everyone how the company is doing. Freedom seems to genuinely care about employees and offers great benefits and opportunities for growth. Whether it’s offering forbearance to customers experiencing financial difficulty or fundraising for various charities, Freedom cares about helping others and giving back.","The platform that Freedom uses is older and has to be used in conjunction with about 3 other systems to do the same process that one system could do at previous jobs I’ve worked. It’s extremely departmentalized. There is a different department for everything and each has their own generic email, so it sometimes feels like you are working harder, not smarter."

645,,Great atmosphere and supportive team,2020-09-25,5.0,Senior Sales Coach,Plenty of opportunity to move up in the company. Lots of money to be made in sales. Great benefits. Co-workers are great and work as a team. Endless high quality leads if your metrics are good. CEO has been AMAZING during this pandemic. Truly grateful.,Job can get repetitive on the phones. Hours can be long including weekends as with any sales position. Position can be stressful and clients on some of the campaigns are very hostile. Some of the sales managers/VPs are very demanding and demeaning when communicating with their team. Very pushy used car sales type approach. A practice I wish would be gone this day and age. Some managers see burnout and high turnover as “part of the business” rather than something to improve on.
646,,Worth it,2020-09-25,5.0,First Flyer Program,Great company to work for,None that really come to mind

Been here almost two months and can say one negative thing. the systems they have in place are such that if you want to work and make money it is for the taking while helping out borrowers save money in a very fragile time.,I can not say one bad thing or I would be nit picking and nothing is perfect
658,,DON'T DO IT,2020-09-19,1.0,Loan Opening,Remote due to COVID-19; otherwise location was attractive.,"No growth, horrible pay; bonus instead of raise was taxed at high percentage. Benefitted CEO but not the employees."

The employer I came from was planning a 9/01 return to the office and when asked what we should do since there is no in person school if we do not have child care set up, they advised that if we missed more than 3 days and could not produce a Dr. note would be fired and could stay home. Then I started with Freedom and one of the first messages I recieved from Stan Middleman was that he wanted his employees to BE safe and FEEL safe especially with the uncertainty surrounding school and child care and that a plan would be made to include these things in our EVENTUAL return to the office. It was such a relief so have someone actually care, I cannot thank him enough",I have not yet found anything to complain about. :)

I started during the pandemic, so I work from home and all of my interactions with co-workers have been virtual (including the interview process). Prior to my start date, I received a shipment with all of the equipment (computer, monitors, etc) I needed to do my job. This contributed to a smooth transition into my new job. Both before and after I started, I have enjoyed my interactions with everybody that I have met and found them very willing to help towards our mutual success.

I have been extremely impressed not only with Freedom's response to the pandemic, but also all of the communication around it. We receive weekly video updates from our CEO along with emails that include status updates. Employee health has been front and center in all of these messages and has put me at ease about an eventual safe return to the office in 2021. 

The employee mortgage program is also a nice perk and I will be taking advantage of it.",None at this time. I highly recommend Freedom Mortgage as an employer.

Great OT/PTO opportunities, nice benefit package and healthy work environment.","Remote work obviously is less interactive with employees on your team, on boarding is quick, may be expected to train someone shortly after you fully understand what your role/task is, can be repetitive work."

Were never over worker and if we would like to go above and beyond and work a ton of hours you can!,The only problem that Im having is that it takes a lot of effort and time to get better lead flow/campaigns. For example Ive been in the lowest converting lead flow/ campaign for over 10 weeks. The technology is a little bit on the slower side. Id also like to see a lot more with training to improve us to move to better campaigns.

After I accepted the job offer, each individual, direct hiring manager, HR recruiter, and on boarding specialist, completely withheld a lot of important information that I requested prior to my start date.

First, if you are thinking about applying and find you will be working with any loan advisors/loan officers you should run. You will be helping them with their clients but these clients tend to be irate. Now as a call center rep for over 5 years I have had my share of nasty clients, but the fact the reason they are nasty at Freedom stems from the loan advisors/officers. In order to get sales the will outright lie to clients and then refuse to respond to clients calls and emails. This is apparently encouraged by management and has been going on for years.

There is little to no communication between departments. I have run into clients who are simultaneously on forbearance and in the middle of a refinance. These two processes directly conflict with each other and, if completed, the refinance will wipe out the forbearance. 

If you want to slack off, only kinda be held accountable, and have no aspirations beyond getting to Friday, then this is the place for you. If you actually want a career and have a desire to help people get and keep their homes, work for anyone else.

As a Freedom Mortgage employee, from a corporate culture perspective, you will always be expected to work hard but you will be encouraged to maintain a healthy work/life balance – and I can appreciate that. I’ve also witnessed many employees advance their careers at Freedom through promotions or via cross -departmental moves. There's definitely opportunities for development and growth.

All together - I'm a proud member of the Freedom Mortgage family.",Nothing to note at this time.

2. Adaptation/Stability. I have no fear of losing my job as a result of shifts in the industry and I can't see the doors closing because the company's leadership is constantly planning ahead.
3. Leads. I don't have to hunt for my own leads. The leads are mostly customers who already make payments to Freedom mortgage and most of the leads we're taking are warm (inbound or web leads).","1. I could probably make a big list of requests to make the systems easier to use. They're not terrible but I feel like some relatively easy (for IT people) tweaks could make the day a lot easier. Especially for a newer person.
2. Interdepartmental communication. It's hard to give customers an update on their loan and sometimes it's unclear who to reach out to if you need something out of the ordinary done on your file or have a (complicated) question or situation. However, if the file is straightforward, it's a well-oiled machine."

It is a large company, but the branch I work in is small enough where you can build relationships with everyone. Anytime I had a suggestion or a grievance I found that I was not only heard,  but that management took every action they could to accommodate me. Another benefit of Freedom is work-life balance. I put in a lot of overtime, but it was when I wanted to. I am able to customize my schedule to fit my needs, working early shift some days and later shift others. My managers have always been extremely flexible if I ever needed to change my schedule. Additionally, Freedom often promotes from within. People who work hard and produce have plenty of opportunity to move up in management if they want to.  Freedom also does a good job at promoting a fun work environment. They constantly hold contests for additional prizes and bonuses all year long. This keeps things fun and breaks up the monotony.",Only downside I would say is that some of the systems Freedom has are a little older and less intuitive than other companies I have worked at.

In a time with so much uncertainty, I appreciate the consistency and fortitude of CEO, Stan Middleman.

Mr. Middleman knows the effort of his employees is not without sacrifice and hasn’t let a moment pass without expressing his gratitude as we all work through this together.  I am fortunate to work in marketing under an incredible leader Bev Thorne.  Bev understands the importance of being connected while we work remotely.  I am grateful for Bev’s efforts, starting each week off with the Monday Morning Marketing Message and ending our week together with a 70 person zoom (all cameras on).  Bev inspires  our creativity with monthly “Buddy Challenges,” and she reaches out directly to members of the team at all levels to check in on them.

1014,,Not a long term job,2020-04-06,1.0,Mortgage Loan Processor,"Besides the pay, nothing else",They will work you like a dog when they are busy and as soon as they are slow you will be laid off. Management loves to micromanage EVERY aspect of operations and the CEO berates under-performing employees in front of others. This is not the place you want to drive to everyday and definitely not a long term job.

We were told nothing was going to change that we were acquired because of the work that we did and that they wanted to grow our department. Almost immediately after we were taken over we discovered everything we were told was a complete lie.  Before we were taken over I worked as an  experienced full doc  processor for our cquisitions team.  Once we become freedom we were forced into a customer advocate position for their portfolio department  working on streamlined loans.  This position is a major step down for any experienced processor as it is not processing it is customer service. I went from a pipeline of 40 to 50 loans which I worked from beginning until closing and got paid a monthly incentive for each loan I closed with my previous company to freedoms way of a them wanting you to close between 85 to 120 loans with the possibility of getting an incentive if I closed over 85 loans which I don't know anybody who actually got the incentive. This position essentially stalks the customer until you get them on the phone and then off to the next department with the customer getting lost in the shuffle of inexperienced employees passing them off to the next person. If you value your career as an actual processor or someone with aspirations of possibly getting into underwriting this is not the place for you it is a waste of your talent and experience. Do not waste your time! I left for an underwriter position at another company after 7 months of putting up with the bate and switch!

You are not paid a commission on anything you sell for the first year (take it as you will). You are given PTO after 3 months and what you use will be put against your monthly quota.

This place is a joke they bamboozle you here to only find out it’s a call center and actually ran like a call center . You’re thrown out to the wolves after only 3 days of training of which you were blindsided and given  live loans to work with only 3 days training on an old 40 year ancient system. Promise a bonus but it has yet to come through and you bring it up the narcissist managers just ignore you. Oh yeah they’ll write you up if you fail to call the customer knowing the reason the delays are because they use cheap title companies.. Complete mess the workload is excessive  ..I started here 3 months ago and have 300 loans in my queue . On top of that I get 20 daily ..there system is so old it doesn’t have the capability of  much so a lot of manuals work .. nothing wrong with manual except the managers expect you to work at an automated mode.. just ridiculous..And they expect you to call the borrowers every 2 days on top emails and answering inbound calls . I must mention love talking and have no problem calling ..the problem is the structure of the company and when you ask to get more structure You are accused of not wanting to do your job.. and very toxic environment.  Lied to about bonuses overtime now has stipulations if you don’t have so many conditional cleared you can’t work OT .. the kicker is the title issues is 80 percent but the employee are penalized so it’s really unachievable even though it’s not under my control. 

Oh last but not least the facility is very strict  they have 2 hour parking minimum in the parking lot so you must park in garage  or you’ll get a boot on your car after 3 rd warning  ( $50 removal fee )and look it’s scary when it gets dark outside when walking to your car alone. 

I wouldn’t wish this on my worst enemy. If you need a job I understand but if you have options DO NOT WORK AT FREEDOM... WARNING COMES BEFORE DESTRUCTION . You’re better off singing in water than become a worker at SLAVE Mortgage!"

1029,,They Will Set You Free At Freedom Mortgage,2019-12-17,1.0,Analyst,Being able to work from home so you do not have to see all the BS face to face.,"Do your research before working here.  Do you really want to be part of the following:

1) Freedom Mortgage Corporation Agrees to Pay $113 Million to Resolve Alleged False Claims Act Liability Arising from FHA-Insured Mortgage Lending 
2) CFPB: Freedom Mortgage fined $1.75M for intentionally reporting inaccurate HMDA data 
3) Freedom Mortgage Corp. Facing Class Action Over Alleged ‘Pay-to-Pay’ Fees on Mortgage Payments
4) Feds put 9 lenders on notice about ‘aggressive, misleading’ VA loan practices
5) Freedom Mortgage CEO buys new oceanfront mansion for $20M

This company grows by taking over weak companies and firing the staff.  They don't only churn loans (like the VA loans) but they churn people.  You never know one day to the next if you will have a job no matter how well you perform.  When laid-off, there is no severance and the way it is done is deplorable."
1030,,Company is a joke,2019-12-16,1.0,Loan Processor,"They have bathrooms on each floor and free instant coffee.
Some very awesome people you'll meet, that are unfortunately trapped there.","They are using cheap title companies, cheap employees, and they look to suck out any extra dollar they can. The CEO will give out enough little treats to keep a majority of the employees happy. If you desperate for a job this is a good place to work and keep applying elsewhere.

It is not uncommon for the cheap title companies they use to miss closings or even for funds to not be dispersed after closing. Many people get calls 30 minutes before closing letting them know they have to reschedule for the day. Staff is so jaded there that when customers call saying funds didn't disperse and no they are two months late on a Mortgage that should've been closed out, half of the staff just goes through the motions.

There are a few great managers and staff who would do so much better anywhere else. Why they choose to stay there probably out of job change fear, or because the CEO pretends to care enough to make up for the times he berates staff. 

Loan officers are poorly trained and too inexperienced, Most of the backend staff has roles sent to cheap third-party companies so they can load their staff up and wring every penny the can out of them. 9 times out of ten the reason they are slow to close loans is because of the inexperience, the long delays by their third-parties, the musical chairs they play with employees and departments, and the lack of technology that most mortgage companies today use."

When the right talent comes through their doors, they refuse to compensate accordingly and prefer to pay the costs of high turnover.

The work-life balance was decent.
The people you work with are kind.","At Freedom Mortgage, management tends to say they are listening to employee feedback while doing the exact opposite. Employee complaints are met with phrases such as ""challenges should be viewed as opportunities,"" which is in essence means ""get over it."" The company touts itself as employee and customer focused, yet the employees don't see much company gratitude in the form of decent benefits or pay. The 401(k) match was laughable, and the period in which one becomes completely vested is 5-6 years. You get 16 days of PTO and one floating holiday, which I don't find to be enough, as some departments are expected to work during the holidays with manager discretion. Many departments have a policy of being fired as soon as you turn in your two weeks, meaning that any PTO you may have accrued is completely lost. 

The work tends to be rather mindless. If you are somebody that enjoys stagnation in their life and constantly doing the same work day after day, Freedom is the place for you. There is little room for personal or professional development here.

As an added bonus, the company is constantly rehiring; therefore, you have little-to-no job security. Employees drop like flies; in the six months I was there, at least seven employees left to go pursue other careers. I believe the average time somebody spends there is probably about a year before they are fed up with the company and find somewhere else offering a better career path. A manager within the company even said that they viewed everyone's job at Freedom Mortgage as a stepping stone to go somewhere else in life, but never somewhere they'd recommend staying."

- Lots of perks for employees who are high performers. Annual Leadership conference is fantastic, event nights, free lunch, great tickets for Philadelphia sports teams for Corporate HQ employees.","- If interviewing with Freedom understand the job you are interviewing for and mortgage industry trends. Entry level sales people will get weeded out if they are underperforming. The hours and overall job for sales aren't for everybody. Other jobs are created because volume rises, but will be deemed unnecessary when volume falls. HR obviously won't tell you these things which leads to some understandable hurt feelings and negative reviews on here. 

If the above does not apply to your situation than there is alot of good at Freedom. Commit yourself to be a top performer and things will generally turn out well for you."

If nothing else, I am happy to have met such incredible people.","- in 1.5 years, I and a few of my colleagues moved offices 6 times. In the last 6 months worked, I was under 3 different managers at 3 different times, all the while I held the same position

-high upper management got there because they lasted with the company through tough times and have no idea how to manage a staff of the current size. Again, direct managers are good with their staff and are only following orders from their superiors, in general I believe the direct managers look out for their employees well being. 

- the PTO plan is horrendous, 10 hours of pto accrued monthly with no extra sick days (thus you have to use pto for doctors, sick days, etc.) I believe the longer you work there the more you get? I’m not sure how long you have to be there for that to kick in. 

-  First Flyers are college students hired in herds where they pay everyone of that specified position the same amount. After graduating the program, if you excel relative to your constituents you will not get paid more. But no worries, you will get the questions of your group delegated to you by managers. Your skills are most likely not transferable outside of mortgages if you are an underwriter for Freedom. They will have you underwrite most of the FHA files without a DE, leaving the appraisals and manual underwrites to those with designations. But they won’t give you a pay increase for doing another product. 

- incentive plans for anyone earning commission/bonus are changed frequently to nearly unattainable goals if too many people reached numbers in previous months 

- the list goes on, but personal opinions of people might be inappropriate for a career posting, and those mentioned above are the most pertinent relative to my experiences, and immediate remedies to those issues listed above would supply an overall better experience. 

Please note, I was not fired, this is not a “retaliation rant”"

1096,,Nepotism and Cronyism at its finest,2019-03-19,2.0,Anonymous Employee,"It's a paycheck, and that's pretty much it.","Unless you know or are related to someone in upper management, your career here will go nowhere.  Benefits are ok, but the pay is below market.  No PTO payout in the event you're terminated or leave on your own.  

There is a culture problem here.  It's mostly a ""good ol' boys"" club.  Upper and middle management suffer terribly from the Peter Principle, as most of the managers have no idea how to actually manage people.

If you plan to work here, beware that the company lays off massive amounts of production people every fall, then rehires more and more overseas contractors to keep payroll costs low and stay below the headlines: ""Freedom Mortgage let go of 800 workers""."
1097,,Loan officer,2019-03-12,1.0,Loan Advisor,Good place to get your foot in the door... but then leave.,"Micromanaged,  Required to do a lot of work without seeing much of a reward or commission. Recently changed comp plan that only benefits top LA’s. Many tenured VP’s, management and LA’s leaving. Most of the employees are unhappy. No culture. There are very few good managers in the building. If you are thinking of working here. Just don’t. It may be a good place to get your foot in the door and get out but with the first flyer program they require you to have a degree for a job that a high school student can do. I wouldn’t be surprised if the Arizona site closes its doors because so many employees are currently in the process of quitting or looking for a new job."
1098,,This company LAYS OFF all the time,2019-03-11,1.0,Mortgage Closer,The health insurance is decent,"There is so much to say about this company but I'll cut to the chase. Management is terrible. When I first started, they got rid of the director of the department I was in (who was supposedly loved by all) and they replaced him with an incompetent manager who ultimately caused the demise of the department I worked in while at Freedom Mortgage. Management is everywhere. They don't have a plan, aren't concise, and do not even know what they are doing. That aside, there is absolutely no culture and no job security. Freedom mortgage lays off every few months and at record numbers. Especially during the holidays like Christmas. I was there for 9 months and suddenly due to mismanagement, they laid off over 30 people right before the holidays. They don't pay you your unused vacation time when they lay you off nor do they provide any severance. My first red flag should have been when three people in my department told me they were laid off 6 times. Because they don't ""like change"", these three people reapplied months after and went back to work for this unsecure company. The Orlando, Florida/Altamonte Springs office I worked in has no cubicles, no walls, but basically long tables that are cramped next to each other with absolutely no privacy. To make matters worse, all the ""walls"" are windows so you can see every single 78 or so employees when walking into the neighboring stores like Scan Design. This place is definitely pathetic and if you are a knowledgable, well seasoned mortgage professional - I suggest you steer clear of this place unless you desire getting laid off. Their systems are vey antiquated (outdated) too.  If you work here, you will be working on their proprietary software that was created in 1990. Think AS/400 or look it up so you can get a better idea of what I am talking about. Your mouse will be of no use to you, thats how old their systems are. Forget about using software bigger, better built mortgage companies use like Encompass. They don't have it nor will they ever. Last word to the wise, this company is owned by one man, who laid people off to build a mansion/second home in palm beach. It's not publicly traded and you're working at a two-bit operation."
1099,,Worst place to work,2019-03-09,1.0,Mortgage Banker,No pros. This place was sad,"Feel free to talk about race, politics and religion and if you don't agree, sorry too bad. HR does nothing about it when you repeatedly have meetings with them about the above mentioned things.  ""Mob mentality"" as they say.  Favorites who have the intelligence of a door knob get saved during layoffs while honest, knowledgeable hardworking people get let go.  They sucker 1st Flyers into the job with false promises. 
Owner has 20million mansion with elevators built in 2017 while laying people off.  Just a shady, nasty place to work."
1100,,Horrible,2019-03-09,1.0,Vice President,"Glass door requires five words for “Pros”.

When the market contracts,you will be laid off without severance. Your bonus or commission will be reverse engineered to to a number that they want it to be (even if earned per plan) Top down management that changes its mind and strategy with the wind and will pat themselves on the back for being “nimble”. 
This is not agility or nimbleness, this is by definition inept, attention deficit management. Sales will be given advice on how to sell by people that can’t or never did. Hard work is not appreciated or recognized... Friendships and relationships are held to a higher standard then ability, competence or work ethic."

SELL you a job where they say you'll be training for months then sell mortgages with ZERO cold calling for only 3 months commission free while you get your feet wet. Complete lie as soon as you get licensed it's 200-300 cold calls a day and you start selling mortgages at the 2-3 month mark. Making less than 20$ an hour for 9 months selling no commission mortgages to God awful leads. Work literally ANYWHERE but here. Don't be suckered into it cause they recruited you from college.
1104,,Awesome company,2019-03-05,5.0,Capital Markets Analyst,Great people and management,Long hours and not enough work life balance
1105,,"Good job for 3-6 months, not a Career",2019-03-03,1.0,Loan Officer,"I learned a ton of valuable sales skills that will transfer to any position in the future.  Product knowledge, building rapport over the phone, active listening, qualification questioning, objective handling, and closing techniques are some of the major takeaways I have from my six months with Freedom.","Cold call 150-200 people a day. These aren't ""leads,"" they're folks who are oblivious that Freedom has purchased their mortgage from another company and now they pay us every month. They have $34,000 in equity, but closing costs surpass that number in some cases, so often you don't have a deal after hours of building a loan for that prospect. They say the leads will get better once you ""hit the sales floor"" but that takes a year of working in the First Flyer program (training program) to be released to a sales team and new manager. Not to mention during that 12 months you are not allowed to take part in work lunches, where corporate provides enough funding to feed 70/90 people in the office but those 20 who are in the training program have to look on as everyone files into the kitchen to get their Chipotle. This happened about once or twice a month, not good for morale. Also, employees efficiency at work is tracked daily. Your computer has a software that tracks how long you've been at your desk and working, and how many times you've gotten up to get coffee, go to the bathroom, etc.. Your managers would quickly IM you or ask across the hall how come you've been slacking off or haven't hit 100 dials by lunch. This sort of micromanagement can be frustrating and make you feel like a child. You were required to report to your manager about leaving for lunch, going on break or stepping outside to make a phone call. It felt like we were high school kids who had to have a baby sitter watch over us. 

Turnover was extremely high. Something that is on par with other telemarketing jobs, but combined with mortgages and people were leaving left and right. Many times the talk at the water fountain or coffee machine was, ""How much longer you think you'll stick around?"" This was because we were calling 150-200 people a day; 20-30 actually answer and pick up the phone. On 5-10 people you may make some progress and have a lead. The only issue is we're calling folks with a 3.25% (often lower) interest rate and $30,000-$40,000 in equity tops, so the likelihood of you actually closing a deal is extremely slim. Now, Freedom Mortgage specializes in cash-out refinancing and debt consolidation. Any person with minute financial education knows how stupid it is to consolidate 3-4 credit cards into a 30-year mortgage. The debts aren't gone, they're just rolled into a 30-year mortgage and paid over that time span with interest of course. So if debt consolidation wasn't an option, our only backup was taking cash out from the equity they have paid into their homes. The problem here is that interest rates are the highest they've ever been right now than in the past 5-10 years. The product we pitch is we can get the customer $10,000-$20,000 to remodel their bathrooms, but we'll charge you close to $30,000 in closing costs for you to access that money,  double your 2.75% interest rate to a 5.625% and not to mention start all over on your mortgage that you've worked hard to decrease in size over the years. In addition, all of this is done over the phone with a stranger, most likely someone who is calling during the customer's dinner time. 

Can you see how frustrating this can be on a daily basis? The constant rejection and poor ""leads"" we had to choose from instilled an overarching feeling of hopelessness, especially with the managers in your ear about metrics and sending update emails every 2 hours.  It's a high-pressure environment which isn't for everyone. You're expected to make big sales for the company but what they've provided you, the employee with is very little to be successful. No one in their right mind will refinance over the phone with a telemarketer they've never seen face to face. This is their largest asset we're calling customers about and they've never even heard of our company. Most folks will elect to visit their local bank and conduct this business face to face with someone they feel they can trust. 

In addition, no commission from the sales you make in the first 12 months is earned. You are paid a base salary for the first 12 months, and if you've proven to be loyal after that time, the company will start paying you a fraction of the business you have provided them through a commission. This policy differs across the board but most commission jobs allow you to start earning that little bonus much sooner than 12 months of employment. I believe this is their way of weeding-out the folks who aren't any good or who aren't in it for the long haul. With such high turnover, maybe they don't want to pay those folks who will most likely leave. Or on the other hand, its simply cheap labor and more money in the CEO's pocket. They can hire a bunch of  clueless college grads who are simply happy with a job offer and not have to pay them very much at all, they'll earn us some business and leave after 6 months. The cost of training and hiring for this company has got to be astronomical considering their turnover. 

Hours were quite odd, we worked 9-6pm and 10-7pm once a week. Getting off at 7pm is a drag, the day is already over it feels like and you've missed dinner. After about 5-6 months you will be asked to start working Saturday's once a month. Once a month isn't horrible, but there's a lot of jobs out there that don't require you to work on weekends, again this is for no commission. 

After about 4-5pm west coast time, all of the help in New Jersey (corporate) has gone home so if you work on the west coast, you're screwed. Many times after 4pm we were forced to tell customers to try and call again the next day but earlier so we'd have someone who could speak with them - not everyone calling needed to speak to a loan officer like myself. 

Lastly, the environment was as bad as it could get. Nobody says ""Hi"" or ""Good morning"" in the hallway. It was normal for me to walk past a manger, shoot them a kind smile and receive nothing in return or they'd quickly glance the other way to avoid conversation with a training employee. Little things like this pile up over time, and it seemed that truly no one was happy to be there in the office. 

I stayed for 6 months precisely and got the heck out of there. If you're a recent graduate or just looking for a sales job, STEER CLEAR this is not what you want. If anything, this is a good job to have for 3-6 months while you search for a better job. This is by no means a career position."

-Salary and benefits for a mature career are very competitive, also not worth killing your career.","- Despite being privately held, there are no bonuses.  If you are a well-evolved mature leader considering working here on that reason, salaried non-commissioned positions pay only salary.  No annual bonus.  If you are hired at a competitive salary, annual merit salary increases are stingy (1.25% - 1.5%), and have nothing to do with your performance.

-Hiring/Promotions appear to be restricted to friends/family of those above your pay-grade, leaving you unable to train/coach the hired/promoted person.

-Use it or lose it PTO policy.  Many comments here mention not being paid out PTO when laid off, but that is a well-established company policy.  Note to those considering this company: USE YOUR VACATION TIME.

- No training opportunities for professional level employees, unless you are one of the ""in"" crowd

-Loyalty, hard work, dedication, longevity, long hours - none of it is appreciated.  If your career is well established, it will die here."

The managers and even other male employees will treat you badly and say very vulgar things to you without punishment. Also when you tell HR they don’t do much to stop it unless you have proof.

Passing the safe exam is also some extra money. If you are already interviewing for other jobs at big companies with a slower recruiting process, Freedom is the best place to be to collect some money while you job search. Freedom recruits extremely fast for sales and you even get to learn about mortgages while getting some free meals along the way. Paid time off days are also not paid out when you leave, so they can be conveniently used whenever you accrue them. This job is the most fun and relaxing when you have a job offer at another firm. Sales experience is a really useful skill to have when working in any field.","You only have a 6-month cushion at Freedom and afterward, it isn't very worthwhile to stay. Eventually, you will have to cold call dial over 200+ uninterested clients each day. After that, once you go onto the actual sales floor, whether you get to stay will depend on meeting a strict quota that tests mostly your luck, and some of your skill. Essentially this job has very low career potential and stability. Almost everyone is replaceable because anyone can learn sales. Before you start, you just have to be smart enough to be aware that the 6 figure salary marketed by hr is highly unlikely for the majority in this program."

1196,,Unrealistically high expectations with low compensation,2018-06-17,1.0,Anonymous Employee,I can't think of any,"Honestly, I'm not really sure where to begin with this review and have re-written this review multiple times before posting.

Just some background information before I begin: I worked at Freedom for 5 years and have been promoted twice – once to a team lead and again to a supervisor. I’m skilled at analyzing data and in creating automation tools (e.g. for one department, I reduced their reporting time from 4-5 hours/day to about 5 minutes/day). I feel like saying all of this is important before I begin because I think it helps to convey how time efficient I am and how I like to work smart and not hard.

At first I thought the growth at Freedom was amazing since I was promoted twice in such a short amount of time. However, I realized soon after that I was only promoted because they wanted to give me a salary and make me ineligible for overtime.

As a supervisor, I was responsible for managing 3 different teams with incredibly varied schedules. In that time, I was responsible for pulling and listening to calls, creating and distributing reports to agents, management, and leadership, and creating new procedures and training materials for those 3 teams. Because of all of this, I usually had to stay in the office from 8am to 11pm (and in some extreme cases, work a 15-19 hour shift).

Eventually I was “promoted” moved away from my supervisory position to a more analytical role in the department. At first, I was ecstatic because I thought it would mean that I would finally have a normal workload. But sadly, that didn’t happen. In addition to my new duties, my manager made me continue my previous ones. At first I didn’t mind because I thought that my pay would at least change with my increased workload (at this time I was pulling multiple all-nighters per week) or at least put in a request to have my title changed. But after several months (and my multiple follow-ups to management), I just kind of gave up on that idea. The best part of it (sarcasm) was that because of all of my responsibilities and because I was incredibly overworked, I was given a low employee review because I wasn’t able to 100% complete a single project by a particular deadline. 

Management have told me on multiple occasions that I shouldn’t work so many hours. However, I think it’s something that they legally had to tell me because they still expected me to complete my projects by a given deadline, as unrealistic as it is. Otherwise, I would probably get another low employee review.

In the past couple of years though (from 2017-2018), I was moved to 4 other, non-lateral departments without either a pay change, title change (system still said at the time that I was the supervisor of a now defunct department), or even a new offer letter. My workload did get reduced a little, but I still needed to pull all-nighters and work 10+ hours during the weekend to complete projects. 

Before accepting my final role at the company, an SVP personally reached out to me with a job offer. In the interview, they promised me that my role would provide job security for the next 3 years. Little did I know before accepting that position that I would be laid off within the next 3 months. Note: Freedom does not offer severance packages and will not reimburse any of your unused PTO.

In hindsight, I think my biggest mistake was staying with the company for as long as I have. 

I hope that my experience will help others avoid this company and apply elsewhere."

Annual increases are limited to 2% for highest level so, if you get the highest level review possible, your raise will be maybe 1/2 a percent higher than some who barely got an average review - not much incentive to go above and beyond. If you get promoted to a new position, your pay increase will be limited to the base of the new position or a 10% increase, whichever is LOWER. You read that right, if the new positions base salary is 20% higher than your current one, you will be limited to 10%. They have been having massive layoffs over the past year and, when they lay you off, you get no notice, NO SEVERANCE, they won’t even pay you for the PTO time you have accrued but not yet used. Also, your insurance will only be covered thru the month you were terminated so, if you get let go on the 30th, you’re screwed.

I was hired in 2015 in their First Flyer program, which advertises itself as a recent college graduate training program. They ply you with social events and awards to entice you to stay, and then once you start actually selling loans you see what’s really going on. Freedom churns (refinances loans over and over again by offering lower credit applicants exorbitant rates) and also steers (it was in our scripting to tell borrowers we could possible refinance them again, all because the rates we i Italy offered were too high). Freedom fires good management and keeps on racist and prejudicial managers. They fire people with no severance or payout on their earned PTO. There is no wonder they were given 60 days to fix their VA loan practices or be forced to stop selling VA loans. I encourage everyone to google Freedom Mortgage lawsuits and read for yourself what this company does - they are shady snakes. They hire too many people and then wonder why leads for loans dry up. This company, based on its recent mass layoffs, will be closed by next year in my opinion - and the only people who will remain will be the senior most management, while everyone else will be left to wither in the wind."

It was a sympathetic and understanding meeting when they let us go. No chance to make actual commission. Had close to 50 loans in my pipeline in 3 months, only saw 15 of them close due to the poor processing procedures, and the commission pay scale kept changing. What’s upsetting is that they pay Managers and STLs based on certain team statistics, and they are then forced to push those stats more than actual closings it feels like at times, and it makes for a hectic work environment. It’s also clear that the UPPER management, I’m talking top tier VPs and above, are more invested in the First Flyers succeeding instead of any other employees."

They opened out location in Feb of 2017 and did a mass hire of 30 plus people and laid them all off a few weeks after training, then laid off another handful in Feb of 2018 and then completely closed the entire location and laid everyone but about 8 people off who now work remotely. They did this after swearing they were “right sized” now. It was literally 2 weeks before reviews and raise time, the first we were eligible for. The people who were chosen to stay were not all top performers, most of them were laid off probably due to pay scale. I think Stan is going to run his company into the ground.

They are constantly throwing out new initiatives and just hoping one sticks. Every week they're trying something new. They're confused and all the VP's on the floor are manipulaters. They use sales tactics on their own employees to convince them to trust the process. Their initiatives are constantly failing and they're constantly laying people off. They are very cold and rude during the lay off process without having a valid explanation for why they are laying you off. Freedom is very shady and I would never recommend anyone working for them. You have to devote your entire life to be a just a little but success there. They tell you your seat is worth $100k. You'll never see that because they don't provide the proper lead sources for $100k salaries. They have you working Saturdays and now Sundays. Not the typical 9-5. The company is called Freedom but everyone there is in bondage. It's a draining position mentally and emotionally, which can also begin to affect your physical health.  They try to manipulate you into thinking you don't want to be successful if you have a life outside of the company and don't want to be their 7 days a week. There is no work/life balance. If only the managers and VP's wake up and realize they deserve more for their lives other than being puppets of the only one who's truly successful in the company, which is the owner and his son. The irony is although they are laying off people constantly, they are constantly hiring. This is why I say this company is confused and needs proper direction. Everyone knows what the corporate culture is as far as when layoff season comes around but this isn't a testament to corporate culture. Freedom stands alone as the most shady and unprofessional businesses I've ever been worked for. Every month is lay off season."

Freedom Mortgage needs to be thoroughly investigated regarding their practices not only regarding their treatment of their employees but also how they take advantage of their older customers. How does an 82-year-old borrower get a refinance for a 30-year term? That is ludicrous! The director of the department is micromanaged by a leader who has no idea how to operate it and has no connection to the Title Track team.  The only time she makes herself visible is during layoffs. She overworks the director of the department so much that the director barely has time to meet with anyone on the team. She made so many poor changes to the department and none for the benefit of the company. Anyone who writes a  positive 5-star review in professional verbiage is more than likely written by Freedom's management team.  Certain people are paid higher pay rates for performing the same jobs as others even as a college graduate with no experience in the mortgage business. Upper-management and HR are cold during the lay off process and treat you like you've stolen something by packing your things and ushering you out the front door. Management picks and chooses who they like to keep during layoffs and dismiss hard-working employees. Let's not forget you have to go into a room with them looking absolutely heartless while handing you a package to apply for an expensive Cobra package you can't afford."

And when you do have a meeting, it boils all down to numbers and metrics: not about the quality of your work, but instead they focus so much on pounding out inbounds and outbounds it will make your head spin. They also have a specific department hired to micromanage, make sure you are in the queue at all time, and always Available. If you need to take a quick bathroom break? You better be ready to explain it. I was harassed by a male co-worker, said something to sr management and they said ""well let us know if it happens again"". I did, nothing was done. HR is a joke about it, too. 
If you want a promotion while you work in the call center, good luck getting out. 
I truthfully feel like this company doesn't care about the employees or the borrowers. The loss mitigation process is a joke, with so much miscommunication or lack of, the ridiculous amount of time it takes to get the process approved for the customer, and by that point, they are in Foreclosure with a date set. The people that try really hard to do the right thing by getting back on track, the company just drags its feet. The mandatory overtime does not make for a good work/life balance. Senior Management is unethical, making false promises of changes to come. All in all, if you can avoid this place, do it. Especially in the call center environment.

Freedom Mortgage has an incredibly strong leadership core and is always looking to grow from within. You must be willing to work hard and continue to adapt but this is a company that will reward you for your efforts.",The mortgage industry is fickle.
1284,,First Flyer Loan Officer,2017-12-27,1.0,,"They hire new graduates fresh out of college, and they give younger professionals the chance to establish what it's like to work in a professional environment.  

The workplace is also diverse, and if you are a First Flyer it is comfortable working with people in your age group.

There is a lot of time and money spent on training.","During your first week as a First Flyer, this job seems like a serious score, but it's all an act until you realize what you have really gotten yourself into. And you won't fully realize what your job actually is until you've been working here for about 6 months. 
Again, the training program is great, but once the training is over and they stick you in your ""processing role"" things start to set in. You are expected to work in a processing role for about 6 weeks, where they tell you the purpose is to ""give you an idea of what the back end of the loan writing process is like,"" but in reality this is just to give the First Flyers something to do while your licenses clear.
Once you actually hit the call center floor, you realize that you actually ARE cold calling people, even after a huge selling point of the job interviews consistently remind you that you won't be.
After you are tortured with cold calling numbers belonging to dead people, disconnected phone numbers, and people who will pleasantly remind you that they want to be on a do no call list; you are finally put on a team with actual ""leads."" Right.
95% of your leads will be people with under 500 credit scores, have had recent bankruptcies, or have been cold called by a third party and transferred to you. Some people are desperate for a refinance, but are just plain unqualified which is heartbreaking. Your manager will force you to stay on the phone with a person who tells you that they are going through a bankruptcy because ""you are the professional, and you know what is best for them."" AND THEY WILL MAKE YOU PULL THIS PERSON'S CREDIT REPORT EVEN IF YOU KNOW THEY ARE UNQUALIFIED because management gets praised off of ""credit pulls."" What a joke.
You will be working with good people who are going through the same sad hell that you are. Your managers will praise the people who actually make sales, and make examples out of them. Everyone on the floor will know who is making money, they will make a point of it, and they will constantly remind you that you're sitting in ""$100,000 seats."" Right. That might be the case for about 5-10% of the call center."

If you're not in the First Flyer program you literally mean nothing to them other than being an expense. Working conditions are horrible, people are always sick since they cram you all in a tiny office, buildings are not properly maintained, compensation is not comparable to the job, to list a few of many discrepancies.

It's completely unrealistic if you want to actually make money. You have to do a tremendous amount of work for a very minimal ""commission"". It doesn't even seem like a commission. It's more like a small bonus for busting your butt to close loans to make the company money. Yeah, it's a business...but I honestly don't understand how their pay structure is even legal. 
Speaking of a tremendous amount of work, you have to do the most tedious tasks that are not benefiting yourself or the borrower. The rates offered are established to make the company the max amount of money. Borrowers are bamboozled every single day into thinking this company is selling them a ""benefit"". More times than not, we're probably putting them into a worse situation with a ridiculous amount of fees. Which, by the way, we're often encouraged to do to bring in the money.  
If you are a female and even the slightest bit attractive, good luck. Their are specific people who will literally visually assault you and talk about you like they are high school jocks. 
You are micromanaged (right down to when you are allowed to use the bathroom). You can be put on a performance improvement plan at the drop of a hat. Your numbers are constantly monitored and you are always answering to some about why things aren't moving. (BTW this is SOLELY because NO ONE knows how to do their job since the way the process works changes EVERY SINGLE DAY). 
I am truthfully surprised Freedom does not have more lawsuits slapped against them.

I was pressured by management to submit a good review a few months ago to help with hiring and am choosing to correct that now.  Shame on me for complying with that request.  Another reviewer made mention of fake reviews here and they were correct.,"Results are never enough.  Communication is terrible leaving most employees wondering what to do next to avoid being yelled at (which will ultimately happen anyway).  Most employees are afraid of Sr management and will only look to keep themselves off the naughty list.  ZERO work life balance although that was their hiring theme last year.  Last minute requirement to work on the weekend over and over.  Sr management advises supervisors to ""chain people to their desk"" which is a direct quote.  The call center has loan officers sitting on top of each other and even have as many as five desks stuffed in an office meant for one.  Loan officers who fund 100 million a year work on sams club tables with folding chairs.  Constant threat of termination.  The business model looks to take advantage of the uninformed by offering extremely high rates as a way to churn for future refinancing.  A large number of employees were laid off right before Christmas with no notice, nor severance.  There was not a single colleague of mine who enjoyed working here.  Any review over two stars is most likely fraudulent, submitted by someone in management or an employee pressured by management."

Working with offshore co-workers is challenging more often than not. Calling customer to get documents. Borrowers think its a scam  and zero credibility then. 
Company gives little incentives to make employees want to stay and there are 1-2 people leaving (quitting or getting fired) weekly at this point due to the lack of job stability and totally unhealthy work environment.

Company creates a culture in which they motivate employees strictly through fear and threats. Several management changes and cultural shifts. Unorganized and fly by seat of pants kind of company. 

PTO never granted, poor management (big time cliche-smoking crew), poor benefits ( get rid of you at 90 days so they don't have to pay any), no room for advancement

You are just a number there for loans processed. You have no name or face. You are just a money maker for them.

All the different stops I made improved my knowledge, skills, network, and understanding of how the company operates.  The management all around was there to help and instructed when needed.

AE's are extremely pushy.  Brokers are rude and allowed to talk to you horribly.  Management are micro-managers.  Training is horrible / non existent and when you ask for help they make you feel like an idiot for asking.  No time to get use to their way of doing things.  System antiquated (DOS) base.  Even though you work from home you end up working off the clock just to keep up with daily goals because they control overtime by only working new files.  If you work over, you have to get permission like child.

1428,,Processing,2016-07-23,1.0,Loan Processor,Advancement. The company gives you a lot of options to grow from anything. The people not in management roles are generally super helpful.,I work in processing. It's a micro managing hell. Say your entire team or whatever process X about loans by busting your butt and working OT during the week and Saturdays. So you each your goal you get a slap on the back and then told to do 10 more next month. Management does not care why a loan is being held up if they think a loan should submitted. On top of that half of the team leads are stupid or petty. Other departments will blame the processor at a drop of a hat. Literally if there is a problem it's because of you until you can prove it wasn't. Guilty until proven not. On top of that the training while done by amazing people was short and barely covered anything. If you don't know about the mortgage industry you won't learn much in it. OT is optional for the most part but try to tell your manager you are not coming in on a Saturday and you think you just killed a puppy. This company has no respect for anyone outside life. They rather work you to death than hire enough people and train them. Seriously just stay away and unless you are desperate.

If you are happy at $40k - $50k, then this may be an OK job for you. I say my pay drop by 50% in 2015 despite closing 40+ loan per month.  Unlicensed trainees pitching clients. Management will cut your leads if you disclose cost to customers. Only a matter of time until they get shut down.

The program is set up similar to a paid internship as you earn credits towards graduation and experience towards your career.

There compensation plan doesn't allow this. They lie when they say you aren't cold calling as a loan officer. The training is boring and not engaging at all. If you don't participate in the training they have an issue with it. The trainers actually talk behind your back and act very unprofessional. The trainers and HR people have no concept of organization and have favoritism. The coaches they give you don't know anything about the industry or what they are supposed to be doing. They require you to go these ""cohort events"" but don't pay you for it and if you don't go it's a problem.  The rotations are ridiculous as all you do is sit around and do nothing. You get a glorified title at the end so they don't have to pay you overtime. Everyone they hire as a first flyer has no real world experience so they have no idea what's going on and how they are actually being completely lied to. Overall it's just a huge waste of time."

The First Flyer program consisted of rotations through essentially every department involved in a mortgage loan from doc management and disclosures to processing and closing. The end result was sales. This structure allowed for a better appreciation of each aspect of the process. One of the main reasons I chose this company was the fact that they offered base salary plus commission. Definitely a pro if you have a family to support.",It is so easy to get caught up in your work that you forget work/life balance. Benefit package could be better.

1479,,LO'S SEEKING A JOB DON'T DO IT,2016-01-08,1.0,Loan Officer,THE BASE IS ONE OF THE BEST IN THE INDUSTRY THAT i KNOW OF AND OTHER THAN THE CO-WORKERS THAT'S IT FOR THE PROS,"This review is going to include info that I wished that I would have been provided before accepting an LO position WITH this company.  Everything in this review are important topics that LO’s look for in a company.
The next list published for the top 10 worst companies to work for should have this company at #1.    Here’s why;
UPPER MANAGEMENT (UM)- the 5 guys that run the call centers have no experience or knowledge of the normal responsibilities industry wide of what an experienced loan officer performs.  If you are an experienced LO & take meds & accept a LO position with this company, then stock up on your MEDS.
Forget about time management, forget about getting loans funded all they want you to be is an order taker.  You can FUND 2 loans a month and your job is safe.  YOU WILL BE MICRO-MANAGED TO THE POINT OF SUFFOCATION.
PROCESSING – UM believes in cheap labor so the Operations Team is primarily comprised of inexperienced unknowledgeable individuals.  They do not want to pay the industry standard income to hire experienced processors, UW and the JR. Processors are straight off the street.
Your loans will get withdrawn, cancelled, killed or simply not processed because these people don’t know what they are doing.  In addition, their pipelines are so overloaded you will have processors talk your borrowers into cancelling their applications.  It does not matter how well you know your guidelines you will lose 50 percent or greater of your applications. Most applications go SOUTH once they get into processing. You will also lose business from homeowners checking online consumer reviews.
OPERATIONS SUPERVISORS – same as processing.  UM doesn’t possess the experience or knowledge in this arena to hire good, quality, knowledgeable people.
There are 1 or 2 good ones but other than that you will fight a constant battle every single day to try to get your loans funded.  I’m talking it’s a war to get your applications to funding.
COMMISIONS – there are 3 tiers of commissions depending on the loan type and loan source you are assigned to originate.  The lower tier commission per loan might make payments on 2 of your credit cards with medium to low balances.
The mid-tier commission per loan would not pay a satellite bill with the basic package and a couple sports channels.
The highest tier commission per loan probably will not make your car payment unless you have a really cheap payment.
The UM idea is volume; the problem is they don’t have the experienced personnel to achieve this so they only work on the cookie cutters.  Forget about trying to process your files or get them to funding.  UM management style is complete dictatorship and micro-management & is something you will have to constantly deal with.  You are put on a schedule that tells you when you can pick your nose.
BENEFITS – for a company that brags about how many billions of dollars they fund each month the benefits are expensive, high co-pays and bottom of the barrel poor quality insurance.  Oh and the billions that are funded each month your share of the pie will be a crumb so small you will need a microscope to see.

1481,,Freedom Mortgage,2016-01-04,3.0,Anonymous Employee,"Freedom is a large independently owned direct lender with a presence on all 50 States. The Operations Team is strong that provides a high level of service for the Sales team and its partners. There is great opportunity for promotion from within and had a great experience myself moving from an entry level position to a management role in a short period of time. I am not advocating that this track will be experience by all but if you work hard, learn the industry and advocate for yourself, you can grow within this company.",The company has worked hard to grow its market share and in doing so it attempted to centralize. This process was not well executed and detracted from the regional influence of a strong operations team. They have since reversed course to some degree but they have also incorporated outsourcing with Accenture into its operational process. This also was not well executed and has caused several experienced professionals to leave Freedom for other opportunities. This is not the same company for better or worse it was three years ago.
1482,,Low Pay no Bonus,2015-12-21,1.0,IT Manager,Easy to get job here as turnover is high.,"Pay is horrible, no bonuses, across the board 2% raises. The CEO, Stanley Middleman, is living it up going from jail for mortgage fraud to making $100s of millions during the refinance boom. He will not share his fortune with his employees except buying them a bagel breakfast once a year. I guess he knows most of the company will lose their jobs as soon as mortgage rates go up so he doesn't care about making employees happy."

Not necessarily for lower level employees who worked at the company, but the actual customers and clients themselves. The policies they had in place were so far from helping and assisting the customer. EVERY company should know: The client is always right.

The comp plan was changed 3 times within 6 months. What was supposed to be an inbound call model was turned into outbound calls. They force you to get state licenses wether you need more states or not (I was given 15 licenses and already had 12) and then they force you to pay for the licenses if you quit before two years. That is about a $10-15k bill you will receive in the mail after you quit. Additionally, in the contact, you have to be employed at the time of your paycheck to receive it. Since commission is always paid a month behind, it is impossible to get paid a final commission check. This is non-negotiable, even if the loans are closed and funded before you quit, you still will not be paid that final commission check.

1535,,Sweatshop environment and micromanagement,2014-09-29,1.0,Senior DE Mortgage Underwriter,Co-workers care and support each other.,"Co-workers had to emotionally support each other due to the unrealistic production.

  For underwriters working full docs, you are expected to finish at least 3-4 new loans and finish all the resubmission for that day ( can be also 3-4 loans or more) and respond and support to all inquiries from processors.  An average loan takes 1.5-2 hrs. (a very old base DOS system does not help either) , if you do the math, there are not enough hours in the work day to finish your daily quota.  We worked off hours to catch up  in order not get in trouble for the next day, but we still end up in trouble, because the loans assigned yesterday were not done.  If you push back and indicate the reasons why the all the loans were not done, there will be a high probability you will get laid off citing that the market is slowing.  That is hard to believe when the western division is still hiring,  and quite a few of remote underwriters ( who were laid off ) were located west coast.

I was recruited to work remotely and took a pay cut to do so but did not expect management to micro manage endlessly as big brother to make sure all your actions are accountable.  Quality was stressed, but for the amount of production they wanted that was unrealistic.  There is currently a class action lawsuit filed against this company for unpaid overtime.  From my experience, companies like these usually settle due to it is cheaper to settle out of court.   I worked an average 20-30 hrs. of Unpaid overtime, and if the courts pulled this company's systems there is evidence to support all the claims.  It shows that in the end, being  micro managed can have its advantages as evidence (emails, instant messages, systems logins,  ect...). to support unrealistic production goals and the unpaid overtime retired to achieve it."
1536,,Underwriter,2014-09-25,1.0,Underwriter,Excellent initial training (by the corporate trainers).,"Can you say DOS...antiquated system - upfront training indicated it would take to 3-6 months to get comfortable with using the system.  However, after being assigned to a manager (using the term ""manager"" loosely), this person's patience to learning the system was exhausted after a 2-3 weeks.  I believe part of the problem was the manager had no management skills (first time manager and not a long seasoned mortgage professional to boot).  The manager was hostile and created a horrific work environment.  Unfortunately, as the group was sort of clickish, I was not comfortable in talking to any other supervisor about the problem - it was clear the regional manager did not have any interest in my success as a new employee.   For some I am sure it works out, but not for me.  After 30 years in the industry, the stress of an incompetent supervisor's degradation resulted in what I would say was the worst employment experience I have ever had.   

Of the 6 underwriters in my training class, 3 are gone.  The other 2: laid off and resigned due to ""sweatshop"" environment."
1537,,In a word:  Don't,2014-09-21,2.0,Anonymous Employee,"Healthcare benefits are fairly reasonably priced.  Computer equipment decent  Some work-from-home opportunities.

Legal Department is amazing--review of contracts and partnership with business outstanding.  Operations Department strong as well.","It is a male-dominated company with a bully-in-the-schoolyard management mentality. Managers yell, bully, or ostracize.  There is very little ethnic diversity / racial diversity / gender diversity in upper management.  

No work-life balance.  Employees must put company first all the time.  Kept NJ offices open during Hurricane Sandy--no regard for employees' safety or personal property. 

Facilities constantly under construction during work hours.  Visitors and employees exposed to dust, noise, paint smells from constant construction.

Poor 401K match.  PTO is below industry standard. 

Extremely unprofessional atmosphere. Many on the management team is inexperienced (not from major corporations) or just high school educated, and it shows through how they handle challenges and their lack of a cohesive strategy.  HR Department extremely weak--no follow-thru and thoroughly ineffective. They think ""jeans days"" are innovative rewards for employees.

Very little opportunity for advancement as the ""yes people"" dominate the culture.  If you are not in the ""in clique"" you will not advance.

Technology applications and intranet are antiquated.  Intranet contains same content since January.  No cutting edge applications.  Network and portals go down with regularity.  Newly created PMO department weak and ineffective.  IT Department lacks a strategy--senior leadership in this department poor leaders--much bluster, few results.

Policies and procedures were constantly changing which made it very difficult to remember. Many policies and procedures were different for each region, sometimes completely opposite from one branch to the next. 
Training was also an after thought. It was sink or swim for the most part. Often, training consisted of you unknowingly making a mistake and then being told you screwed up.
The biggest complaint was that the company held a huge celebration with a catered lunch and flew in all the top management to celebrate how well the company was doing but then laid off myself and many others two days later. Needless to say, it was a shock. We were told that they were cutting back staff to adjust to the work load. This was hardly believable as there were new employees in the department who were still in training and we had been on unlimited overtime for weeks. It was obvious that they were cutting the most senior and highest paid employees in each department and replacing them with younger employees that lacked experience and were most likely being paid much less. I know when I was laid off, along with one other co-worker, that left the rest my department with no employee being over 30 or so and at least half of those were under 25 and fresh out of college. I know it wasn't my performance as the company gave me a 25% raise just 8 months prior to keep me when I had been offered a position with another company.

1555,,Bait and Switch...Interview vs. Actual job,2013-11-15,1.0,Loan Officer,Co-workers were extremely helpful.  Freedom Mortgage paid for NMLS licensing.  Other than that...Friday's were casual dress.,"I was recruited by (sought out and contacted by them--mind you) and pulled from my current job search and actually declined another offer with a great company based on what was told or sold to me during the interview process with Freedom Mortgage as to what I should expect working for Freedom Mortgage as a Loan Officer or Assistant VP of Sales (as they call it).  

In this industry to be successful at this type of sales job a prospective employee needs to consider, before deciding to accept a job offer with a company are, the leads that you are given to contact or work with in conjunction with whether the product you will be selling or the interest rates, in this case,  are competitive.  If I were to be responsible for my own lead generation (which I wasn't) but if I had been, that is something that I would have or should have been told upfront, so that I could make a decision on whether the company and I were a good fit for each other.  Basically, I was promised and told lies in the interview process and throughout the 30 day training period as to the lead generation system at Freedom Mortgage.  This is one of the reasons that I declined the other job offer from the other company.  Another reason for declining the other job offer in lieu of working at Freedom Mortgage was the compensation that I was told that I would be making.  Anyone in this industry knows that you get paid when a loan closes (either in basis points or a flat fee---ex: $350/loan closed)  I was told that not only would I receive a flat fee for loans that closed, but that I would also be given a flat fee for locking a loan as well. Locking a loan, for those that do not know, is another way of saying that a customer/borrower agrees to use your company for their loan at which time an interest rate is ""locked"" in for a specified time period. To sum up my promised compensation was:  a very fair salary plus commission upon locking a loan as well as commission upon loan closing/funding.  This turned out to not be true.  I was recruited by Freedom Mortgage along with 15 or so other Loan Officers from another company whom had recently closed its doors and laid us all off.  We were all promised in the interview process and again throughout the training process that we would be working mainly with ""Purchase Loans' which turned out to not be true.  Here is a list of what was promised to us and what turned out to be true or false:

1-Salary-TRUE
2-Working mainly with purchases-FALSE (Purchases commissions were higher than refinance commissions)
3-Being paid when a loan is locked-FALSE
4-Amendment to ""paid upon locking a loan"" to getting paid after loan is processed-FALSE
5-Leads would be new/fresh/hot-FALSE

Before my departure from the company, in the last sales meeting that I attended, our immediate sales manager told us that they agreed that we were in fact hired too soon as upper management really wanted to obtain as many loan officers as they could from the company that we all worked for that closed down so that we ""wouldn't go anywhere else"". So, they brought us on without a plan in place, knowing that they couldn't deliver on the promises made that we would be working fresh new leads, that we wouldn't be working with fresh new *purchase* leads, that they weren't paying us upon locking a loan, that they weren't paying us on get a loan processed.  We were all pulled from our job searches, declined other job offers based on false promises and fraudulent inducement.

I have since tried to contact the other company whom I turned down to accept the Freedom Mortgage job offer and the position has been filled. I am now stuck hoping to be able to collect unemployment while finding another position.  

The irony here is that the industry which has been tainted by unscrupulous lenders and lending practices now has laws in place to protect borrowers from unfair or deceptive lending practices such as ""Baiting and switching"" ...  it appears that lenders have just found another way to do it!!

For those of you whom are part of this group of Loan Officers that I mentioned above...let's get in touch with each other and all go and pursue legal action together.  CLASS ACTION!

We were tricked and all harmed financially.

For those of your reading this and considering employment with this company...maybe other departments in the company are OK to look into.  But know this, in the 3 months that I worked there, there were 2 big layoffs!!!

1562,,Inconsiderate of employees,2013-09-17,1.0,Compliance Specialist,I met some great co workers which are now friends,"""Team Leaders"" are barely educated and looking over people who are more qualified for their job.
Pushed towards over time constantly but immediately harassed about over time come the new year.
Nothing to do for months and not allowed to touch open files to work. I sat for two months watching netflix because we werent allowed to do files until specific time intervals.
Must be related to management in order to be treated with respect.
Told to break laws in order to complete loans."
1563,,Massive Layoffs,2013-09-13,1.0,Loan Officer,"You get to see sales managers driving different cars everyday, and the CEO has a Bentley.","You are not treated as a person, you are forced to work overtime, some nights I worked until 10:30 PM with no extra pay. In addition, your hours of work change weekly, so does your compensation. I was paid a mere 100 dollars per loan funded. This is not a company, the day you sign the acceptance letter the CEO sees it as a bill of purchase and he and management can do with you as they please. I beg you, walk away, this company has been sued more than a dozen times by its employees! its a huge revolving door..."

The starting pay is COMPLETELY ridiculous for most of the departments , senior managers are the ones getting all the bonuses and benefits while the barely even show up to work , the place is a mess and is so unorganized. Forget about annual reviews and raises , you would be lucky if you got a 2% raise.

 The CEO is one of the cheapest people you would ever meet , the facilities are ridiculous , bathrooms are out of soap and toilet paper almost everyday. There is one fridge and 3 microwaves for the 4 levels building. The health benefits were decent , the percentage they would match your 401 k was ridiculously low.

If you know a manager or you're related to a manager , you're hired , it doesn't matter if you qualify or not. I knew at least 3 managers within the company that had their sons/daughters as direct reports. I don't think that they ever heard or conflict of interest in here.

they would expect you to go to work in the middle of a blizzard without consideration to any type of weather watch .what a joke."
