146,Futures First,"If you love markets, FF is the place.",2020-07-28,5.0,Market Analyst,"Having worked in Futures First for 4 years, I can say that its not a conventional place to work in. Its actually a school where you pay initially to learn, not in monetary terms but rather in terms of your qualitative assets you have collected all throughout your life. I will try to list down some of many pros of working here.

1. Once you join FF you'll realize you're going to deal in of the most niche but one of the most important branches in finance. 

2. Being a trader is not less than 50% as glamorous as it is shown in movies like The Big Shorts, Margin Call, Billions and that's what you experience if you are work here.

3. When you know how do you react in your toughest times, you get prepped for handling the future unfavorable circumstances. Markets are not the same the next day, thus bring different set of challenges everyday.

4. One of the most important perks is the compensation part. I was emphasizing on the learning because the payout after that is huge, pretty huge I would say. 

5. Apart from all these things you are benefited on a personal level when you learn to manage your personal finance well or the art of investing.",Can get tough physically as well as mentally.
147,Futures First,Good company to work,2020-07-26,5.0,Derivatives Analyst,Huge potential to make a lot of money,Skills become obselete when you leave the company
148,Futures First,"It is an amazing opportunity, but not for everyone",2020-07-23,5.0,Assistant Vice President,"The ones that I like are these

1. Colleagues
Everyone here is smart, highly motivated and trying to be the best that they can be. Everyone will be solving challenges everyday individually as well as in groups.

2. Complete responsibility for decision making 
You will make your own decisions, every single time. You learn from them, you refine them and you take responsibility for improving them.

3. Unlimited earning potential based only on your performance
There is literally no limit to the amount of money that you can earn from this opportunity. And your earnings do not depend on how the company does, or anyone else does in any particular period.

4. No chance for politics
It is a flat organisation with transparent structure. There is no chance for politics at all.

5. Culture of Excellence
The culture of the company is designed to maximize the chances of everyone to succeed and to perform at their best","Why is it not for everyone?
1. High amount of Emotional Quotient is needed to handle the ups and downs in performance
2. There is an expectation of high performance from everyone. While this keeps the culture of the company strong for the right people, others will quickly fall out
3. There will be challenges- intellectually and emotionally- all the time. That limits the fit to only those people who are willing to take risk and solve challenges everyday"

2. Long working hours, 11-12 hours a day
3. Stressful job compared to normal standards
4. Statistically low chance of survival in the long run, just like any new business

Even though there is a less chance of survival, the learning more than compensates for that. Long and odd hours don't matter much if you grow to like and love the job, everyone here does. If you can't love the work you do even after say, 6-8 months, you probably won't survive. There is no middle ground."

282,Futures First,"A great, unique though risky experience in arguably the most dynamic industry!  (Freshers: always keep a BACKUP though)",2018-04-28,4.0,Market Analyst,"FF is the clearly the leading prop. trading firm in India. The managers are good and culture is fine (not great or much exciting though). Performance Bonus (read: your cut in your trimester's net profit) is great! (if you manage to achieve any, that is). 
Thrilling work, zero politics, zero corporate crap... Simply perform or perish!
Had a memorable one-of-a-kind experience while being part of the dynamic futures trading industry here. I'm now moving out of this domain, after nearly 2 years at Gurgaon branch.

I'll start by CLEARING SOME AIR about FF and Trading (my honest individual review)... since it saddens me to see that preconceived notions based on old times are still doing the rounds.

The review of FF firing employees indiscriminately is sadly omnipresent!!... But it is FALSE in today's times! Yes, attrition is high. But it's not exactly FF that fires you. (I'll explain)

Also, reviews of managers being rude and tyrannical aren't all true! (Currently, all Ggn managers are very amiable. Don't know precisely about the Hyd branch though; the one who's managers are infamous in reviews for strictness)
See... Every firm undergoes evolution and has it's phases. Maybe FF too had been (over-)strict with employees in the past and may've had different thought process but now it's a healthy corporate culture here.

As for high attrition... FF DOESN'T FIRE YOU; THE TRADING CAREER DOES!!
Trading is a very competitive, dynamic and demanding career where if you aren't going forward, you're simply going backward. There's no grey area where you can slog n survive. 
Markets (and not the firm) eventually weed you out if you don't have your basics very clear, or aren't a quick learner or aren't susceptible to rapid changes in markets. Rampant algos in almost all global markets have made them very mature, so margin of error has reduced significantly (esp. if you're a small-scale speculator, as risk:reward ratios are skewing)

Plus, I haven't seen anybody at FF Ggn being fired out of nowhere! Almost all exits are mutual. YOU ALWAYS KNOW that it isn't working out. You're the first one to know!! 
Mostly, the trader would've already given up and relying solely on hope if poor phase is prolonged. (sporty spirit doesn't let go!)

Rather, FF managers back you till as long as they see the spark in u and it's financially viable for the firm. Lot of guys of my batch (me included) who weren't thriving, were still being backed bcoz managers felt we had it in us and could turn the tide soon!
.
.
Though I'm not too experienced enough a trader, I'd like to give some tips from personal perspective :

** Firstly, read well about what trading in global markets is, before jumping in the domain seeing only the insane amount of money.

** Research about what %age of traders actually make that 8-digit money. You'll see how skewed the success ratio is.  They say it's <0.05  !!

** Consult how steep the turning-the-tide (a.k.a learning) curve usually is (esp. for your product).
If you're entering this career, don't think short term. You won't get easy or quick money. A no. of persistent years need to be invested.

** If you aren't ready for ^this, try exiting as soon as possible. Coz if you're unsure, you might get stuck in the hope loop n that's the worst part of this career - Not being able to quit. (just like in sports or Upsc!) 
You'll end up wasting precious career-building years or running out of options if you're very late in deciding.

** If you want to try out this job once in your lifetime, right out of bachelors college is best time for that, as you have minm. liabilities.
Gauge and decide in a couple of years, whether you see yourself making money in long run. But don't expect $1mn in just an internship or in a few months. That's foolish!

** In your initial years, ALWAYS have a BACKUP handy. Keep working at something else alongside trading in office.  As exit options are scarce.
Bcoz the moment you're out of this industry, you need good technical skills to enter anywhere else and trading knowledge is not one of them. (Not a relevant work ex for other careers)

So maybe you learn any tech industry skills (like coding) Or build financial knowledge (trading learning remains limited to your product if you don't have a deep fin interest) Or prep for higher edu, Or work on networking (most important corporate survival tool), etc.
But DO NOT remain in a STATE OF SLUMBER!! 
The risk:reward ratio of this career is high. You come here dazzled by the rewards. 
Be always prepared for the risk side too!","- A risky career! Plan it well, after discussing with apt people. And keep reviewing the plan every trimester.

- Exit options are scarce and not very good.
If you aren't doing great, do have a backup. Need not be a job. Can be any skill, courses, edu prep, etc. 
Just don't kill idle time (at home), merely hoping to succeed as a trader! Else you'll struggle badly after leaving.

- HRs definitely need to bring more vitality in the company's atmosphere lately.

- Zero salary growth if not thriving at trading. Your fixed salary might be same as your joining salary even in 3rd-4th yr. As the real earning in trading is solely performance bonus (your cut).

- Don't know why some managers are so fussy in approving leaves, despite ours not being a team job!! We literally had to bargain at times.

- Trading is after all a loner's job. There might be times when you're busy trading sitting alone, not having teammates for fun."

One always needs time to know if a piece of work is made for him/her. These 6 months made that very clear to me. In short the 6 month internship period is a great experience to add and also entering financial field after engineering is not any cake walk and requires commitment and time.

2.) Mentors are great and the more you ask, the more you get to learn from them.
The nature of job at futures first requires a lot of experience to succeed and make money. That is why it takes time to make money(oher than salary) here at the first place.

3.) I would say it is a one time shot where you try the markets and make money out of it but also few are able to do that since it is not easy with too many smart tools now a days.","1.) Work life balance for sure, but again the reward to risk ratio compensates that :p ( if you succeed)

2.) Probably personality development haults for the period you are in the company since that is not used anywhere but it definately teaches one to be patient and hardworking."

344,Futures First,Outrageous and arbitary,2017-04-30,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"You can earn anything, no performance politics","There are many cons
1) You have to convince yourself that you are not working in company rather than in a shop where you give every charge to shop in return you use the facilities.
2) Few loyal management people are there in this shop since inception and they have conviction that it's because of them an employee is able to eat 2 square a meal. They don't have a iota of professionalism. Starting from Chairman to Manager all do follow this conviction. But they forget that type of talent they hire are best at least they are not begging for food at your shop.
3.) They do play with employee career (Graduates as well of MBA's) they hire at different package in campus and when do they join in very less span of time rule changes for compensation. And Career prospective after this practices become very slim and gloomy, in terms of Career change or compensation side of future employer. 
4) There are different policies for diff. employee if one employee is not getting any special benefit then why special treatment. If performance is their criteria for this discrimination then why in 1st place they hire inexperienced employee.
5) They are winning because in India there are no competitor and people fight for money that's why they are able to get the talent.
6) In name of employee care they have nothing. And every time they give excuse that market will give you money and manage your problem with that money.
7) It is ridiculous when manager question your credibility in your product knowledge when he/she hasn't any sense in what's going in market? 
8) Managements invests a great time in innovating  firing practices in shop. If this time had been invested on getting best side of employee. Output could have been in bright side.
9) If one is coming in this firm with expectation of  no future outlook on career progression and compensation criteria and he/she is willing to go on scale 0 in these aspects then this is ideal job because if you will click lot of money if not you can travel in negative zone of your life.
10) Very subjective performance expectation from each employee. This expectation becomes clear only when you won't have any time to work on it."
