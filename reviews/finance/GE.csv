Mine has ranged from $300 to $1300.
100% uncapped Tuition reimbursement, but you have to sign a 4 year retention agreement.
Collectors are not able to opt for a part time schedule or a remote/flex schedule. Only flexibility would be to change to 8-5 to 7-4 or 9-6 schedule.

Additionally, the information across businesses seems to be lacking.

Nothing to brag about.","I was so excited to get an offer from GE. I should have done my Glassdoor homework. I received another offer at the same time.  Gosh how I wish I had accepted the other offer.  What a mistake I made in joining this company.
I thought the depressing, micromanaging, overrated, nepotistic environment was specific to my group, but now that I've been here for a few years, I see it's throughout the company.  It's a way of life, if you can call this living.
That just about describes it.  It's like a visit with Satan.

GE Capital does everything possible to put the customer in the term ""customer"" service. There is  a lot of room for advancement and management supports individual growth within the company. The more an employee gets involved with the company the greater the opportunities.
The company offers excellent benefits and provides an adequate balance for work and personal life.","The work is very demanding and to say that the company micro manages each employee doesn't even come close to the metrics that are reviewed by management. I believe in the end results required by the company, however,  I feel that the customer service team is under compensated for the effort and responsibility delegated."

1158,,I needed a job and ended up with a career.,2014-06-17,4.0,Workforce Planning Specialist,"Because it is a big company, there are a lot of opportunities for lateral and upward career paths.  The culture is one of integrity and honesty.  Not only was the pay more than adequate, but working full time meant I had excellent benefits starting on day one.  Additionally, GE Money encouraged professional and personal development and offering many opportunities along those lines.  GE Money also offered opportunities to help in the community.  There were also activities not related to work for those who wanted to engage in fun.  Creativity and forward thinking were always encouraged and welcomed.","Because it is a big company, there were times when some decisions were made up the chain of command with no real awareness of the effects those decisions would have down in the trenches.  Also, there were some pockets of ""good ole boy"" mentality where popularity won out over professional qualifications.  When dealing with a large number of people, there is bound to be personality conflict or competition and sometimes these things got in the way of good business.  Also, in the small office I worked in, the scheduling for associates was difficult and not employee or family friendly."
1159,,Slippery Slope,2014-06-17,3.0,Anonymous Employee,"Empowerment, flexible hours, excellent corporate culture and values, great training if you can get on it.",The leaner we get there are less people there are to do the work and there is no prioritisation and nothing gets stopped. The organisational design has been compromised and is inefficient due to continued piecemeal restructures that managers have been encouraged to make without sufficient strategic review to ensure the changes align across the organisation and that there are still career paths for employees.
1160,,Work at Home Client Services,2014-06-12,4.0,,"Flexible schedule, no commute, yearly salary increases","pay for my own phone and internet, no benefits, feelings of isolation from the company because there is not much contact with other employees, no opportunity to work full time from home."
1161,,Good company well positioned for a positive change,2014-06-12,4.0,Senior Financial Analyst,"A company with a great work culture of openness, integrity and collaboration. The relatively new drive for simplification acknowledges that the company has become overburdened with processes and needs to become leaner, so hopefully that will bring a positive change.","The processes are often very bureaucratic and there have been a multiplication of them after the crises to ensure everyone reviews and approves everything, so the employees don't feel much empowered to do what they're supposed to be doing without 20 people looking at it.

Very powerful HR function that can help or hinder progress of employees. If you're lucky to have a good HR leader capable of recognizing and developing talent, then try growing in the company. Otherwise, don't waste more time than necessary to master your role and certainly don't try breaching the wall of ignorance and lack of helpfulness - it just is not worth it."
1162,,GE Capital,2014-06-11,4.0,Sales,"Brand recognition, good benefits, company vehicle, work life balance","Compensation plans could be more attractive, permission to apply for role should be based on talent & skill set not tenure (24 month min). Late adapter to sales models & software."

They are need of experienced individuals to help grow the company.  Many opportunities in the next year.  Perks are average.,Many pockets of poor leadership and lack of accountability by senior leaders.  Blame is pushed down to lower management.  Company advertises a work-life balance however the reality is there is little time for anything but work. Lack of organizational structure continues to create chaos within the organization. Very little detailed policy and procedures.  Pay and benefits very average.
1166,,Professional and process driven company,2014-05-30,4.0,Anonymous Employee,"GE has processes for everything and all is written down and tracked. From career development to job action items, everything has a process and flow to getting it done and done in the allowed time.","While they track everything and are process driven, this also causes problems because not all problems can be solved in a cookie cutter way. Deviating from the play book is difficult and time consuming because of the bureaucracy and lack of ability and authority to deviate from the playbook"

1168,,Unrealistic Expectations,2014-05-25,1.0,Banking Advisor/Representative,Nice co-workers; good perks and eventual chances for advancement (I think),"After two weeks of classroom lectures with overheads, we were put on the phones, taking calls.  Some scripting, but federal regs and company policies require certain words be used or not used and in a specific order.. The department records all the calls so they can check them regularly, however, the callers are often hard to hear and understand due to heavy accents. They tell you that this is the week to make mistakes, but if you do, you're history. One warning and the next day, one mistake and you're gone. You might work with people who've been on the job for a few weeks longer than you, however, each person tells you something different.  Even the people assigned to help on the floor give different answers.  You are told to ask for help, but that slows things down. If you don't take enough calls during your shift, you are told that this is unacceptable.  There is no training with mock calls, which would have been the biggest help.  It takes time to get into a rhythm, especially if your background is not in a call center. A little more help and a lot less stress from the manager and I could have become what they were looking for.  Instead, they wasted three awful weeks of my time and theirs.  It seems a pretty inefficient way to run a company.  I wonder if the big bosses out east know what is going on.  UNLESS you have extensive call center phone experience, avoid this one."

Quality Training when first join the organisation and also during my  tenure of 4 years with the company.,Very political culture especially from senior management.  If you were not a favourite then there was no chance of career advancement. High staff turn over of team leaders which unfortunately installed poor staff moral.

Management is understanding of personal committments and the fact that sometimes there are somethings that can only occur in parellel to your working hours.
-Veteran GEAM employees that have nothing to prove create a good work environment and are extremely friendly and helpful, but hires from other GE businesses are a totally different animal.
-Opportunities for people to move into non-investment focused careers in other GE businesses but difficult for employees to establish a career in finance at GEAM.
-Employee engagement via lunch and learns, happy hours, team building events, community service, etc. is common and promotes open communication within the workplace.","-Extremely sub-par compensation with marginal annual raises, regardless of personal performance, and no bonuses
-Senior management claims they are not shrinking the business but as revenue generating 3rd party business leaves, it is not being replaced and the simplification push is making the 3rd party client experience worse not better.
-As positions in the Services and Technology team are vacated at an alarmingly fast rate, the openings are not being filled causing increased workloads for the remaining employees all while management touts salary budget surpluses.
-With the past few years attrition, employees under the age of 30 are virtually non-existent with the exception of FMP's, who change locations every 6 months  It seems as if management is more vested in personal performance than they are in helping direct reports advance in career opportunities with GEAM.
-GE's culture is great in some instances but at GEAM, it has led to employees coming from non-investment based GE companies and being given positions/responsibilities that they do not possess the competency for. As a result, these managers are left clueless about how their employees do their jobs and the scope and timing of projects they request from them."

""advancement opportunities"" which you are unable to apply for without manager approval and they don't want new people in their pods so won't recommend you if you are a good worker who meets metrics.  If it snows in Kansas they still expect you to make it in, blizzard or not, and mark it against you that you're not willing to risk your life for $10/hr. They also train on systems they claim you will use which consistently go down which forces you to go to their older non-Windows system which they give you maybe 30 minutes of training for and which requires knowing exact codes to use leaving you helpless.

Ridiculous levels of bureaucracy for the simplest of requests.  Long timers with bad attitudes just coast through the work day. They're not held accountable and usually pass the blame for their mistakes.  And the most curious trait among the managers is really poor business etiquette (always late for meetings or they just don't come to the meeting, no appreciation for time limits, invasion of personal ""cube"" space, talking to you while you're on the phone) and the list goes on.

The system works most of the time to promote those who excel and remove those who are only taking.,"The company will manage to take up the most time of you as it can. It is a highly competitive environment ans, as such, you have to constantly give more to really feel you are doing well. having a laptop to take good for home-office is sometimes not such a good idea if you do not learn to disconnect.

Excellent reputation (prospects will usually take your call). GE is so diverse in terms of markets and businesses, you can diversify your career into GE industrial/technology divisions.",GE announced that it is reducing its reliance on financial services so GE Capital is shrinking.

The consequence is that they will stab you in the back at every turn. This place puts corporate politics ahead of creativity and imagination.

You find a lot of employees take pride to be part of the corporation. For employees, it's truly a  meritocracy.  If you are willing to work hard, no reason why you won't succeed. Talent recognition and promotion is an inherent part of the company's staffing and growth strategy.","IF you are new to the company and are hired as a lateral, you definitely will need to get up to speed on the terms and company culture.

2.

Very difficult for outsiders to come in and make a difference. They have 'GE ways' to do everything and you are expected to follow the trend. Managers frequently say things like 'Dude, this is GE and this is how we do it'.

Even if you have decades of experience in the outside world, you are treated like a newcomer and have to 'prove yourself' for training, people management roles, leadership programs etc. In today's fast paced/growth atmosphere, no one has 2-3 years' time to 'prove' and then wait for professional growth. 

GE only thrives on 'contacts' so join the company only if you know people in senior management positions."

The hours were long 9-8 most days. During planning sessions 9-11 is common, I have regular stayed beyond that with the company paying for a taxi home (nice of them).
The interns are worked really really really hard.  The FMP's love to be worked hard.  The CAS guys are moved around the globe working unimaginable hours (at least they had the benefit of being able to expense everything). The managers with all the hatred they have built up over the years for giving up their lives love to work everyone else very very hard and the Execs know the business inside out and will have generally been there since they graduated from school.  One exec I knew moved over from the US and stayed in the office every day until midnight.  This is a company of sacrifices and rewards only those that show extreme determination and submission to the company's will.

One strange thing I was aware of is that everyone seemed to have been there for a very long time.  If you look at anyone’s online profile most had a picture there which was of a much younger, slimmer version of themselves. This indicated that most were either very happy with the company or after going through the intern > FMP > CAS route found themselves trapped.  Leaving was not an option for the faint hearted as this would probably mean a significant drop in salary.

I had most of my work experience in various other companies and cannot say that I have ever experienced anything like this.

For the most part the employees, coworkers are professional, equally driven, intelligent, positive minded and ethical people, which is fulfilling. I developed some very good professional relationships with talented people.","Change is good, but it can also become overly demanding to maintain quality in regular job responsibilities while continually taking on new ones in order to facilitate that change. And since the attitude is to try and do as much as possible for as little as possible (meaning not enough resources) people get burned out."

Training that was provided was semi adequate, but most was left to OTJ.","Pay is poor, opportunities very limited, promotions are selected totally ignoring any outside experience.

This allows you to measure your accomplishments.,Over worked with lack of recognition. The goals and objects set at the beginning of year should make it easy for management to complete their part of the annual performace review process.

The company even supports this for employees who are at least satisfactory in their performance. Even with periodic layoffs and constant tinkering with organizational structure, GE has the size and finances to provide stable and long-term employment to workers who have average to above average skills and deep perseverance. If the place is not always fair it is not too unfair either. It probably stacks up favorably to more companies than not.","Conformist environment with a weak HR that is more of a mouthpiece of the senior management. Measurement of excellence is not matrixed - contrary to the internal belief. If your style appeals to a senior leader he/she could 'pick' you for bigger jobs. Conversely, no matter how good you are, if you 'do not part hair on the correct side' you would not get any where - the environment encourages quick and constant judgement of people. It is difficult to have a sense of job security with businesses being bought and sold."
