4,,Good Place to work,2022-04-10,5.0,Business Analyst,Low talent density company but they take really good care of you. If you work hard an innovate they promote you. If you just do the bare requirements you will still go up just a little slower. The benefits are really good and the work life balance is unmatched when compared to other large companies.,It's a slow moving company with a lot of moving parts. It takes a lot of time to do anything at the company. Low talent density. The company is moving in the right direction but there are a lot of people that are stuck.
5,,"Decent workload, unfair upper management",2022-04-05,3.0,Funder,"Honestly, the hours and salary were OK. The job itself is pretty easy and if you get into a rhythm you can finish your tasks pretty quickly.",Upper management is unfair. You have to know somebody if you want to move up.

14,,One of the best teams I've ever worked on,2022-02-28,5.0,Data Quality Analyst,"The team focus is cooperative vs competitive within the team and within the company as a whole which is HUGE for me. I think makes us more competitive on the whole like a beehive or an ant pile. One ant or one bee isn't much, but together with his team/hive/colony he can do some amazing things. I'm still new, but also love the new drive for analytics within the company that I've seen so far. If the company wasn't driven toward analytics I could never be happy here. I am VERY happy I accepted this position though. The management is kind, caring, and makes sure I'm happy rather than constantly whip cracking. They invested lots of time in my education of the company structure too, so I'd understand where my puzzle piece fits in.",Nothing to report just yet.

A lot of good ideas are passed up just because ""it's always been done this way"" which is discouraging and frustrating.
In the past year, nearly half of all analysts left, with most not backfilled. 
Very limited growth potential within the department, but it's a big company with plenty of other opportunities, just not easy to move up.
I thought the pay and work environment were great until I left! I realize now how grueling it was. I left for the sole reason that I wanted to stay working remote and they would not allow it. I ended up with a significant raise and way less stress! (In addition to working from home permanently)"

199,,Great First Office Job,2020-07-01,5.0,Support Clerk,You are in a fast pace environment and learn a lot.,Some T/L's are not fit to be in leadership positions.
200,,Current IT Transformation,2020-06-14,4.0,QA Analyst,"Close knit, family type environment.  Very diverse workplace in IT - proud to be amongst people of various backgrounds, ethnicities, cultures.  It’s not just one demographic or gender that dominates teams in IT.  Great work life balance - most management is flexible and accommodating for personal and family matters.  Even before COVID, some teams even supported work from home schedules.  Benefits and time off (floating, personal, sick, vacation) days are excellent.  

A lot of office perks for Arlington locations - fun, social environment, work events, raffles, free coffee, ample parking, etc.

IT is going through a major transformation - QA in particular.  Culture change agent VP came in a few years ago to shake up the organization to move it forward with the industry and move the team from manual to a more technical automation test team (SDET roles).  Ongoing initiatives have been put in place to upgrade or “modernize” archaic financial software.  

My observation is that there is a minority of people who are actually on board and share this vision, so it’s a plus if you like change, learning new things, challenging yourself, keeping your technical skill sets sharp, relevant, and up to date  and are forward thinking.  It’s a great place to utilize and hone in on  a lot of the industry standard technology and practices out there today.  

IT in general has a lot of great talent.  You’ll work with a lot of sharp, knowledgeable, and smart teammates.","Pay is below market rate.  I accepted a pay cut when I joined.  IT lost a lot of people due to this same issue.  Management will retain a lot of good people if they pay them equitably.  401k and bonuses are ok but could be improved.  

Not a lot of people are on board with the IT transformation, particularly in QA.  I think it’s because it’s the deep rooted culture that’s been ingrained in a lot of the long term employees.  It’s old school mentality and systems thinking.  Most have been complacent and comfortable over the years - you can see it in the non technical management and staff who still haven’t invested time in improving their technical skills, even though the VP’s and up have been giving the team a few years to get up to speed.  This “systems thinking” prevails - people want to be spoon fed, they want templates and processes, they are not used to having to learn new technologies or doing things differently.  When I joined, I got the feeling that most team members were there to just earn a paycheck, stay with GMF until they retire, and do exactly the same job they started out doing years ago.

This resistance to change will prove challenging for IT to move forward.  IT and QA have  already lost a lot of people who either jumped shipped because they didn’t want to move forward or were unhappy with the way change is being done.   

COVID didn’t help matters any so a lay-off was inevitable.  Not the most stable place to be at at the moment.

Lastly, there is a lot of cronyism and favoritism. - office politics are everywhere.  There are a few bad apples in every bunch, but these apples are able to get away with so much - I’m talking flagrant HR violations - just  because of who they know."

All QA staff are being forced to transition into Software Development Engineers or find another job. Threatening employees with dismissal if they don't progress to SDE more quickly. 

Manager was great for a few years but now acts exclusively in self-preservation to avoid being phased out as a non-technical employee. Management at all levels is ""just doing as they are told"".

288,,An absolutely soul-crushing endeavor.,2018-08-02,1.0,Anonymous Employee,Break rooms were nice. Employees are generally really good and collegial .,"Nearly everything else. I've never experienced such a culture where executives are favored so disproportionately over employees. The training of new/young executives is subpar at best, however, they do seem to have a level of indoctrination that is admirable.  The pressures of the department I was in were insane, making the job extremely undervalued and the pay insufficient.  When hired, 40 hours were indicated as the requirement, but the reality was that they wanted you working non-stop, taking work home with you, working on the weekends, and dedicating your life to the company - with no clear-cut goals or benchmarks.  The AVP and SVP worked around the clock and anything short of that effort by employees was frowned upon.  Entry level supervisors were working 12+ hours, just to keep up.

Pay is based on 40 hours, and you often work 60+ just to keep up because they aren't properly staffed.  If you fall behind, the wick gets turned up, and leadership increases the pressure.  In my case, there were constant sniping comments, pointed and aggressive statements made regarding my age, and increased demands against nebulous goals that all worked together to create a hostile work environment.  

I left because I was being targeted. My resignation resulted in my AVP contacting friends of mine to inform them what a piece of garbage I was, and going as far as blaming his personal issues on my resignation. The AVP was extremely moody, aggressive, controlling, and un-compassionate. If you like walking on eggshells, then this is a great environment for you.

Beyond that, the promises made in my interview(s) about potential career trajectory were way off base.  I took a lower position than I should have to get my foot in the door, only to realize what a mistake that was, and that 18-24 months to return to an executive position was more like 6+ years.  Attempting to transfer out of my department was also frowned upon, and often met with serious resistance.  Thus, stepping out of the company was the path of least resistance versus disappointing the powers that be. 

The benefits are also mediocre and a bit hazy.  Expect to spend over 10% of your income on premiums and out of pocket expenses.  Or better yet, just go to another company that values their employees."

Also the snack bar selections are sooo good it's going to bankrupt me.","Everything was great before they did this ""system upgrade."" I have had customers scream and curse at me and some of them have a right to do so. Many accounts were impacted negatively by the upgrade and most customers just want to resolve their account. They still have not fixed issues online and most customers can't even make a payment online without something happening. Not to mention that our system is down for extended periods of time. They keep saying that IT is working on fixing all the issues but every time they fix something, something goes wrong. Most of the time I cannot even do my job like I want to because the system is running slow, is not responding or is malfunctioning. Every day another customer threatens to sue us because we can't seem to get the system up and running. 

Be prepared to suck up to management to move up. I refuse to apply to positions because you don't earn a promotion based on experience you earn it based on who you know. There are plenty of people I know who have applied to positions but someone else is picked because of the fact they kissed up to someone.
On numerous occasions I need assistance from a supervisor but it seems like they are always in meetings or nowhere to be found. I've had to walk across the floor just to get a supervisor to help me with an account.
I love helping people and want the best for them, but I often encounter rude reps from other departments. I am always nice towards them. And when I mention the rudeness of other reps, they sweep it under the rug like nothing is wrong.

313,,Stay away from GM Financial; Worst Company Ever!,2018-02-05,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"There are very few. Downtown Detroit is very much “in” nowadays and you get free parking. Also, there are some amazing and talented people working there.

Highly recommended for people who enjoy being bullied to a point when they start questioning their own self-worth.","By far, this has been the worst company I have ever worked for.

The name GM Financial indicates the company is global and sophisticated but behind the GM façade is a very small-minded, petty, bullying-type mentality which you start experiencing from the 1st day.

The management overall is very poor. Upper management are racists, homophobes and misogynists. The culture of fear instilled in GMF is almost unreal and HR are not only supporters but sometimes the instigators. 

The open door policy applies only if you have something nice to say, praise the leadership or tell them what they want to hear (being a snitch and a brownnoser is very well perceived and rewarded). If you speak up when you see something is not right, or you question a leader´s opinion (or god forbid, their decision), they will retaliate, guaranteed.

Micromanagement is part of their DNA; if you do a great job, your boss will likely take the credit but if you make a mistake, you are blamed for everything and you become a scapegoat. If you try to defend yourself, you will be intimidated until you admit your fault.

Communication is also a major problem, there is a lot of gossiping, employees finding out about decisions through the grapevine, departments and their leaders don’t talk to each other. There is a big power struggle at the top; upper management visibility don’t like each other, they compete (and play dirty!) and manipulate their teams against each other any chance they get.

There is almost no training provided by the company unless you find it yourself and even then you have to almost beg for GMF to pay for it. 
The benefits are very mediocre and you cannot work from home even if you have an emergency. 
All of this leads to very high turnover (employees either quitting or getting fired) so people fear for their jobs daily. This is a very toxic environment to work for.  

The list goes on and on. Your emotional and physical health will suffer by working at this horrible company. Avoid at all cost!"

318,,GM Financial should be in the top worst places to work.,2018-01-04,1.0,CxO,There are no pros to working at GM Financial.,There are more cons then one can list and you'll find that in the essay below.
319,,Sr. Credit Analyst - Colorado,2018-01-04,1.0,Senior Credit Analyst,I cannot think of any pros about working for this company. Very tough on their employees. Not worth the pay,"No work life balance, terrible management team at Colorado location, high turnover rate, unrealistic goals. On the phone all the time as well"
320,,No Way Out,2018-01-03,2.0,Funding,"There are nice people that work here and to be on a good team with ppl that mesh well together makes working here easier despite the pay, new bonus structure, department merging and upper management look overs.",This company reminds me of the Army. They seem to try to break you down to build you up by telling you “NO” when trying to advance your career.  Many timesaver person or almost ALL that go to further their careers are told NO then finally you get a yes depending on how you reacted to being told NO. Career advancement is not based off your resume or what you have accomplished only how upper management feels about you.
321,,Bilingual Collection's,2017-12-27,1.0,Collections Specialist,Part of the benefits are okay I guess? The team members are frendly for the most part.,"First got hired on to GM Financial I was very excited  I have always wanted to work for this company  but when I actually got in  it was very disappointing the health benefits are horrible and if you're thinking about progressing in the company you can forget about that the supervisor makes it very difficult they find any little thing to discourage or punsh you for even trying, the pay is also horrible, I have never met a more successful call center with such little pay, the raise you receive at mid-year review could be a heck of alot better and the year review could also be way better. It's all about the connections you have and the people you befriend it's the only thing that gets you anywhere around here so be prepared. The position itself has a lot of work you're not only dealing with collections but several other departments in one and they don't even accept doctor's notes if you don't have the time off you get penalized for it even if it includes your child being very ill and you having to leave work."

Great vacation time and good benefits.,"Not very innovative when it comes to technology implementation.  The company did not like to challenge the status quo.

The site is just beautiful on its own, the work is easy do its providing ""Customer Service"" to accounts in collections for both portfolios Lease and Retail and within the next few months more departments are opening with more positions and opportunities for those who make the cut!","You have to be in more honest terms a kiss up and someone who is bubbly and all talk, apparently smarts and being good at your job, being on time/here don't matter to management. Heads up for your first day or week, become buddy-buddy with management this is the only way opportunities will be afforded to you.

Once you are buddy-buddy with management everything is up for grabs here. You will soon have the opportunity to get up and walk around when ever you want (mind our job is to be on the ""phone"") as long as you show that you are at communicating with others (mind our job is to be on the ""phone"" ) such as your peers, leaders, and higher ups."
331,,Uphill Battle,2017-10-08,3.0,Customer Experience Operations,"Unique approach to call-center work; Diverse Atmosphere; Frequent Attempts to ""spice things up""; Awesome co-workers; Really nice work building",GMF is slowly turning into one of those micro-managing companies that base a worker's value purely off of statistics.

Horrible hostile environment with no room to grow unless your kissing but or being an informant of whats going on the production floor. P.S if you want to get promoted tell EVERYTHING THAT SEE OR HEAR!"
333,,Commercial Account Manager II,2017-10-03,5.0,Commercial Account Manager II,Good work environment with friendly co-workers and a good work / family life compromise in my department,The company is growing rapidly with increasing amount of floorplan dealers coming to onboard which has created a large number of accounts per account manager which can increase stress and challange individuals to prioritize tasks at a very rapid pace.
334,,Do not recommend,2017-10-03,1.0,Credit Analyst,Covered parking.  That is about it.,"I worked in the Denver Credit Center.  Management was terrible.  Comfortable, lazy, and unwilling to do anything more than what is required.  You can't have an opinion there or you will be blacklisted.  If you can be a robot to go along to get along, you will be fine.  Oh, and you help car dealerships rip people off as much as they can."

Company vehicle is a plus besides having to pay for it",Too political. Never the same message throughout the company. Having to pay for a company vehicle isn't the best while pay plans change yearly
338,,Please read before applying,2017-09-11,2.0,Account Representative III,Very nice break room and nice building.,Very low wages & micromanage at its finest. No room for advancement.
339,,Great company but lots of politics.,2017-09-08,3.0,Senior Organizational Design and Development Consultant,Lots of opportunities for growth.,They micro manage to the point that you feel like a robot waiting for the next command.
340,,Cautionary Tale,2017-09-07,1.0,Collections Representative,There are not many pros to working at this company.,"Micromanagement - be prepared to have every bathroom break, cup of coffee, etc deducted from your 30 minutes of break per shift. Expect to be chained to your desk and monitored - every note you enter in an account and how many minutes you spend not on the phone are tracked. Yes, it is a call center but the micromanagement is insane. We are all adults and should be treated as such unless certain people exploit that trust.

Working until 8 p.m. 2x a week and one Saturday a month is not as great of a work-life balance as they tout. Saturdays are difficult as they toss you into accounts you aren’t trained to handle but need representatives to manage & the late nights are not ideal for anyone with a family or evening responsibilities. 

Sick time – they deceive and manipulate you into taking PTO over accrued sick time. Since they aren’t required to pay out sick time, but do PTO/ vacation, they force you to falsify time off so they can approve it as PTO/ vacation. Be prepared to fight tooth and nail to use the sick time YOU accrued instead of being bullied into vacation time.

Advancement & turnover – literally no opportunity for advancement. There are so many lateral transfers disguised as opportunity yet you can still see people with the company for ten years or more in the same role they began in. The only opportunity for advancement involves another member quitting or being fired, which isn’t an ideal situation given no one is promoted past a Team Lead, which is one step above entry level. College degrees & performance don’t matter here. There is an incredibly high turnover rate within the company which is not surprising since they hire over 20 people in a single hiring class. Only a handful of my original class members remained after one year. New hire classes are held once a month for six months or more in a row & the recruiter will lie to you about hourly rate & bonus options. Everyone in my hiring class was misled and in for a rude awakening during actual GM training. 

Compensation – expect floor bonuses nowhere near what recruiters promise, nor will it be reflective of the work and tasks you perform. Pay raises are no more than 30 cents per year, so it will honestly take you  over three years to receive a single dollar raise. 

Actual job – anticipate to fill a repetitive role where you are not valued and considered a replaceable butt in a seat. Regardless of performance, you are not a person who matters to this company in the long run and will be treated as such. As long as you do the bare minimum, you will get by in this role – which is incredibly frustrating to those who work hard. These low performers fly under the radar until management is sick of them. Realize that you will not advance in this company unless someone else is so fed up they quit or are fired, which speaks volumes to their culture. Also understand that you will be prodded and forced by your supervisors to ask personal and intrusive questions to customers that are truly none of your business nor applicable to your role. We don’t need a breakdown of where a person’s alimony, customer service, or how much of their partners will they are receiving. 


Don't be fooled by the false positive reviews that rave this is the best company to work for, best job you can ever have, etc. I also read them before working here and found them incredibly unreliable and false.

If none of these cons affect you, then proceed. If these concerns are questionable to you as an employee, then proceed with caution or hold out until you’re offered better employment. These are the daily expectations of your roll and expected to be met. Your only hope is to have a great Team Lead, but you will only be with them for a short time."

352,,Customer Service,2017-05-21,3.0,Customer Service Representative,"Private training environments and new facilities allow for a fast paced but intimate learning environment. The skills the company constructs to train and assist you once you're on the floor are vital to meeting company stats that are qualified. Once you successfully reach your stats you are exposed to the possibilities of raises, promotions, and company wide recognition.","The inconsistency of hours. Once you leave your training environment your schedule is no longer consistent, you become a filler basically for full time employees that have requested time off. If there is a short of time off to fill you do not get hours."

354,,"Big name, small company mindset",2017-04-20,2.0,Communication Specialist,"Initially, the fact you're working for the financing arm of one of the largest automakers of the world is incredible. The lights are bright, the cubicles are clean and there are GM brand logos everywhere. You feel like you're a big shot. You are also paid your worth. That's a huge pro. As long as GM is doing well, you can expect to have a job.","Sure, there may be a lot of diversity in the call centers but on the corporate side, there's very little. Ironic because the diversity percentage is dramatically touted. If you're a POC, expect to be either the only one or one of a couple on your team. Also, the company has been growing rapidly but the culture hasn't been able to keep up. The morale is extremely low. Working here is similar to having a crack addiction - everyone wants to leave but the money, the high of it, is the only thing keeping them here. Your talent is welcome during your interview but when you actually start working, you're expected to maintain the status quo. Some of the leadership describes themselves as hands off but in reality, they know nothing about what's going on. You'll also run across managers and VPs who don't care anything about butts in seats. In addition, some of the leadership believes in a work life but definitely not a work-life balance. You might find that there are different rules for specialists and managers. For example, the managers and leadership team are allowed to work from home (some do it at least once a week) but if you're a specialist, don't you dare think about uttering the words work from home. You're constantly told to worry about yourself and not others. You're expected to do your work and shut up. Saying anything but what others expect you to say will have you labeled as too ""aggressive"" or ""over emotional."" The earlier review that the company is a good ol boy's club and employees being judged based on charisma rather than performance is true. Women certainly aren't valued here. Lastly, HR doesn't care about any of your complaints. They're there to protect the company, not the employees."

Good perk with getting GM branded vehicles at a discount.

Company has been growing at an exponential rate. Has issues understanding that the old methods of work will not grow with the firm. There are still entrenched weak ideas that need to change to continue to be successful.","Onboarding process was weak and disorganized.  More shepherding of the process is needed.  Certain documentation needs to be expedited in the first 30 days or there is a potential loss of benefit.  Processes are unclear.

Very cliquish...if you are one of the 'blessed' individuals, you can do no wrong even if the ideas are terrible and end up laying a giant egg.

In the department where I worked, virtually zero...they espouse 'empowerment' and do the exact opposite.

Has had several recent health incidents during renovation of workspaces where there has been significant exposure to hazardous chemicals. Ignorance is no defense. MSDSs were not provided readily. HR does not understand their role in these incidents and corporate security was not readily available. They need an industrial hygienist on staff."

I was let go for something extremely petty however my Co-partners have been doing much worse. Being one of them sheds some truths to these reviews. The back stabbing, lying & sleeping with your staff it's all been true. HR needs to tighten up on there non-fraternization policy. It's not fair to fire some managers & praise others just because they come to you. What about the failed relationships with the employees who still work in the Department.

407,,Awful experience.. Cannot be Saved from ultimate Failure!,2016-04-29,2.0,Senior Business Systems Analyst,"Laid back
No timeline or deadlines
Moving target on any Project
No accountability
Leave work at 5:00 PM","Actually this company is Americredit that was rebranded as GM Financial after bankruptcy. Since then due to influx of budget (tax payer money), there has been over hiring at higher pay to employees. However, there is flaws in every step of the way. Firstly the onboarding process is horrible (its backwards). You get to sit in orientation after a month. 
Every department is inconsistent. However mostly the culture is geared towards micromanagement. There are many executives from the Americredit days leading to resistance of change in the ways things are done. The workstyle is very traditional and siloed. No collaboration between team members is encouraged. You will see people coming to work, sitting in their cubes and leaving home at 5:00 as there is no real work. Overhiring and more managers lead to situations where favoritism come in play. There is lack of leadership in the executive level as managers or some toxic employees can do whatever they want. HR is non existent. There is no control in terms of professionalism. Power play seen at many levels. Basically a very flawed system. Senior leaders take poor decisions and cannot discipline troubled people. You will be in trouble if you speak up against all the injustice.

Also lot of harassment and bullying is prevalent. Some woman managers and executives have created groups and target individuals. Managers hire their own people and create their own little empires. Very fraudulent and broken environment. Employee morale is very low. You cannot really learn anything or grow here. You will forget your skills. 

It cannot be saved from ultimate demise!"

On the contrary, I've seen a caring management group, that want the engineers to succeed.  Of course, it's not perfect, but considering the volume of work we do, and the rapid growth we have undergone, the teams operate with remarkable effectiveness, and management is solid.

It is so disheartening to watch good people with managers title fight for what is right not only for the company but for their teams and watch them be blown off by the AVPs because it doesn't meet their personal agenda and political aspirations within the company. Then they turn around and steal those people ideas and move themselves up ignoring who did the leg work, no recognition of any kind.

Managers parade around the office with fake niceness, then stay holed up in their offices all day. They say they are there to support the staff, but at the end of the day, they have done nothing to help get through the job but criticize and belittle you.

479,,If you want to settle in a position this is the place.,2014-05-28,5.0,Windows Systems Engineer,"Atmosphere is generally laid back, but not overly. Managers and upper management understand that things happen and allow for work from home at last minute. Plenty of room and opportunities for improvement professionally and for advancement in the company.","Not all managers are up to par. Some are far better then others, while there are a couple who have never been in a management position before and get walked all over. Some of the ""incentives"" are a little insulting.  Your bonus is not just tied to your performance but the performance of your co-workers as well."

Very easy work, once you get past the initial shock of talking to customers it is a breeze.
 
No dress code: can wear jeans/shorts whatever your heart desires.","The company seems to care more about the public opinion and their charity work more than their actual employees. They spend months planning March of Dimes benefits and other charitable things, which dont get me wrong they are for a great cause, but when it comes to planning something for their employees I hope a gold star and a pat on the back is what you were looking for.

No dress code: although it is listed as a pro it can be both. Some employees seem to take it too far and it makes it hard to be professional.

Team Leaders are on their high horse all day, when in reality they do not do much. They all seem to wander around all day and make small talk with the other team leaders and other management personnel in the building. When asked to take a call a lot of then tend to pass you off to another claiming they are busy.

High school mentality: Clicks and managers tend to just let things happen because there is no real fear of repercussions.

When I started there I was told that there were opportunities for advancement........ This is clearly untrue. They give you a light at the end of the tunnel and many stay for that reason. 

Only center wide bonus is awarded: There is no team or individual bonus, only center wide bonus. You see people and their numbers on a daily basis and no matter how much harder you work than them you receive the same money at the end of the quarter. It is very hard to see people not work for months at a time, make the same bonus as you, and are still somehow employed."
