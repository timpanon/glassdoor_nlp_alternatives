4,,Good place for Engineers; other roles may not be in the scheme of things,2022-04-15,3.0,Product Manager,"1. Generally excellent peers/ Engineers
2. Interesting problems
3. Respectful and generally consensus driven within a peer group
4. Decent pay - when you include bonus
5. May be useful to have Goldman Sachs in your resume; as the hiring process is thorough","1. Distributed teams from West coast of US to Australia means you work long hours - that is manageable, but with no laptops and emphasis on working from office - it becomes tiring. 
2. Lack of autonomy; no decision can be taken locally in practice, leads to long calls for budgets, hiring, policies, work decisions and everything. Can get suffocating.
3. Work tends to become more project management than product management.
4. Heavy Engineering centric culture is good.. but Product Managers have little scope for a sustained career path and will face stunted learning due to constraints in the role (refer below)
5. Unlike smaller companies, access issues will prevent Product managers to be close to code or UX etc... so on the job learning gets stunted. Difficult to flow on the job... and when prolonged may hurt your ability to move (remember bonus can be 0 if you don't add value)"

191,,A Boomer's Business,2022-03-19,2.0,Financial Analyst,"- Network- You will learn how to converse with people in a work place setting, show face and ""network"". If you don't learn how to do these things it will take you forever to get promoted. It's a good skill to have and will serve you well in your career. 
- Impact - The work you are doing does matter. Even small things, if they go wrong, will have a big impact. Attention to detail is important.
- Learning - Great opportunity to learn about the Financial world. Everything you have to learn at first may seem overwhelming but it is worth it.
- People - Willing to help you out or answer any questions at anytime. Just be honest about needing help with something so no errors happen. At Goldman, it always better to ask for help than make a mistake 
- Time Management - Just a lot of things to do everyday. Time Management is a must for success and a good skill to have.
- Office - The have free food here, free gym and it's a hybrid model right now
- Resume Builder - probably the best thing about this company","Compensation - Unless you work in Investment Banking, the pay at this company is embarrassingly low. You will also have to work 60 hour weeks and get paid half your hourly rate for overtime. If you work out of college, just know that you could be earning more at any other job you apply to, even Dominos. The dedication needed for this job is not worth the pay out. It is obvious this company sees younger employees as interchangeable, so its hard to not see them the same. 
Limited Growth - After 1-2 years on desk you will have learned most of your job. Roles are very niche. If you have any other skills you want to develop, your role will limit you. 
Bonus/Salary Increase - While based on performance is fine, scandals impact your bonus a TON. 
Prestige - Working at this company gets to peoples' heads. 
Button Pushing
Promotions - Take forever. Have to show face and do the most to be up for a promotion. I heard someone say to stand out you should be coming in an hour earlier. Seems to be an outdated mindset.

Hours - Work life Balance is difficult"

284,,Great growth opportunity for recent engineering graduate,2022-03-07,3.0,Senior Software Engineer,"- TL;DR: Recent engineering grads will amass more technical knowledge in their first 2 years working here than they likely will at most other engineering companies.

As a recent engineering graduate, you will learn a lot (and fast) due to the fact that most engineering teams tend to be small, comprised of generalists, but deliver a ton of work. This translates to recent grads working across the stack on whatever team they are on and becoming reasonably competent devops/data/backend/front-end engineers.

- The analyst program is great. Especially for new-joiners relocating from outside New York as it gives them an immediate sense of community.","- The pro above could also become a con as recent engineering grads on teams that aren't very mindful could suffer from burn out.

- While you'll grow a broad set of skills that allows you to perform varying engineering roles in your first 2 years, you'll ultimately find yourself falling behind on newer industry trends (think cloud-computing, SRE, security).

- A lot of politics that prevents engineers from understanding organizational direction and priorities."

People work very hard so you often can count on your peers even on weekends and through the night.",They work you a lot of hours. It is important before accepting an offer to understand how many hours the prior person worked so that you can adjust your salary offer to match. If you worked 40 hours at your prior company and they are willing to pay you 20% more for 80-100 hours of work you are making a lot less. A ton less in fact. Know your worth and use the expected hours to negotiate a salary. At this company it is all about your initial salary coming in. I have seen people making 70K less in the same role because of the difference in salary coming in. Raises and everything will be a % of your prior role so you will never catch back up. Also don't take a promotion prior to the beginning part of Q1 (when you know when the raise will take effect). They will only give you the new pay starting then so they will essentially get your working the new role for 9-10 months before any new pay starts. Obviously not employee focused so work your two years and get out. You don't want to be here long term and you will notice quickly great talent doesn't stay.

Goldman Sachs is a Fortune 100 company, Goldman Sachs has had record-breaking profits during the pandemic and yet they DID NOT pay for employees' work equipment during the pandemic. You use your personal laptop, you use your personal cell phone and you do not get reimbursed for Internet usage, your cell phone usage, etc. There is a secretive process to receive a small reimbursement for equipment if you need it (less than $300). 

If GS was so wildly successful during the pandemic, why do they insist on making employees return on a full-time basis to the office? (Sorry, not full-time... you may be allowed to work 1x/week from home.) Management pushes for RTO with unsupported arguments about collaboration and they importance of being around your team (research does not support this by the way). An open environment actually discourages people from speaking openly as everyone around you can hear you. 

The only legitimate reason I can think of for Goldman's behavior I referenced above is CORPORATE GREED. You can feed your employees lines about the importance of being together but your employees have proven they can perform for you from home. Respect them and listen to what they want. Times are changing."

Even though on books you have to work for 8hours but you will still need to log in by 10 and work past midnight and sometimes beyond that. It is frustrating to work here. People here have no idea about the innovation or industry standards, only jargon that no one understands the implementation process. It goes by old school style, and even if they ask you to share your ideas, you will have to take 100 approvals even to start, and in between, you have to incorporate 100 people's views even though those are bad. If you don't have any other job offer, you should join here for your reasons, but you will regret joining Goldman as a lateral every day.

615,,Goldman Sachs cheated me out of a portion of my 2020 total compensation,2022-01-23,1.0,Vice President of Technology,may look good on a resume but hopefully not,"I was employed at Goldman Sachs for 22 months. Part of my total compensation for 2020 was an equity component which represented 15% of my total bonus. One needs to be mindful of the fact that at Goldman Sachs, the bonus makes up a significant chunk or one's total compensation. Other financial companies pay higher base salaries than Goldman Sachs so Goldman tries to make up for the difference with a higher bonus.
I had worked for Goldman Sachs before, from 10/2004 through 5/2012. Part of my compensation back then was also paid in RSUs (Restricted Stock Units) which vested over the course of three years. Back then, it was also acknowledged that if I were to leave the company, I would forfeit unvested RSU, unless I was over the age of 50.
This time around, the rules for equity compensation have changed. The Equity Component was vested immediately, but could not be exercised for a number of years.
Interestingly, when I started investigating this issue in greater detail, I discovered that the last leg of my equity compensation component could not be exercised until 2050. It is most likely that I would not even be alive by then.
In November 2021, I received a correspondence from GS stating that I needed to certify my equity component. Failure to do so would result in immediate forfeiture. I complied and retained this correspondence for my records. One of the mandatory fields in the certification form was the name of my present employer. I specified my present employer as Bank of America. Note that my current job at Bank of America has absolutely nothing in common to the job I was doing at Goldman Sachs. Bank of America has over 200,000 employees who perform a myriad of activities that are completely unrelated to what other employees may be doing at Goldman Sachs.
On January 19, 2022, I received a letter from Goldman Sachs stating that all of my RSUs granted as part of my 2020 total compensation package were forfeited because according to RSU agreement paragraph 11(a), it was deemed that I associated with a “Competitive Enterprise"" after departure from the company.
Anyone who is still working or thinking of joining Goldman Sachs needs to be aware that the only way their Equity Compensation component could be worth anything is if they were to stay at the company for many years."

780,,Only worth it as a last resort,2022-01-03,2.0,Operations Analyst,"Good name brand to have on resume, good location if you're lucky enough to be placed in the New York office. Mobility into front office has become a bit easier since many people resigned during COVID.","Your experience will depend largely on the team that you're placed in, and will vary from very bad to an average, dull job at best. Most managers are worn out from years in this role/industry and you can tell that they're unhappy with their lives. This translates into the role with a culture of under-training, overly high expectations, finger-pointing when there is a mistake, and micromanagement. Teammates are unhelpful and get annoyed when you ask questions, even though there is no other way to learn the job since all of it is very Goldman-specific. They will actively talk about you negatively and assign blame when something goes wrong. Overall, the people make it a very toxic culture. There are a few genuinely good people, but most are only worried about themselves and networking with you so most interactions feel surface-level.

The lack of training may be due to the expectation that there will be high turnover, which creates a self-fulfilling prophecy. If you do stick around and even if your team isn't bad, your job is to do very monotonous, repetitive tasks that would be better off being automated. And, since Goldman uses unique software and your role has such little impact to the company, there's no transferrable skills that you gain for your next role. 

Ops is also treated as the bottom of the totem pole here and it shows. My annual bonus was <5% of my counterparts in front office. You get paid a fraction of what the front office makes, with overtime rate at 0.5x (instead of the usual 1.5x). At this point you're working 10+ hours of overtime per week for less than the NYC minimum wage at around $13/hour. 

My advice: only take this job if you have no other options. Even then, beware that there is a 12-month minimum contract, where you have to pay the (pre-tax) $10,000 relocation bonus back to them. The job was so bad that I considered paying this multiple times so I could leave."

938,,"Goldman Sachs, Ayco Personal Financial Management",2021-12-03,2.0,Analyst,"Good experience if you want to be a financial planner. 40 hours/week, nothing more or less. Time off, benefits, and HI were high quality. Pay is what you would expect for an entry-level financial analyst position after college, but it never goes up with performance or tenure. Great place to get paid to train, take certification exams, get some experience, and then leave for better opportunities.","Pay is stagnant. They talk about career progressions and promotions constantly but it's all an illusion, as it takes 3-5 years at a minimum to move up a level and your income never changes (except for a 1-3% increase each year) during that time. Even when you get promoted you are still capped out at a 75k/year total compensation (base and bonus) structure (takes many years to get to that cap) in this department. 

This coaching role at Ayco is really just a stepping stone to gather experience to ultimately leave Ayco, since there is no long-term career for a coach at Ayco that is financially feasible. Accordingly, the turnover is ridiculously high, which should tell you everything you need to know. My team had about 15 people in my region when I started and every last one had left Ayco within two years. Even during that two-year time frame, many people joined and left shortly thereafter. The biggest con is the universal, stagnant pay... every coach gets paid the same (within 5k margin) regardless of performance or experience. Some coaches may perform consistently at a 10% rate compared to other high-performing coaches , but get paid the same as the high-performing coach. However, since turnover is so high, they will never get rid of the poor-performing coaches. Therefore, it seems like the culture is a competition to do as little as possible, but just enough to not get fired (which they would never do). Coaches that actually stick around long enough to understand the compensation will gradually transition into doing as little as possible at work while they look for a new job. 

Management and the internal accounting system are extremely antiquated. You can only get promoted at the end of the year and your pay can only change at the beginning of the year. If you are on the verge of promotion and don't get it, then you have to wait a year before being considered again.

Internally, the organic, progressive career path for a coach would lead to the team leader position. The team leader runs a team of coaches. I have heard from prior team leaders that their pay is still very low (capped at 75k maybe). Additionally, there are very few team leaders for the coaches and very little opportunity for a new team leader position to open up. However, when a team leader position opens up, it seems like Ayco will hire some externally to fill the role, instead of the hundred-plus coaches looking for promotion (even though some coaches are very qualified and tenured).

Very little collaboration. You pretty much just take calls and satisfy your appointments all day, every day once you are out of training. There is very little teamwork and plenty of isolation if you don't create opportunities to meet and socialize with your colleagues. 

High burnout rate from doing the same thing over and over again all day. Nothing ever changes meeting-to-meeting, day-to-day, week-to-week, etc..."

Well regarded","Constant and high workload
Most tech is old, boring
Most projects are meaningless (just done for the sake of meeting regulations, quality not important; see recent fines they received because of this) 
360 review a joke - opportunity to backstab colleagues anonymously (and get their bonus)
Lots of old timers, people who joined the company from uni and stayed with the company ever since (10-20 years). They have domain knowledge but dated tech knowledge. Quite difficult to get promoted in their place, since they have connections
Can't invest money yourself in the stock market without manager approval. Even that allows you only to buy certain whitelisted funds
Forces you to sell your individual stocks when you join (missed earnings for me since I had to sell my Tesla stocks)
You can't do anything without their approval (public talk, blog, write an app/website , side business, tutoring). All needs to be approved by the Company
Modest to no pay raise in years - different excuses
Brought in extenal MD with bad attitude and aggressive behaviour, rarely available, not replying to messages, inept technically though branded as expert in the field. Many people left or moved teams. No way to give feedback
Average salaries despite what you're made to believe
Poor working tools (virtual Windows box, remote desktop, xMing into Linux from Windows OS flaky)
Barebone servers with cmd line access in prod for most teams. Poor and dated internal tools: Conductor, SecDB, Pure, etc 
Gitlab deployment does not cope with the load, jobs fail, take forever 
SVN widely used 
Few teams use cloud technologies 
No laptop, no budget for training, wfh chair or equipment

Toxic, another manager required us to turn cameras on on the calls when WFH
Very toxic culture
Extreme cost reduction on everything, feels like you’re working at a really poor greedy bank
Low bonus - 1 month pay even with good performance review 
Salary growth is lower than the inflation rate in Poland (even with good performance review)

Pay is good at the entry level, but this is literally not growing, so you can earn 2-3 times more after a year here - so don’t waste time staying here for too long

I actually had people on my team get a promotion and end up making less money because they moved off overtime pay. Way to reward good employees with less money. Makes so much sense.

We’re a fast-paced shop that has quickly become the largest C&I solar asset owner in the US.   You’ll be tasked with a lot of responsibility, even as an early-career professional, and expected to deliver day-in and day-out. 

My favorite part of working with the group is being able to bring my authentic self to work everyday and feeling like my voice is heard. The vibe is more similar to a small-shop solar developer than an investment bank, especially in the Boca office. 

Pros:
- Lots of responsibility
- Goldman Sachs brand name
- Constant learning and rapid growth 
- Friendly peers","Frequent project acquisitions and financial closings can lead to late nights for everyone on the team . . . but you’re working with the best in the industry and learn something new everyday.

People are very bright, there are opportunities for promotions for junior candidates. Great benefits package.","If you are considering an engineering position in NYC, I would advise you to reconsider. Comp is low compared to tech companies. A lot of attrition in engineering. Particularly in NYC. Typically, engineering leadership is leaving which poses a problem for replacement. General strategy is to move all US back office eng to Dallas.

Diversity stops at the team lead level. Mostly male team leads of a rather limited set of cultural backgrounds.

Easy to go from Analys to Associate to VP but after that there is practically no upward mobility. Better off shopping around for jobs elsewhere and trying to come in laterally as an MD.

Too much bureaucracy, dated tech stack, lack of a data-driven approach to decision making. Performance is scored on a curve and not against any objective measure so even if you perform well, if someone with you job title has more years of experience than you and performs equally well that will hinder your comp growth."

You will work with (mostly) smart and ambitious people and sometimes peers who genuinely want to help.

Pay is good/above market.

At the end of the day, things just get done and get done usually well.","Crazy competition. You are literally going to be compared to your peers for the year end review, and if you are deemed under the 10-15% performance population, or your manager can't defend you against other managers, you are out the door. I have seen good performers thrown under the bus. This ends up in creating a toxic/politics oriented culture.

Given managers are also assessed the same way, they will not hold back in achieving what they deem appropriate, even if say he is doing a favor for a peer MD/politics oriented activity and requires you to work throughout the weekend just so that he gets those extra public relation points. 

Lots of adding you in cc ""get this done by end of day urgent!!!"" When it's just a favour to another MD , while your actual important activities get tossed asside (which then you are called out on).

Work hours are crazy in most roles.

Mental health will be impacted if you are not ready to cope with the pressure, politics, work hours.

CEO is keen to return to office, for no actual concrete ""scientific"" reason.

GS has a knack for attracting bright, ambitious, collaborative people. People earlier in their career can really benefit from a culture of apprenticeship.","Relative to your peers in the company, compensation can feel arbitrary and is only weakly correlated to your personal performance. For those who put their heads down thinking they'll be paid for doing a great job, be warned that comp is very much driven by perception, favoritism, and the ability of the partner running your team to pull for you at year end. 

The technology in the trading division is generally very outdated. This can be challenging for quants and engineers used to open source and cloud compute. It is a long journey paying down the ""tech debt"" for building everything in house prior to 2016."

Good people
Great opportunities for the right person
Availability for cross training","Nobody in IT is hired directly. Positions are temporary to begin with (through an agency) and a 1-year contract with the expectation to go permanent at the end rarely result in actually going permanent after 1-year.

1658,,Associate in Product Controllers,2021-08-06,3.0,Product Controller,"1. Huge international reach and of course brand awareness for later opportunities in your career. Opportunity to move teams or offices was possible (but you had to fight for it). 

2. Very intelligent people working there that are able to assist in your own learning and career development process. Personally, I picked up quite a lot of knowledge which will stand in good stead for the future. 

3. Pay was reasonable for back-office IMO.","1. Technology used on a daily basis in Controllers is very old legacy stuff and honestly pretty terrible. A large majority of daily/weekly headaches are simply caused by random and unforeseen tech issues which you had no part in creating. Guaranteed they will ruin your productivity with frequency. You'll likely become quite acquainted with issuing tech tickets. 

2. Work life balance wasn't great due to Executive Office deadlines. Don't be surprised if you're still waiting on someone to send you a file late into the evening. You'll also be expected to work on Federal Holidays (New Years Day, July 4th etc) if it in any way impacts the delivery of quarterly reports (which it will). Yes, you may receive a day back in lieu, but actually booking that in with the team is another thing all together."

There is no opportunity for growth or raises. Your managers have no ability to provide a raise or bonus even if you deserve it. It’s decided by the higher ups that you never see. The Modesto office is run by terrible leadership. The manager is a micromanager and dictator, but won’t follow any of their own rules. Stay away from the company and especially this office. They are not team players and don’t want the best for their employees. They just want the best for themselves.

2094,,A good place to start,2021-06-04,4.0,Software Engineer,"As far as Engineering goes, I really enjoy the people and have found many mentors (both senior and peer). People are smart and come from various backgrounds. Diverse thinking and cool personalities. There is a strong emphasis on networking, which creates a pervasive ""catch-up over coffee"" culture. I entered post-undergrad, and I like being able to choose between working back-end/service-side and front-end, and learning a little bit of everything, not necessarily stuck to one thing (though my specialty is Java). Team culture varies depending on the leadership of your team. My first team was not too entry-level friendly, but my team did genuinely care about my growth and had my back; I always felt that I was treated with respect. Overall I've had a pretty positive experience with working in a team and working to my own schedule. Since pandemic I've been working remotely, and the plan is to move forward with a mixed approach (2-3 days in office, 2-3 days working remote from home). Engineering teams do seem open and willing for the mixed-work style moving forward as well, which is good. Internal mobility is always an option and people are willing to help you out. Amenities in the New York office, such as the gym and the cafe, are very nice.","If your main concern is money, you might as well look for a job at a tech company. Could definitely be getting paid better elsewhere. Office politics is definitely a thing. If you're interested in stocks/trading, working at a bank will put restrictions on that. My current team is based in EMEA and is definitely more suited for developing new engineers, but dealing with time difference, keeping in the loop, and making space for myself in project tasks (from the perspective of being based in Americas) has proven frustrating at times."

+Very nice pay for experienced hires","-Internal tech can be a burden, but required for security or company politics reasons
-Internal tech can be used heavily, and then abandoned
-Code reviews are uncommon. Code test coverage is forced, but the act of testing isn't accounted for in project planning, which leads to haphazard tests built to touch many lines and always pass
-Work hours vary by team, some teams are very overworked. Avoid at all costs, you will get paid the same more or less
-Insane support hours on some teams, AVOID SUPPORT HEAVY TEAMS AT ALL COSTS or you will be working after hours and weekends unpaid
-Some people take themselves and the job too seriously, this Big Bank mentality can cause a lot of unnecessary stress
-Lots of politics and 'chest beating' to get things done and move ahead
-Stressful emphasis on having your body in your seat for as many hours as possible to show that you're 'working', on many teams
-Many longer term employees figure out the system, and become below average engineers/contributors who know how to play politics and play up their work
-At times, toxic employees take your work as theirs or conjure new realities to put you/others down when you've down no wrong and brush off their blatant mistakes. The system rewards this behavior, so nasty less-than-talented individuals move up quickly
-Talented new hires are not retained, because the company reward structure is too safe. It's hard to get an early promotion or non-standard bonus without flexing a job offer, and typically the offer is better so you just leave"

2526,,Great Employees,2021-04-08,4.0,Vice President,"Great team members. Bright, enthusiastic, hard working, team oriented.",You will have a very significant workload
2527,,Probably not ideal for the long term,2021-04-08,2.0,Associate,"I worked in 2 divisions, so I'll do a paragraph on each.
 
Foundational counseling (Ayco) was a good place to start a career. It was interesting and had a good work life balance. Not too much pressure, useful information and the colleagues were solid. You could move to another division and most likely have a leg up if you want. If you work there for 2 years your CFP exam will be easy and you'll be a better planner than 99% of people in other firms. 

The Family Office is interesting as working on clients you won't find anywhere else can be fun. Lots of complexity and most people won't get bored. It appears to be growing and the colleagues there were hard working, friendly, and intelligent.","For Foundational Counseling, there isn't much of a career path there, especially if you just want to work with clients and don't care if they are worth millions or not. It's a decent place to get licenses and experience, but that's about it, despite the fact that the job is relatively fun. Goldman really took over this division and the pros mentioned above are diminished, to be sure. Goldman clearly doesn't understand the way the service should be delivered and implements things that don't really make much of a difference on how the service is delivered. 

In the Family Office, pay increases don't exist too often and there are lots of taxes to file, many of which the service shouldn't include or has wildly mispriced. I did simple dependent returns that took hours and hours (because of the software, which is glichy, slow, and frequently doesn't work) and the clients were charged thousands, but they could have used turbo tax and paid $50 - $100 bucks and taken around 30 -45 minutes. Additionally, they seriously undercharge for large tax returns (some firms charge 2 or 3 times what Ayco charges). The account manager makes bank and works long hours, which might not be for everyone. You might be fortunate and be with an account manager who helps and wants you to succeed and is a pleasure to work with and explains things. It's just as likely that you won't. Some account managers share comp with planners, some don't. You could be doing the same job, working the same long hours as your friend and getting 20k less a year. 

As such, if you are young, fresh out of law school or just got your MBA, ambitious, don't mind being underpaid for years and then overpaid, and don't want to have a work / life balance, Ayco is fine for you. If not, work in Foundational Counseling for a few years and then get a job at Fidelity or Vanguard or something. I literally doubled by base salary plus will get fixed bonuses with a floor and ceiling. Turnover is lower than the industry; however, that is misleading since Ayco doesn't cold call or gain clients the same ways that other firms do. As such, considering the job doesn't really require sales for account managers to make good money, turnover is actually quite high. Lots of account managers have left recently, which never used to happen, but Rockefeller, Bender Lane, and Shade Tree are popular choices. After 6 months to a year, it's a good bet 50% of the people that you sit near won't be there."

Worst company I have ever worked for and would not recommend to anyone. 
 
The following is a detailed summary of my experience.

Let me start by saying, I was very excited when I received the call that I would be able to work as a consultant for a big-name firm like Goldman. This seemed like a dream come true since I would be doing what I went to school for at a large reputable company. However, I ended up quitting due to what seemed like borderline unethical business practices within the first month of employment. A recruiter reached out to me and told me about the opportunity of being a ""consultant"" at the firm and was looking for ""recent graduates"" in my field of study. I was told the position was ""remote until further notice"" and that I ""would be working as a consultant."" I took the position because it was remote work, and since I live with high-risk family members, working remotely would allow me to avoid exposure to COVID-19.

My recruiter and the management staff confirmed this information, reassuring me that my skills would be of use in the department. Although, this was too good to be true. I found out the hard way that I would be commuting an hour to and from the office every day. I would not be working remotely because my position was actually in their mailroom, sending and receiving customers' transactions (not a joke). Furthermore, I would not be provided a parking permit since the building does not have a parking lot and is in the middle of downtown SLC where daily parking is extremely expensive—eventually telling me that my position was mandatory.

To make matters worse, there was a required executive meeting for all employees where corporate discussed their strategy of ""increasing the number of people returning to the office."" They stated, ""we want to get 10% of our workforce back in the office,"" and were going to implement ""COVID-19 policies"" to ensure this happened.
These included all mandatory positions (which now includes mine) to have COVID-19 test(s) per-week and employees we were in charge of ordering them and submitting them before our shift. We had 48 hours to submit our test and perform it on a Zoom call to ensure it was done correctly. If we failed to do this, ""we would be denied access into the building, and it would be flagged on a watch list"" if we attempted to scan.

If everything did go through according to plan with the test, we were instructed to wait in the lobby 15-30 mins before each shift to verify we didn't have COVID-19, and we would not be compensated for lost time.
This was the final straw for me. I returned my work equipment to the security desk and walked out. My understanding of the job I agreed to went from ""working remotely as an investment consultant"" to this horrible scenario that doesn't even resemble consulting work that happened in a few weeks. I could believe this was even happening, nor could anyone I mentioned this to. I have worked as a consultant before in other large organizations (Universal Studios being one), and they never treated employees like this. Furthermore, I did provide consulting work for Universal.

I did not do any consulting for Goldman Sachs. 

I was just organizing and inputting mail."

However, as an employer they belong in the bin!","I have nothing positive to say about this company as an employer, honestly. If you're a white male or an Ellen Woods doppelgänger in looks (ie. petite, blonde, white, female, kinda airy), no doubt you'd succeed. Anything else, please look elsewhere. Seriously, if you care about DEI/community development efforts, this ain't it. If you have multiple offers, don't even consider working for this company and don't let desperation move you to consider this either. You will really be miserable and end up using your peanuts of a salary in therapy because you'll be that bruised at work. 

I initially thought the toxic work culture (sexism, ageism, racism, homophobia and all the isms) were at this particular location that I worked that, but reading through other reviews on here and other platforms, I am realizing it's company-wide. 

I can go on and on about all the things they're doing wrong as an employer from only recently (in the last year) providing coffee (without creamer/sugar or anything) to employees - just plain coffee - to how they treated their ""essential employees"" at the height of Covid to employee performance reviews to bonus dissemination to their lip service on racial and diversity issues (and no action)... just trash. 

I only ever received feedback from my direct report unless I requested for one, but he'd report my shortcomings to higher-ups. If you are not pro-active about soliciting feedback, you'd have to wait for the annual company-wide performance reviews which influences your bonus (if you get one at all and how much). As you can imagine, by the time you get to know what you need to work on, it's too late (unless you're constantly actively seeking feedback). Otherwise, you may be out there chilling thinking all's well then you'd be hit in the face so hard, you'd be whiplashed, at the beginning over the year during performance reviews.

Again, they go hard for their clients at the expense of their human capital (which is part of their core values, btw) and for that sole reason, they belong in the bin."

There are many internal harassment complaints against almost each senior manager in this group. Diversity, inclusion and meritocracy is non-existent is this group. Overall favoritism prevails and you have a huge advantage if you are young, physically attractive and belong to the predominant demographics in this group. If you are not born this way, be ready to get exploited, be ready to get insulated and screamed at in front of entire floor, be ready to accept significantly low pay (50% less than your peer in some cases). Technology is this group is a mix of modern tech stack, Slang and Goldman's own infrastructure so you will be working on legacy and internal frameworks for significant amount of time. Lot of talented engineers and leaders have left this group and have joined top tech companies due to extremely toxic environment that is not healthy. Work life balance is also a joke. People are there at 7am in the morning and are still in the office at 10pm. Weekends are non-existent.

Disclaimer - This review is not written by some angry disgruntled employee. I was promoted during each promotion cycle. But I belief life is much more than just working for team X in company Y. 
When people start working for a company, some can not leave due to immigration processing or some unfortunate circumstances. Hopefully this review will give some insight and will help someone take an informed decision before joining."

Very welcoming at the start of employment in June 2019 and decent environment back then. So far they haven’t forced anyone to return to the office so that’s another perk, but not sure if or when they will force people to return to office.","Worst part about ayco is the awful culture. Weekly department meetings are lacking serious morale and most coaches complain to each other about outdated and barely functioning technology that they always promise will improve but never does, micromanaging team leaders, and lots of useless busy work mostly due to the poor technology. Lots of meaningless reporting and they’ve started pushing coaches to refer every client to their life insurance product and report back on how the life insurance conversation went. Every day. Job used to be laid back and had awesome culture but new management has sucked the soul right out of this place. It could be such a great place to work if the right people were in charge. Very frat guy and cliquey environment that is not welcoming (fake welcoming to the point of being obvious) to women and ethnic minorities. It’s a boys club where the right people will go golfing with the right people to get opportunities. Office politics are real here. Coaches with mediocre skills will be propped up as gods while others who are just as good are tossed to the side. If you want to be a financial planner forever this might be the place for you, and if you move up the ladder to relationship manager, get CFP, you can make the big bucks, but coaches are paid meagerly and get 2-3% raise per year max. There are some great people here who will help you succeed, but others would love to see you fail if they don’t think you fit in with their fake woke “PC” robotic group of individuals."

4149,,Make sure you use GS like they use you,2020-10-12,1.0,Analyst,"-Brand Name - Cannot get any better
-Offers many training resources
-Some colleagues are highly skilled/even brilliant at their roles
-Exposure to C-level executives and some ""legends of finance"" in certain roles
-Opens doors if you are in the right role, specifically on a revenue generating desk or within a role that involves some sort of technical skills.
- If you are starting with the firm as an analyst or associate, the firm will ensure that you are well trained and treated somewhat decently. There has been too much bad PR surrounding the abuse of analysts recently for HCM to allow anything otherwise. This is especially true if you are female. 
-Talks at GS: you get to attend lectures from some very impressive politicians, celebrities, sports stars, business leaders, authors etc.","-It's all about the name. You will be paid less as an analyst, associate or VP for the privilege of working at GS. The discount is real!
-The collegiate nature which the firm was once known for no longer exists. Its every man for himself now.
-The best outcome for clients is often not the focus anymore. The focus is often now just how can GS convince clients to give it money.
-It's too ""top heavy"". There are multiple heads of every division, group and desk which puts a massive strain on pay and often makes it difficult to discern what direction management wants you to go in.
-The hours aren't really worth the pay anymore.
-The hours are long as advertised and the competition is fierce, making it next to impossible to stand out.
-Your commercial contributions don't matter at the end of the day, only your manager's opinion of you matters. If you are liked by your manager, you will see decent bonuses and salary increases. If your manager doesn't like you, you'll be fired when they cut 10% of people each year.
-Even if you are performing well, all management really cares about is the bottom line so they will happily outsource your role to India or replace you with an algorithm if possible.
-Political correctness run amok. The leadership clearly supports a certain political agenda, let's call it ""New York liberal elitism"" and if you disagree and share the beliefs of maybe a Bernie Sanders or Trump you will be an outcast.
- If the revenue your desk is generating is consistent shrinking, it will be an all out bloodbath. Partners will blame MD who will blame VPs who will blame associates and analysts. Pay will be cut at every level in order to ensure that the Partners and MDs maintain their level of pay.
-VPs are so busy that they do not have time to teach junior analysts or associates.
-Politics which would put Congress to shame. It's all about who you know. Many colleagues who are friendly to your face and may even give you a good 360 review will say unflattering things about you behind closed doors. The culture is very gossipy and can be backstabbing.
-The company has no strategic direction. It's simply a bunch of people running around trying to cater to every whim of their boss.
-COVID-19: Senior leadership is on the record in the press saying that they would not lay people off in 2020 but they went ahead and laid people off anyway. They lied!
- Positive reviews: most are from very junior people who worked for the firm for less than 2 or 3 years and got a great exit opportunity or have never worked for a normal company. They don't represent reality."

Another pro was before covid (now everyone works from home) is that we used to get free dinner if we worked past 8PM which was pretty much every single day, a very nice gesture from Goldman to let you know you're welcome to keep slaving for nothing while receiving some cheap $25 stipend for dinner.","I do not even know where to begin. I actually never thought I will be spending my time writing this but I believe everybody has a right to know how overrated this business is and how abusive this place has become. To begin with, Goldman Sachs employees are probably the most overworked individuals possible. It is not uncommon to wake up and before you even go to the bathroom, start working immediately without having time to eat or do anything else. You are literally a slave to your work, including Saturdays and Sundays. Don't think there is such thing as a break here. There is absolutely no personal space, management is extremely micro in regards to people management, they lack diversity and decision making, specifically the CEO who is all about public image and making sure his Instagram shows the outside one thing when the inside is a Jail. In short, a bunch of white older people with no sense of compassion, people skills or regard for human life. Just about a week, two Vice Presidents who recently came back from their maternity and paternity leave were fired. Even though Goldman Stated there WOULD BE NOT layoffs for 2020. Bunch of lies, just like every manager here. 

Long story short, you may be better off working at McDonalds. They are paid hourly while we are salary, so taking an average of the hours you work at this bank and your salary, you will find out you will probably make more money at Mickey Ds while being treated the same or probably even better. Do yourself a favor and do not work in this landfill."

4565,,More Toxic than Chernobyl,2020-07-18,2.0,Associate,Can be a good rubber stamp for the resume. You can learn a lot if you’re willing to teach yourself (it’s jungle law).,"I came into the firm as an experienced hire through a diversity hiring program. Within my first month a VP on my team told me I was only hired so management could get a “tax break”. I should have walked away at that point but I was determined to stick it out. Of the 4 or 5 people who originally brought me in to the firm, all were either fired or left in outrage before I even started - this should have been another red flag (because the firm has a massive turnover problem).

I felt that management consistently lied to me about a variety of things mostly pertaining to advancement. They would also talk pretty openly about horrible things they had done to past employees and laugh about it. 

Maybe these things could have been more tolerable if they were the meritocracy that they tout but they weren’t in my opinion. That same VP’s job revolved around technology and he/she didn’t know what a server was (literally asked me in a conversation once “what’s a server”); the difference being he/she was part of the elitist yet incompetent culture that permeates the NYC office. They regularly hire the children of clients and as you can imagine they are usually the kind who NEED their daddy to get them a job because they are otherwise completely unremarkable.

I stayed two years until I had to train another VP how to do a new job he/she was assigned and he/she couldn’t competently use excel (same individual would regularly try to humiliate analysts/associates for lack of technical skills until he/she took it a step too far once and was almost fired). 

Seriously as far as diversity programs go, you can’t bring someone in under the guise of receiving training and then have them train your VPs."

- Looks good on your CV","TLDR; Avoid it like the plague. 

The amount of bespoke stuff is unimaginable. There is a road-block at every step of the way. Forget the latest technologies, tools, etc. It's a bank and as such is a dinosaur just like every other bank.

Technological progress is non-existent. Internally, most things are in a half-broken state. 

Be very careful about choosing to come to work here. The risk of lagging behind in terms of skillsets/technologies the rest of the world is using is critically high. 

Want to make improvements? Most people will tell you it's not worth the effort. If you actually try to make positive changes (except for updating gazillion confluence pages), the team responsible for that most probably will tell it's ""not in development"" (despite said service being half-broken and used by ""clients"").

Ah, despite the billions of dollars the company handles, you won't get a laptop for yourself. You're stuck on a remote desktop instance. Forget all the productivity tools you were used to before. The developer experience is dreadful.

Want to run the latest version of PyCharm/IntelliJ/etc? Sorry, can't.
Want to use the latest version of that library? Need to go through a whole process before being able to use it.
Want to work on AWS/GCP/Kubernetes/etc? Sorry, need to demise that 20-year-old system running off CVS first.

Don't come."

- You can learn the financial domain. 
- Hierarchy is quite flat which can be a good (or bad thing when everyone is a VP)
- Flexibility to work at any time
- There is no appreciation for the work done, but no one tells you you're bad as well.
- Amazing office at Bangalore ORR campus, plus game room and super high end gym","Long list:

- Teams mostly have no knowledge of design and development, esp the folks who are there for 5+ years

- Unreasonable deadlines, when you've other projects in hand + support (80-100 hrs in a month). 

- Long working hours (quora, glassdoor - they all tell you. IT's TRUE).

Even during lockdown, working till 3/4 am in morning and again logging back around 10/11 am. Actually we are working more than when we were at office but {Management disagrees}.

- Managers ask us to take time off, but won't work on the project deadlines. 

- For someone new, this will be mentally exhausting and physically draining. I see the new joiners working till 9-10 PM at night. Some asked me why all are having lunch at their desk.

My Personal Opinion:

Problem is not work, the Indian management doesn't hire keeping the workload in mind. In the name of flexibility, you have work from office, then home or cab while travelling (many do that). 

In most of the companies, there are cycles of pressure (more work), then breather before the next release. Here there is no such thing. So no time to develop a new hobby or skills. 

FYI been a year in new building at outer ring road, I haven't seen a single person from my team use the Game Room at GS. Or use Cafeteria, other than take away. And never got time to use that awesome gym.

There is no room for personal/professional development or growth. I think for many personal life suffers, yet we keep working in hopes of Bonus and salary. 

I feel like a slave honestly, most of the times. It's difficult to prepare for interviews as you no times, and lose touch with algos, programming, analytical skills. I am unmotivated and feel useless now, so I continue on here."

The hostile environment does not make you motivated to work better, it makes you feel drained and down. I hope this is not the experience everyone gets here, but sadly GS is not what it used to be anymore. There is no buzz or excitement in people working here.

Networking is seen as important and firm offers ample opportunity to network with others at the firm.","Not a merit based system, a popularity and favoritism based system.  If you are liked by your manager and the MD over your department, you can easily get promoted.  You just have to be liked more than the other people in your department.  You'll see plenty of losers, lazy people, those with lesser credentials, and horrible leaders that are not well-liked get promoted.  You can work harder than everyone and never move up due to this.  Most often you will probably have a terrible manager that is not a subject matter expert and doesn't understand what you do because Goldman does not care whether you are a subject matter expert.  Goldman cares only about putting people in management positions that the manager and MDs like.  
You'll see everyone in the office is 20 something.  MDs are usually in their 30s or early 40s.  Age discrimination for sure!   
You cannot really indicate concern with any problems because the firm utilizes 360 reviews, which means your peers provide your reviews.  if your direct issue is with a peer or a manager, reporting bad behavior such as poor work ethic will only hurt those that are doing the right thing.  Employees that do want change and need to report behavior will not for the sake of their career because of this awful system."

The 401K plan is extremely generous for employees after their first anniversary, and tuition reimbursement is available at $10k a year.

• Learning opportunities - you will learn more than you can possibly imagine.  The networking that comes from the groups, events, and cross-division/departmental projects really help expand your skill set and resume.

• Resume booster- a large percentage of my colleagues came to the firm for this very reason.  Post Goldman life has also been very nice for most as they move on to other opportunities.

• People - It was a privilege to work with such a talented group of people.  Everyone has great ideas, strengths, and works extremely hard.  

Also of note, there are a lot of opportunities available to volunteer locally, people do really seem to genuinely care about what they do, and I was extremely impressed with how the firm handled any HR type issues.","• Work/Life balance.  I was fortunate to work in a division that offered overtime, however extra hours were always available and it was strongly encouraged to work extra.

• Stress- Do more with less seems to be the philosophy here.  Departments seem to be understaffed, overworked, and undertrained.  Management seems to be reactive to change in staffing rather than proactively working to make the day easier for employees.  Turnover is extremely high for a company of this caliber in the division I was in.

• Pay - pay is subpar, and employees are discouraged from discussing this with each other.  Annual raises, bonuses, and promotional increases could use some work to be in the same league as other companies.

• Internal promotion can be difficult depending on the needs of your team.  The firm tends to hire outside, and tends to promote management more frequently than those that work in operations.  There’s not a lot of transparency about career pathing, and that heavily impacts morale."

A piece of advice to the campus hires, if you're planning to study further, join the company, go enjoy the NY trip. then quit. There are not conditions on the trip.","- The company has messed up its pay scale, there is huge parity within the same team, people with similar experience/background/titles might earn upto 2x times as you. The situation is so bad, there are senior folks making less money than the juniors
- There will NEVER be work/life balance.
- The interview process is so painful, that they are never sure of if they would want to recruit or not until they roll out the offer. Plus the whole process is roughly 10-12 rounds spanning over 1.5 months
- They claim the bonus is performance based, which is no where closer to the reality. There is often a parity between performance review to the real work that the individual did
- Regarding bonuses: The first year for lateral hire is base bonus (which isn't based on the performance of the employee), generally very low (unless they disclose the figure to you at the time of joining) and then they pro rate the amount to the time until you work."

The benefits are good and there is focus on wellness and resilience. The Goldman name makes it really easy to get a huge comp bump and promotion when you leave.,"The work environment is incredibly intense and needlessly so. Management does not take a long view but rather jumps from one crisis to the next. Teams are short staffed which contributes to the constant need to put out fires rather than think about mitigating risk long term. In order to get a promotion, you need to play the politics game. Unfortunately there are some toxic individuals in senior leadership who will prevent anyone but their favorites from being promoted/get raises.

If you’re not best friends with your manager or speak the same language as them, good luck getting ahead.

Terrible pay, terrible bonus structure for non-rev. If you have a real degree and actually put in effort in college, don’t take that job in Operations. You will be underpaid based on your education, and doing the type of work that does not require a degree and should have been automated or outsourced years ago (ie. DATA ENTRY, copying and pasting, checklists etc.). Embarrassing to describe what you actually do at work and really difficult to spin it in a way that will make you seem attractive to new employers.
Outdated technology and systems. Systems cannot support the business or client requests and do not connect between teams (teams are not familiar with systems if they don’t use them). Any mistake has an extremely negative effect on ops and you will be held accountable even if the mistake occurred due to other team’s oversight/negligence.

One day you can hear something and the next it can be completely different. Managers do not care about the employees what so ever and about 99% of the employees there, complain DAILY about how much they hate the job and are all actively looking.

There's no room for imperfections as any mistake can have catastrophic consequences, and that mentality is hard to let go even when you leave!

I also met some wonderful, brilliant people who challenged me, and I'm grateful to have gotten to work side by side with them.","Now where do I begin... There is a deep deep foundation of inequality between men and women. Women are hired more often for certain roles rather than others, and not surprisingly those roles top out at VP rather than Managing Director or Partner like the roles that are more often held by men. Last year on national women's day (or a comparable made up holiday), we got an email from the executive office stating that they recognized the disparity between men and women at the firm, and in an effort to remedy that, they would be endeavoring to hire 50/50 men vs. women in the incoming analyst class...... This hollow attempt at a solution just floored me. It felt like throwing a limp soggy bandaid on a gaping wound. The problem isn't that you aren't hiring enough female analysts at the bottom of the ladder--the problem is that you aren't enabling women to stay in the workforce and move UP the ladder. Better yet, you aren't holding men to the same standards that you hold for women who seek the same promotions.

For example, a good friend of mine spent ten years at the firm. She had multiple credentials behind her name, had recently gotten her MBA, and spoke up about wanting to make the switch to a separate position with more responsibility and room for upward mobility (also a role overwhelming held by men). Management told her that they were instead going to give her a different role that they'd just created--something sort of halfway between what she'd been doing already and what she wanted to do. Simultaneously, there was a guy who had been hired at the firm straight out of college, who'd been there two years and had no advance degrees but walked around with his chest puffed out, and management decided that he WOULD be a good fit for the same role that my friend was trying to get into. For what it's worth, this wasn't something that they were just hiring one person for but rather they were accumulating many candidates to train for the program all at once, so there was definitely room for the both of them at the onset. My friend kept fighting and finally she was given the okay to go into the program, but they'd managed to ruin the whole thing for her in the process. She ended up making the decision to leave the firm and is much better off now... But it was certainly an eye opening experience for me. If you're a woman, expect to work ten times as hard for the same opportunities.

Additionally, and this is particularly timely given the recent cultural awareness provided by #metoo, if you're a woman, you can expect to get touched inappropriately by men that you work with. It's literally just something that you get used to. I'd be talking to my friends in other industries about this one guy who always puts his hand on my lower back or the other one that would rub my shoulders, and they'd be SHOCKED. Another dude would always find a way to get close to me at office happy hours and find some way to touch me. Meanwhile I was just used to laughing it off! Another time, a male supervisor reprimanded me for ""not bothering to put on some earrings"" before a client meeting. Mind you I was wearing makeup, a tailored Armani skirt suit, low Louboutin heels, and had done my hair, but that wasn't put together enough for him! He was wearing.... a suit. My work friends and I would all share stories over drinks, but we all knew that nothing was going to be done about it. Management was already aware, but the primary offenders were the rich white dudes that kept their business afloat (in their eyes), so there was no touching them (pun intended). 

How about another one... After my first year, I had exceedingly positive feedback in my 360 Feedback (the word ""allstar"" was used multiple times by multiple aforementioned important white men) and yet I got a 3% raise. A male peer had been hired a week after me in the same role, had made multiple mistakes that cost the firm money, and got a 6% raise (yes, we discussed these things). His bonus from the firm was also twice what I got. A year later the same guy was fired after he CONTINUED to make mistakes, and I was promoted to a different title but again only got a 3% raise. For anyone who is want to say that women make less because they don't negotiate, I can promise you I fought tooth and nail for a higher raise, and was given a YOU'RE WELCOME with my measly 3%. 

If you're pretty and you're smart, you won't have any trouble making friends, but you WILL have a hard time getting ahead. I wish I'd known ahead of time!"

5876,,The absolute worst place that you could possibly work. Don't chase the carrot.,2018-12-13,1.0,Financial Planner,"You get experience in different areas of financial planning with high net worth clients. Most other employees at Ayco hate their jobs, so you will have friends to wallow with in your sorrow.","Ayco has the most miserable, toxic work environment that I have experienced in my professional career. You will be worked to death so that, if by the grace of the gods, you will become the almighty account manager. You will be judged completely by how many hours your put in and not by the actual quality of your work. Be expected to work from 8 am - 8 pm Monday - Friday, as well as come in one day per weekend. 90% of the employees sit around complaining about how much they hate their job. They openly state that they are actively seeking other jobs.

Raises? Bonuses? Not a chance. You are lucky to receive a $500 salary increase, even with a promotion. Bonuses generally range from $0 - 2,000. Ayco itself can have a fantastic monetary year, but salary and bonuses are completely dictated by Goldman Sachs. Ayco loves to blame not giving bonuses and salary increases on Goldman having a bad fourth quarter. Don't worry about the Goldman executives - Ayco services them as clients and they make millions every year, even when Goldman has a ""bad"" year. Upper level management will continuously lie to you to get you to work harder, only have to your hopes and dreams crushed shattered at the end of the year.

Did I mention tax season? You get to do your full time job in addition to preparing a boat load of complex tax returns. Tax season breaks people because it so painfully miserable full of archaic processes and procedures.

""Technology."" Saying that Ayco has ""technology"" is offensive to the word. My computer in 1995 had a faster operating system. Ayco uses thousands of programs rather than one integrated system, such as a company like Merrill Lynch. Your computer will constantly crash and you get used to seeing ""Not Responding"" multiple times throughout the day. Management loves to talk about making process more ""effecient"" but they refuse to invest in modern technology.

Compliance. Ayco likes to make things as difficult as possible for the employee from a compliance perspective. Minor things like changing a client's email address or phone number is a major chore.

The holy grail aka Account Manager role. The account manager position is what everyone at Ayco strives to be. This is the position that generates all of the money and respect. If you are not on a career path to become account manager, then you might as well go ahead and find a new company to work for. Everyone knows that account managers make good money, but management loves to keep their little payment formula a secret. Let me enlighten you roughly on their compensation structure:

Account managers make 1/3 of the counseling fee that Ayco charges clients. Ayco's counseling fee averages to be about $10,000 per client. If an account manager has 60 clients, then they are generating about $600,000. This makes them about $200,000.

Next, Ayco's fees for assets under management depend upon the investment strategy. On average, account managers receive a $2,000 raise per every $1,000,000 in a managed strategy. If an advisor has $100,000,000 under management, then this will generate approximately $200,000 of income for the account manager.

Lastly, account managers receive a percentage of premium for any life insurance, LTC, annuities, etc. that they sell. It's not usual huge numbers but can add up to another $25 - 50,000  for an average account manager.

While the account manager role can be financially rewarding, it is a position that requires an immense amount of work and day trip travelling 2-3 days a week. It is grueling and pretty much kills your chance at spending any time with family. Ayco advisors are required to have a minimum of 4 meetings with clients per year, compared to most investment advisors who meet 1 - 2 times per year. Tax season also puts more stress on the advisors. Many of them burn out and move onto other companies, even if it means taking a pay decrease. The wealthiest clients are always tied up among a few advisors at every Ayco office. Literally there may be 3 advisors at an office that make as much as 12 other advisors combined. Management plays favorites with certain advisors and hands them the best of the best clients.

This list could go on forever. Please do yourself a favor and take a job elsewhere. I don't want any more people to have to experience the depression that Ayco causes its employees. Ayco will forever be Goldman Sachs' ugly step child."

- Big enough that you don't always have to work that hard and can get away with doing nothing most days
- Average cafeteria
- At-work gym","Where do I start? I worked in GSAM for 10 years, both in NYC and London. Good luck to the people in London, who are treated just like any regional office and not valued employees in the 'International Headquarters'.

GSAM and GS, as a whole, are living on the reputation that they once had. The company has been on a downhill trajectory since the IPO. The inertia of its former glory allows it to attract the best talent and creativity, which they inevitably suck out of individuals, leaving them shells of their former selves, with no real skills and only proprietary knowledge which is useless outside of the firm. The firm has hired too many 'lateral hires' who have killed its culture and forced those who 'grew up' at the firm out the door.

GSAM is an extremely exciting money market and fixed income business where misinformed clients are name brand *cough*, willing to pay extortionate fees for lacklustre performance.

GS is a bloated bureaucracy where it's impossible to get anything done. Be prepared to have your best ideas killed by committee, usually based in NY and who have no understanding or interest in the international business.

While GS is a good place to launch a career, DO NOT let yourself get sucked into this place for your entire career. MOVE to a private equity firm or hedge fund. At GS, you'll, without question, stagnate and get stuck into your role/team.

Unless you're in Sales or a part of the PM team, be prepared to be treated as a second-class citizen. Forget about a role in Tech or Compliance. While GS tells the public its a 'Tech company' it's anything but -- just have a look at GS 360 sometime. Wow! What a great job they did with the platform revamp there!

The sales people in GSAM walk around with such swagger, you'd think they're making millions but the majority make little more than anyone else. The Sales MDs think they're gods -- good luck trying to get on their radar. However, if you love playing politics, you'll do just fine here; it should be your major focus. Little emphasis is put on skills our output; it's all about presentation (and usually of other peoples' work).

In Europe there's a small chance that you'll make it from an internal to an external salesperson, but you'll probably be fired as these teams turn over quite frequently for failing to lure customers will high fees and poor performance. In the US, the transition from internal to external wholesaler is virtually impossible.

Stay away from any other 'support' team in GSAM, including Communications, Investor Services, etc."

There's a lot of things that Silicon Valley companies could learn from how GS runs its business. Since career progression for junior employees is largely based on arbitrary metrics like number of years out of school, if you have a BA vs MA vs PhD vs MBA etc., in certain situations when you're transitioning from a different career path you can actually get pretty nice pay for your experience, even though overall GS pay doesn't seem that great.","The pay for junior employees really doesn't compare to what big tech is paying these days. You could double the bonus and it still wouldn't be able to match FANG pay. You can tell that the new grads and interns coming into tech/strats are not really the best. Then again, this is probably by design, but it's not great if you're an employee.

The perks do need some upgrading IMO, for morale reasons. The cafeteria and vending machines are not exactly cheap, and being able to afford the more expensive snack/food items unintentionally signals your status/income level. Slightly upgraded drinks at the water cooler like soda/sparkling water, maybe some snacks, and slightly subsidized cafeteria food would help."

For the low and well below market value pay, not worth the long hours and stress (unless you are an Account Manager, because they get paid a ton).  They took away tax compensation, which is incredibly unfair for all the hard work and long hours you put in.  Worst of all, there  is nepotism in the Operations department-  as a result they are very biased and management tolerates this.

It is good news to see an adjustment to pay for analysts and associates to match big tech, but demotivating to existing top performing VPs with way more years of experience to know analyst total comp was higher. Titles don't mean much now. Titles control base pay, but bonuses are at discretion of Managing Directors and this is what make the difference in pay at end of year.

After some thought into the renowned business principles of GS, I thought it important to share the practical work principles that are seen from the view point of lateral hires. Lateral hires are the underclass at GS and face hurdles at many points until they exit and truly hope this offers a window to some who my be deciding on options of joining or leaving GS.

First, please note that as a “Lateral Hire” you are called a risk to GS as you do not carry the CULT ture of GS.  This will not be known in your welcome package but you will realize this a few months later.


The Work Principles

1.  Never take a stand on anything.  Follow the tenured GS folks who will never take a stand as they know that winds can flow in all directions.  It’s better to stand and watch as your convictions are withered away but all is well with your career path. Be always in the hedge mode.

2. Appear to be as detail oriented and technical as possible.  Focus on the detail on page 8 of a presentation and highlight a certain unknown regulation or regulatory aspect. You are always technical.  Just simply a technical person who clearly loves the details! I was simply bothered that no body worried about the clause at the end of page 11 that has profound implications for the program trading business!  Yes you now have their attention now back it up with what you have to say. Say it fast as if the train is ready to leave the station. Then state we should discuss this tomorrow when we can get some time! You now have the attention of some senior folks in the next 24 hours.  Bad news travels fast at GS.

3.  Use words and lingo such as “remit” “opportunity set” “mandate” with the right frequency and with cautious pragmatism. Use the word “post” instead of “told” or “said”.  I posted him not told him or her.
4. Be prepared with your story of rags to riches.  This is the favourite topic of partners of how their humble beginnings now seem a distant past considering current status, wealth, position and self-acclaimed respect in society.

5. Proclaim how naive you were before you joined the oasis of wisdom. Proclaim that your wisdom now stands corrected. Your life truly began only when you joined this oasis otherwise it was merely your imagination.  Yes this is the corporate version of the Benny Hill show.

6. Never speak about what you learned before you joined GS, it’s simply not applicable.  It was already known and has been factored in. Just as you never talk about your old pagan religion in front of Benny Hill.

7. Remember that people are human capital that can be positioned. You can go “long” or “short” on people as with trades.  They are just a different form of trade. Every year people are traded like cattle graded using quartiles. 
Q1 - Cult centric smart folks who will trade in all their values at the altar of GS.  They have few things they will stand for. Quite malleable in opinions as long as it meets their career goals. They can get away with almost anything. Many Q1s are truly smart but not all Q 1s.  Some Q1s are there because of political winds such as diversity (a potential story for GS 4 years from today as to how GS made their life from rags to riches albeit all social disadvantages example a widow, a refugee from Syria, may be an LGBT who escaped persecution in their home country etc)
Q2 - Want to be more Q 1 like but not quite there. They are supported politically.
Q3 - Smart people that work hard but not quite visible as they are the ones in boiler room powering the firm and not in front of the press
Q4 - Smart lateral hires who have not found political support from the Cult as yet. They were leaders in prior organisations and have made a difference elsewhere but are not GS ready. They have opinions and may think independently and offer them unknowingly as they have yet to realize that there is a discount factor applied to any and all they have to offer and say.
Q5 - Essentially Q4s who have never been coached or supported. Political underclass who have not tasted the flavour of the quarter or year.

8.  In the US we always hear it’s not what you know but who you know that matters. Although loudly proclaimed as not being the case at GS.  GS is really the epitome of that statement. GS would widely proclaim that face time does not matter. However, Face time is selectively offered to Q 1 s without the rest of Quartiles knowing about it and believing that face time does not matter.

9. There are few true friends here. There are acquaintances. A few people will stand up for what’s right even when the winds blow strongly at them.  They have usually left to join other organisations. They become friends when they leave GS.

10. You are told that GS should be the top 3 priorities in your life. Family or your partner being one of the three.  Please refer to Principle 7.  You are never quartiled in your family so GS cannot even be close to your Family as a priority.
11.  Please do not manage people well. The worse you are with people the more technical you are as you really have no time to focus on your soft skills. You are headed to be the next Co-Head of a Division. Remember capital stays and can live to be long term greedy; people die eventually after they pass on capital and know-how of how to build capital (this is also known as succession planning or “take out planning “

12. Women, complete a major project in the last trimester and then head out on maternity leave. You can come back two years later as part of the return ship program. Men you cannot compete in this arena. Even if you complete a similar project and take leave to take care of an ailing parent you have no chance of return ship as this is not the flavor of the decade.

13. How do you know all is well with your career. You do not. You never know where you stand as the winds can blow in any direction. Once this uncertainty is part of your DNA it will ensure you try harder like the honey bee that is trying to predict the wind direction. 

14. Culture Careers; Expat Therapy-  Become an Expat;this is the best career move you can make.  Move to another country and make sure you claim that this is some serious stress for you and family. State how you had to use bottled water to brush your teeth to protect yourself and family while the commoners in the vicinity had to travel to collect drinking water from nearby sources. It does not matter what others do you are truly the expat that matters. You will be airlifted to safety albeit after your promotion for the stress you took for safe drinking water. Make sure you make some noise about local practices such as the caste system in India, lack of public transportation. If you are an expat in the US, you cannot talk about how African Americans are still not safe at police hands or that American schools are unsafe for your children just as you had felt the need for bottled water to brush your teeth you will not find the “bottled water version” of American schools.
Culture Careers
In the first month of your expat assignment offer some deep insights on the country and the firm in that country.  For example, in India confirm what others have proclaimed previously in the first month of assignment. The place is hierarchical and respects you more than you deserve and therefore your co-head even more than he deserves (she here is inappropriate as that would mean that India is not sexist).  People will not escalate problems beyond their Manager as it goes against culture norms. This statement would generally help you in extending your assignment as you have still not careered sorry carried the culture of GS to the locals. In addition, this statement may help you continue having oversight for India from NY or London or elsewhere. Quickly talk about how your Housemaid was courteous to you and family beyond your expectations in arrogant NY. Explain the help you offered the maids son in Math and learning computer skills. If you have pictures preferably in local attire as this could be in the next global newsletter. (Very Trudeau!)

Once you train the locals to escalate make sure they escalate to you and not to your boss as that could mean they are not yet fully GS cultured. 

In your going away speech, proclaim how yoga and India have changed you significantly. (especially till you reach your Tribeca apartment and you order your Decaf Latte at Starbucks that is priced more than the daily wage of you courteous maid who continues to rant to neighbors about your computer lessons to her son)

In your flight back to NY think about the careers besides yours that you have helped make, especially that person in the corner who you did not connect with as they just kept doing their job well (Q3) and did not socialize or escalate anything to you. He is doing well and has left GS for a start up analytics firm working on AI."

My friends always want to hear what is like to work at Goldman.  Compensation is based on what you deliver for the firm. Talent is always recognized with promotions and money. A great importance is given for diversity and inclusion which makes employees contribute to the growth of the firm without having a feeling of left over. Even though financial firm a lot of effort in recent years to streamline technology and company is trying hard to keep up with the latest technologies and is not afraid of bringing in new tools and technologies to workplace.",Knowledge about systems and technologies developed sometimes stays with only few experts within the firm. Others will be expected to deliver without necessary training. Knowledge sharing has to happen so that other developers in the firm also become equally productive compared to a rockstar performer. People with expert knowledge on systems are not willing to share knowledge which is a bottleneck for teams productivity.  Communication skills are given a higher preference when promoting people instead of technical skills.

Paternity Leave is 12 Weeks - but you will be asked ""are you really going to use all of that time""
You could say you ""worked within the Goldman Sachs Umbrella"" in the same fashion that the parking attendant at Yankee Stadium works for the Yankees.","The Work Itself - the target continuously is changing, not for good reason but primarily at the whim of management and leadership. All the way in the door they mention their relationship with Goldman Sachs. Soon after you sit in your seat for the first time, you realize nothing is close to cutting edge and more so resembles a start up company. From business process, to technology, to building amenities everything is poorly designed, dated, and not what you would expect from a company that claims an allegiance with Goldman Sachs.

The Compensation - many of the previous posts speaks of poor compensation and bonuses. That is certainly the case for 80-90% of the staff. This is one of the only portions of the business model that does resemble Goldman. The top tier get their bonuses, while those who work the long hard hours get the speech year after year about ""there are many factors in compensation"" and ""it was a tough year for the company"". 

The Work Environment - hands down one of the most hostile and toxic work environments I have ever seen.
The pressure is placed on associates by leadership to work long hard hours for key objectives and tax deadlines etc. While that is a staple of most successful businesses, the way it is executed is extremely poor.
In recent months there was an article about  a former SVP, and what her experience was with the firm, let that be an example of how the work environment actually is.

Upward Mobility and Career Development - all of the classic examples ""glass ceilings"", ""good ole boys club"", ""Nepotism"" and ""Pedigree Promotions"" are out in the open for those who pay attention. May associates will work for years towards a promotion, to see someone that ""looks the part"" be promoted. Promotions are more tied to your pedigree within the company, your appearance, or impenetrable favoritism  than the work you have done or your true value to the company. 

Diversity - There is a significant effort to promote their Diversity Network. But you can visit the leadership portion of the Ayco website to get a real feel for what the companies profile looks like.  I would often joke that there is more diversity in the line to get coffee than there is in the whole company.

Benefits and Retirement Contribution - Health Insurance Benefit leaves much to be desired, HDD insurance plans will bring your take home down some percentage depending on if you have single or family coverage. The Retirement Contribution was so low it was meaningless."

Travel","Very low pay for financial planners/analysts. You will be better off to start your career elsewhere and with any pay raises will make much more than a financial planner/analyst here in almost any other professional environment after a few years. 
My personal experience is promotion without any increase in pay, bonus or COLA adjustment year after year. This is not out of the ordinary. Now think of that, truly, doing a good enough job to be promoted without anything but a title change. Does that happen anywhere else? Expected to work long hours, help pick up work load from others overworked with zero gratitude from management. Moral is extremely low and has changed dramatically over the 5+ years of working there. You will be told if you give up 5 to 10 years of your life you can make account manager which is the only job worth having in financial counseling. The AM job is very high paying and if you make it there would be happy with your choice to work there, but really have to compete for it and being a good employee/worker is not all that is needed.  This is a very political company, while this is true to an extent in any business, AYCO is extreme here. Above all else, your career progresses by working for and being liked by the right people as long as you are a decent employee. You need to work for the right people that care about getting you promoted or have a voice with senior management or you have virtually no shot of moving up in any capacity and that is outside of your control. There is very little transparency in bonuses, pay, etc. Worked at an office that broke new company records for new AUM in a year and no year end bonuses were given out because ""Goldman"" did not have a great year. This is not atypical, as every year now it seems bonuses, raises, cut expenses etc. will not be given out because of something to do with Goldman Sachs in one way or another. Not sure if this is just the go to excuse or real, but again, very little transparency . Overall, there are a lot of good people to work for or with, it just seems that the company is becoming less and less of what it used to be. Even if you work for a good boss that cares and appreciates your work, that means little as ultimately senior management or the Goldman office makes decisions. Moral continues to decline. This is too bad, because when I started here it was not the case. It seems that the more involved Goldman becomes the more the work environment deteriorates. It may be worth a shot for a few years to see if you can make it and get a name on a resume and training which will open some doors in finding another job. But from my experience, and knowing others that left, you will quickly find that you are overworked and underpaid once you go elsewhere and will really appreciate your new employer."

Years of poor financial performance, layoffs, overworked and underplayed staff has taken a tremendous toll on morale. Many employees openly discuss looking for opportunities elsewhere; most are treated as a human cog in the machine that this company has become. Most benefits are not competitive tot he market and healthcare premiums are affordable. Many employees have had several years of lower take home pay as a result of compensation practices and poor benefits. Long days are the norm and expected by all levels of associates. Staff are expected to be at the office rain sleet or snow and lack of working modern technology requires positions that should not need to be in the office travel in inclement weather.

So I can not speak to them all as the company is massive.  However for the division I work in I see a few issues. One being that management talks behind the backs of the employees.  Also that if someone is not doing well in the division, it's openly known on the floor. I've had one co-worker who had really no business knowing another co-workers standing talking to me about ""His numbers"" and how poorly he does, and basically what a looser he is.  If this was one isolated incidents it would be one thing, but it just isn't. I've had this come up in meetings with my manager where he discussed the standing of someone and though didn't give an name, gave descriptors that made if fairly clear who he was talking about. I've also noticed that thought they do attempt to coach and help these people, they also treat them like they are total morons, talking just a bit more slowly, or explaining things just a bit more than necessary.  This sometimes coming from manager who have only had this and one other job in the two or three years they've actually been old enough to work....  Manager I'm thinking of is 22. It's only his second job. No education past High School talking to an older man with a bachelors and 40 years work experience under his belt.  Speaking of age, I have also noticed within our division, no one over a certain age gets promoted. There is a huge age gap in regards to who's moving up and who's not.  This I find highly disturbing in that it appears to be clear age discrimination. Though the job is secure, they will not fire anyone for the most part. In all likelihood to avoid unemployment penalties. However they will keep people around bumping down their pay and putting them through Hell trying to push them out.  On the surface it's a friendly upbeat environment. Under the surface though it's very very dysfunctional edging on abusive.  One last thing to note..... the company is VERY conscious of it's image. They are big on ""Reputational Risk.""  In working here you are told you are forbidden to act in any way politically, like any protests, volunteering with certain groups, etc.  So be sure you are willing to trade your civil and constitutional rights fr a pay check.  It's to the point that one person who wanted to volunteer with the opera of all things was told she had to get permission from a review board before she could even look at it.  Beyond mind boggling."

b) Despite the recent attempts at calling themselves a ""Technology Company competing with Google for talent"", the fact is neither the pay nor the average quality of engineers is even 20% of what Google is.
c) While there is gym and cafeteria, it is cheaper to walk outside the building and find a better food/facility at half the price you pay within the building.
d) Toxic politics with constant bickering amongst middle management who see no chance of moving to MD level and are always frustrated
e) While the company boasts about teamwork, you are alone when there is a crisis due to some inadvertent mistake. You will be punished severely with multiple people questioning you why you went wrong 0.01% while nobody appreciates when you were right 99.99%
f) Company doesn't believe in spending even a single dime on you besides your compensation signed in the offer letter. You will be asked to attend many Friday evening drinks all of which are self-funded and you pay around 20 bucks even if you just had a 3 dollar beer.
g) You will not learn any new technical skills
h) Nobody will allow you to work on a new open source technology unless the bureaucracy has approved it. That means hundreds of people spend loads of time doing the same repetitive work in Excel.

6712,,"Misogynist, racist, anti-Semitic boss.  Run away NOW.",2017-11-12,1.0,Anonymous Employee,None. None. None. None. None.,"I was unfortunate enough to be stuck with a misogynist, racist, and anti-Semitic manager.  Example: When setting the support rota for April, he waited until I went to lunch, sat down with everyone else on my team, and pulled out a calendar and deliberately scheduled me to be on call during Passover.  (He himself never took call.)  Another example: I was held at fault for ""arriving late"" every time there was a delay on the Metro-North commuter rail or the subway.  Yet another example: There was a subway strike while I was at GS.  All employees who had to take the subway were allowed to telecommute for the duration of the strike.  My manager was not affected by the strike.   He wrote me up for telecommuting because it was ""unnecessary"" -- for HIM.

I did my best to deal with the situation, but it was untenable.  I approached upper management, who told me to deal with it.   I ultimately dealt with it by quitting for my own mental health and finding a job in Midtown Manhattan where they understood that delays on Metro-North were Metro-North's fault, not mine.

And their idea of work/life balance is ""if you have time for a life, you obviously don't have enough work to do, so here's some more!""

People don't leave companies, they leave managers.  I left mine."

6716,,IBD Analyst,2017-11-11,3.0,Analyst,"GS IBD Bangalore - I have learned more in my current job (despite working in an offshore capacity) than I would have thought possible. 
Best part of GS is that they let you run with things. If you seen as being dependable, no one will get in your way. You can execute deals and be the lead Analyst on transactions sitting out of B'lore as long your team has the faith in you.
However, this can't be said for all people in the IBD B'lore Analyst program. Whilst to an extent, the program is what you make of it - some people don't get any work or are just ignored by their teams in the 'front office' locations.","- Lack of career progression (despite doing 2 years with GS, we need to start over a 'Analyst 0'  when relocating to a 'front office' location). Oddly enough, the teams you work with have no say in this process. Even if they feel you can join as an Associate or Analyst 2, the bureaucracy will never allow it. There are a bunch of people managers (i.e. staffers, B'lore IBD program mgmt folk) who seem to want to treat people here as 2nd class citizens. 
- Compensation (too low for IBD). I work 16hr days on average (often a lot more when you have multiple deals in market). I can say with confidence (based on my reviews etc..) I am one of the top Analysts in my chosen geography area and am the preferred go-to Analyst for many VPs and Associates. But you still only get a fifth of 'front office' Analyst paycheck
- Inter division mobility - let's just say its a lot easier finding a job outside GS than one in another revenue generating function 
- Lack of exit opportunities - 'GS IBD B'lore' - Regardless of your experience from this program, its close to impossible finding good exit opps in PE or front office jobs in banks in Mumbai for India coverage as you don't have 'relevant India experience'."

Great place to work for driven individuals who require only the minimum managerial oversight.  The culture can wildly vary depending on which team you join.  Firm in general has a desire of building their own solutions over vendor products which means you’ll always have some new interesting initiative to build (even if it’s just rebuilding what an open-source would already provide).,"Preference to build rather than buy technology solutions means a profuseness of buggy libraries and services with little or no documentation and support.  Often integrating with such systems hinges on the success of who you know that can point you in the right direction (“talk to so-so who may be able to refer you to someone who may know somebody that has a foggy memory of how you use that convoluted API”).

Team cultures vary.  I’ve worked on close-knit groups where everyone worked hard for the common goal, while other teams I’m just a headcount regardless of my contributions."

Low-level employees are underpaid and treated poorly, but moreover, are given very little opportunity.  The company is strangled with a combination of archaic technology and terrible communication between departments.  I would say if you are very self-motivated, Ayco can be a great place to teach yourself what you can using the resources at their disposal, and the GS name can look good on one's resume, but ultimately, it would not surprise me to see the company dissolved/spun-off by GS in the near future."

Made me truly appreciate getting a better job.","After having been an employee of Ayco for 7+ years and leaving the firm over a year ago, I felt it was time to give an honest review for anyone looking. 
FACT: The company changed to a purely numbers driven business. It used to be about building culture and a healthy work environment but it is like that no more. Management picks up on the hard workers and lays on more responsibilities with no extra pay. They promise the pay but always delay it... keep that carrot dangling in front of you. Personally, I got ""promoted"" twice, with no pay raise with the promise of raises or bonuses but all I received was plenty more responsibility. 
FACT: The company has a compensation issue. What compensation? Exactly. They fail to compensate. They say, for the area, you make very good money and that's how they address the issue. 
FACT: Hard work will get you ahead; I will not deny that. But kissing up to management and being lazy will get you promoted. The management at Ayco does not want to address the real issues. They'd rather speak to everyone as a whole and not do the job of managing people. 
What keeps people from leaving Ayco? The camaraderie of your co-workers. The fear that if you leave, you're not going to find something better. They tell you the grass always appears greener on the other side and give you excuses why it appears better at other companies. For all current employees, I'll tell you that's true. But I'll also tell you the grass really is greener on the other side. Sometimes you have to bite the bullet and make the jump! Take a risk. It's worth it!
Do something that makes a difference. Do something that makes you happy. FACTS ARE FACTS. My life has become a heck of a lot better since I left Ayco."

2.nbjhfiuhnl..... just needed to enter more than 5 words to write pros about this company when i dont have any","1. I will break the biggest myth on this planet about Goldman Sachs - not everybody is rewarded (bonus & Hike). Many instances when even if you dedicate 13-14 hrs of continuous efforts daily throughout the year, if management ""perceives"" that another person better than YOU, you can be rest assured for that year to get ZERO HIKE & ZERO BONUS. Yes, it true, its damn true and digest it before stepping in. In my 2 years of career, I did not receive any yearly bonus

2. Bias - Complete Intern-centric company. Experienced hires from different companies are treated unfairly on many many different levels. Majority of praising reviews are from former or current GS interns only.

3. Scrap value switching cost for experienced hires - Brand Name. Period. You are brought from the market at a scrap value just to be used and thrown away. You are made to feel privileged that you are working with GS. 

4. Bullying - unwelcoming hostile environment. Experienced hires treated as ""intruders"" and any voice raised is suppressed in one on one catch ups with managers and interns raised as ""Seniors"". 

5. Lack of respect - At every level.

6. Pay for everything - There are NO perks. Transportation is charged, food is charged (not subsidized), Gym is charged. You basically shell out the precious years of your life in terms of your money, energy & efforts just to work crazily meaninglessly for what? You will realise only once you leave.

7. No Job security - Be prepared anytime to be shifted to a completely different role without your prior exp. If unable to deliver the expected results in short span of 1-3 months in all that ""hostile environment"", be prepared to enter the brain squashing, mentally depressing, emotionally scarring & self doubting phase of 4 weeks PIP (Performance Improvement Plan) which is the last nail in the coffin to terminate you. If you are lucky enough to deliver impressive results though, PIP might be extended for few more months (an excuse by management to see your continuity and credibility) expecting you to deliver 0 errors. It doesnt end there. If you do not deliver something of ""value"" what the management wants, you might end up in another PIP 3-4 months later which will be definitely convincing enough to terminate/fire you. This truth never comes out."

Attending talks that bring in geniuses from across the world. A fantastic CEO who values diversity at the work place. I've met way too many inspiring individuals during my tenure at Goldman Sachs! I have to admit that it was a great first job out of school - I've learnt and grown so much from this place. I have LOTS to be thankful for.,"Managers in Operations Salt Lake City are mostly jokes. They are brought in from either Bangalore (where they lack EQ, people skills, common sense) or London ( cliquish, zero technical skills, London rejects). You can't find true leadership at this office. Your career will have no growth and you'll be asking yourself every day ""Am I really working for the best investment bank in the world?"" Operations was built out in Salt Lake City only as a cheap, escape route for the firm. GS wanted to save money and decided to pick the most boring city in the entire United States of America. Poor decision! The lucky 2% manage to move to New York and the rest of us are stuck with low caliber managers and Mormon colleagues that are sickeningly sweet but unfortunately boring. This office is a major disaster and Salt Lake City is looked down upon by rest of the firm (well Bangalore still wins for being the worst). I don't even understand how some of these people make Vice Presidents at Goldman Sachs. My advice to incoming folks: Run far from this office. There are way too many people who are unhappy and very limited opportunities for internal mobility. Also, ask yourself if you want to be a glorified factory worker processing brainless information every. single. day? That is Operations for you. 

It's only prestigious to work at Goldman Sachs if 
1) You are working anywhere BUT Salt Lake City and Bangalore
2) You are working anywhere BUT Salt Lake City and Bangalore
3) You are working anywhere BUT Salt Lake City and Bangalore

I think you got the message."

7088,,Apply Elsewhere,2017-06-01,1.0,Anonymous Employee,The only benefit of working here is the paid time off - you will need it.  Jeans on Friday?,"Where to begin?  

Understaffed offices create a very stressed work environment.  Turn-over is very high for two reasons: the first is management keeps downsizing and firing current staff and talented individuals who make it through the layoffs smarten up and find other jobs.  You are stretched to the maximum here since you are supporting several account managers, there is plenty of work to be done.  Plan on working 8-5?  I don't think so - that is highly frowned upon, you better make Ayco your priority if you decide to work here.  This means 10-12 hours of dedication each day.  There is no such thing as a work-life balance at this company.  At this point, you're probably saying, well the compensation makes up for it, right?  WRONG.  No pay increases, no more ""tax"" pay, and bonuses are all bundled in to a ""pool,"" which, you guessed it, was never seen by most employees working here.  So how does management keep stringing workers along here?  The promise of the ""carrot"" where you one day will have your own book of clients.  Long days and no pay increases will get you far - and once you advance and begin to take on your own clients, make sure you are aware that you will also be servicing your account manager's clients and any other clients on the ""POD"" team.  If this is the career path you choose, it doesn't hurt to get your foot in the door and gain some experience and your licenses then get the heck out.  Morale is very low across the board, and upper management really seems to care less."

Most tech teams will not make you a good engineer. Goldman Tech is all about learning the business. If you ever try to find a job after GS nothing you learn at GS will be useful. Slang is not useful except in other banks that pay similarly poorly.

Graduates are treated terribly, doing grunt-work and sent on 2 month 'training' in New York initially which always woos the young new starters but making them fly cattle-class in the cheapest seats possible (supposedly one of the best finance companies in the world?? really??), away from family and friends for extended periods, only to later see that they will never be promoted properly, they need to leave to get anywhere in their careers as they will never be taken seriously otherwise."
7151,,Global Investment Research (GIR) ART Program in Salt Lake City,2017-05-07,1.0,GIR ART Program Analyst,Working in Salt Lake City provides you with convenient access to skiing and other outdoor activities that would not be available if you were located in New York or San Francisco.,"The Analyst Research Training (ART) management in Salt Lake City will tell you nothing other than that you are the ""exact same as someone who is hired in New York"" or another core Global Investment Research (GIR) office to get you to sign the offer. After starting it will quickly become apparent that the goal of this program is to hire people into the program that are either from non-target schools or who were for one reason or another not a strong enough candidate to be considered for a position in New York and make them all compete for a few positions in New York after you have ""proven"" that you are capable of performing at a New York level. Your two years of experience will count as only one year of experience in New York (that means it will take you 4 years to become an Associate versus IBD where it take 2 years). You will be held to a higher standard than those that are hired into the New York analyst program as you need to ""prove yourself"" in order to be considered for a New York position.

Management will state that the goal of the program is to pay analysts approximately 55% of what they pay them in New York since the cost of living is lower, however virtually all program participants will agree that part of the 45% discount is cost of living related and the other part is just the fact that you are considered a lower valued ""front office"" employee (on a cost of living adjusted basis you are just not getting paid what they do in New York). Even the argument of the discount being cost of living related is contradictory given that analysts that are hired in Houston (where the cost of living is even lower than SLC), get paid the same salary as an analyst in New York.  As virtually all program participants are unhappy and regretful of the situation, you will constantly hear the Analyst Research Training (ART) program management in Salt Lake City and other levels of management say things like ""you just need to trust the system"", ""for you to perform at a New York level, I need you to do XYZ for me"", and ""we are going to have someone from New York speak with program members about making the transition from Salt Lake to New York"". Since it is generally accepted that the exit opportunities to the buy-side or corporate are more or less nonexistent from Salt Lake City (which from personal experience, this is more or less true), the goal of virtually all participants is to ""make it"" to New York. However, transferring to New York is discouraged after so many analyst have transferred to New York and immediately started recruiting for the buy-side.

Since you are remote and your boss and team members don't have to see you face-to-face on a daily basis you will be treated as a second class citizen and anything you do or say will be automatically assumed incorrect or lacking merit because you were not good enough to be in New York. Doing anything to please the senior analyst and be a ""team player"" is expected, however this is only expected from the junior team members as management is perfectly fine with senior analysts treating junior team members like the second class citizens that they are. Senior analysts know that you have no other options, and that they can expect and demand anything from you regardless of how unreasonable it may be and the Analyst Research Training (ART) program management in Salt Lake City, will do nothing other than agree with them no matter how absurd and ridiculous it may be. There is no right and wrong, there is what a more senior person says and what a more junior person says and the senior person will always win. 

Probably the most challenging aspect of the program is that you are working on a daily basis with other program participants who are extremely jaded and distrusting of the firm. The vast majority of program participants will openly say to each other that they regret signing the offer because they feel they were deceived by the firm and management, and virtually everyone is doing anything and everything they can to leave the program, but most are not successful."

Goldman also hires a lot based on your communication skills, and A-performers, which reduces overall balance of personality types in a team, where everybody wants to compete with each other and there is no team work.

People are used as patches for the processes that haven't yet been automated. This leads to daily work that doesn't build any transferable skills. What knowledge you do manage to build is usually rooted in the technical aspect of the firms system, and will eventually become obsolete once they roll out a system update. 

Depending on your managers compensation and promotions can be very closely tied to office politics. It is almost impossible to stand out as a high performer through your daily work alone.

GS is trying to improve its image in the media so it has instituted more aggressive affirmative action policies which is great for them from a PR perspective but this has lowered entry barriers and standards, and it also degrades the firm's unique culture which is a mix of merit, collaboration, and competition.

People slip through the recruitment filters if they check the right boxes so the number of mediocre/poor professionals entering has increased in recent years.

The ""long-term greedy"" ethos is vanishing.

Your career accelerates only once you leave for the buy-side using the GS brand rather than growing within the firm based on the trend over the past few years.

- For a young person, fresh out of school, GS is an excellent introduction to Corporate America. Approach it with an open mind or like a social examination as your experience will be a great determiner whether working for corporations could be a thing for you.","If you're unable to muster or feign the interest and importance managers feel is due to this work, note how what was once average/good feedback quickly turns unprofessional, insulting your intelligence and mental aptitude. However many times they try to tell you the work is challenging and not for everyone, know that it is not. It sort of felt like it was a way for them to legitimize and feel better about the menial, mind-numbing work it truly is. 

Although GS prides itself on diversity, it often seemed forced (checking off boxes). In general, I think it's good to be wary of any organization that pushes diversity initiatives and programs that hard. Surprisingly, it didn't make the workforce or managers more tolerant of others. Finally, the fact that one ethnic subset of the analyst class were assigned mandatory diversity mentors/champions is indicative of something.

The culture really breeds sycophancy and since fragile egos run amok, you can only imagine how crucial your ability to engage in office politics will be for promotion and staying in the good graces of managers. Believing you'll be judged based on the merits of your work is a common mistake new joiners make. For some of my teammates, the highlight of their day (week perhaps?) was having the MD greet them and acknowledge their presence. I hope I've simultaneously dispelled any claims regarding GS being flat. It is as flat as feudalism in 9th century Europe."

Great network. Looks good on a resume.","Pay starts shockingly low. 

360 feedback system is a joke. The firm is focused only on efficiency and the bottom line; they will cut you at the drop of a hat if you're not grinding the wheels.

Layoffs were pretty awful. People just disappeared-- managers didn't say anything before, your coworkers just weren't there anymore, people you cared about and got close to-- gone. Again, the firm does not care. They do not care about you, there is no loyalty to you. 

The hours are long and thankless in ops. 10 hours minimum every day. Never had less than a ten hour day.

Work life balance is virtually nonexistent. You exist to make money for the firm; they do not care about you. 

Management spends a lot of time trying to talk up how great it is to work in ops, but everyone's trying to get out. Ops is where careers go to die; it is the red headed stepchild of the firm. You know how everyone associates Goldman with Wolf of Wall Street types? Well in Ops, you're the one on the other end of the phone when said wolf picks up the phone to scream about a failing trade. It's purely extractive and exploitative. Do not listen to anyone who's trying to tell you that you'll have a long and satisfying career in ops. You'll be strategizing the entire time about getting away to another division, and getting to a prestige office.

In ops, you'll never get the choice of anything. New office building? Nope. New facilities? Nope. Healthier food? No. Central location? No, we're going to put you in the far office. Everything in ops feels punitive."

Do NOT be fooled into thinking that taking an administrative job at this firm would be a great way to get your foot in the door. Administrative assistants are largely overlooked. Internal training, mentoring, etc are all focused on associates, analysts, and VPs.  The job is a complete and utter deadend. A lot of people are completely dismissive of administrative assistants and won't even bother reading your resume to see what you did prior to that job. 

If you are qualified for other positions and have career ambitions and are hungry for advancement,  do NOT get talked into taking an administrative role. It will be a huge setback for you and a shocking number of people will be completely dismissive of you. You might as well be background furniture."

Poor management - managers are managers because they have been there long enough and not because they are ready or have the skills to be a manager. The few managers I have seen are either aggressive or distant in style, and so not very approachable.
Others: lack of training, lots of politics, little flexibility, not a fun place to work at"

* Work with great, smart people who are dedicated to their jobs.

* Hours not as bad as one would imagine. You will have the occasional late night dealing with problems in production, or ensuring a deadline for development is met.

* Benefits are absolutely phenomenal (firm pays life insurance, short term disability, has good/great 401k options, provides health, vision, and dental and customizations to plans to fit your specific situation / budgeting, and much much more).

* Compensation is great but not the top -- this probably has to do with a trade off for getting those magical words ""Goldman Sachs"" on your resume -- there is a large supply for relatively few positions, so they can afford to pay less than some competitors at the lower levels.

* As it turns out the vaunted meritocracy of GS does indeed exist, and the top performers are regularly singled out and given plaudits and earmarked for promotion and better bonuses.

* There's always something interesting going on, whether it's training sessions by industry leaders (like an engineer lead from Google talking about Angular 2), networking events, or talks@GS from famous people (Shaq, Laura Bush, Game of Thrones show runners, etc)","* In the tech division, at least, there is an ongoing problem where the firm's standards for software keep on changing, resulting in a ""hitting a moving target"" problem -- by the time you finish upgrading to 2016's software specs, 2017 is here and you have a whole new spec to meet.

* Some of the software specs are great and absolutely worth onboarding to, but some others are head scratchers that provide zero utility and only impede the regular course of software development (looking at you, forms engine).

* While GS is definitely pivoting more and more into technology, resources (and by that I mean people) are still tight. Either the scale of changes should be reined in or more resources should be hired."

There are a few departments (enterprise platform for example) that are more focused on advancing the technologies in the firm, but most software engineer positions are tightly coupled with business teams and they dictate what you do and what you work on. 

The pros are:
 - Goldman is definitely one of the better financial firms in terms of experimenting with a wide-variety of technology stacks. In my short year there, I was able to experiment with HBase, Mongo, Vert.x, Angular JS

- Many opportunities to learn. A lot of talks with many interesting people (one of the talks was with David Benioff from Game of Thrones). Classes for different technologies offered year round

- Great people, friendly","- bureaucracy, had to constantly fight with business to do things that would benefit them in the long run

At the end of the day, there isn't any real rapport or a solid team manager who has truly been there for the team all along to oversee or recognise individual employees' contributions and progression within the team over the years.

Also higher management does tend to play favorites. No regard for or consideration of loyalty.
7996,,General Review,2016-05-06,3.0,Associate,Flexible work arrangements and good people,Tough for promotion and new opportunities
7997,,The Original Fintech Startup Powerhouse still delivers,2016-05-05,4.0,Vice President,"- Best interview process of my life in a context where experience trumped nonsense tech screens.  Sessions involved strategic and domain specific discussions with VP and MD technology leaders and one or two on-the-fly high level technical questions.  Mostly, it felt like a flattering sales pitch.  One of the only times in all my years working that I've left an interview actually feeling good about myself.

- Premium offer over my then base salary, including discussion of expected year end cash awards.  All arrived exactly as conveyed resulting in highest comp received in my 10 professional career

- Moving towards a ""startup-lite"" culture with business casual attire, working remotely, flexible work hours, social/networking events

- My resume was already decent but adding GS to it brought a torrent of invitations to interview, networking requests and other professional and personal benefits that come with being associated with the top global investment bank.  

- Management structure is flat, with no single person making decisions in solitude, including your direct manager.  A strong network greatly affects project outcomes

- Policy allowing mobility at any time is a big benefit for productive and effective employees as it shifts bargaining power in their favor by forcing managers to keep the situation equitable or find someone else.

- Lots of very brilliant people have worked and/or still remain there from a fairly diverse set of backgrounds.  Literal rocket scientists and multi-PhD superstars all over the place - even as consultants.","- Strange culture where people often act like doing their job is a favor.  Tricky communicating effectively with intelligent but often thin skinned and/or insecure personality types holding long term senior positions

- Work often comes informally as high level projects along the lines of ""rethink and simplify the current expensive but proven solution with delivery of an entirely novel, unproven, theoretically more efficient paradigm"" - and then judged somewhat qualitatively on minor points and preferences, shaped by popular opinion.  Politics here are as weird as they are dicey as they are crucial to getting ahead or staying afloat.

- Compensation per employee is nothing like the press/media math of ""X profit / Y employees"".  It's higher than average in general but there's many who are paid less than their value along with many medium term consultants with no skin in the game.  On the positive side, there's almost no one who adds little to no value and sticks around for more than 3-6 months like all other banks

- Management structure may be flat but largely because of its opaque, convoluted and constantly shifting nature.  This can make it feel like a full political campaign cycle just to screw in a light bulb.

- As crazy as it sounds, if you reach a senior level, it becomes difficult to pursue opportunities outside GS as the universe of companies that can and will provide both a better career trajectory and higher compensation shrinks dramatically.  Those that can can usually have outlandish expectations with only incremental compensation improvement offered - like describing how to build a profitable algorithmic trading system in explicit, low level technical detail over the phone in 10 minutes."

-Advancement is pretty much standard until you hit middle management so there's a lot of transparency in career progression.","-Pay is low for a software engineer job but above market for an IT support job, so it's not too bad if you have just a general engineering degree and not know a lot about programming.  Don't be fooled into thinking that back office tech pay is going to be much better than other back office positions though.

-Culture isn't that great to be honest.  Since there isn't any profits/loss to show for performance, you'll encounter poor performing workers who just talks the talk.  When things go wrong, it becomes a battle of egos and office politics instead of real honestly and working together.  Level of trust is low between different teams because of it.  It's very shocking how low the bar can go when simple programming issues gets turned into a magnitude of solving world peace."

But these rural voters may once again be the pivotal force in this fierce contest for the Democratic nomination.

Polling doesn't tell you much in Nevada, because it is so difficult to predict who will turn out to caucus. So we set out to gauge the strength and energy of the operations for Democratic rivals Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders by finding Democratic voters in these sparsely populated counties over a three-day journey along the loneliest road.","Life Magazine gave U.S. Route 50 that designation in 1986, warning travelers that Nevada's stretch of the transcontinental highway (once the route of the Pony Express) offered travelers ""neither services nor anything to do along the way.""

But Nevada legislators saw an opportunity to bring tourists to this spectacular two-lane highway that traverses salt flats and sand dunes, high desert plains covered with spiny hopsage and sage brush, piñon forests and half-abandoned mining towns.

At times, very top heavy.  Teams are packed with middle to senior management, and there is a heavy reliance on junior members.

The company focuses on benefits but lacks insight, acknowledgement and capability to meet standards of the Goldman Sachs pay equivalent. The severe dislocation and oversight is disheartening when everyday is almost a soul crushing exercise meeting the standards of the company.

Depending on how much overtime you work in your non-exempt period (hourly)... When you are promoted to exempt (salaried) you can compare your gross income and see that you are making less than when you were hourly. Note - this is a promotion where employees are making less. 

Discontent is running rampant at this point and soon the most seasoned professionals will need to seek competitors because the low wage and high output is not sustainable. This could be considered a burnout job if you wish. 

This company will experience a rough road ahead is they continue to dismiss the value of their employees.

This is my review of this company and hope that these remarks are not overlooked by management or employees seeking this company for employment."

* Good people leave because the work is not rewarding enough, technically or professionally.
* If you do stay for > 4 years, you can't leave coz you won't be good enough. 4 years of dreary work is too much.
* Too much power with the manager. You have to keep him happy. In reality, the organization is not as flat as they say it is.
* Compensation for 'Application Developers' is below industry standard. Again not good for you if you are the ambitious, impactful kind.
* Too much importance on face-time (being present in the office in front of your managers) and ot so much on actual work done. (Again, this is technology division specific)

Uncommunicative and inarticulate people can never survive. Many things are discussed as private meetings. You will never how people are destroying your reputation in those private meetings. 

Not all promotions are genuine. It is another way to retain people. Your promotion doesn't necessarily turn into compensation.  People stay for fancy titles. Race for title is a never ending battle there. Also, Fresh hires are light years ahead of lateral hires in terms of how they move up the corporate ladder.

In front-office technology roles, you learn the business and people skills, not just technical skills. I'm paid well and I appreciate the prestige and respect comes with working at Goldman. The people I work with are a joy to work with. They are humble, fun, very sociable, and very professional. Everyone is very well put together and affable.

Honestly, I absolutely love working at Goldman, so don't let my below nitpicks make you think I don't. The only way for us to improve is for us to be transparent about—and focus on–our issues. So I'm going to focus on the nitpicks. If you can live with them, then JOIN! Because I'm pretty much covering every nit-picky grievance I have. (Really.) I think things are largely moving in the right direction, and that's what matters most, as it tells me that we are aware of our deficiencies, and we're actively working to improve them.

No place is perfect, but Goldman is certainly among the very best places to work. I feel very happy, privileged, honored, and humbled to be a member of Goldman's ""family.""","There are lots of meetings and distractions to juggle as a technologist. There's always more to get done then there is time for. Sometimes projects aren't properly designed in order to meet the pressure of deadlines, and you end up building a Leaning Tower of Pisa. You usually have to perform support tasks (on that leaning tower) while simultaneously developing new features. After you've helped resolve issues, the same people come back and ask what the status is on the project delivery timeline… in a meeting you're spending time with them in, of course. Some in the business will ask why a bug existed and how we can stop them going forward, as though we knew about them to begin with and left them in. (Have they ever read the notes on any phone app update? Find one that didn't include bug fixes! Unfortunately, bugs happen. Please be understanding.)

There's also a lot of proprietary in-house tech. Goldman often chooses to re-invent the wheel, instead of using an open source library, or contributing to them, for that matter. In the end, it's a losing play that doesn't scale; better solutions are inevitably created when you collaborate with the world, and you gain knowledge-sharing gravity when you do so. Documentation is often lacking as well."

HR/ Compliance and Management are some of the best teams I've ever worked with.
Assistant's stick together (you kind of have to!) and support each other. Good assistant manager.","Long working hours, most people never take breaks. Culture can be very old-fashioned depending on what department you work in and what people you work for.
My biggest issue since working at Goldman Sachs is not being made to feel part of the company. Assistant's are very much overlooked by most bankers, and are seen as 'non-revenue employees', which is far from the truth. 
Most days I feel like dirt on the end of someone's shoe. There is definitely a 'class discrimination' at GS, not only with assistants but bankers as well. 
Most people say you end up feeling like a robot...There isn't much office culture. Not that most people wouldn't want it, but because 1- everyone is so busy no one can look up from their screens. 2- management do not participate or encourage team exercises, or occasional 'fun' on the floor.

Most people think highly about this company because it has been apart of many high profile m&a and ipo deals and is known for its extensive recruiting practices and hardworking culture.  So having this brand on your resume will convey many positive qualities to recruiters.  If you get an offer here, definitely take it.  Once hire, if you do not enjoy working here, stick it out for a few years and then start your search again.","Goldman Sachs experiences very high turnover and many people, on average, stay with the company for 2-4 years.  For example, in my department, in one year, about 5 employees left for other companies.  Our department only had 30 people so it was a huge brain drain for us.  When I asked my former colleagues on why they left, many of them cited the long hours.  Some would work over 80 hours a week and other for over 11 hour days.  They said they were unable to see their kids grow up or had healthy issues related to the long work weeks. So know that these long hours aren't for every lifestyle.  I believe their workweek is best suited for recent college grads and other individuals who have not yet started a family."

It's just another 'rank'.)  Compensation for the non-revenue generating divisions isn't as competitive as it should be with other banks...especially at the analyst level (much less than $100k...which is a challenge in the NYC area).  Work/life balance...they talk about it but that's about it.  It's really up to you to carve out time for yourself and family (expect a MINIMUM of 10 hour days for all divisions...much more for revenue divisions, especially IBD (investment banking)).

Health insurance and 401k packages are top-notch.","Not a tech culture.  Very corporate.  Work really hard (working smart is discouraged for job security reasons) for minimal reward.  Make sure you really believe in the mission of what you are doing.
Massive turnover in tech - the perks and compensation that are still left are being scaled back to improve the stock price.  May be uncompetitive with other industries. 
Tech practices and code are obsolete (but slowly getting better).  You may be thrown into the fire to maintain legacy systems with almost no documentation.  Ensure you are keeping your skill set up to date.
In many tech teams, morale is really low.
Management may be only concerned about their career progress and you may not receive credit for work you have done.  
You are compensated mainly on how much money your project, business unit, and the overall company brings in - make sure to choose the right projects and business unit.  Beware that compensation may not be based on merit."

I do telecommute mostly a day per week, and it helps immensely with managing my other-than-work-life.

Overall, I do recommend GS to technologists, depending on your interests.","Given its a bank with stringent regulations, the work does come with a lot of scrutiny unlike tech companies where developers are quite relaxed and probably that leads to less stress.

Zero work life balance. Managers are not given the relevant roles. Some of the senior technical managers have zero knowledge on handling development projects and tend to super micro manage. And there are others who are technically good but absolutely lost when it comes to people management. When it comes to global teams, most of the managers prove themselves incapable of dealing with the India vs us vs UK politics that it starts effecting the morale of the team. Since job instability is very high, managers are more focussed on saving their jobs,  compromising the careers of their subordinates.

good on resume
people 'think' you make tons of money
you don't need to explain where you work once you just say the name","The prestige is really just a facade- 
If you work on their proprietary programming language - secdb/slang, get the hell out as soon as you can. you will be behind in mainstream technology, and you won't be marketable outside the company very soon. 
Once recruiter said there are some companies out there who simply won't interview any ex-goldman employees as they are just behind in technological skills, and there is a 'bad' reputation for ex-gs people
you do NOT make tons of money here unless you are the exceptional 1%. most people would LOVE to make the avg gs salary - 350K or 400K as advertised in wall st, but it's extremely top heavy. Go to other hedgefunds who could easily pay much more. 
GS is very savvy when it comes to saving/making money, and they won't spend more money to keep you happy-  but just enough so you don't leave. 
The culture is all about facade--- it's very superficial and no one trusts anyone. because of this 360 degree 'review' system they have, everyone pretends to be nice to everyone but when it comes to review, they can always backstab you because only a few people can get the high marks. 
When I left, there was a backlog of exit interviews up to 3 months - and another colleague of mine who left 1 month after me said he had to wait 6 months for his exit interview. In other words, there is a mass exodus happening in technology. 
If you are in technology, you are considered a 'cost center' and will NOT be treated the same way biz side folks are treated (traders, sales, strats). 
What I see in GS is all these cost center people, Tech, Ops, Infra, end up trying to suck up to the business folks, empowering them to act rudely as they have the ultimate say in everything. 
Expect an extremely political environment. Either you get into the fraternity or you are out. 
Since 2008, there hasn't really been a 'golden year' where everyone was happy with their compensation. 
GS would use 3 factors to determine your comp - your performance, company performance, market benchmark ---- and they would also find that one factor to tell you why your comp is not gonna be stellar this year. 

If you are a technologist fresh out of college, I would totally recommend you to go into startup space and that way you would learn so much more. 
If you are a lateral hire from a tech industry, don't come to GS. 
If you are lateral hire from another finance industry, GS may be better than other big banks.. but if your objective is to maximize your salary, I would recommend a hedgefund space instead."

In India, crappy operations roles, hires highly overqualified people just because it can (has the money to bring them over), low end work (project management doesn't need more than 6yrs of work experience), lot of lip service to enabling Indian hires ownership and engagement, truth is all decisions of any value are driven directly from HQ. Work is dead-end, after a few years here you will not be worth anything anywhere else except in exactly similar roles in similar companies

HR:
Follows US style hiring practices, hire & fire at will. Do not lose opportunity to interview elsewhere if it falls into your lap even if you're not looking. This company has no loyalty to you and you will be mistaken to offer the same to it. Company feels it does you a favor to offer a job here. Prides itself in running you through their famous gruelling interview rounds, not uncommon for people to talk to a dozen people before decision. But interviews themselves are mediocre, if you are sharp and speak good English you can get through no problem.

Technology:
Worst place to work in IT. No respect for work, never given resources to do good work. Typically 2 people will do work that Infosys bills 20 people to do. Not saying Infosys is efficient, but you get my drift. 

Culture:
No team culture, no fun events. Company very pushy for you to drink their cool-aid and conform. Company philosophy is - we hire smart aggressive people and they all can rationalize behavior to collaborate or backstab as needed to keep performing for money. Severely restricted internet access - no gmail, no nothing. 

Other cons:
will need to carry 2 phones. People will watch your movements - when you get up from desk, how much time you spend talking with someone etc. Company brings in foreigners (ex-pats) to show how its done. Some expats are great, but there are some who quickly realize 'our' cultural issues viz-a-viz white foreigners and exploit it mercilessly."

Technology wise it invests a lot. Very small things regarding office environment is taken utmost care of like clean desks, good chairs, clean cafeteria, separate microwaves for veg and non veg, good food (India) etc. That makes it feel good about being an employee at Goldman Sachs. People know about it and look at you as a person having their dream job. They even have a process on minimum and maximum AC temperature for office space. Many prefer minimum though. Great work environment. One can’t complain about that. They are one of the pay masters in the industry. They have Community team work (CTW) which happens once a year which gives one an opportunity to work for the community. The day is a paid working day but you are not working in office. All benefits are provided like cabs. This is part of a job role for VP (volunteered I think) to lead one of many CTW.","The work life balance is a mess. Normal expectation from the people is overtime everyday. Everyday overtime could be silent KPI for promotion.  Genuine escalations are fine but many unnecessary escalations at times. This comes from focus on small things, which is also a pro of the company. Focus is good but they tend to make it a big at times. Escalation is a pride from some - ""Today I escalated this issue"". Leaves are problems. They expect to continuously check emails during leaves. They name it BCP but I see it an inefficient collaboration within teams and handoffs. Favouritism is another setback for the company. As its workplace is mix of employee and contingent employees, there is yesmanship and flattering. Long meeting for brainstorming but landed nowhere.

8941,,Great Company ... but not for everyone,2015-05-01,3.0,Vice President,"I worked in the Technology division for 5 years.

1. I worked in the technology division of Goldman Sachs and i admire the smart people and technical courage of the company. The company truly believes in technology and is not afraid to build (and invest) in home grown products where all financial companies just live on the mercy of vendors and system integrator. You will be surprised at the scale and complexity of technical projects executed by Goldman on their own without the involvement of any vendor or service integrator.

2. They take great pride and ownership in their work. The company outsources very little and products receive great attention from everyone. Managers pay great attention to detail. Goldman definitely seeks perfection in what they do.","1. Get used to executive worship culture. Goldman have MDs and Partners and they are living Gods in the corridors. This create a culture of sycophancy and executive pleasing. I have seen people spend their days and nights not on working but pleasing.

2. Very New York Centered.  New York is the absolute power center and the managers there will share nothing with anyone else (even with other US cities). In other cities you don't have an authority to do anything without triple New York approval.

All important projects are completely controlled out of NY and if you are in other locations you will find that its hard to grow. (or even breathe).

3. Its a company which encourages a culture where people work 20 hours a day. It's common to see colleagues work nonstop from 6:30 AM to Midnight.

4. Organizational Arrogance: Management has very firm views on what needs to be done and you have little or no voice. It takes many years of service for anyone to have a voice in the company. Questioning or disagreement almost always is a career limiting (or ending) move.

This arrogance leads to a culture where people spend their entire culture building mega personas, and hyper images of themselves. Its a culture where snobbery thrive.

5. Very rigid organizational rules: Goldman follows lots of processes and governance models around IT. These models are so rigid that even small tasks can take many months of back and forth wrangling between IT and governance teams. This is why executing even small projects takes 10 times the effort it would take in a easy going organization."

8994,,An Open and Honest Review,2015-03-31,3.0,Senior Financial Analyst,"-  Practical financial work that one can apply to their own life (taxes, retirement planning, cash flow planning, etc.)

-  A decent first job out of undergrad (assuming you graduated from a non-target undergrad where Goldman, McKinsey, hedge funds, Google, etc. do NOT recruit).    

-  Ayco is a wholly owned subsidiary of Goldman Sachs, so you get the name on your resume with some benefits (employee discounts, etc.).  Ayco employees can be found in the Goldman Sachs internal employee directory, and a lot of you're employment paperwork is on GS letterhead, so I guess they're technically GS employees.  

-  Can be a great experience, but it all depends on who's team you're placed on.  If you work under a VP who's understanding and compassionate about the well-being of others, then you'll have an okay time and might even enjoy yourself.  I'd say I had a good time.

-  Ultimately, wealth management is a sales job (depends on person if a pro or con).  If you make it to VP, be prepared to be a salesman.  However, you're pretty much handed rich clients, rather than cold-calling, so that's one thing really good about Ayco.  The hard part is making it to VP.  If the business is there, then you'll be rolling in the dough as a VP (but probably traveling and working a lot as well).","-  If placed on a team with a ""grinding"" VP, be prepared to hate your life.  You'll literally get called on holidays and asked to come into the office.  An analyst in my office was called into work on Mother's Day while he was out with his family, and he was an hour and a half away from the office.  Also, if you plan on moving up to the VP level, you're expected to come in before your superiors and leave after your superiors (which is understandable, especially in a ""face-time"" focused industry like finance).  You're also expected to say ""yes"" to anything asked of you, including the anecdote mentioned above.  Office politics is heavy; there's a lot of brown-nosing and kissing up.  However, office politics is probably true of any work environment, especially finance;  so everyone on Glassdoor complaining about how the politics suck at Ayco should stop complaining and grow up.  Social politics is a part of life. 

-  For a wealth management firm, Ayco places an unreasonable amount of time into the tax planning and tax return preparation of clients.  If you're in the Financial Counseling division, I'd say that 75% of the work you do is tax related.  The job is not as investment heavy as it is played out to be.  As an analyst right out of undergrad (no CPA or any prior tax experience), you'll be preparing ultra complex tax returns for clients that involve multi-state sourcing of stock options and restricted stock grants, foreign income and foreign tax credits, etc.  In addition, a good number of associates in the ""tax department"" do not even have a CPA, nor do the VPs.  Pretty much, you'll be doing CPA level work for cheap.  I don't understand why Ayco places so much emphasis on taxes; I don't believe it adds much value to the bottom line of the firm.  If the wealth management divisions of Bulge Bracket Banks (Goldman Sachs [the REAL one], UBS, Morgan Stanley) are thriving with major AUM, have healthy profit margins, and aren't focusing on preparing tax returns, I do not buy the argument that Ayco makes that doing taxes ""keeps us closer to our clients.""  Instead of spending so much time and emphasis on taxes, Ayco can spend more time on bringing in new business and AUM.  I'm open to other arguments.

-  The pay is extremely low for the amount of work you're expected to do.  You'll pretty much work Wall Street hours for 1/5th of the Wall Street analyst pay, and you won't have the exit opportunities that they have.

-  Morale is extremely low.  Every analyst who isn't trying to make VP (I'd say about 80% aren't trying to make VP) is pretty much fed up after 1 year and start looking for a new job.  However, it's frustrating because wealth management skills don't really transfer to any other industry besides wealth management.  I'd say the low morale is a result of the low pay, corporate culture, and lack of employee perks compared to other companies (I hear of a lot of places that serve free lunch everyday and give every other Friday off).

-  SORRY FOR ANY GRAMMATICAL/SPELLING ERRORS.  I KNOW ANYONE WHO DISAGREES WITH WHAT I HAVE SAID WILL PROBABLY TRY TO USE MY GRAMMAR AS AN AD HOMINEM.  NOT HERE TO WRITE AN ACADEMIC ESSAY, JUST GET MY POINTS ACROSS."

9036,,A good starter job.   A technologists view of GS.,2015-03-09,3.0,Anonymous Employee,Above average pay.  Training that you won't get anywhere else on a variety of technical and nontechnical topics.  Benefits are very good.  People are smart.,"In the technology division of Goldman, they have racked up tremendous technical debt.  That debt needs to be repayed and the current work reflects that.  Plan on spending a lot of time doing technical support and learning a lot of code that is not well-documented.  Plan on fixing bugs and doing a lot of ""uplift"" work.  If you are lucky, you may get to do some new development - but probably not for a few years.

Goldman technology has had a lot of attrition the past 2 or 3 years - people getting fed up with the status quo.  Management doesn't appear to be doing much about it.  Their new strategy seems to be to drive their senior engineers out of the organization and replace them with younger, low-cost engineers that they can work to death and hold a work visa over their heads.

Goldman hasn't had a really good year income-wise, since 2009.  When you are interviewing, they will sell the ""bonus"" as a significant part of your total compensation.   But, the bonus is directly related to the firms earnings for the year and less related to the great work you did that year.  You could be a super hero engineer one year, but if the firm did badly that year, plan on a small bonus.  On the other hand, you could have a less than stellar year with the firm performing well, and get a good bonus.  My experience was that I got a good bonus a couple of years and a less-than-inspiring bonus on the other years.

They talk a good talk about work-life balance, making you believe that is part of the corporate culture.  Don't believe it.  Once you get to the VP level and above, you will need to sell your soul to GS to continue to move up the corporate ladder.   If you don't care about having a life outside of work and your family is a low priority, you will do very well at GS.  Also be sure that you have very good skills playing ""corporate games"" and politics as you move up the ladder.  Those skills become very important.  If you are a good smoozer, you will do well.  If not, plan on being treated badly enough that you will choose to leave on your own.

Goldman rarely fires people.  Their strategy is to level off your salary and stop paying you bonuses, until you leave on your own.  It's a lot cleaner that way.  No lawsuits to worry about for wrongful firing.   GS is always looking to ""manage risk"", even when it comes to their people.

Finally, the most important thing.  Make sure you have a great relationshsip with your direct manager.  GS does a ""360 degree review"", but 350 of those degrees are the opinion of your direct manager.  Even if 15 of your peers think you are a superstar, you will not got a good ranking, if your direct manager thinks you are lacking.   By the way, a poor ranking against your peers translates into getting passed over for a bonus.

Summary -  Join GS right out of college, work 4 or 5 years, get trained, get some experience, get GS on your resume and get out.  A smart strategy for the smart engineer."

I have seen people clocking 12 hours consistently for week after weeks for no apparent reasons (not that they are overworked or anything, that's just the way they roll ) One reason might be that  Managers look at how many hours you are spending in office rather than the actual amount of work that you have done in a day.
2. Pay package: I had heard Goldman pays way above industry average. Didn't happen in my case (may be depends on profile or negotiations at the start).
3. Appraisal system: Seems very rigged to me. Basically it is like 360 degrees but if you know people (if you have good networking skills) then it is just like asking for testimonials from your friends on Orkut (RIP).
4. Hiring process: Won't comment about campus hires, but for laterals, they just take way too long to arrive at a decision. People are kept on hold for 2-3 months.

* Professional and very diverse
* Great job security for good performers
* Some truly great managers","* Technology division still not seen as a revenue-generator, nor core enough to the business, and relatively poorly compensated
* Still somewhat bureaucratic -- arbitrary non-meritocratic guidelines set by HR (minimum experience required for promotions etc)
* Proprietary and non-transferrable technologies -- makes technologists not want to stay for too long
* Huge lack of transparency into employee compensation -- person next to you could be just as good but get 40% less/more
* Mostly only the top 1% are paid better than other banks"
9128,,Operations Summer Analyst,2015-01-16,2.0,PWM Operations Summer Analyst,"Prestige and pumps up your resume. I got all my interviews with other companies mostly because Goldman was in my resume.

Trust me, rejecting the offer was the best thing i could have done. Not having a job is scary but Goldman helped me land a top tier job. You can greatly leverage this internship experience with any company.","Operations requires no skill and is absolutely unrewarding. You will write e-mails and create projects for internal use, no revenue generating. Higher management is unimpressive and I cant see anyone in the office being able making a sale, close a deal, or analyze financial data. 

Don't be fooled, Goldman people are impressive and sharp in IB, Sales, Research, and several other divisions, but being in Operations is like if you were working for an entirely different company.

Of course there are smart people in there, but i will bet a million bucks that if you gave them the chance to go back in time, most of them would have not taken the offer and would be better of somewhere else. Don't be scared to reject the offer, but if you accept it make sure you understand what you are going into. 

Great job for anyone that comes from a low-tier school, they recruit from great schools and from very weak ones. If your school has a name or is prestigious I wouldn't take the full time offer, leverage it.

 You are and will be a secretary for the business side if you stay in operations, that's the ugly truth.

DO internal mobility, that's the best shot at another division."

9165,,Technical Analyst,2014-12-24,2.0,Technical Analyst,"- People are nice and friendly. Throughout ~2 years I've only heard my manager yelled once (at someone else), and he immediately felt bad and apologized. However I've heard different stories on the trading floor since the pace/environment is more stressful there
- I can feel that almost everybody who is successful at GS are very very similar in personality, manner and in their ways of doing things. I think in order to become successful at GS you must become one of those ""polished"" political figures - great at talking, great at selling yourself, great at doing things that make your managers notice you, great at networking and befriending everybody around you. I just don't think I am a great fit for that but if that's what you want to become, working at GS would help you achieve that really fast.","- Low salary compared to the rest of the industry. When I was interviewing for other Tech companies (Google, FB) while at GS, after I report my current salary to their the compensation team they all say that this is way below the industry and they will just disregard that while calculating my package. My offer from those two places is more than twice as much as what I am being paid at GS (which is around mid 80s)
- Not much focus in Technology. Can't blame them. You are not driving the revenue. As an application developer I am usually being grouped to the ""IT guys"" and asked to fix their keyboards. 
- Too much focus on soft skill. When I was at my training, our mentor was some guy who is very smart but a little lacking in manners. He would be wearing rather casual and messy clothes, and usually not very good at saying fancy welcoming words. All my peers however seem to disregard him as ""one of the worst mentor ever"" ""cannot possibly represent GS"", although this person possesses really great technical skills and passed me some really great knowledge.
- Technology wise, the place is rather dysfunctional. Many people leave and come so often, so there are always codes lying around not being maintained properly. The project I worked on for a whole year and only have 10 users and no one seems to care. When discussing visions of some potential new projects my team would be launching, manager is always talking about how they can ""convince"" the business people who decides the annual budgets, while rarely talks about if it would really be helpful to the users.
- In the technology division a lot of senior people are in fact very smart and have strong background. but in the recent years the newer recruits, there are less people who are actually smart and passionate about technology, most of the really talented ones go for somewhere else that pays way more."

If working in front office teams you will have plenty of exposure to the business side of things.,"As with many large organisations, the experience of working at Goldman Sachs is greatly dependent on which team you end up working for, since the style, culture, and compensation varies wildly between teams. In terms of compensation, the business-aligned divisions will be a lot of better off.

In technology, it is extremely painful to get any change approved, due to the many layers of management and bureaucracy. Also, the software development practices used in certain front office teams are truly shocking - hardly any unit testing, no collaboration.

Technology processes are heavy in bureaucracy - to some extent this is understandable, but this impacts productivity. The number of meetings that one has to attend sometimes tends to take focus away from the job. It is very difficult to get something done unless you are in the top echelons of the management - even though there is a lot of emphasis on people being driven and motivated.

Unless you're in the top 2 quartiles, you're severely limited in terms of compensation, promote-ability, mobility - for YEARS (last 2+ years of quartile rank is questioned so have a bad year and you've set yourself back a minimum of 2 years). A lot of closed-door negotiation happens to shift people in and out of quadrant ranks and it has little to do with their performance review.
Incredibly slow-moving in terms of progress because of the layers upon layers of bureaucracy and antiquated systems and processes. 
Unwillingness of technology senior management to negotiate with their business partners and push back on unrealistic demands on ever-constricting and conflicted supply. Lack of planning or commitment to quality results in an expectation of longer hours, on-call status, and overall acts of heroism.
In terms of Technology, GS is about 2-5 years behind the mainstream; lots of legacy systems, code, mindsets, skills, practices, procedures. It's easy to be come technologically irrelevant the longer one stays at GS in a Technology role.
Widespread hubris. Most of the senior managers have been at GS for their entire careers (20+ years) and therefore a ""not-invented-here"" attitude is apparent.

9300,,The price of success,2014-09-14,1.0,Senior Software Developer,"So what's it like working for Goldman Sachs? Well, first things first, I worked in one department of one of the many divisions of GS. GS is a company of well over 30,000 employees. Each division is like a company in and of itself, so generalising an experience even within a single division is fraught with issues, so you'll have to take my words in that very narrow context.

The Good
Probably the best thing about this company is that it is very pro-diversity. They want to create a work environment that mirrors the real world on the outside and they are keen to tap the brain power of the diversity that's out there. While I don't particularly care to know at work what someone gets up to in their own downtime, it's likely to be reassuring to others who are LGBT or of other diverse backgrounds who are looking to their own futures within the firm. To reinforce the firm commitment, it is mandatory for employees to complete a minimum of 2 hours annual diversity training.

I'd say that every person I met at GS was top notch. There are no village idiots or jokers lurking anywhere. Professionalism is at the core of being a successful employee. I always got the feeling I was rubbing shoulders with the 'A' grade crowd...the Ivy Leaguers. Almost everyone is uber smart and hyper keen. If you have an issue and you need someones help, then most people (though not all) you talk to will make it their mission to help you out.

The corporate gym is very well equipped. Great machines, great classes to attend and cheap membership gives you an Rebok-like experience at about half the price. It's a bit weird the first few times you go as GS optionally lends you a gray t-shirt, gray shorts and white socks to sweat you stuff in so no need for you to bring in your smelly sweats to the office (but you will need your own training shoes as thankfully they are not provided). Membership includes your own private locker but I never used mine as I'd never want to leave anything sweaty in a locker overnight! Since everyone uses GS sweats, this culminates in a complete lack of gym clothing diversity...it's a sea of gray and you feel like platoon infantryman as you wander round the gym floor.","The Bad
Work-life balance. Depending on the division you work in will have a great bearing on how hard you will be expected to work. Miraculously the department of the division I was in is somewhat chilled out compared to all other parts of the firm I heard about. Most of my colleagues were averaging about 45 hours per week. That's almost unheard of in GS most colleagues in different divisions were putting down 16 hour days every day as a norm.

When you exit the building at 6.30pm of an evening on your way home, you will pass a swarm of busy bees carrying bags of takeaway food re-entering the building on their way back to their desks for another 4 or 5 hours of work. These are the eager beavers and the company rewards this kind of hard work when bonus season comes round in February. If you're not one of these people, then chances are your career is unlikely to reach the stars to say the least. A 55 hour week is at the very bottom end of the “hard work” spectrum. Read the Forbes article about Liz Beshel to see what the commitment level for success really is at GS if you plan to go beyond the stratosphere at GS.

The Ugly
Almost every big corporate company shares the same ""hard work"" traits, but GS effortlessly manages to up the ante to another level:
1) You are always available even when you're on vacation because of the Blackberry phone

You are always just a phone call or an email away from being brought into help solve the latest problem no matter what hour of the day is or what plans you made with your family this weekend. 

Logging in from home in the weekday evenings and on weekends like everyone else does is a basic norm at GS

Not responding to a weekend crisis due to a trip away with the family is something to avoid. The company expects performers to be available at all times

2) When you join the firm you will spend one day going through 'orientation', effectively being indoctrinated in all things GS. During this day, you will learn (among other things) about the strength of the GS 'posting culture'. They tell you that everyone posts constantly and it is expected that you will post constantly as well.  

Due to the ""posting"" culture at GS, your inbox will quickly overflow every single workday so mastery of Outlook will go some way towards managing it, but in reality, most folk put in additional evening work hours to get on top of it all. The signal to noise ratio is generally appalling from middle management upwards.

3) As if email traffic wasn't a bad enough problem to manage, they have recently added 2 more mountains for the GS information worker to scale, neither of which are inter-connected. 

i. First up, GSConnect is the internal social network – think Facebook meets LinkedIn meets Goldman Sachs (It's built on top of the popular Jive social platform). This is a reputation (points) based platform for everyone to hear about what everyone else is up to in the firm and chime in with comments, articles, advice and tips. 

For many folk at GS, this is a great means for marketing ones own skills within the firm. Being seen to continually contribute to the team and the firm will get you noticed. But like any social platform it is a double edged sword that could easily destroy ones reputation in a heartbeat. Not being seen to actively contribute will come back to haunt the employee at review time and therefore at bonus time.

ii. Second up, LiveCurrent is the new instant chat program that you will need to be seen participating in. This is a place to share information in a more immediate manner with the GS hive. It's nothing more than chat rooms. LiveCurrent is a basic annoyance as pop up toast interrupts the working day continuously with banal updates from various leaders

4)  GS meetings are primarily all about asking questions. If you want to succeed at GS, you need to practice this art to perfection. Unfortunately most meetings are a waste of time but there is no throttle to control them other than to decline them, but not seen to be participating will come at a price during the annual review process. Most meetings result in more noise be it email trail, GSConnect or LiveCurrent - trying to stay on top of the noise is challenging to say the least.

5) Consensus driven culture. The orientation day will inform you that there is no such thing as a 'star' performer at GS because everyone operates in a team and therefore the team is the 'star'. Not only that, but you will now have to get used to “building consensus” on a very regular basis. You will get praise for being seen to round up the herd and get buy in from everyone for decisions of any magnitude and that is the problem. Typically (outside of GS), most people naturally seek consensus when there are big decisions, but GS has promoted consensus building to a first class citizen within the firm so even small decisions get quickly bogged down with the basic requirement to build consensus. 
 
6) The 360 degree annual review. This is a 2 month gruelling process imposed on everyone at GS that is taken very seriously by all. It is essential to have mended all fences with your colleagues at least 2 months before the review process starts or suffer the the wrath of their short term memory. The official word from management is that the review process does not affect your bonus which is very hard to believe.

7) Unofficially, GS has currently different levels that are **due to be disbanded**. The levels are as follows: Analyst, L1, L2, L3, M1, M2, Partner. If you are being hired currently, be sure to ask the level you are being hired in at because they won't tell you unless you ask and it will take you a month or so after being hired before you find out and this information and by then it will be too late to change it (you will have to wait for the annual promotions for which you have to be nominated first). To give you an idea, L2 is someone with 5 years experience. Levels are not advertised internally at all, so you will have no idea what level other people are at unless you have the conversation. Being hired in at the right level will influence the compensation bracket you fall into, so it's reasonably critical to know - you want to come in at a level that truly reflects your skills and abilities. A key point to make here is that the levels are due to be disbanded very soon (or it may already have taken place since I am an ex-employee). It's worth mentioning that VP (Vice President) is merely a badge of honor at GS, not a level as just discussed. Therefore, it is of no consequence to your compensation, so bartering for VP with HR is nowhere near as important as bartering for level since only the latter will have any impact on your compensation profile. So now you know.

8) With no one knowing what level anyone else is at, you won't be surprised to hear that GS has no org-chart. So you will have no idea who reports in to who. This can be very confusing and the idea is to reduce structure in a bid to allow ideas to easily bubble up. If you are used to a classical hierarchy where you report into one boss who defines what is required of you then beware as it doesn't work like that at GS.

When you add up the time spent processing the ever flowing fountain of information you will soon notice that you have no time to do the job you were actually hired for unless you plan on working evenings because only then can you actually get some work done once the crescendo of information dies down for a few precious hours. Stealing your way into work by 7.30am will also buy useful time before the noise starts up again.

With the banking sector having effectively destroyed itself from its own deregulated excesses of the 2000 era, it's worth noting that remuneration packages were substantially reduced as a result. It's fair to say that most employees will not climb any higher than middle management (L2 is the defacto level at GS) and it's only after middle management that game changing compensation starts to kick in. Assuming you were to get to that point, consider carefully the time that will need to be sacrificed in your life (especially family life) and weigh up the pros and cons. If you get an offer from GS then that itself tells you something useful: you are by definition a high calibre individual since very few candidates get an offer from GS. With that in mind, why not consider channeling your highly rated skill-set (and GS are excellent at gauging skill-sets) into joining a fun start-up (GS is not a fun place to work by the way)? Or if you have a ground breaking idea, why not do you own startup?"

They almost brag about their ability to pay the lowest possible amount to keep an employee.  I advanced several times, and my pay always seemed to be about the same.  It is hard to justify an increase in responsibility, time, and expectation without compensation being reciprocated.  
Secondly, the reviews are a farce.  Your manager, who gathers all the reviews from your peers, has the ultimate deciding factor of what your final score will be.  They can drop it to whatever they want regardless of your peer ratings.  I have sat in review sessions and watched this very thing happen."

You will never be bored. You will always be challenged intellectually.,"In the past 2 years there has been an increased number of leaders leaving on their own. Most believe the reason is what those that are still here see, an abrupt flat compensation. If you are a new joiners or just out of college, chances are you're going to get paid just a bit more than OK, but not great. Mostly in the form of a bonus. This is greatly because the firm needs to compete with other companies that pay better. Once you've been here more than a couple of years, your total comp starts to quickly plateau. Only about 10% of people that joined alongside you will actually reach a level of leadership that will get paid well consistently.

While people do still get promoted and are given some resemblance of leadership (oversee a project or 2-3 people) the true leadership aka mgr roles get filled from outside. So, if you have a 2-3 year plan its good. If you have a 5-10 year plan be ready to either be disappointed or snuggle up next to a mgr that influences careers.

Great benefits (401k matching, great health care/dental/vision), short commute times if you manage to avoid SLC rush hour traffic/ winter storms","As with most reviews, work life balance is abysmal, especially if you want to move up. Once you're given a blackberry, there is no excuse for not being available or responding to emails while you're not in the office. The monetary rewards can be amazing, but were not worth giving up my personal life and personal time, in my own opinion. 

Ideas for change are welcomed, but a very corporate culture can make it difficult to get things accomplished and changed. Managers can be very forgetful and have to be reminded of things everything. When they forget something, they blame you for not remembering for them.  Credit to the individual is thrown out the window as everything is focused on how the team does, however coworkers will take credit for your work with your direct manager if you don't raise your hand say you did X task. 

Analyst pay is very low which quickly hurts morale. Compensation has taken a hit in the recent years, although the executives in New York have gotten compensation increases. 

Operations is heavily dependent on I.T., however the communication is very difficult and I.T. is so backed up, it can take months before they get to a request of yours. 

Perks have been reduced to the point where ""Jeans Day"" is the highlight of the quarter. The office is not client facing therefore business casual clothes is not always required. Let all Fridays be jeans day. Christmas, Halloween, etc, have all been cancelled at the office. Anyone who decorates their area that is festive with the season will get a stern talking to by the closest Managing Director. Its like they suck the little bit of fun you would think you're allowed to have out of the work place.

One can take sick days as needed, however if you miss more than 1 day and you're not dying or in the hospital, your work starts to get distributed to other team members. This creates a stigma that you're not that sick and can still work from home. So although you're able to take sick days, it's looked down upon when you take more than 1 at a time for something that does not require hospitalization."

Most people were smart enough, but they didn't seem to be anything exceptional.  If anything, the experience gives you the sense that smartest guys on Wall Street really aren't that clever.

The importance of teamwork at GS is not overstated; people are all willing to help each other.","At this time, there are too many regulatory requirements that GS needs to comply to, meaning a lot of resources are spent on reg related projects, and not so much on other innovative profitable projects."

9517,,not the firm it once was,2014-03-01,3.0,Vice President,Plenty of smart people remaining; their proprietary technology is interesting,"l left GS after working for 10+ years in their tech division. Here are a few reasons why : 

Standards are slipping. In the past 5 years, many jobs such as DBAs and SAs have been off-shored to India to save money. Turnover in these locations is high and the quality of the staff is often lacking. lt's rare to find anyone in these roles who is skilled and takes a genuine interest in what they're doing.

The amount of regulation and red tape has reached absurd levels. A simple task such as getting a server rebooted becomes a bureaucratic nightmare, involving multiple levels of manager approval followed by repeated emails, phone calls and hours of waiting. Don't even think about downloading a cool piece of productivity software onto your PC. You'll first need to check whether the app has been approved for use at GS, then get your manager to sign off, and finally open a ticket to have it installed remotely. If your app isn't on the approved list, forget it.

By the way, India is never, ever referred to as a ""low cost"" location at GS - it's ""high value"", to use the correct GS-speak, To survive in the corporate hierarchy, you'll also need to learn how to ""reach out"" to somebody (= talk to them), to ""revert"" to an email (= reply), and how to ""leverage"" virtually any object (= use it), I know GS doesn't have a monopoly on this sort of double-speak, but I always find it faintly worrying to see how otherwise intelligent people parrot these tired phrases without a hint of irony or self awareness.

Perhaps the most-used buzzword in recent years is ""industrialization"" - as in replacing human jobs with software, Management claim that industrialization will free people from routine or boring jobs, allowing them to spend time in more creative activities (there's never been an attempt to automate any MD- or partner-level jobs, although those are probably the most amenable - wonder why ??) 

It's difficult to criticize GS for wanting to cut costs, but it's dispiriting to think that your job in IT is essentially to put other people out of a job. Earlier in my career, GS was about using harnessing human intelligence to solve complicated business problems (and being paid well, because we were doing something that few others firms could). Increasingly we seem to be engaged in a race to the bottom, chasing ever-shrinking margins with as few overheads as possible, The relentless drive for efficiency makes for a pretty unappealing work environment - desks have been ""densified"" (another lovely GS-ism), office plants have been removed, and even the waste baskets have vanished. 

Don't expect to be be particularly well paid. I guarantee that you will quickly become fed up of reading about the ""average"" GS bonus payout in the media, and then having to explain to friends and family that you're only paid a fraction of that amount. I used to be proud of the fact that I worked as GS, now I try to avoid mentioning the name,

The annual 360 reviews can also be pretty dispiriting. Over the years I've had reviews across the scale. Doing well seems largely to be a question of being in the right role and knowing the right people. Don't fall for the rhetoric about meritocracy - working hard and doing a good job is no guarantee of success. Personally i'd far rather the whole system were junked - I've had to deliver a few bad reviews in my time, and it's unpleasant and often utterly demotivating for the recipient.

Oh, and prepare for endless cheerleading about the benefits of diversity and multiculturalism. The training is mandatory, so no sense complaining. But the sad reality is that ""diversity in the workplace"" often translates into hiring candidates who simply wouldn't have made it through the door 10 years ago.

I loved my early years at GS, but I would not be tempted to re-join the firm today."

9523,,GS Operations is a great place to start If you want to be in finance or you don't have a plan out of college,2014-02-23,3.0,Associate,"A little background about myself, I worked in the Salt Lake City Office which has grown to be the second biggest location in the United States and my entire career was in Operations Division.  Please take that into account.  I can't speak for Sales, Trading, or any other division outside of having to deal with them on a regular basis to get work done nor can I talk about the other office locations outside having visited a few and all are different.  Ops is great in that you can learn a lot of transferable skill sets and abilities that you can take to almost any job.  You are only niched into ops by your own lack of creativity if you think that ops is a dead end career choice post college.  I hope this helps puts things in perspective for a lot of you.  I still believe that overall this is a great place to start a career although I would doubt that its a place where people ultimately make their careers (at least in Ops).

Some Pros about GS is that

- Professional growth
If you don't know what you want to do in life running through the gauntlet that is Goldman Sachs is a smart move to build up your professional profile and skill set.  You will be forced into situations that take you out of your comfort zone and if you are lucky you will have some good people around you to help you prepare and learn from those experiences.  Every situation is treated with highest professional manner and everything you do is expected to be of the highest quality of work.  Every report should be accurate and concise, every email professional in tone and content, every analysis has every angle covered with good presentation and the appropriate content for the audience.  Everything matters and you better be sure your work is up to grade.  Don't be scared they will understand you are new to this the first few times you make a mistake.

- Smart people all around you
If you haven't realized it by now you will shortly that you are rarely the smartest person in the room (if you are currently that will change at GS).  These people are smart.  Very smart.  You can pull the wool over their eyes once or twice or maybe get by for awhile with a manager that doesn't care but in the long run (year or longer) you will be exposed.  Thats ok, you don't always have to be the smartest in the room you just can't take it personal every time someone calls you out in public or private and get better.  Again, this is Ops not other divisions.  Ops is not out to call you out every time you make a mistake or criticize you on every idea.  They do it its because the firm benefits more when your mediocre idea is vetted with other smart people and becomes a great proposal.  Don't take it personal. 

- High stress environment 
This is a pro and a con.  If you can handle a high stress environment you will thrive.  If you can't you will learn to or you will be looking for a new job shortly after joining.  GS puts a lot of pressure on you really quick.  Like I said before, what you do matters and sometimes you have to make really hard decisions in short periods of time because market is closing or client is threatening a walk or your manager doesn't want to lose his or her head and needs you to crunch some numbers yesterday.  Just know that once you overcome these obstacles you will be better for it.

- Responsibility is high for junior individuals
Another pro and con.  Almost the same speech from high stress environment.  

- Mentors
Rest assured the really good managers at GS (and they exist) understand that good junior analysts need good mentors to show them the ropes and take them under their wing.  GS will even match you up with one if you haven't found one on your own.  Just know that its on you to follow up with them and if you are smart you will have more than one and they will be strategically placed in positions that you can leverage.  Reach out to them, gain their insight and heed their advice because they have been there longer than you and guess what they are still there and successful so they must know what they are talking about.  Just don't restrict yourself to one, get many and get them from backgrounds that you are not comfortable with.  More perspectives will often change your own on a situation.  Take this advice; man walks in a desert when he surrounds himself with people that think and act like him.","- Work/Life balance
Forget it, you won't have one.  You work 10 hour days on a good day and 15+ on a bad day.  Your dog will drown in anxiety or chew up your sneaker collection, your wife will hate your job, your kids will wonder if you love them and your friends will inevitably people that work with you or in the same industry.  Assuming of course you are on the path to success at the firm.  Otherwise you may be able to pull off weekend getaways, the occasional afterwork drink and hey maybe even the gym to burn off all those donuts you ate your desk.

- High stress environment
Read above but if you can't handle being in a stressful, high strung, alpha environment where everything you do matters than please save yourself the therapy sessions and medical costs and try something else.

- The actual work can be boring
Yeah it sucks, especially at the analyst level.  Guess what? Processing transactions, data entry, project testing, trade settlement, account opening, etc all suck. They are not fun.  Not even a little.  But it gets better... you know when you are an Associate and you are leading a team of analysts doing something they hate for that almighty dollar.

- Corporate politics
This is not unique to GS.  For those that are in college are have never worked at a large organization please mentally prepare yourself for the office politics.  They are there and you are playing whether you like it or not.  You can choose not to play and hope by the good graces of Allah and Blankfein that you are noticed for your good work but I have a higher chance of getting that 10 at the gym to ask me out on date.  You are going to have to play.  Marathon some Suits on USA and learn up on office politics and keep yourself out of the crosshairs as much as you can.  Build friendships and network, don't through people under the bus, and don't take credit for someone else's work and you will be fine.  This is where a mentor will do you well.

- Compensation
Analyst level it sucks and you will kick yourself for it.  Stick it out and get lucky that the firm has a great year and you too can have a great year.  Just remember its based on how well the firm did, how well your business unit did, and how well you did.  Oh and you are also in ops which is at the end of the day a cost and not a revenue generating arm of the firm and so you will never get rich until you make MD.  Well off at VP but not rich.

- Senior Leadership
How can I say this.  Just because Michael Jordan was arguably the best player ever... doesn't mean he is a great coach.  Phil Jackson was a mediocre player and well look what he accomplished.  GS traditionally promotes Jordan's to management so prepare yourself. 

- Accountability
You should definitely have this.  Some people won't and some people will.  Sadly you will find there are large groups in GS Ops that are not.  You can't change them and unfortunately those that don't are what slows down good businesses.  Be accountable and you will be surprised on how fortunate that will be for you.  Heck, be accountable for other people, it shows leadership and managers will recognize that.

- Can't trade (oddly a big downer)
GS Ops cannot trade on personal accounts.  Well you can but only if you first check with your manager, the compliance lists and your mom.  Sadly almost every company is on some list that restricts you from trading.  Get used to indexes and big funds.  Its like working for Sam Adams and company policy says you cant drink... ever without asking them first.

- Grindhouse mentality for some areas
There are areas of GS Ops that are quite literally grindhouses.  They take you in, chew you up, and then spit you out when you are done.  Then they go out and get the next college kid and repeat.  Sorry its just how it is.  Learn what you can and transfer to another area if you want or leave but its their business model and it works for management."

I can say that the company culture is very inclusive and open. The organization is as much of a meritocracy as you can get. Most people who produce good results are rewarded for it.

The wealth of knowledge that the business leaders have is unbelievable, and if you can manage to schedule some time with them, you'll probably learn more about the industry than you could anywhere else.","Constant fear. Every person in the office I worked in in Salt Lake knew that only a few missteps could cost them their job. Once a year management picks a bunch of employees they want to replace and walks them out the door (keep in mind, these are all brilliant, hard-working people). Management will remind you of these routine expulsions as means of motivation. Working at Goldman is an intense scramble to be better than your co-workers, because you know that if they happen to be better than you, you will be treated as expendable. I was more anxious and stressed at Goldman than I've ever been in my career, and developed constant, throbbing headaches and had a very hard time sleeping. If management thinks they can replace you with someone better, they won't hesitate to do it. Firing dedicated employees is a very common and cavalier occurrence at Goldman.

A culture of rudeness and extreme passive-aggressive behavior is pervasive throughout the company. If someone thinks you aren't important, they often won't respond to your e-mails or calls, regardless of how desperately you need their help. This kind of behavior is completely accepted. Also, expect business leaders to be extremely critical and demanding."

Unlike GSPS which was spun out into asset management and a number of funds SSG is still a balance sheet business and thus has to bear the full brunt of the Volcker rule and all the capital changes and regulatory changes to banks. Getting deals and trades done has become extremely difficult. I wouldn't say they pay much less as a % of your profits than a few years ago, its just that there's hundreds of powerpoint slides and multiple layers of approvals to make those profits. It is unequivocally a bad place to be a liquid markets or event driven investor now due to the Volcker rule. Unfortunately SSG makes way too much money (both revenues and operating income) for the bank to give it up as yet hence this limbo of no one being able to leave due to stock vesting schedules and the bank's refusal to allow any mobility outside the group into GSAM.

The performance evaluation is rather subjective, unlike what they told you, it's not linked to your compensation in most cases - people who scored high in their review could still get very little based on how much you're 'favoured' by the management. 

Career development completely depends on your boss, and your boss' boss: if you have a supportive manager in career development and guides you about promotion do's and don'ts, it's great. Otherwise you have to fight for yourself. Worst of all, some managers would actually prefer keeping you working on the same stuff for years and stop you from moving to other teams.

3. You get to put on different hats. I am a low-latency c++ developer and I have worked from researching and requirement gathering directly from external client to doing development , deploying and testing with the client for user-acceptance. I have also managed a project.
4. People are in general helpful even in scenarios where they dont get credit for what they are helping out on.","1. The company especially the equity side is moving from a fast paced development centric division to consolidation and development with caution model.

If you are lucky like me you will end up in groups that strongly believe in testing. You can learn a lot about how to establish good working relationships with people you strongly dislike (a valuable skill in finance), and how to work with a large number of people at the same time because you will need to talk to them to be able to do your job (simply because basic procedures are not documented). Some managers know how to get things done, but manager quality is very inconsistent.","The amount of stress can be enormous. In terms of compensation - no raise over 3 years in spite of promotion from Associate to VP and then becoming tech lead for a very important team does not seem right. At bonus comp time the mix of stock and cash is unknown - which is very stressful. Other places make the mix ratio is predetermined.

Being the best on the street is not a substitute for paying people what they deserve.

Reason being there is no concept of work life balance here. The average working hours are 12-16  and may vary depending on the unrealistic deadlines that come your way. The strategy here is to really hire 3 people if there is a work which needs 10 resources and then screw the hired 3 resources to the maximum limits.

9870,,Run.,2013-02-21,1.0,Associate,"Great benefits and health care coverage; however, my boss would never let me use them. I could never get out of the office for a doctor visit, so the benefits really weren't worth it. I left the firm with the maximum number of vacation days I didn't have time to use. I guess at least I get paid for them when I leave.","Every negative rumor you have heard is true. This is a sweatshop. Employees are shuffled around like interchangeable pawns in a chess game. The hours are TERRIBLE even though the people I interviewed with touted the company's ""work/life balance"". I was told that they only pay 1/2 time for overtime to discourage overtime hours. Not true. I have seen people who web-surf most of the day applauded for the long hours they were putting in. Appearances are everything and you can plan on 50 hours a week as a minimum if you are lucky enough to join a group that is well-staffed. I was micro-managed (though that will depend on your division) and in looking for a new position, found that in Utah, experience with Goldman Sachs actually HINDERED my job search - significantly. The years I spent here have been worthless to me. Their roles are highly ""specialized"" meaning that you learn nothing about the broader industry and are basically a ticket puncher doing the simplest menial tasks until they figure out a way to automate your role and you are moved to man another conveyor belt. When I asked to work only a 10 hour day ONE day a week for personal reasons, I was repeatedly NOT accommodated. You can completely forget about any medical accommodation for hours, though they won't hesitate to give you a footrest or seat cushion. They may support you in theory, but not in practice. Turnover is very high (they lure you by saying that it's a competitive environment for the brightest minds and that only the best endure - not reality) and I know several people who have chosen to be unemployed rather than continue to work at GS. I worked for Operations for 2 years before moving to the Investment Management Division. Within one year in the Investment Management Division, I got over 25 ""farewell"" emails from people leaving the firm. The firm is lowering it's hiring standards wherever they can and in most of the hiring discussions I witnessed, the only basis for a decision to hire was whether or not the most senior interviewer ""liked"" the person. They are hiring from all different backgrounds and experience (which they explain as ""diversification"") and grade point average do not matter anymore. This is no longer the organization that hires ""the best of the best"". In New York, you are hired if you are from the right family with the right contacts. In Utah, you are hired if they like you.

There is a lot of schmoozers who hve spent years at the company are not getting fired because of the years spent.

Insecurity and incompetence at TI is at a very high level, other divisions are much better but TI does not have P/L valuation and has really diverged from the mainstream business (though this is true for most of the IT's in financials).

Young people are hired but not given challenges and opportunities.  They really hve to become schmoozers to get any recognition and spend 10 years to see growth (if they are not schmoozers).  If you are a schmoozer, you can make VP in 5-6 years.

Company is also known for hiding its titles, they tell you there are only Associates, Vice Presidents and Managing Directors.  Well, it turns out to become MD you have to go through 4 promotions from Vice President and each one takes two years (exceptions are possible but rare)."

You will probably get bored supporting existing legacy systems. The environment and culture are also very different. Technologies supported are old and (some) proprietary. Work hours are long, 12+ hours every day.

The career ladder forces people to choose at some point between the managerial or technology path. This is the only place in the industry where an excellent technical person can not also be a manager of a tech team. Everybody has to make a choice at some point about her/his career path and you end up having people that may not understand technology well, or are afraid of its challenges,  choosing the managerial path. Mid-level management inexperience is one of the biggest problems in the company. There is no career growth for technical people once they reach the senior levels of the VP position.

Be prepared to work with some people that are arrogant."

Great brand name to be in your resume.
You can take up as many responsibilities as you wish. You will be challenged every day.
Very team oriented culture. People work together to get things done rather than criticizing or playing the blame game.
You will learn to multi-task, manage time efficiently, prioritize your tasks, communicate with clients, interact with different stake holders, building really great technical systems","Absolutely humiliating compensation benefits. 99% of the revenues consumed by senior management. 
No rewards for your superior performance. Promotions are based on number of years you stay with the firm.
Most of the technologies used are outdated.
Senior Management keeps brain washing the employees in the name of long term career. There is absolutely no career growth.
I worked in Salt Lake City office. Most of the hires here are either consultants or new hires from local community colleges. If you are from a top ranking university, you will get into depression very soon.
SLC office culture is one of the worst. No work life balance. If you don't go to office by 7 am in the morning, you will have a meeting with your manager. Average work hours are 12-14 hours everyday. No overtime pay for technology employees. Production support can keep you awake through midnight and weekends. No work flexibility as well. You will have to give 100 reasons if you chose to work from home.
Every task is super critical and super sensitive. No room for mistakes. Do a small mistake and you will get criticized for that in your reviews. Deliver a mega project successfully, you will get hardly appreciated with a few good words and no other rewards.
They will keep saying that bonus is a huge part of compensation benefits which is a big lie. In my course of stay at GS, bonus was either zero or negligible. 
They will collect all the feedback from you but will never work on them. 
The salary for a new hire in SLC office in technology division is $30,000 after taxes. You have to ask yourself if you want to work for 14 hours daily for this salary."

The 80-100 hour weeks that I gave and the great performance reviews did not help me get closer to a promotion. The problem is that nothing produced in Salt Lake City generates any revenue, so it's the last place that rewards would be given.

There are people who work from home one day a week, have special schedules, etc.  the work is interesting and busy. The days go by quickly even though they are long. It seems like there is never a dull moment.  When I first started at GS 10 years ago, the work was like most entry level jobs, meaning there was a lot of repetitive day to day work. However, the work evolved over time just like any job and has become more analytical and value add.  There is a huge focus on diversity.","I have 4 direct managers who have different agendas and don't communicate well with each other leaving me with multiple competing tasks.  The firm works people long hours.  There are retention problems because of work life balance. The median age is 25 because the older folks with families can't make the hours work and still spend time with their kids.  While they claim that their culture is consensus driven, it has shifted over the years to be more directive.  They also tote that their employees are a most valuable asset but don't seem concerned with giving them more personal time.

10137,,Frustrating experience as a software engineer in Ops Technology,2012-04-07,2.0,Senior Analyst Developer,"- Plenty of growth potential (when the market is up)
- Competitive pay (when the market is up)
- Some very smart peers
- Exposure to people working in GS offices in almost all developed and many developing countries","- Politics, politics, politics
- Bad reputation in the world - e.g. regulatory, press, general reputation amongst people.
- The amount of red tape is astounding
- Very non-competitive pay in down years (essentially everybody took a large pay cut and many took a 20% or more 2011--no, that is not an exaggeration)
- In most groups within Ops Technology, software engineering and tech in general are very much a second-class citizen to banking and trading and it shows in the way the groups are treated.
- Long hours and very poor work-life balance.  Wide-spread acceptance of this as the standard operating procedure.  If people complain (and one needs to be careful to whom you complain), the typical response is something along the lines of ""this is Goldman Sachs.""
- That said, there are some very, very talented software engineers at GS (including and especially the CTO, who is on the board of the Java programming language).  But broadly speaking Ops Technology is not a very talented group.  Many of the very talented people are leaving, making things worse.
- The way layoffs are handled is very much without integrity.  When I first started with every person who was let go -- either fired or laid off for some reason -- there was an announcement and an explanation.  In 2011 there were so many rounds of layoffs (at least 3 major ones, and several smaller ones) management simply acted like nothing happened.  You might be in the middle of a project with somebody and send them an email only to get what we've jokingly started calling ""The Layoff Autoreply"" -- their mailbox is ""full"".  Invariably mailbox full meant it'd been disabled and the person was laid off.  No word from management.  Just an empty desk and bounced emails.  Asking a manager for details about so-and-so would only get a ""yes"" or ""no"" to the question of whether they still worked at the firm--no details, explanation, etc. so lower and middle management had clearly been instructed not to discuss in any detail.  So it ends up just ominous chatter and gossip about who is the most recent person to be laid off.  One can imagine what this does for morale...
- Steady trickle of technology jobs -- not just support roles, but real software engineering -- out of NYC to Salt Lake City or Bangalore.  They're euphemistically called ""high value locations"" in GS lingo.
- Production support at night and on weekends is very widespread.  It can easily ruin a weekend.  This is fine, but coupled with the machismo ""This is Goldman Sachs"" mentality, it means there's no comp time and frequently not even a ""thanks"" for sacrificing the weekend.
- A culture that encourages distractions.  Focusing on one thing for an extended period is very, very difficult.  The cubefarm is very loud -- you need noise cancelling headphones if you're easily distracted by loud chatter or phone calls nearby.
- Dated technology is very common.  I came to GS a few years ago expecting it to be a cutting edge place, but discovered my group had just switched to Java 5--in 2009!
- Budget cuts are brutal.  There's no more travel.  No more firm sponsored happy hours.  No Blackberries unless absolutely necessary.  There are zero perks now.
- There is currently (first / second quarter 2012) an exodus from Technology at GS -- the talented people are leaving for startups, tech firms, or hedge funds.  Google is the number one firm snatching up talent from GS, but there are many, many startups doing so too."

Expectations are high, and you will be challenged over and over to learn, teach and lead.  Teamwork is generally the norm, and everyone is expected to adhere to a pretty tough suite of policies and procedures, regardless of your practice area.   Starting salaries are high, and the benefits are very good -- if you make it a point to save and invest, you would be hard pressed not to accumulate wealth, even at an early stage of your career.","Goldman Sach's drive for excellence is legendary and while there is a great deal of commentary on achieving work/life balance, the scales always tip in favor of doing a great job.  While part-time and flexible work arrangements can be negotiated, it's almost never a good deal because while you give up a fixed percentage of salary and benefits, the work almost never is decreased in equal measure.

More distressing is the 360 review process, which gives the appearance of fairness, but in reality leaves a great deal of latitude in the hands of managers, who have budgets to meet, and who therefore tend to ""manage to the middle"".  The  evaluation process is politically motivated and treacherous, while under a veneer of ""meritocracy""  Thus, the performance of more experienced, higher paid employees is downgraded to put more in the pot for favorites who may not perform any better, and who may not coincidentally be white, male and younger employees."

Much of the decision making happens outside of India.
Too much bureaucracy and herd mentality. Managers just repeat whatever senior managers say -- in the name of consensus based decision making.
Not a company for true technologists or geeks -- since too many technical shortcuts are taken everyday succumbing to biz demands.

Very good benefits
A great place to work for anyone who wants to pursue a career in finance","Extremely political; don't come here if you don't know what to say when, how and to whom

Politics and the consensus principle are often hugely detrimental to innovation; the innovation process takes extremely long because of this; not recommended for innovators and/or impatient people

Long hours and below average pay (if you break it down to the hour); granted this is only from an Operations perspective, so other divisions might be different. I currently make somewhere between $11 (60 hour work week) and $15 (50 hour work week) an hour. I have an MBA and 5 years of work experience

Favoritism: Yes, there is a pretty good review process in place but being highly efficient and a good performer is not going to get you anywhere if you're not 'politically savvy'

10203,,Career platform still as good as ever,2011-12-27,4.0,Vice President,"I've been at GS since well before the firm went public in 1999.  Over that span of time its culture has remained remarkably strong and enduring.  Indeed, although there have clearly been ups and downs along the way, all the primary reasons for starting and building a career at GS remain just as relevant today as they have been for years.  Namely:

1. Strong culture of teamwork and collaboration.  People help each other out.  There is a significant focus on helping people succeed, and on nurturing and developing talent. This, in turn, drives some important aspects of the interviewing and hiring process.   Conceit is the enemy of collaboration.  If you are too convinced of the veracity of your own point of view, you will tend to undermine he team-oriented environment and the objective of getting to the best outcome on any given issue or decision. Therefore, a healthy measure of humility, balanced with a proper level of self-assurance, are key traits for successful candidates.

2. Training and Professional Development.  GS has a very extensive range of formal training offerings, although in this regard it does not differ materially from other large, leading organizations.  The more important element - and the one that will tend to play a much more relevant role in your career advancement - is the wider culture of coaching, mentorship and apprenticeship that exists in the firm.  It is a central element of the way GS works that people take an interest in teaching and developing those beneath them,  or even in other areas to whom they have only tangential connections.  While there are formal mentoring programs for summer interns and new permanent hires, the more enduring mentoring relationship are the ones that grow informally - and GS is very fertile ground for this.  Although the firm is now over 30,000 people, it retains the feel and intimacy of a much smaller firm.

3. Long term career platform.  I've worked in multiple divisions and regions with the firm.  Most managers' initial instincts are to fill open roles with talent already under the firm's roof.  Generally speaking,hiring is on such a scale that there is plenty of need to hire new people from outside the firm. However, the central point is that as an employee, you have access to a very wide variety of opportunities within GS and most people who've been at the firm for any length of time have typically been in a number of different roles or have moved around geographically.  Does it work perfectly? No - but an unusual effort is made at all times to get the right people into the right seats.  

4. Working with the best.  There really are some remarkable people at GS.  In many cases, people you work with are the most renowned at what they do in the world.  It will take your game to a new level.  I've worked personally with hundreds of GS people over time, in all kinds of functions and all kinds of places.  Contrary to popular external perception, the people are friendly and the atmosphere collegial.  While remarkably talented, people are also remarkably normal.  The kinds of people you would be pleased to have a beer with.","The firm is generally very thinly staffed.  When it works well, it provides for a rich and intense experience, rapid learning, great advancement in exposure and responsibility, and fewer people among whom to carve up the spoils. Rapid career advancement is more possible here than at many other places for this same reason.  When it does not work well, people are simply asked to do more than they are able to, which can lead to reduced morale and engagement.  The kinds of people hired by GS are those who strive for excellence.  When they are in such a position as to limit what they can accomplish to the merely ordinary, the drag on morale can be significant.

Although this aspect has improved over time, the firm still has a tendency to keep certain long-tenured senior managers for several years beyond their expiration date - well beyond the point where their contribution is particularly meaningful or positive."

On a bad year, you've probably put in many hours of work and not going to see a competitive income - that can be quite frustrating.","Work Culture - too many do's and don'ts with respect to how to talk , behave and ""play the game"". You always have to be vigilant of perception within the company. That reflects on your bonus.
