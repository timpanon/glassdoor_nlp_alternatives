0,,"Come for the golden handcuffs, but that's it",2022-04-14,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"You will get paid more here than anywhere else for an equivalent title, but that's it.","Upper management/leadership is abysmal, antiquated and completely lacking in emotional intelligence. The CEO is, I am convinced, a narcissistic sociopath who knows how to make money but not how to run a business and is completely out of touch with reality. In an all-company call one week he was feigning commiseration to his precious Loan Officers who were dealing with the ramifications of a third round of layoffs in as many months. ""When the company isn't profitable, no one is profitable. Not me, or any other execs."" On that same call just two weeks later, he spoke of the custom wood paneling he was getting for his home theatre (a $38M waterfront property in Miami Beach he purchased in 2021) and how he was shopping around for a new G wagon and had to have his assistant call several dealerships to find the one he wanted. He will openly berate employees by name on these same calls, then turn around and act appalled when he finds out his Loan Officers treat their teams abusively. 

Senior leadership at the departmental level is nepotistic and overpaid, with very little thought given to actual mentorship or guidance for their teams. Entire departments are dismantled or restructured when executives resign, only for even more silos to be created and employees bounced between supervisors with zero regard to how teams should actually be structured or what key functions are missing when they make new hires. The overlap in roles at the senior leadership level is murky at best, and a source of bottlenecking and confusion for anyone who tries to figure out ""who does what"" 99% of the time. If people knew how little planning goes into the non-sports marketing campaigns (and how little data is tracked.. I saw another review ask about ROI - ha!), they'd be floored.

Some teams pull 75-80% of the weight only to be completely left out of accolades or recognition, while those who continually drop the ball, have high turnover and retention issues, and garner numerous complaints about how they speak to people and handle situations are promoted and treated like the prodigal children. Some teams are left understaffed with open reqs for literal months, while others are able to make hires any time they get a new project that they don't know how to delegate to existing team members. 

See all of the reviews about working from home? Forget it unless you're in one of the departments that isn't micromanaged and under the unforgiving eye of the CEO and his Loan Officers - while many are still enjoying that perk, we were told 1-2 days per week, then a bait-and-switch was pulled and everyone is now required to come in to corporate 3 days per week. Meanwhile, the newly-hired CMO lives in Charlotte and hasn't even introduced himself to the general population of employees, and roughly/at least 60% of the senior leaders are also remote. Oh, and did I mention the CEO bought a home in Miami Beach and is hardly at corporate himself until weather in Chicago permits and he can be on his yacht with his buddies?

People pulling weight will be laid off without notice, all the while senior leadership and the Loan Officers are wondering why resources are tight and turn times are increasing, and demanding more and more of a smaller and smaller, burned-out employee base. I've never see so many overpaid people with lofty job titles and such little organization in a department. 

Diversity, equity and inclusion is just a marketing ploy here - a key hire for this initiative actually left after a year, and I don't blame them. It's all about the numbers, so unless you just so happen to be a female or minority Loan Officer who rakes in over 100M in production, you can forget being recognized or elevated in any way. There's an organization for women, yet the company only gives four weeks paid leave and then basically forces you to take all of your accrued PTO if you go past that - so if you want to take sick time/vacation after you return to work or before the baby comes, best plan ahead! A woman didn't return from leave and senior management did nothing but slander her name and talk about how terrible it was that she did that, meanwhile she was online the day after her baby was born and ""no one knows why."" Another woman from a different department actually said in a company call that she doesn't take PTO so her team can, and this same woman was also online just days after giving birth, giving a presentation.

Oh and if you join with any sort of bonus structure, prepare for it to be changed without any notice and often after you've already done the work (as in, a week before it's paid out, seriously)."

9,,Backwards Corporate Environment,2022-04-08,1.0,Processor,Pros: The CEO seems to be getting something out of all of this. Good for him.,"The company deliberately deviates from many of the established business practices that one would expect from a large corporation such as this one. ODDLY, they seem to prefer temporary workers with no experience to do a file processing frenzy  and let them go after one year. They just cut everyone off within a year and ghost them, threatening collections if they don’t send back their equipment immediately! So shady. Why don’t they consider rebranding as a temp agency for mortgage rather than pretending to hire full timers and give them benefits, only to do mass layoffs several times per year? That would at least be honest. Don’t lie to people who are expecting to stay full time when they’re planning to lay them off in a year! Myself and several good people left management careers because we were proactively recruited by GR— only to be quickly discarded! And instead of recognizing and valuing the talented people you do have, you just cut them off.  What is the reason that GR does not want people hanging around here? Everyone knows it is cheaper to retain your employees than to be a revolving door. That’s a red flag. Anyway, when you do get laid off, they will deliberately pay you your last PTO, bonus and severance in small chunks that are over the weekly benefit amount in your state, knowing full well that if they space it out you cannot claim unemployment. You will have a new job by the time those three measly payments have all been sent out. They know you’ll withdraw your mandatory 401k instead. They are calculated. No one in the group I worked with was able to draw unemployment because of this. My entire department was randomly dissolved, but no one bothered to notify or invite everyone to the mass layoff call. Lastly, the outplacement program is a joke. Everyone I know who got laid off tried contacting outplacement. They didn’t bother to respond AT ALL. Do they need to adjust their e-mail settings or check their spam folder? Seems odd. You’re on here promoting it like it is a real thing. Somehow, they did happen to choose me as one of the few individuals to get a call back. Two weeks after I emailed them, they emailed me asking for my resume (which I had already sent to them on the first day I was laid off). HR called to tell me snidely that my resume was not doing me any favors. But yet when you said that, I already had multiple job offers, so I’m thinking it did me a few favors. You and your company did me none other than kicking me while I was down. HR/Outplacement is SO out of touch and the entire company is a complete waste of everyone’s time and energy. They should become a temp agency for mortgage which is exactly what they are. Stop recruiting highly qualified candidates and then cutting them off midday with a threat to return laptops or be sent to collections. You lay people off and then you call just to tell them that their resumes aren’t top notch. FYI lady, I was busy mailing back my computer so I don’t get nickled and dimed for that by your greedy company, all while praying I can still provide a roof over my kid’s head and something to eat while without pay. Will it be Spaghettios or Kraft on sale this week? I’ve gotta plan that out first and foremost. Sorry for YOUR inconvenience."

When it comes time to pay you more, theyll do it to you. Absolutely no work security. Instead of working here and being forced to find a new job in a year or two, find a company that will respect you and allow you to grow in your field. You’ll be so much better off. 

Training is trial by fire and dealing with the VPs of PODs is a nightmare because of just how many have unearned egos. 

From the top down this company is mismanaged. CEO claims he bootstrapped the company but IRL he got a 2million dollar loan from his dad. The man has been out of touch with real people from the jump. In my time I’d heard him say in conference calls that the pandemic would be a good time for people to lose weight, that we should all be reading the secret, he TOLD US WHO HE THOUGHT WE SHOULF VOTE FOR. Just completely irresponsible behavior for someone in the position of responsibility he’s in. Talking about your multi million dollar home isn’t a good look when there’s people you pay to work that are struggling to not be homeless.

GR is so desperate to prevent going IPO that they’ll gut their own company and rehire for a pittance all in the sake of a very gilded sense of profit, sacrificing their long term reputation in the long run.

Asking the same question to RUM 2, a COMPLETELY different answer would be given. And the audits would be totally different from anything you’d been told before. Team leads would not return emails or IMs requesting assistance. PODs lied and manipulated constantly and management was always quick to throw you under the bus. Upper management never seemed to know how work was pulled and contradicted lower management directions. We were forced to compete against each other for files and if we didn’t pull enough files our job security was threatened. The Qs were always very low and associates were limited from the list they could pull from. They laid off multiple departments and put those responsibilities on the associate underwriters. Then they cut hours to 32 hours a week. I was looking for a new career. I found stress and trauma."

1. The CEO  might just be the worst CEO…maybe ever. He is a bully who rules with fear. Everyone is terrified they will be fired. This company is the classic case of hiring the execs because of nepotism. They are or were at one time His friends and have basically driven the company into the ground. They are so busy going to these ridiculous trips multiple times a year that they could care less what happens to the company. No one listens to the employees or even the management that actually know what they are doing. They hire and hire and then fire and fire for no apparent reason. Clearly no one knows what the word “forecasting” means. Everyone is terrified of this so called leader and won’t say that he is to blame for the current state of his business. 
2. The entire team of execs should be fired. Not sure what they actually bring to the table except for their 6 figure salaries that they only get because they are friends with the owner. 
3. Going public would be a miracle. Too much drama for that to ever happen. 
4. It’s a classic boys club. I saw how the loan officers spoke to my colleagues who happened to be women and even I was taken aback at the fact that this was ok here. 
5. The CEO loves to talk down to his employees during his weekly calls…. In front of everyone. He’s made people cry before and last I heard quite a few people quit because of these calls. Try to act with a little humility. Might help your cause.
6. Diversity is a word that doesn’t exist in this company.  In todays world, that makes zero sense I know, but it is what it is at This company."

Ironically, the recruiter that was very helpful in the beginning, was shortly laid off after I was hired. There have been massive layoffs since I joined the company, which was less than a year ago and they don’t seem to be slowing down. A lot of employees were recently furloughed and were told on a last minute call. It was shocking because prior to that, entire teams were laid off, putting their work load on us, so now we have additional duties to perform but less days.. Everyone on my team has been on pins and needles and it affects our work and the mental health that the company says is supposed to come first. I’m not sure what algorithm they use in order to tell who is laid off but it seems like because it’s such a large company, anyone could be next, but who knows. I wish there was more security here and they would not hire any more individuals only to let them go shortly after. It gives the company a bad reputation and it doesn’t make me very proud to be a part of that. I feel like it would be a great place to work otherwise."

And as long as you have competent operations staff, you can do a lot of loans with minimal processing or borrower hand-holding.","They have cut operations pay three different ways (once by getting rid of OT and twice by restructuring the bonus plans to pay out lower bonuses) in the last six months, and just phased out two critical job positions (front end operations assistants and condo processers) which is going to drastically increase the workload for all ops staff. Keep in mind that this is after a round of massive layoffs and pay cuts. So now you are going to have an extremely overworked operations staff that has had thier pay cut three times in the last six months. I am expecting people to quit in droves--particualrly the competent ones--which is going to drastically increase the amount of time and effort i need to do my job as an LO, which in turn directly reduces my income and quality of life."

The whole department was laid off on a teams call with 50 people and was told to log off in the middle of a Thursday. We had no heads up. It was completely heartless. I understand business needs, but we could have gotten a heads up. When summer starts again and it heads into the busy season, they will have to hire all new staff again and struggle to keep up since training is also not a thing that happens here."

- Goalpost constantly moves
- Leadership loves to promise huge raises if you come over to X team but when you ask for your raise 6 months past when you should have received it, they tell you that's not a business need or that you don't have enough training to qualify, yet they also refuse to train you the last task. (Instead of giving our team of 40 or so our raises, GR mass hired several HORRIBLE EMPLOYEES until we were up to 130 people. Not to mention, a large majority of these people would do nothing all day and weren't adversely affected until these recent layoffs in 2022.)
- I was specifically enticed onto a team and promised $80,000 take home after a single year ""investment"" of receiving a very sizeable pay cut without a bonus, and almost two years later I still only made the same base pay without any bonus or OT (both that were also heavily promised throughout the ""investment"" year)
- So much middle management that the majority of these individuals spend most of their time just coming up with new ""projects"" for their teams to work on as to look like they actually do something 
- High quantity of management, yet they're not reachable by phone, message, or email on a consistent basis throughout the several managers I had. Sometimes they claim to be too busy, and other times they just ignore you.
- Once again, the goal post is moved constantly. My original goal to the eventual goal we were at before I quit was 2.5x that a year later when I should have been promoted several months prior at the 1-year mark. The program then changed into a 3-4+ year program without any formal announcement."

They mass hire when busy and layoff after a slower month. You are treated as another “number” on the books versus an actual person. The hardest thing for me to witness was their full on campaign for mental health, raising millions for organizations that are in need. I was more than happy to contribute what I could to a great cause. However, when it came to mental health of their employees, they turned cold. I witnessed this behavior in the Region I worked in and the ROM did not take the tome to engage in putting a stop to demeaning comments to others on pipeline calls when he was on those calls.

On top of executing a substantial amount of marketing requests—as most manage HUNDREDS of loan officers, be prepared to do a lot of hand holding, teaching, and explaining as most loan officers appear to have received little-to-no education during the duration of their lifetimes. I can only assume this is a trickle down effect from the dude-bro CEO who has created a highly toxic company culture—a toxic culture that he’s constantly trying to gloss over with free lunch and parties on the rooftop. There are plenty of intradepartmental “rush” projects that can be thrown at you at any given moment such as proofreading THOUSANDS of postcards before they’re mailed, conducting state audits, launching and completing campaigns, packaging and mailing marketing kits for new hires—most of which are due the same day they are assigned.

The CMO is on vacation for most of the year. He is so checked out that if you approach him about literally anything, he will talk to you like a robot. The other marketing managers are extremely unhinged and reach the lowest of the low in levels of unprofessionalism. Clearly, a company like Guaranteed Rate is the only place in this whole city (maybe world?) where they’re able to retain employment."

Remote work environment.","Where do I start?

The story you are told when they are selling you on the job is completely inaccurate- the commission, paid time off, all the leads!

Getting good leads was very inconsistent- but getting micromanaged was constant. They hired sales managers who were great people who had the potential to lead the teams- but all they did was micromanage and repeat back the messages from upper management- they had no authority.

The pay was horrible- the commission paid was much lower than I was told. The commission structure changed 2 X in 18 months- and each time it resulted in a lower payout. We were showed what the new payout is based on current numbers (and were transparent that it will be lower)- but just said you need to ""sell more auto policies"". Management was upfront about the commission split when hiring- but gave inaccurate statistics of what the carriers pay- so my take home was low.

There is no work life balance- long days- often working evenings and/or weekends. I found at night I either was working, or feeling guilty that I wasn't working. I worked over 60 hours a week and my pay was low. I worked some weekends to stay afloat.

Benefits- Medical benefits had high monthly premiums and very high deductibles; only two weeks vacation and very limited company holidays. After 5 months you are 100% commission- time off is unpaid.

Management- Leadership by fear and bullying. Bro-culture; Toxic Positivity is a constant. 

There was always a charity to support- and you were asked to donate and send an email to management confirming when you did. Charity always seemed to be about appearance- suggesting we share it with a # on Social Media.

Turnover was horrible- over 40% You couldn't keep track of who was leaving as people came and went really fast. In my time there head count was always just shy of 200 employees yet every company meeting had double digit announcements of new employees.

So many meetings- and such a waste of time!"

Guaranteed Rate is a horribly managed company with little values and boys-club mentality. The Marketing Department is no exception. We often work at the whim of the CEO with little care for staff, zero management of priorities and a very difficult review process. Projects are often started and left, despite the hard work and money that is poured into them. Turnover is unsurprisingly high, promotions are limited and pay starts low. As an example of Guaranteed Rate's culture, the CEO often calls out certain job functions during all-hand meetings to threaten their jobs. This happened to the hard-working events team during the pandemic multiple times, despite the fact that they continued to bring money and value to the organization through creative ways the entire time. Bad managers in the marketing department are also left to repeatedly burn out their reports with no repercussions. This review does NOT apply to the GRA marketing team or the Social Media team. While I’m sure they deal with similar issues from executive leadership and the CMO, they each have one or more really strong and caring leaders."

They also claim to give promotions but the same employees that got promotions have the same pay for more responsibility.
The managers like to play favorite and want the people with the highest number to stop checking in so that people with low numbers “ can catch up”. Definitely not fair for what the pennies they pay. The managers only make 20 more cents than everyone else for way more responsibility. If this is a billion dollar company why not pay the employee fair wages?!"

I was told I would work until around 5-530 and then they scheduled my call block until 630 every night. They stated the average LO was doing around 30 fundings per month where my team averaged around 7-8. You are encouraged to lie to customers and lie about appraised values to make loans work. If I had to use PTO they would only allow it in 8 hour increments so they would take away hours I worked to reduce my overall hours down to 40. There are almost no leads available to LO's so you need to self source most of your loans to be successful. This is a very high pressure sales position so if you can't handle stress this is not for you. Also, they want to consistently turn over the bottom 1/3 of sales people on a 1-2 month average and that is directly from a leader."

-Managers, supervisors and team leads alike speak ill of their employees casually to other employees.
-As with alot of corporations no credit is given to lower level employees for implementing a more efficient way to do something.
-They are blamed for pointing out faults. And openly ignored until someone at a higher level brings up the same issue.
-Neutral sounding rules that exempt certain people from having an disciplinary action taken against them.

The people there are probably the best thing about the job.","In office job, from 8-5 located in Chicago. only a con because of traffic, probably best for people that live close to the work location.
Benefits are very basic, only 10 days pto for the year. effective after 90 days tho.
Limited to No growth. Rest of company kind of overlooks the workers here. 
Some workers have been there close to a year and didn't and won't receive increase in pay. The pay you enter with will most likely be the pay that you leave this job with.
They'll be VERY quick to replace you, don't think they depend on you for this position.
Upper management seems to mistreat the supervisors here which can cause a stress on the rest of the office.
*Guaranteed Rate is a billion dollar company. yet this job is located in an old factory, in the basement. It has a smell in there, the carpets are dirty, lopsided and never get vacuumed, small break room, an open space work environment, gets very hot in the summer and cold in the winter. I moved to a much smaller mortgage company, and they have the same department set up in a state of the art office, with better benefits and pay. It just shows, that you can't prioritize pay, you need to also consider benefits and work environment when choosing a job.
Almost everything you do needs to get approved. Have to use your pto for almost any reason that you're late or miss work.
Expect you to work your butt off but there is no need to do the most for the bare minimum."
247,,Worst Company to work for,2021-08-31,1.0,Production Manager,I don’t have any. Most disappointing place I have ever worked,"Compensation is bad , no real training , they keep making you watch videos if you have questions.
There is no sense of urgency and
Everything else other than work is more important to everyone that works here. They won’t pay you what they owe you if you leave.
Still trying to get in contact with HR about my
Pay so I don’t become homeless."
248,,Disappointing,2021-08-29,1.0,Anonymous Employee,Work from home options are good.,"Lack of respect from leadership. 
Upper management belittles anyone who doesn’t agree with everything they say. 
Lack of awareness of how much ops team members are required to do to get loans closed. 
HR is only there to support upper management. 
No work life balance when it’s busy and constant worry about losing job in slow times."
249,,Beware of layoffs,2021-08-27,3.0,Closing Coordinator,They are a decent company when you are busy. I feel like they have pretty decent benefits for their employees.,"LAYOFFS!

They have a huge hiring wave and then will layoff a huge group of people. 

Communication. It is very hard to get any information or answers from management."

251,,Could be better not horrible,2021-08-26,3.0,Appraisal Coordinator,"full time, remote for now, able to communicate with managers","counter productive, too many additions and no direction, task should be delegated better so that it does not become overwhelming. Too many systems being added, everyone is working on the same thing when it should be divided and focused. The pay is very low for the amount of work which is not motivating enough."
252,,Famous for Layoffs,2021-08-26,2.0,Loan Coordinator,Okay salary. Sent gifts and paid for lunch every now and then.,Low producing loan officers. Files not distributed evenly. Management would talk about how some processors were drowning. But wouldn’t hand off work to employees that were begging for files. I was laid off because my pipeline wasn’t busy which wasn’t at all my fault. I left a company I was with for 6 years to come here just to be laid off less than a year later.
253,,Avoid Avoid Avoid,2021-08-25,1.0,BDS,"Found great team mates to work with who did matter to me. We helped each other out. We felt each other’s pain. That’s it, everything else is a con.","1. Didn’t pay me my bonus when I have an email saying I’d get it
2. You get over worked for little pay and broken promises
3. Micromanaged to the finest thread
4. Pay is terrible. Contract said salary to find out you’re hourly. 
5. Hours: when you go over time you’ll get a warning or reprimanded. They’ll also change your hours on your time sheet if you go over, back to only 8 hrs, which is illegal. They also changed my sick leave to vacation days once I left.
6. Some people have no business managing this side of the company.
7. Turnover is very high, everyone from my hiring class left or was fired because they couldn’t stand the theft in pay and hours.
8. Contract again says you’ll get 3 VPs they instead gave me more than at one point only in my 3rd month with the company. 

This company should be in the process of dealing with employment law infractions. There were so many employment laws being broken. I hope this company gets a glass eye out on them by employment laws in every state they’re in. I gave them so much and they stole a lot."

259,,Too big to manage,2021-08-18,2.0,Anonymous Employee,"The ability to work remotely was the only pro or benefit I found to working for Guaranteed Rate, you could also kind of have flexible hours.","The company is too large to manage, the teams seem disorganized. They don’t pay actual over time to non-exempt employees, they have a flex pay system that really isn’t beneficial to the employee who is working long hours trying to keep up with the work load. No sense of community or culture either."

261,,"Lots of work, little help",2021-08-09,1.0,Mortgage Loan Officer,"-Small base salary instead of a draw is attractive but not worth it.
-Bigger known company,","-Must close a TON of loans to make good money, more than other companies require.
-Management is non existent when you need them.
-They require the loan officer to close the loans 100%. Processing does not help. -Loan officers need to clear conditions, run findings/mavent reports, send disclosures, re-disclose loans, lock rates, and constantly follow up on files that sit for 90+ days.
-Comp structure requires LO's to close 30 loans a month to get paid what other places pay for 10 loans and the processing is better."

266,,Culture of bullying and intimidation,2021-08-01,1.0,Software Engineer,"Competitive Salaries, (very good salaries for sales people.)
Remote work allowed, teams are spread out geographically.
Diversity is at least paid lip service to.
Use of Clojure.","Sales - focused culture. Culture of abuse comes directly from the CEO (owner / private company).
Salespeople and other roles can make great money, but it comes at the price of mental health.
IT hemorrhaging talent because they don't want to deal with constant bullying and harassment from management.
No delivery, with quality constantly being sacrificed for speed. Constant production issues and crazy overtime.
Unrealistic demands from management."

Great tech and easy to use systems.,I feel constantly overwhelmed by the pressure to meet metrics and think they are unrealistic for some situations. There is limited vacation time and you always come back to much more work after vacation it ruins the feeling of time off. Feeling burned out after one year. Overall the mortgage business isn't for me but I would recommend working for Guaranteed Rate.

277,,No Job Stability,2021-07-08,1.0,Mortgage Specialist,The payout per loan is pretty good. They invest in the best software to get loans closed fast.,"They're not great at projecting future business and revenue. They over hire and ask employees not to complain when they run out of leads. They depended heavily on the refinance market in 2020 and were banking on a continuation of the pandemic to keep rates low. The phone system runs on a first to answer basis, meaning people with faster internet can answer the lead call before you. The calls do not rotate to a different LO each time."

286,,RUN AWAY QUICK,2021-06-24,2.0,Business Development Specialist,"NONE, literally none, go away as quickly as possible","work and pay comp do not match whatsoever, compnany culture is suffocating and counter productive with many areas of micromanagement, though they say they want you to be autonomous and independent. Focus so much on meetings, even more than what your VP wants from you. The work material you do and the quantity of it, you could start your own business instead of getting paid the minimal amount you receive here. Fine with changing everything except paying the employee more. Company masking over the true issues. Which results in high employee turnover, but then management blames employee for leaving"

Nearly impossible to know who to ask when you have a question, because so many people are involved.

- High turnover makes it easy to move up quickly
- It's easy to stand out if you just do your work and do it well","- Horrible company culture. Everything is toxic, negative, and disrespectful
- A hierarchy of yelling: CEO yells at loan officers, they yell at processors, who yell at everyone else
- Completely reactionary management style. Example: No one took security seriously despite warnings from employees. But when the company got hacked and exposed personal information of employees and customers, security all of a sudden became a top priority
- Constantly understaffed
- CEO is very bad. All ego
- Pay and benefits are horrible, and raises only come with promotions

This organization sells work life balance, culture and financial freedom. Let me tell you, none of those are in anyway truthful. You will be sold on false compensation expectations, you will be over worked and in most cases will never meet your manager prior to coming onboard. The recruiter I dealt with was superb- yet my second interview was what created skepticism. Not to mention they were nearly an hour late. Keep looking, this place isn’t for you."

Cons can be changed very easily.,No personal contact. No matter what area you need help in people email a response and it is an endless of exchange of emails because no one wants to pick up the phone and take accountability.

Being subject to upper level management who manage ( rule ) by fear and intimidation. Worrying that someone is going to snitch on you in the hopes they can advance their career. Not really actually caring about what the clients or loan officers want, just the numbers! Speaking of numbers, having to track every single thing you sell to make sure that you actually get paid on it and that management doesn't try to ""randomly"" reassign your accounts so that they don't have to pay you your full or even any of your commissions. Not really knowing who is who or what they do due to excessively high turn over. Having absolutely ZERO work life balance! Oh and pray that you never have a major family emergency.

One is constantly in a defend mode as it is not whether or not you will get attacked, but when and how many times during a day it will happen. It is not that everyday is an awful day, they are, one hopes for a less awful day at this place. 

Benefits are pathetically awful. One is not fully vested in the 401K for years and the match is an insult. The Health Insurance is expensive and would probably only benefit people that exceed the deductible. PTO is a joke. 2 weeks and minimal major holiday.

Turn over (especially in the marketing department) is extremely high, in part because there is no real strategy and because the leadership across the board is so horrible.

I was required to work overtime and not clock it because the company didn't want to pay after hours. I was required to travel and was never compensated for mileage or time. On many occasions I had to use my personal credit card for company expenses and was not reimbursed. This company is mis-managed from the top down.

386,,Where you can Learn and Grow WITH the company,2021-01-21,5.0,Product Owner,"*Work with motivated, diversely experienced (mostly mortgage tech but some operations people or financial service tech), and creative people who are excited and feel the power to make a difference in the product. 
*Curiosity Rewarded: Long days when learning/getting started but if you are on and have questions for people they will take time to talk to you which is nice to never feel like an annoyance for being curious
*Mature and Skilled Developers who are eager to contribute to the product 
* No name blaming people, if team has a mistake its shared, but if they do well it is highlighted. Great team connections and ability to work across teams
* Learn new things every day which is the best part, it is challenging, but if you care about making Grate the best lender / giving our borrowers the best experience you will do well 
* Ability to share and discuss with Designers, Stakeholders, and Developers in one meeting, every voice is welcome
* Frequent shout outs amoung IT Team, managers show lots of gratitude for the hard work (Doesn't ever get old to be told you are doing well or give a team mate a shout out i
*No work toxic politics - Very professional organization

Nothing but good things, working with people who care and know what to do, when to do it, and who to get in a room upon it [new business/user stories needs] makes it an exciting place to work. The actual gratitude managers share with their team makes it feel every contribution matters even if someone didn't touch a piece of code they are included in credit for. It is a great company to work for, if you don't have any mortgage background you can train yourself using their tools after hours but expect to work hard. People at GRate are skilled and go above and beyond to make sure that they are doing their best for their team and in turn Borrowers & Business users.","* IT is a bit disorganized but it is coming together with every person they hire, it should be told to people that the structure of their management isn't keen on middle management, which is great but when first starting should be highlighted more from trainer the workflow structure 
* Need more people to actually create organization within the IT dept, everyone is so busy it is hard to find time to do it with members but everyone is super willing to spend extra time, or take time out of their day to discuss and create action items of what's needed
*Learning curve - not a con, just a huge org so be ready to come swinging your first day.
* Quick turnaround time for new employees - Could be just remote issue but, expected to have the experience to pick up and go with your product or team. Not a starter role"

437,,The BOTTOM line is their TOP priority,2020-09-22,2.0,Underwriter,The company's CEO Victor Ciardelli is a CEO with high level thinking. He has a Bob Marley/Surf's up style which is fun to see his enthusiasm while he tokes it out during weekly zoom/video conferences.,"The middle level management doesn't fully share the real goings on with upper level management or CEO Victor. He is not made privy to the lengths that 1st level managers push their underwriters to to get those 8 business hour/24 life hour turn times. Some underwriters working 12 hours per day still is not enough, the company continues to press for more and more and more. Many employees have burnt out but afraid to say no, because it means 1st level managers will retaliate with additional scrutiny or worse. New underwriters are given very little ramp up period and are expected to pull 12+ hour days and substantiate those 12 hour days with the same productivity level as those of double digit tenured veterans of the company. I experienced a 1st level managerial change shortly after joining and the difference between managers at first was a confident friendly one, however soon after my new manager's ramp up period (she was new) she became confrontational and never once did I feel like she had my back professionally. At times, even felt she was hostile toward me. I bit my lip and decided to look elsewhere, and so glad I did, I will also add, people are not paid fairly here for their experience. If the company can hire you for $30K less than the next guy, they will. The BOTTOM line is their TOP priority, then appeasing sales. There were times where my manager basically eluded but didn't say in other words that OT wasn't approved at times but still wanted the same amount of work done as would be warranted in a 12 hour day. The only way that can happen is off the clock work, which many do and did to keep their jobs, keep their managers' reports looking good, and keep their managers from targeting them."
438,,Your Work Will Not Be Valued,2020-09-19,2.0,Post-Closing Assistant,The job allows for a relatively good work life balance. Bonuses can be substantial during busy months. They gave me really cheap discounts on Sox games. Lower- and mid-level management are friendly and understanding and genuinely want to help you succeed.,"The bonuses may be substantial, but some amount of bonus money is basically required to be earned to feel like you are getting paid enough for what you are doing. I had issues being paid properly when I worked overtime on a holiday, and HR took literal months to get back to me and then still didn’t want to pay me. A coworker in my department made comments that made pretty much every woman in the office feel uncomfortable, as well as comments that threatened violence; this resulted in multiple HR reports, but no noticeable disciplinary action. Upper management does very little to hide that they only care about employees as a way to make money."
439,,Perfect job for extroverts!,2020-09-11,3.0,Anonymous Employee,White sox tickets! They are always giving employees swag and having monthly themed events. Many people have met their spouses there and created what could be lifelong friendships. Lots of team bonding.,"Okay if you ever watched The Office. The new leads episode where Sabre put the sales team first and they let it go to their heads. Well that is what its like working here. Everyone bends over backwards on behalf of loan officers and most of them are great but some really let it get to their heads and will treat you as though they forgot you were a human being because they can get away with it. 

There was also a lack of adequate training when I was there, but I hope it has changed since. 

It can be a bit like high school with cliques and be aware of that."

Once you are established, BOOM! It's pulled out from right under you. Horrible POD, they complain and complain about the type of loans you produce ( my case, was Down Payment Assistance) I hear things like ""Ugh I hate these loans!"" ""They're too much work!"" and ""I don't get paid enough to process these loans!""
I have been ""advised"" to NOT do these loans (which is total discrimination by the way!) I am in this business to do GOOD for my clients, not the company. Upper Management never answers their phone during business hours, they're always on ""calls"" which is a total disadvantage when you need help and guidance. I have been told by multiple sources to ""Stop bringing in the Down Payment Assistance loans because the company loses so much money on these types of loans"" so then why offer them if you don't like them?! Horrible structure with so many people involved in submitting a loan to Underwriting, the approvals take up to 2 weeks to get submitted to Clear to Close. I can keep on going.... but the main thing is they keep your money and give your loans to Salaried Loan Officers when you do too many Down Payment Assistance loans... .and they tell you because the company is losing money. What about me? I am losing money too because of this. I have had multiple loans go without pay which is totally unacceptable. 
I get told by Processor ""I advise you stop bringing these loans in, they are horrible!"" or ""I am in such bad mood! I don't feel like working on any of these loans""

Things have to change, this is not taking care of your employees. I am very disappointed in this company. I have lost 8+ relationships with agents because of the delays with Processing. And they blame it on the Loan Officers...."

455,,"Wow, glad that's over",2020-06-11,1.0,Marketing,Occasionally there's free food in the office. Free coffee? You have a desk. That about sums it up.,"My time at Guaranteed Rate was basically a never-ending circus of childish sales management and leadership who had NO business being in the positions that they were in abuse their power. Because this company outwardly only cares about sales, revenue, and beating loan volume records, those who make the money are the only ones who matter, and everyone else is just around to be a punching bag for loan officer mistreatment. If you tell a loan officer that they can't do something from a marketing perspective because it's non-compliant literally per the company's own guidelines, they will then go crying to their manager/leadership until they get their way. It's just dealing with and babysitting a bunch of children all day. Also ironic for a company that touts accountability as one of their core values, because there IS no accountability here. Basic morals/integrity go by the wayside every single day so that loan officers can have the world. In addition, everything else from employee benefits/vacation time to office facilities is the bare minimum - truly no worthwhile perks or benefits to speak of. You can’t even expect to get a pithily cost of living raise each year unless you fight for it, threaten to quit, or get promoted (which is very unlikely at GR). If a management consultant came and took a look at this company’s leadership and operations from the top down, I have no doubt that they would absolutely be appalled. GR desperately needs a new CEO, new C-suite, and a fresh perspective if they truly want to become the nation’s top lender. You have a LONG way to go. As for Marketing - an overly bloated department with too many unqualified chiefs, too many siloes, and an absurd amount of red tape. Quitting was the best decision I ever made. I honestly don’t even think GR will be worth putting on my resume a few years down the road because I learned literally nothing in this job, except for maybe how to NOT run a team or engage employees."
456,,Hard,2020-05-10,3.0,Loan Coordinator,"The job itself is rewarding. You work directly with the borrower, once you have a good system in place and get the hang of it it’s a great career. Great culture, enjoy the people you work with. Hard work gets recognized here.","The closing process. You can work nights and weekends to get a loan clear to close, but that’s the easy part. It’s almost impossible to close a loan at GR. It almost makes you want to quit and be a closer. The first core value of GR is that they put the customer first, but they put closers first. While it’s great to help out your closing team, they are missing how this impacts the borrowers. You’ll submit a clean loan to closing, weeks before the closing date and the closers will decide the day before closing that there are enough days on the lock so you need to reschedule. Then the next day to schedule is a week and a half out. It doesn’t matter how smooth the loan process goes or how stellar your customer service skills are, when you call the customer to reschedule for no reason they are going to be upset every single time and there’s no push back on closers for doing whatever they want. Its likely due to understaffing of closers, but regardless as an LC all you’re doing is getting yelled at by customers and there’s no solution. Even if you have tough skin, it’s not something you can get used to. It’s impossible"
457,,GR could be great for some people...,2020-05-08,3.0,Anonymous Employee,"Salary is competitive, great support from peers and leaders in my business unit, fun events and parties in the office. Definitely a work hard, play hard mentality. There are also a lot of opportunities to promote within the company. The company is growing and making a lot of money, creating solid job stability.","Although it's common in many company, executive leadership were mostly a bunch a jerks who did what they wanted, regardless of people's input. Although you can make some great money here, you will say goodbye to your life. The amount of workload expected from you is completely unreasonable. You will work 10-12 hour days and weekends. If you don't mind that, then this might be a good place for you. This job completely took over my life; I eventually realized I had spent the last year of life only working and not ignoring my health and loved ones. The job significantly effected my personal relationships and my mental health."
458,,Great place to scale,2020-04-16,4.0,Vice President of Mortgage Lending,You can scale and close a lot of loans with a great team. There is a system and process for everything. Trust the system and take time to find the right people to work with to get your loans through. Some amazing mortgage talent.,Too big and easy to feel like your on an island. So many layers of mgmt
459,,A terrible place to work.,2020-03-10,1.0,Post Closing,Excellent co-staff. Decent location.,"The short version: I was literally lied to about my salary and bonus structure when i was brought on, the office environment is an actual dark, dusty, hazardous basement that is in violation of several OSHA regulations at any given moment. Advancement is near unheard of. Benefits package seems more like a prank than anything else. 

The long version: Upper management seems completely unconcerned with non-corporate departments. Atrocious benefits package. Nearly non-existent HR support. The office itself is dirty, dusty, cramped, dark, literally in a basement, foul smelling, does not provide enough bathrooms for size of staff, has had repeated workplace hazards over the course of several years that were either ignored or outright hidden from us. 

Base pay does not meet the expected workload. Countless people work 6 10+ hour days a week just to stay afloat, as the company justifies dismal base pay with a ridiculous bonus system that requires you to work absurd hours and sacrifice weekends to actually meet. Morale seems to be a complete non-issue, and decisions that benefit the team generally only do so as an incidental factor, not a primary consideration. 

Sick time accrues as, effectively, one day per month worked (I think? Honestly my repeated attempts for clarification on how benefits break down have been either not responded to or shrugged at.) and more or less every other benefit is unclear. I somehow started the new year with negative PTO available. 

Maybe working in the upper levels of the company is fantastic, but I would recommend avoiding post closing, final docs and shipping at all costs. It's a shame, because the people that work in these departments are wonderful, and deserve so much more. Several people throughout the department have been with the company for over 3 years and have not seen raises or major promotions (promotions within the department are generally more lateral moves to different teams with ""better"" bonus structures - if you're willing and able to work 80 hours a week.) Many, if not all of these issues have been brought up to upper management and seem to continue to be ignored.  

To quote another review: ""If you are outside of sales, your chances of advancement or increased compensation are slim-to-none. Frugality is one of the company's pillars--which also means regularly scheduled down sizing and maintaining just enough staff for specific roles that people don't get burnt out too fast (e.g. your team mate gets fired/quits, now you pick up his slack until you get fired/quit)."" - This is a perfect sum up of the job. 

The only reason most people stick with this job is because they haven't found anything better yet, or can't afford the time to look. 

I could and should carry on, but I think you get the point. 

Don't work here."

462,,Worst experience EVER trying to get paid what I was owed after I resigned,2020-03-07,2.0,Vice President of Mortgage Lending,"A good platform overall, except for their POD model of loan processing. Best if you're a large producer in volume and units and you bring in your own team to fully support you.  Everything you want to know about GR products, processes, procedures and personal are right there at your fingertips, all you have to do is look.  Compensation was competitive. Good Condo Dept. support!","While GR is not quite the bureaucratic behemoth of a Wells or Chase, by the time I left, it darn sure felt like it most of the time when dealing with Ops, whose support was spotty at best. Some of the processes required to get relatively easy things done at most other companies were onerous and were a constant source of brain damage at GR. Think “complex solutions for simple answers”. Support for one-off marketing materials was essentially a mess. IE… it took me over 90 days to get a flyer approved!  If you’re a modest producer looking to take your production to the next level, your processing support will be “hit or miss”. The good processors are of course assigned to the top producers, and their POD model has your processing duties split between two processors. So instead of trying to manage your pipeline with one processor, you needed to get into sync with two processors.  Fine when it worked, but more often than not it doesn’t work and I had over 11 different processors over a 12 month period. No way to get any momentum going. Speaking of momentum, be very careful when you resign with GR. Their payout after you leave seemed straight forward enough, based on other similar contracts I’ve singed. BUT BEWARE!!! The Company may at their sole discretion delay the advance of your unearned commission for any loan up to 120 calendar days from your last day of employment at the company. Means, anything in your pipeline that already has or will close within the next 30 days that you have not yet been paid on will not be paid to you for 120 days.  Now I did get authorized an advance to pay me out 50% of what was due, BUT they took over 90 days paying THAT out to me. And when I did an audit of my final pay I found that they had collected an extra month of deductions for benefits they shouldn’t have… that then took another 45 days to get resolved! What a nightmare!"

Pay is fair for even coordinator-level marketing employees, and yes there is of course going to be tasks you're asked to do and don't want to - the fact of the matter is the department is extremely overworked and sometimes we all have to jump in to do things that ""aren't in our job description"" or ""below us"" to get it done and support our coworkers.","Working from home is severely frowned upon by the C-suite for anyone who isn't an LO or UW,  even for those who (unlike that same management) live far away or are parents. There are a lot of silos between subdepartments/teams, with finger pointing become a regularity when projects spin out of control. New companies/ventures are getting spun up, but there isn't any additional support being hired - people are jsut expanding their roles to cover the additional companies, but not getting any new team members.

The bonus structure was like chasing a carrot on a stick. PTO is scarce. No interest in a work/life balance.

My last day is fast approaching, and an HR rep reached out to schedule an exit interview. After waiting a half hour, he never showed up.

It's curious to see so many glowing reviews on here. Evidently it means that working closer to front-end operations is a totally different experience from working in the back-end.

With that being said instead of everyone going above and beyond to help a borrower purchase a new home or refinance and pay debt to help them financially (keeping in mind that a home is a lifetime investment and if it weren't for a 1st time homebuyer trying to make their dream come true at a young age or any borrower wanting to purchase a new home  or refinance to pay debt and lower their rate to save money no one in the mtg industry would be in business) UW's especially but also MC's and LC's  have to worry about their scorecards which affects their income! With GR mainly focusing on purchases with a 3 day turn time for approval then submission for CTC is 3 more days n God for bid the UW holds the file for you to obtain a few documents that was missed or possibly/more than likely already in the file but maybe the LC missed tagging a condition and the UW is ONLY going to look at the conditions tagged so your file is kicked back instead of maybe holding the file in CTC status till EOB or next day so it doesn't get kicked back! And LC was able to obtain those 1 or 2 conditions within a few hrs...well resubmit for CTC..another 3 days and if it's a rush..yup hits the LC's scorecard and money, then 48hrs for closing but it's a purchase and you wasted unnecessary time with UW because they don't have time to see if maybe oops the LC uploaded the condition but didn't tag it so now it's a closing rush..another scorecard hit! Bottom line if your NOT PERFECT DON'T work for GR! Pretty sad GR is in top 10 of the largest mortgage companies and everyone has to worry about scorecards and layoffs when it slows down after you've literally given the company and owner your undivided life with numerous hours and given up your personal/family life to make money..NOT help the borrower which is what I'm used to but worry about a stupid scorecard! Victor instead of scorecards why don't you motivate your employee's? Everyone gives you and GR their LIFE so think about rewarding them instead of having them worry about a scorecard and making less money or being slapped because loans weren't taken care of in your STANDARD of TIME FRAME! You make it impossible for an MC to make money...they are working 10, 12 15hrs a day, weekends to make any money! You probably wouldn't have such a huge turnover in phenomenal experienced employee's like myself who has YEARS of experience and numerous awards in this industry! You make billions!

It is not IF you’ll have to forfeit your commissions, it is WHEN. This company is notorious for stealing earned commissions and move loan to a new, direct LO at, or just before, closing. This happens multiple times on a daily basis across the Country to good, hardworking loan officers doing what is asked of them and trying to feed their families. Internal mistakes are commonplace and those mistakes cost the loan officer, regardless of fault. You will lose money here. You will sacrifice relationships here. You will regret your decision to work here, I GUARANTEE it."

516,,Not worth it.,2019-03-11,2.0,V Star Specialist,My coworkers were nice and inviting.,"The work is stressful (its sales).  It is too competitive, We got updated every 2 hours about how many transfers you had via email, plus every ten minutes by team leads and coworkers. It was pretty excessive and annoying. I hated the way they micromanaged, but made it seem like they are helping. They are ALWAYS listening to calls. You're pretty much cold calling (its an autodialer)  people, because most of the time they didn't request any information from the company. As a result, you deal with a lot of  upset and frustrated people. There is basically no other opportunities except for becoming a loan officer (which suck evens more).  We had meetings throughout the day and it was literally for you to practice what you say on the  phones. You did not get a break from being on the phones even when you were off the phones!"

The business side and the tech side don't really talk to each other and the lines of authority feel very muddled. Managers have too many direct reports to adequately support their teams. Every day I mainly feel annoyed, exhausted, and like there's no possible way for me to complete all the work I have to do."

During the call we were told if we did not like it we could leave, in those exact words.  The position I thought I would retire from is now one I will probably leave. I've been a good employee for many years and this is the result. Makes a good employee under perform or leave.
Also, we work on technology that often goes down hindering our daily duties. 
Frequently new procedures are added complicating the closing process. You will work in a high pressure environment that no longer compensates accordingly. I would not recommend this employer."

528,,Love working here,2019-01-14,5.0,Marketing,Great company great people for hard working individuals,turnover is a problem
529,,Most of these reviews are fake. The CEO is the non-racist form of President Trump.,2019-01-10,1.0,Mortgage Loan Officer,"Cafeteria people can be pretty cool (except they do not wear gloves when serving the food.) Rooftop parties are fun (usually cliquey groups and attempts to distract you from the awfulness of the company; really, the parties are brainwashing events.) Company does give back to the community, which is the company's attempt at hiding their deceptive practices. You will meet some cool people, and you will want to hold these people close, as you may be needing their help finding your next career.","Where to begin? Victor is a huge liar and con artist, as are most of the executives and loan officers, so I will do my best to summarize this:

1. Company turnover rate is over 50% (A number like this are usually those of a pyramid scheme.)

2.  Harassment occurs religiously. You will be harassed and shamed for smiling, doing well, being innovative and entrepreneurial, being better than the favorites in the company, etc.

3. Your monthly bonus will be changed at the very last minute. They will change your bonus based on how they feel that day. If they wake up in a bad mood, kiss goodbye your large bonus. It will become a very small bonus all because someone didn't take his/her happy pill. 

4. Job security here is a joke. Every day, Victor or some other executive/director will come to you randomly and tell you that you are replaceable and mean nothing to the company. Your position, to them, is non-existent. From the moment you are hired, Victor wants to fire you. The company hires only to maintain a good public reputation. They suck at it, because of their turnover rate.

5. Many of the reviews here are fake. How can it be that in April 2018, the rating was 3.5, then in August/early September it was 2.6, and now it is 4.2? Yeah, so many fake reviews. If you removed all of the fake reviews, the rating would easily be 2.6 (maybe lower.) This company is sinking and Victor and the executives know it. 

6. People in this company are slaves to Victor, an emotionally insecure dictator who has ruined more lives than has Clinton, the Bush Family, and the Trump family. I know people who have trouble finding a job now because Victor and his cronies launch smear campaigns to ruin former employees reputations.

7.  Benefits and PTO SUCK! 6 Holidays, $250+ benefits for a single person, and 2 weeks of PTO, which you will be harassed if you take off a day (I think they are scared and know people will take off a day to interview for a different job.)

8. Technologies are out-of-date. This company was created literally just to compete with others. Victor had no vision. His previous company failed, and now, everyone is being harassed for it failing, even the ones who weren't even alive at the time. Regardless of age, you better know how to use a technology no one knows how to use. 

9. Horrible pay. I am convinced Victor got his funding for GR from the Chicago mafia. 

10. Glassdoor reviews are managed (but you could probably tell that from my previous comments.)

11. Your family and friends will be harassed by management. They think they are entitled to doing whatever they care to your family and friends. 

12. This is a sad PR-stunt of a company. Guaranteed Rate Field? More like Guaranteed Hate Field.

13. Right next to the train is inconvenient. If I am trying to close a deal, I obviously do not want to hear a train in the background. Distracts the customer and you have to yell at them.

14. Parking is not good."

556,,Guaranteed Rate... of employee turnover,2018-11-26,1.0,Loan Servicing,"Lots of unnecessary benefits like rooftop parties, free massages, and an on-site nurse","Embarrassingly low pay for a multi billion dollar company.
401k matching is the lowest I’ve ever seen. 
They regularly lay off large numbers of employees, so job security is non-existent. 
“Yearly” reviews are treated with the lowest priority and are often late by many many months and 90 day reviews are often ignored completely, showing that management doesn’t care about employee development. This also affects raises, which barely exist. If you stay long enough, you might get no raise and end up losing money due to cost of living increases and inflation.
There is a large drug problem in the company... it’s a thing, and it’s swept under the rug.
Parking at the corporate office is extremely limited.
The company is run like a mom and pop shop, which leads to a lot of unprofessional behavior, large sudden policy changes, and inconsistent enforcement of rules.
Loan officers are essentially allowed to run the company themselves, leading them to feel entitled. They cry and whine and they get whatever they want. HR rules do not apply to them, so I hope you like sexual harassment.
If you’re not a loan officer, you don’t matter.

When I was reached out to by an HR they told me I could expect to be making around $70,000 the first year, but you really end up only making about $25,000. They also failed to mention during the interview process that you are supposed to be working 12 hour days. Their over time policy is also terrible it is only about $6 an hour. They told me during my interview that they had an excellent training program but the training program is only about once a week for an hour if that and you are very micromanaged. I had to email the training department everyday about what I did yesterday and what I was going to do today. This job is not for everyone, and if you want to have any sort of a work life balance I would look elsewhere. They literally expect you to work on the weekends and tell you that if you don’t want to then this isn’t a job for you.

Having good pricing on a wide array of loan options was appealing as well. The learning curve was steep (my first 90 days involved a few sleepless nights), but now that I'm settled into a groove, I can't imagine leaving. The company has a genuine, authentic commitment to building every tool a busy loan officer needs and sharing best practices internally with coaching and more.","The only challenges I've had relate to GR being such a big company. A lot of the good stuff (pricing and efficiency-wise) goes hand in glove with being really big. The company has done a great job of putting information on a well-though-out intranet and I'm quite self-sufficient, but every now and then I am not sure who to talk to about a question.

NOT consumer lending, not credit cards, not checking accounts but HOME LOANS... you can tell that we are the customer.

Our main push for coming over was being able to market, jumbo loans, and better service overall.  We have struggles with process, still.  And, that is probably to be expected.  However, the breadth of product, the attentiveness of the heads of the departments to our needs, has been phenomenal.  Overall, I am very excited we made the move and I feel like my business is getting ready to take off.  Our goals as a team are to increase our production to $100mm by year end of 2019.  The infrastructure is coming along and I feel confident that we are in the best place to achieve that.","Jon and I came over as a team.  In that, we wanted to set up our production as a team,,,market as a team...split 50/50 Branch Management responsibilities as a team.

However, the silver lining is we are finally moving into our office space...so, we can send them out once that is done. - but we want to market as a team.

-No year reviews/salary increases
-Health insurance is terrible and very expensive 
-They have two company wide lay offs a year, so job stability does not exists
-They pay zero overtime and instead give “flex pay” which is like $2 an hour, yet they continue slamming you with work
-Most male managers are creeps that will make you feel uncomfortable 
-Terrible PTO 
-They don’t promote growth within the company and have let people go who have brought up interest in other positions 

They sound great on paper, with the roof deck, nurse, etc, but on a day to day work space this place is terrible. Take time to read through other reviews. My advise is to save yourself and only take if in desperate need for a job"

It is a culture that encourages growth and forever invests in the tools to aid growth.,"We can forget about the nuances that make for a great environment for the support staff to work without burning out.  High turn over in support positions, leading to changes in processors, causes the highest level of stress to me and my fellow loan officers.  ...Rates seem to be abnormally high at the moment, no longer having us in a place to compete with most correspondent lenders.  Health insurance is pretty poor."

I cannot imagine I ever worked anywhere else.... Guaranteed Rate, where have you been all my career??",I have not found one yet.
764,,Branch Manager/VP of Mortgage,2018-09-10,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"The ability for loan originators to increase their production volume through the many resources they have which include: a processing system that promotes the originator to do what they do best which is sell 80-90% of the time, endless marketing to your past customers and the top Agents in your area, Event planning team that helps you promote GR and your business to the Top 20% Agents in your market, The best technology in the business which includes a top of class digital application that promotes the ease of doing business with GR along with the ability to manage your pipeline from your phone which includes sending pre-approval letters!

765,,Simply the Best!!,2018-09-09,5.0,Branch Manager/Vice President of Mortgage Lending,"Here's the thing, I've been in the business 16 years - 6 years with Guaranteed Rate.  Prior to working with Guaranteed Rate I would switch companies every 2 years without fail.  I knew what I was looking for in a mortgage company to back my business and I wasn't going to stop the search until I found the right company.  The search included 3 requirements that a company must meet for me to stick with them.  I wanted a support staff that would allow me to focus on my job as a loan officer to get more business, rates that competed with the best, and a forward-thinking company that would provide cutting edge technology.  When I signed with Guaranteed Rate I quickly realized they not only met the requirements, they completely exceeded what I was looking for.  Guaranteed Rate simply crushes the competition with technology.  There's no competition.  Rates are consistently competing with the best rates offered in the market.  The structure of our operations and support staff is the only way to do business.  The POD model we have at Guaranteed Rate just makes sense.  I could never depart from it.  You don't have to worry about your processor taking time away from setting up new files at the end of the month to focus on closing loans because we have processors for each side of the transaction.  If you find yourself in a similar situation searching for a company that meets similar requirements I was searching for there's no question where you should go...  Guaranteed Rate is simply the best!!","As others have mentioned, the benefits could use some help.  With that said, the additional loans you'll be able to close and the amount of time you'll free up with our systems far outweigh the benefits you might receive elsewhere."
766,,A fast-paced entrepreneurial organization where you can make a difference!,2018-09-08,5.0,Anonymous Employee,I've been working at Guaranteed Rate for less than a year and the experience so far has been outstanding! My GR colleagues are very passionate about improving how we better serve our customers to deliver an exceptional mortgage experience.  I can attest the company lives its core values as they permeate everything we do internally. GR is an exciting place to work if you want to take ownership and collaborate with others to solve challenging problems to disrupt the mortgage industry.,Benefits are good overall but could use an upgrade.
767,,"If you like getting royalty screwed over, this is the place for you!",2018-09-07,1.0,Anonymous Employee,I first got to GR’s Glassdoor page and actually laughed out loud at the completely fake reviews. Don’t believe the positive reviews because they are totally fabricated. Yet another attempt by GR to lie and deceive. These guys sink to new lows every day.  Don’t get fooled!,"The question here is not if this company will self destruct but WHEN. They have routinely lied to employees and clients, they manipulative people while paying them very poorly, they have had numerous security breaches, and the morale at the office is atrocious. This company is the closest thing to a scam that I’ve ever encountered. Absolutely horrible management (it’s a revolving door), very few benefits (the ones they do have are super expensive), and HR will completely blow you off if you ask for help. Most people quit because we get overworked and underpaid. Trust me you do not want to waste a second at this place. They have been sued many times and they will screw you over. They will mess up your paychecks and they will make you work 12 your days without asking. Worst company I ever worked for."
768,,Future Looks Bright,2018-09-07,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Ideal environment for a software developer:  autonomous teams; minimal hierarchy; ""API over Implementation"" management style, meaning leaders set expectations, and teams work together to make things happen; accountability backed with authority; strong commitment to Functional Programming and Clojure; direct lines of communication to C-Level executives.

GR tries to take care of you as best as they can, and they give you the perks that most offices wont even think about giving to their employees. Having the Nurse Practitioner located in our building saves us the hassle of having to take the day off of work to get seen by a doctor. We also get a nice 20 minute massage every month as a perk, she's incredible to say the least. We have a gym that we're able to use for $20 a year. This gives us the ability to go work out during our lunch break, so that we can distress. The company also tries to build up our moral with monthly events to get our teams together and have a little fun.",I can't really say anything negative because there isn't anything. There's a lot of stress that comes with certain aspects of our jobs but that's something every company has in its midst.

Not a lot of red tape to get approval for marketing events and activities.","Not the same brand recognition you would get with a bank.  Loan officers generate most of their own leads, so it's a better fit for people that work with realtors to generate their own business.

The company is receptive and open to feedback from employees and is truly interested in providing the best product possible to the borrower. GR balances the stress of the industry with frequent celebrations and finds ways to remind employees that their work is valuable.,"For years my least favorite part about working at Guaranteed Rate was that we didn't have recycling in the building, but I'm happy to say that as of two weeks ago there are recycling bins placed in every section of our building."
824,,Great work-life balance,2018-09-05,5.0,Anonymous Employee,Guaranteed Rate makes it easy for me to work from home when I need to.  They also have a gym and workout classes at their corporate location so that I don't have to skip my workouts when I'm in the office.,Monthly massages are only available at corporate.
825,,Sales Assistant,2018-09-05,5.0,Sales Assistant,Friendly and extremely supportive work environment. Flexible when it comes to personal schedules which makes you work harder for a company that understands your needs.,I have no cons to list at this time.
826,,Loan Coordinator,2018-09-05,5.0,Loan Processor,Good People first and foremost.  Understanding and hands-on Management.  Work hours are flexible and accommodating for anyone and any situation. Great Pay and Guaranteed Rate is always looking to improve work environment and work tools to help you be successful in all that you do.  Very Pro-active!,I have been working here almost a year and I can't think of one CON yet!  I have been in the Mortgage business over 20 years and have never experienced such a great company like this!
827,,Operations Assistant,2018-09-05,5.0,Operations Assistant,Our Philly team is amazing.  our atmosphere is energetic and on the go.  Family away from family is how I see it. Hard working and fun loving.  The team work from management on down is great. The work resources that the company gives you is amazing. training and resources galore. there is no reason not to thrive in this company because of all the support and resources you are given from the time you start.,I have to say I don't know if there are any cons. but that is from my point of view. I have been with GR for 3 1/2 years and there really isn't anything I can say is bad.
828,,You Get What You Put In,2018-09-05,5.0,Sales,"3 main reasons I chose to work at GR:
1. The People. The people we work with are highly motivated and our customers are our main focus.
2. The Products. We continue to find ways to give our customer the ""best deal"" in rate and loan types. 
2. The Mission. Victor is philanthropic so our company follows that thought-process.",I wish I came here sooner...
829,,Flexible and friendly work environment with room to grow as an employee,2018-09-05,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"In my short time with GR, I have been welcomed by all the teams I interact with. I've found it easy to manage flexibility in my schedule so that I am able to maintain a good work life balance without much interruption in my extracurricular activities. While having a great boss also helps with that, I've seen other managers actively encourage and promote their reports to new positions, even if it means losing an asset to their team; it's nice to know that there are others genuinely willing help you get to the next step in your career.  One of this company's aims is to use technology to simplify and speed up the lending process, meaning anyone good with technology should be able to easily get their feet wet here, with or without finance knowledge.  And with the ever-changing mortgage industry, there is still plenty to learn and be challenged by with positions always open due of the growth of the company. In addition to the career opportunities, the work culture is phenomenal-monthly employee appreciation roof top events, access to an onsite gym, free monthly massages and a cafeteria whose menu rivals the best spots around the town.",I have not ran into any at the moment.
830,,Closing Coordinatior,2018-09-05,5.0,Closing Coordinator,Love the positive attitude everyone has.,Maybe allow more growth in the position. Follow up with yearly pay increase.
831,,IT'S REAL - STILL PINCHING MYSELF,2018-09-05,5.0,Regional Closing Manager,"Senior Management really cares about the daily hurdles and tries to improve processes to make the job easier.     Work/Life balance is terrific since some departments allow you to work from home. So when children are sick or employees are not feeling well enough to get into the office, they can work from home and not have to take a sick day.   The people I work with are the best. Everyone works together to make the job easier.","The industry we work in- Financing Homes- is stressful, but it's not a reflection on the Company itself.    I love working at this company and I'm still pinching myself after 5 years.   Compared to other companies in the same industry,  it's a dream!"
832,,Best place to work on the north side!,2018-09-05,5.0,Anonymous Employee,I love working at Guaranteed Rate!

835,,"Great Culture, Satisfying Work, Phenomenal Company",2018-09-04,5.0,Analyst,"Management really goes out of its way to invest in the employees, find ways to make the job fun! Its called work for a reason and everyone pulls together as a team to make sure the job gets done, but we're constantly being awarded with free lunches, activities after work, free tickets to sporting events--there's even a masseuse to work your stress away!  In all my years, I've never worked at a place that tries so hard to give the tools to the employees they need to succeed, and I can't imagine working somewhere else!","The job can be tough!

836,,Chaos,2018-08-29,2.0,Software Developer,GuaranteedRate has a lot of good intentions and has/is attempted/attempting to make strides to better the internal culture of the company,The company has extremely low retention. Engineers come and go every few months and management is like a revolving door. There is a lot of political toxicity within leadership and it seeps into every area of the business. Engineering culture is also very poor. Teams are very disconnected and always tend to play the blame game rather than working together as a unit.
837,,"Great place to start, not to stay.",2018-08-28,3.0,Anonymous Employee,The dental plan is great.,the money is not so great for the amount of stress and pressure included in the job.

839,,Terrible. Disregard the fake positive reviews!,2018-08-24,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"I have some nice coworkers and there are affordable lunch places in the area. That’s where it ends. This company is built on intimidation, deception, and taking advantage of employees and clients alike.","I’ll be honest here because guaranteed rate likes to lie to everyone. I accepted a mortgage specialist position under the impression that this was a solid company that rewards good performance and supports employees. Sadly this is not the case at all. I soon discovered that they force us to be telemarketers for 12 hours a day and make 300 dials a day to people who unknowingly signed up to get bombarded by mortgage lenders like GR. We have to call these poor people multiple times a day which is pretty much harasssment. As for salary, they boast of a 60-70k range for first year. Considering how they pay less than minimum wage as a base salary, this is an absolute lie. Commission is expected as well but their process is so flawed that most people don’t fund loans for months. Many loans wind up not getting funded because GR drops the ball, which costs us our commission. So in reality, mortgage specialists probably earn about $25,000 a year (if payroll doesn’t screw up, which is rare since they always do). The managers are useless pompous tools who don’t help at all. In fact I’ve been lied to by managers regularly and most of them get fired or quit since GR is so bad.  HR will not help either. My coworkers are absolutely miserable because the job is high stress and pays next to nothing. Many of them are approaching 30 and have to ask their parents for money because GR does not pay enough. I have constant anxiety from working here. This is the worst place I’ve ever worked. Please do yourself a favor and do NOT even entertain the idea of working here.  They have been sued multiple times and have compromised secure information in a data breach. Stay away!"
840,,Worst professional experience of my life,2018-08-21,1.0,,Slim pickings here. I suppose they have working toilets and heating/AC. Other than that this place SUCKS. They are a bunch of slimey con artists. Please don’t fall for their tricks.,"Recruiters first reached out to me and said I could expect to earn $70,000 my first year. They talk a big game and act like it’s a great company and I decided to believe them. Worst decision I’ve ever made. I soon realized to my dismay that they are immensely disorganized and complete liars. They pay a salary that equates to less than minimum wage. They switch their methods all the time and make you learn things for nothing. They force you to work 12 hour days and weekends as well WITHOUT OT. Their OT system is a complete scam and winds up being like $6/extra hour. The managers are sleazy lying jerks and it’s super stressful. Managers have actually told employees if we don’t like it then we can leave and they don’t need us. I quit and they tried to withhold my check which is illegal. They have a habit of trying to withhold wages from employees. Also they have been sued many times. This place deserves to be shut down. They take advantage of honest hardworking people. I cannot believe their actions; I am appalled.  People wind up working for scraps and are practically slaves because they overwork and underpay."
841,,Business Development Specialist,2018-08-20,1.0,Business Development Specialist,People in the department are great.,"Micro-managed, Taking time off is a huge issue, terrible pay and terrible benefits."

Screw this palce,"Lies, manipulation, terrible compensation, expensive benefits, clueless managers, sexism, boys club, absolutely no work life balance, constant payroll errors, super high turnover rate, etc. I seriously would not recommend this place to anyone. This job made me and my coworkers miserable and when I quit I felt a massive sense of relief."

They are totally vague about the mortgage specialist position and consistently over promise and under deliver. They wind up paying much less than average and they neglect to tell you that the days are 12 hours long (and their overtime system is total B.S.) everyone is stressed, managers are unhelpful liars, no good benefits. They always mess up paychecks and the company is so cheap and they cut corners. They say that an on-site masseuse is a perk but day 1 they said we are not eligible for it. So it was a bait and switch LIE. They actually pay mortgage officers less than minimum wage so it would be better to work at McDonald’s since it’s less stressful and it pays more lol.

A SCAM. They lie and deceive people. It’s very stressful, they frequently mess up paychecks, they always fire people each year, there is no work life balance, benefits are super expensive. I honestly have gone into work with a stomach ache from sheer stress. Trust me you don’t wanna work here. They make it seem like it’s a great place but they are filled with false promises and I have felt mistreated and lied to on a daily basis."
849,,If you value your life and overall well-being do NOT work here,2018-08-07,1.0,Anonymous Employee,Not a whole lot to write here. Once or twice they get food but it’s gone before people can have any,"I should have know this place was a scam when their moronic recruiter sent me an email that looked like a disabled 6 year old wrote it (tons of typos and grammatical errors).  Not only that but when I interviewed she forgot my name and thought I was from a totally different city. Anyway this company routinely lies to prospective employees, employees are  drastically underpaid, they overwork us and scare us into working longer hours without adequate compensation. Management and HR has blatantly turned a blind eye to the numerous issues and labor violations. If you need help you’d be better off praying to god because management won’t help. Their benefits are subpar, there are no snacks or refreshments, and they have been sued many times. I knew this place seemed sketchy because of their fabricated projected earnings, made up overtime policies, and more. I decided to take a chance and ignore my gut and I regret that choice every day. Don’t let them take advantage of you. Literally all my coworkers are miserable here and for good reason.  This company is a disaster."

The amount of loans lost has dropped from 55% down to 20% which is due to a very competitive multiple lender preferred builder and realtor platform....but success will be a whole new level here for us.,Only real downside is that with so much in the way of systems and technology it is a definite 2-3 month ramp up and learning experience...which is hard when you come from a place where you know all the systems and processes...but when you get it you really get it!

I have worked at GR for 2 years. I have been a Sales Assistant, Loan Coordinator (Loan Processor) and am now a recruiter. They have given me so many opportunities that I wouldn't have been offered anywhere else. I would very much recommend working here to friends as I have helped several friends get hired here! I have seen so many reviews talking about income and let me just say something: If you work hard, YOU WILL MAKE MONEY. That is exactly what the bonus structure is designed to do. The harder you work, the more you make. And you can accomplish that in a normal 8 hour day.",Transition period can be difficult but it gets better. A whole lot better. GR is different when compared to other mortgage companies so it takes a bit to get your own flow and groove of things.

A manager blatantly lied to my face in a pathetic attempt to threaten me if I tried to leave. The upper management is sleazy, untrustworthy, manipulative, and spineless.

1- they say you’ll make 60-70k in a year. FALSE! They pay you a measly salary for 4 months and then it plummets to less than minimum wage. It takes a long while to build a pipeline which means you won’t get much commission. Also November-February is a dead zone. If you’re lucky you’ll make half of what they say you’ll make

2- work life balance is one of their core values. WHAT A JOKE. Two weeks in they force you to work 12 hour shifts without consent and they don’t pay OT properly. They say it’s a 24/7 job and you’re expected to work on the weekend without pay.

3- they routinely violate labor laws. They make us work 60 hour weeks and we don’t get paid for it.


4-  management tells employees they’re expendable 

5- they have infamous layoffs every year.
A bunch of managers just got fired 

6- they compromise employee’s personal info and have had data breaches

7- recruiters post bogus reviews about the company to make it look positive but in reality it’s a nightmare 

8- your paycheck will inevitably get screwed up. It’s a trademark of GR

9- they fire you for trying to switch departments or trying to take night classes. HR will not help you if you ask for help! 

10- numerous management figures have had their licenses revoked. Obviously a red flag

11- they straight up lie to employees and threaten you if they think you want to leave. They will threaten to come after your wages and actually try to withhold wages.

12- they constantly change their methods and are horribly disorganized.  You’ll get trained on one thing and then they throw it out the window. They cannot make up their minds.

13- the coffee sucks"
883,,Violates State Employment Laws,2018-05-31,1.0,Vice President of Mortgage Lending,Digital applications save me time.,"Guaranteed Rate violates State law in their employment contract then even after being notified, continue to violate state law.  They force hourly staff to work outside business hours at home but refuse to pay even base pay."
884,,Absolutely Atrocious. Disregard all positive reviews,2018-05-30,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"I’ve been wracking my brain but cannot come up with a single positive aspect about this company.  All the positive reviews are so clearly fabricated and false, it’s sickening. Nobody talks like that and as an employee I can tell you that the whole office is miserable. Nobody I know would give this place more than 2 stars and that’s generous.  They may give you free identity theft protection since they will compromise your personal info, so that’s a pro!","Endless lies, endless work, endless BS. This company is run by a bunch of clowns who do nothing but deceive and abuse employees and clientele.  They frequently mess up paychecks and they don’t pay enough to begin with. The “company culture” runs on fear and intimidation. Employees get fired for trying to continue their education while working.  There is absolutely no work life balance and they tell you it is a 24/7 job. Multiple people had their last paycheck withheld. I would have never applied to this place if I knew the truth.  Save yourself!"
885,,Definitely NOT the place to start your career,2018-05-29,1.0,Mortgage Sales Associate,Convenient location with lots of affordable lunch options nearby. GR is only bearable if you are a veteran loan officer or if you have a massive financial cushion to sustain you for a long while. Otherwise it is literally the worst possible place to start your career,"They seem to have a habit of lying and a complete lack of transparency. The actual job duties are pretty ambiguous and the compensation is terribly low. In fact there were multiple emoloyees who had to dip into their savings accounts or ask parents for money in order to survive because GR essentially pays less than minimum wage. Say goodbye to a social life if you work here because they will try to intimidate you into working 60 hour weeks.  Also you can bet on your paychecks getting messed up. Management is really quite sleazy. If
You value your life and career don’t work here"
886,,Ignore the fake 5 star reviews,2018-05-29,1.0,Anonymous Employee,You’ll spot red flags to look out for at other companies. You get identity theft protection after the company leaks your private data to hackers. Like another review said there’s no shortage of alcohol.,"The company culture is crazy cheap, like you’ll be lucky to have a working chair or sometimes just a place to sit. You’ll be told to fill out public surveys to say what a great company it is. it’s hard to stay positive with a constant flow of people leaving out of frustration and burn out.
I saw all the negative reviews before I took the job and decided to ignore them. Don’t make the same mistake! You’ll just be looking for another job in a few months, or maybe you’ll be part of the seasonal layoffs."
887,,Endless opportunities.  No glass ceiling.,2018-05-28,5.0,Vice President Mortgage Lending,"Guaranteed rate gives you every tool to be successful. As an originator there is not a better company in the country. My Mc and LC have all been at guaranteed rate for over 5 years as have I. They are making more then they would at another mortgage company. They work hard and provide excellent service. That is the basic motto across all departments. Work hard provide excellent service and your opportunity grows. I tripled my business at guaranteed rate and my clients are HAPPY.   I brought my older sister to guaranteed rate two years ago. She had zero mortgage experience and will hit presidents club this year by end of July. I just brought my younger sister on through our excel rate program so she has the same opportunity. I brought my sisters  here because the opportunities are endless. No glass ceiling here. Know your craft, work hard and care about the customer. It’s really that simple. Care about the customer and you will always win!",Seriously I don’t see any.

They routinely lie to employees and try to scare them. They also try to convince you it’s a great company to work for but that could not be farther from the truth.   If

It’s a nightmare,"Toxic work environment, manipulative/conniving management, heinous benefits, zero culture, no work/life balance , I could go on and on. They straight up lie to prospective employees but their true colors come out. They change their process constantly and they’re very disorganized.  One manager actually told employees that we are expendable and they don’t need us. Everything about this place is stressful and morale is terrible. I go into work with a stomach ache just from the stress every day. As an employee I feel used and tricked by this place.  Hours are forcibly long and the compensation is disgracefully low. Please don’t waste your time at this place; it probably won’t be around much longer before they’re shut down for numerous violations. If you accept a job here I can guarantee you’ll hate it. End of story"
892,,I regret applying here,2018-05-15,1.0,Mortgage Sales Associate,Sometimes there are cool events or free food or bbq,"There is a total lack of honesty from the get-go. I thought the mortgage associate position was one thing and then they pull the rug out from under you and show their true colors. We get forced into working really long days and the way they do overtime is extremely shady. Essentially we get screwed.  They pay a “draw” for the first couple months and then your salary drastically plummets. You’re expected to make the rest back from commission but it’s impossivle to build a book of business in the short time you’re there training.  After 4 months of employment here you will make $1400 a month after taxes and that is not a joke. People can’t live off that. If that wasn’t enough, they hardly close loans on time and the managers are clueless. Multiple people ask HR for help and managers squash it in order to manipulate employees.  The support/ops/underwriter teams don’t get treated well and to be honest nobody does unless they are the top performing sales individuals. This company is growing waaay to fast and its funny because they will wind up building all that new office space for nothing since everyone winds up quitting."
893,,VP Mortgage Lending,2018-05-14,2.0,Mortgage Loan Officer,"Technology, Programs, Training Program, Trainers, Communication","Poorly treated support staff which is the magic of a successful transaction. Managers had ZERO empathy for LO's with less than $3M a month in production. Processors were treated like machines. Don't get me wrong- GR has some excellent leaders but in my experience, the Portland Division has a poorly ran management group in place. My first 90 days- my transition team in Chicago was awesome and then after that- the local processing took over and I couldn't close a loan on time 10 out of 10 times. Losing referral partners right and left and in some instances, we were two weeks late with my only response was- increase your production to $3M or more and you will get better support? The processing was BROKEN mainly because of how the work was allocated and how they were treated so the regionals fix- hire his wife who had zero experience in the mortgage or processing world? 

I don't know if it was that they are growing faster than they have the ability to hire good managers that are actually leaders or maybe having the Corporate office on East Coast reduced the ability to oversee operations- but in my experience of being in industry over 15 years there is a major gap in the NW Operations vs. what the CEO preaches. If you are thinking of coming to GR- be sure to do your due diligence when it comes to joining them and know who your manager will be. 

I was fired by a new manager that came in for not meeting $2M a month in production- even though I lost 3 of my referral partners due to them not managing processing and there was only 2 out of 7 people doing over $2M- none of them got fired. The day I left my Branch manager started soliciting my business immediately- well he had the branch allocated processor assistant solicit for him instead of working on other LO's files and continues to put an ""I"" in the word team and his motto is to do all we can to ""Crush the Competition."" They took my database- not just past clients but ALL of my contacts and today continue ""FISH"" for leads by responding to incoming emails. 

They now require you to only use one CRM- be careful as they say they own it all then."
894,,Transaction v Relation - monstrous creation!,2018-05-11,2.0,Vice President of Mortgage Lending,"GR has a wide selection of products, good pricing, enthusiasm for technology and an excellent sales platform. It provides tons of marketing and operations support to loan officers who consistently close the highest dollar volume nationally.  GR's focus appears to be on call center based transaction sales, encouraging loan officers to buy advertising sourced leads and marketing specialist services.  
Corporate culture appeals to former Quicken Loans employees. GR offers the opportunity for call center experts to tip toe into relationship sales seeking purchase business through the real estate community.  The company provides event budgets and encourages loan officers to provide first class business development activities.
Young team members who align with the company's culture, buy into its management philosophy and make themselves available virtually 24/7 will find advancement opportunities available.","GR is a transaction sales company in a relationship sales business. 
Contrary to the Consumer Finance Protection Bureau's (CFPB's) directive for mortgage loan officers to be trusted advisors to consumers, GR's sales coaching experts boast of spending no more than 15 minutes with borrowers, relying on a level of operations support to handle the details that is not provided to loan officers who produce below $50 or $100,000,000 of closed mortgages per year, regardless of market.    
Customers and Realtors of high-producing loan officers will talk to a different person every time they call.  Although most team members are under pressure to deliver exceptional customer service, most are relatively inexperienced in the industry and/or are expected to produce more than can be accomplished if they properly review documents.  Processors are pressured to work after close of business to meet unrealistic deadlines but are not paid overtime.  This leads to nightmare loan approvals or suspensions of any loan that doesn't effortlessly fall into place.  
This resource allocation practice necessarily discriminates against referral-based loan officers serving under privileged communities and those living in the most ""affordable cost of living"" areas.  Outside sales mortgage loan officers with a reputation for excellence have a choice between doing most of the processor's job (according to company procedures) and micro managing the rest or lose business and compromise his reputation. 
Loan officers hired for branch processing in areas of GR expansion interest may find a high degree of turnover of experienced professionals mostly due to the operation system being designed to best process applications from highly qualified, digitally savvy customers.  The processing system is expected to take a year for employees to learn. 
Central processing doesn't seem to respect loan officers.  Although most carry the title ""VP"" and processors are directed to refer to them as such, processors behave as if they are higher in the corporate structure, re-structuring deals for ease of processing without permission from or consulting with the licensed loan officer who is responsible for that file over the next 30 years. They assume the loan officer is wrong, demand loan officers adapt to how they do things (reducing the commission-only paid loan officer's efficiency), may not promptly return calls/messages but require the loan officer's immediate attention if required with no notice, regardless of the loan officer's schedule ... or get put back at the bottom of the stack.
The tone of Operation's relationship with Loan Officers is passive-aggressively hostile.  Communication is robot-like polite, with the please's and thank you's nestled in for political correctness (with exceptions, of course).    Processors and underwriters respond to well structured loans as if they automatically assume the loan officer is guilty of fraud.  Many underwriters are poorly versed on underwriting guidelines, attempting to reject loans for reasons that are spelled out acceptable in investor guidelines.   It is not uncommon for a highly qualified loan officer to snip and paste actual guidelines into an email with a detailed explanation of why the loan is insurable. 
Loan officers are told to ""trust your team"" but are reassigned to different people every 90 days or whenever is convenient for operations. Promises of a consistent team of highly qualified professionals are secretly conditional upon unrealistic volume expectations. 
Management is inconsistent, changing frequently with no notice sometimes for weeks. Loan officers are reassigned branches without consultation or sent to corporate with no branch assignment, loosely supervised by people that may not be experienced in the local market or outside sales.
If there is a mistake, GR's knee-jerk reaction is to hit the loan officer.  There are charges for rush underwriting and closing taken out of the loan officer's commission because the VP is responsible for everything, even if their support personnel don't efficiently process the loan and are required to serve multiple loan officers. GR is willing to reassign loans to lower-paid inside loan officers if there is a cure of more than commission to be earned - with absolutely no pay to actual loan officer who did the work.  GR will reduce the pay of a loan officer 6 months after a loan doesn't close if they no longer have records of the customer paying for the appraisal. If proper forms weren't filed by the processor, the loan officer pays for the appraisal.  These practices result in loan officers getting less than their established rate due to on some loans and is probably outside the Loan Officer Compensation Act requirements.  
Especially since the company merged with private-equity firm Thomas H. Lee Partners, the company is moving toward central processing, laying off local branch people at the same time it advertises to hire call-center serving central processors. It is pushing for higher dollar production even in communities with low sale prices as if most referral sources work exclusively with jumbo borrowers.  GR either has no comprehension of the nature of relationship sales or it is intentionally discouraging loan officers except for those who consistently produce high mortgage amounts."

They blatantly lie about the role and the pay. You will be tricked into working longer hours for less than minimum wage. There’s simply no way to survive off what they pay.  Say goodbye to your life if you work here. Management is a boys club comprised of the CEO’s slimey friends, some of which have actually lost their licenses. They call themselves a cool startup but they have this thing where you can only wear jeans Fridays if you pay $5. They trick and abuse employees which feels terrible.

You will legitimately get more money on unemployment than working here. Managers are slimey, sleazy and lie to you regularly. Totally disorganized. Their core values are a joke: everything management does contradicts the core values. Management is rude and unhelpful, HR turns a blind eye and benefits are trash. They treat employees like garbage. People have tried to switch positions internally and they get fired. Company morale is miserable in all departments. Toxic work environment that leaves employees feeling incredibly stressed.

Manager was semi-decent but entirely unresponsive to emails and phone calls for weeks at a time. It was like having no manager and working with the hope that you don’t have any questions. Relied solely on other team members and had no guidance whatsoever. When complained, was told I should have understood that the manager is not a “micro manager” and that I should have known when I should be reviewed. I suffered considerable mental and emotional stress having to deal with the sudden firing. No such thing as accepting responsibility for actions for management. But subordinate team members ALWAYS had to apologize for any mistake and take responsibility for the team. 
Employees are treated very poorly like they are easily replaceable and can be fired on the spot with BS excuses. This company takes advantage of the fact that the employer doesn’t have to give you any heads up before firing you. To the max. 
The HR department doesn’t care even 1% about employees and has absolutely zero compassion. They fire you like you are not even human. They do a poor job with explaining benefits and are not timely with answering emails. 
My HR rep didn’t even have the decency to say hi when I would run into her in the office as we worked in the same place. Smiling is a foreign concept to that godforsaken department. I absolutely loathed that such an important job was given to such a callous and uncaring person.

In turn, there’s no advancement or innovation in technology, and any sense of meritocracy is squashed. 
The ""tech innovation"" part is a mirage, because upper management cares more about inflating the company's accounting value to sell ownership to private equity/investment banks. This is not entirely unreasonable; all companies strive for higher valuation. 
In Guaranteed Rate's case, however, the want for higher valuation is incredibly short-sighted; the company creates no meaningful value to the industry, and it has nothing to offer that other bigger companies do not already. That explains why the company has plateaued in its marketplace standing, and why Victor Ciardelli has already started shopping around to liquidate his holdings.

926,,Associate Mortgage Specialist,2018-02-13,1.0,Associate Mortgage Specialist,The group of people I started with were great peers.,"EVERYTHING. Please do not apply to this company. In the beginning they offered me an  mortgage specialist position and I accepted with high hopes. A week into the position they drastically switch your schedule without your approval and have you work mandatory overtime without asking even though it is stated in contract that you have an option. Also, instead of spending your time studying to pass the mortgage exam they train you on the call center operations and focus on your production numbers. 

Also, Management often states that all other obligations need to be put behind you for the position. To me, being at home with my children  is more important than cold calling a 3 month old lead at 8 pm. PLEASE be cautious before wasting your time applying here."

A flat management structure provides daily interactions with the directors to receive feedback on how to improve as well as give feedback on how to improve the department, sales process, or company itself.

Some fluff like free monthly happy hours and twenty minute massages if that's what makes you happy at work.","This is not a culture that values feedback, transparency, or mutual respect among its employees and its chief executive.   The  company is run through his own personal experience, therefore operations such as IT and marketing are reliant on meeting whatever his personal opinion is.   Micromanagement at it's worst.  As a result, internal cross-functional meetings are not focused on building a strategy based on customer needs or data, but what leadership might want at that particular moment in time.  This cannot allow employees to operate to their best potential in their particular area of expertise and mostly, it breeds fear.  And fear for a reason: during my time at Guaranteed Rate, many directors and executives were let go - we're talking 5 within months. Imagine the chaos this causes as more junior team members try to pick up the pieces of what they're supposed to be doing, while not making the same ""mistakes"" their predecessors/bosses made.      

There is little strategic planning, deadlines or other reasonable measures to be able to execute your job with any sort of predictability.  Resources to be able to execute might be granted, or not, depending on personal experience instead of a building a predictable budget. Instead of a meeting to discuss your ask, you'll be asked to put the request in the CEO's inbox, or maybe someone in an entirely other functional area will be asked to execute the project that you're supposed to be working on.  This also results in territorial behavior instead of the teamwork to work towards building something awesome. 

If you're on the fence about working here, you can easily find articles about Guaranteed Rate's approach to partnership and companies they've worked with in the media. The stories align."

1007,,Department,2017-03-02,2.0,Anonymous Employee,Great company culture that embraces the City of Chicago and urban culture.,I signed up to work a 8 hr day but instead ended up work 11-12 hour days.

Co-worker that I worked with was a nightmare. Every other word that came out of his mouth was the F word. Very unprofessional. Hired me to work remotely and max of two days in office occasionally due to travel time. Corporate decided that everyone had to work in the office. Office was not located where I was told upon hiring and the temporary office was in major metropolitan area. Parking costs were extremely high when I was told it would be free if I needed to go to office. Upper management did absolutely nothing about the vulgar language and sexist jokes from co-worker though they were told about it. This co-worker sells a lot of loans so they seemed willing to put up with his actions. Management was not polite or helpful with training. The response was always, ""look in the resource center""! She seemed irritated having to deal with complaints of this co-worker, even though she admitted my co-worker uses the F word to everyone including his boss.  If management feels you complain about a co-worker who makes the company a lot of money, they will get rid of you upon your first couple mistakes. People in money making positions are only ones who count, the rest of employees are disposable."
1012,,Closed out,2017-01-05,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"The bonuses were great but you really had to work hard for them. The office in Chicago was great and relaxed, I worked in one of their satellite offices and they offer nothing to the employees there.","I was promised 2 weeks of training at the corporate office. I got 3 days, then was shipped off to a satellite office with no support at all. Used a brand new software I never used before so I had many questions. I had to ask my supervisor who was in the Chicago office and took hours to get a response. All the employees at the satellite office worked from home at will, I was told it was a privilege for me to work from home and was expected to be in the office each day. Training was horrible. They just threw printed out handouts at you and expected you to follow along with no experience in the software I was using. My boss called one day with HR to tell me it was not ""working out"" and that they had to let me go. I can respect the decision to be let go, but my boss out right lied that we had ""conversations"" about my performance months earlier and that she was just now getting around to terminating me. Horrible experience. I would avoid this company unless you are is sales, then you are treated as a golden child. Benefits are ridiculously expensive. Only given 3 sick days and are expected to work from home if you are to sick to come into work."

Well no, humbly sir, its not my job to name your folder, or make any other decisions for ya.
Nature of the job - all equipment is standard, so minimal hardware troubleshooting.  Most of the job is support of logins :(  .  Some frustration whether some complex business rule was not followed i.e. operator error, or the application / server is having hiccups ... again."

If you start in entry level, you can forget about being someone important. I've literally heard an executive ask ""Who are they?"" about a current employee, and the response was ""A nobody"". If you are not a high performing producer (VP) or executive, you are basically scum of the company. Oh yeah, they hate paying overtime (time and a half), yet they expect you to work over 40 hours a week. Benefits? Only about $300/month for yourself (extreme sarcasm). I didn't even enroll in benefits seeing that I started out making $13/hour even after having 7 years of work experience and a college degree. BEWARE RECENT COLLEGE GRADS. Don't be fooled by their job post that screams ""super cool company culture"", they are FAR from it. The turnover rates are ridiculously high, which is a HUGE red flag!

It started off that way until they kept changing things every 3-5 months. The contracts changed, so the promises of making more money became harder. Once you're good at making money for the company they'll love you but once you can't produce they'll threaten to fire you no matter if you're a good worker or not. All they care about is the number & making the company money. They do not compensate their employees well considering every month we're helping them bring in billions. It's sad how greedy this company is, they care about their employees that much. It's no room for growth & in order to move up you have to suck up to a bunch of men."

I don't have to worry about my reputation being ruined by the all to common industry standards that show a lack of urgency in the process.  Customer service is a huge part of this business and reputation is how I have earned the trust of  so many local referral partners that enable me to to feed my family.  Not only is there great leadership but always a resource available to make sure I succeed. The process is down to a science and operations is held accountable to hold their end of the bargain when it comes  to getting a deal to the closing table. I have not lost one deal yet because of pricing nor missed a closing date on the contract since working here which is something that I used to rarely experience.  I'm respected and treated like an adult provided with leads as well as the direction required to  start the process regardless of how ""creative"" the financing has to be.  We have an events team that  call local venues and schedule events for not only me but everybody on my team individually so that I'm able to stand out from the crowd. These events have allowed me to earn multiple referral partners because it is a unique way to grab attention from the local realtor community.  If we do not have a loan that fits the mold of each individual then we have the ability to broker the loan out to a Nother lender but still keep our client so I can confidently say that I have access to  most if not all available  lending options  that exist in our highly regulated environment. Since our process is ironed out and very detailed there is no question or gray area in regards to who does what and when things are supposed to get done. Everybody knows what they are supposed to do and  take great pride in getting the job done. I have been able to stand among the ranks of the top 1% of loan officers in the United States over the past couple years and I'm proud to say I will be able to continue to do that here and still be able to spend time with my family.  I will be able to do twice the amount of business in half the time because of how organized guaranteed rate is. Again, we have resources in place that will always be available if I have a question. Two processors for each file so that sales can focus on sales while still delivering exceptional client service at a competitive price  available if I have a question. Two processors for each file so that sales can focus on sales while still delivering exceptional client service at a competitive price. I'll finish with this even with all of the above I am still compensated at the highest rate I've ever been compensated per transaction. Thank you guaranteed great!",Thanks to the local and companywide support my peers as well as leadership has offered here at  guaranteed rate I can proudly say that I don't have any cons!

They are readily available to their customers and work diligently to provide them with the best customer service possible.

1083,,Inflated Broker Shop Disguised as a Mortgage Lender,2016-03-02,1.0,Anonymous,"Some can work Remotely (you can end up working 12 hour days so it does help to not drive), Corporate has the nice, very expensive and impressive Rooftop Deck (around the time that was built 25-30% of the workforce was laid off by 1/2014), Chef and reasonably priced lunches.","The ""open workspace"" concept gives you about three feet across, almost elbow to elbow with your co-worker next to you. It reminds me of working in a factory (shall we say sweatshop)? People come and go all the time. Too many cooks I mean Managers, and not enough actual workers. The training department is constantly slimming down so they developed a National Support Center downtown that spends their days answering any question possible regarding Secondary, Underwriting, and Processing. 
Overtime? No paid Flexible Work Schedule. Research it, as it only benefits those working 40 hours or less a week. Once over 40 hours you are paid almost as if you're an Exempt employee. Kind of ridiculous and most departments because of this illegal twist tell, No demand and intimidate those that clock in more than 40 hours a week. 
The company is in so many directions and just about any lender you can think of, they offer. Great? Not unless your staff knows what they're doing. Each loan is passed through several hands and audits. The VP (LO), MC (Mortgage Consultant), Underwriter, LC (Loan Coordinator), back to underwriter, TRID desk, closer, etc. After all those hands this loan must be perfect right? Wrong. There are Junior Underwriters, audits, pre and post closing audits and still issues. There are a vast amount of Broker loans too that the Lender underwrites, unfortunately garbage in garbage out.
The employees other than the VP's are disrespected, intimidated, overworked and many under paid. Many Managers do not deserve to be or are not qualified to Manage themselves yet they manage teams, departments, etc.
There are some great people working there that are such an asset to the company, but you'll never hear about them. Nepotism is encouraged and is so common among the select employees. 
There is absolutely no work life balance whatsoever!
I had a manager that almost grabbed me by my neck for saying good morning to the people next to me! He said I was wasting everyone's time? Good Morning and Peace Out!

Overworked employees with little to no overtime compensation, company takes advantage of employees at all levels. No such thing as a review or raise no matter how long you work there.

The marketing department is a tight-knit bunch full of young, enthusiastic employees and managers that genuinely seem to care about their employees. Long days or night and weekend work doesn't really exist on the marketing side. You don't really need email on your phone because everything can be left at work when you leave.","The marketing department pays pennies some employees.

Loved the idea of the POD model, although, it wasn't managed well. You could have one team in 4 different states.",Awful Management. No work-life balance. Expensive benefits. CEO went on yelling sprees. No overtime. Flex time was a complete joke and should have been considered as wage theft

1090,,I have a love hate relationship,2016-01-08,3.0,Underwriter,Lots of opportunity to grow.  So many people I know have gotten their government delegations (FHA/VA).  So if you want a chance to build your career this a good place.  Their is a lot of opportunity to get paid for what you do.  The salaries may be low but the bonus structure is pretty extensive so if you have some extra time on your hands and are willing to work more you can make a lot of money here.  There are a lot of good people here and if you find them and kind of work  your way into that niche this can be a very enjoyable place to work.  It is very fast place to work and turn time oriented.,"Benefits are kind of poor.  I do not elect to get them and choose to be insured via my spouse's insurance instead.  Medical is expensive, 401K isn't very good compared to banks.  as mentioned above base salaries are low but can be easily be made up but doing extra work.  It is a very difficult place to underwrite.  We have tons of investors including GNMA/FNMA/FHLMC and beyond the agencies we have to underwrite to their overlays.  This is great for sales to get the best rates but bad for underwriting as it exposes us to higher potential of missing overlays.  it is very sales oriented and the structure/culture of the company leads to many distractions and often being interrupted and asked the same questions over and over again because the team doesn't work cohesively sometimes.  It often lands on the underwriter to over communicate so everyone is on the same page which is very time consuming. Although the company is very good and promoting and growing their people, it is a double edged sword.  You wind up working with people who are green and the training isn't as robust as it should be.  So you wind up holding their hands and walking them through and training them on the program.  This is a big problem especially if you are government underwriter. As with most companies they look for every reason to do the loan when there are plenty of reasons to say no.  They push the edges of guidelines so you need thick skin and let it roll off your back when your decision gets overturned."

1093,,"IT and Marketing are trying to be progressive, bureaucracy is rife rotting company culture.",2016-01-02,1.0,Project Manager,"The pros mostly apply to people working at the corporate headquarters--subsidized lunch at an internal cafeteria, access to a gym, a rooftop yoga class, and a nurse who also does chiropractic adjustments. If you work at a different office you don't get anything like that. Aside from corporate most offices don't even have vending machines (it's against policy).

The IT department and Marketing department are trying to disrupt the larger financial industry as a whole, but are not empowered to actually make those changes. I don't see this changing for at least 6 months, and may even be stifled then for no good reason.","Healthcare costs are the highest of any I have ever seen. You end up paying far more of the premium than the company. Deductibles are high, and choices are super limited. I paid on the order of $400+/month for fairly standard coverage for myself alone and still had a large deductible.

Micromanagement, fear, and capriciousness rule upper management. A certain C level executive is so mercurial that it causes fear in the rest of upper management. One is never sure if they will see his good side or bad side, and this is independent of whether or not your work is objectively good. It took multiple months for a requisition of mine to be approved for a simple $10 computer adapter because the CEO had to sign off on it first--it's rumored that he signs off on all requisitions. 

Because of the fear that is strident in the organization, coordinating interdepartmental projects is far harder than it needs to be. It means that no one knows what they want, because at the end of the day everything must be signed off by their boss, their bosses boss, and so on.

Turnover is high.

Everyone is on the defensive in meetings, waiting to be attacked, and it keeps the business from openly solving problems and creating better service, better products, and a better place to work.

While working here you feel like no one cares for you because of the little things: the chairs are cheap and break all the time and no one will change them in the name of frugality, you can't get simple tools that you need without having to send it all the way to the top of the chain of command--which takes months.

The company wants to hire the best and top talent in the business and then debilitates them from doing their job. It's like hiring the best construction company in Chicago to build your house and then telling them they can't use a hammer, nails, screws, power tools, or wood. You'll always get mediocre results, even from the best in the industry, if you don't help them get the tools they need to accomplish your goals."

The only issue being is if your manager or VP doesn't produce numbers you bonus will be hindered.  Not only is that an issue, most the VP's/Managers think they are the greatest ever and expect you to be exactly like them.  It's the VP's way or the highway.

Victor (the owner) needs to worry more about investing in better/larger network servers in order to support the volume we have and invest less in marketing campaigns that will only bring more business that the systems cannot support. You can't handle what you have.....why are you trying to generate more business when you cannot keep up with what you have? Advice to Victor: It's OBVIOUS the systems cannot support this volume and you're way in over your head. If you keep going at this rate with less than qualified management team you have, your turnover rate will continue to increase and GR will be known as the WORST places to work and your company will fail......and that is what's GUARANTEED

- The systems go down on a daily basis, yet the production expectations remain the same causing many employees to work past midnight &1am. 
- There is absolutely no respect for hard work within this company and there is no work/life balance. 
- Senior/upper management are not consistent by setting out new procedures and never following through. 
- Management appears to be confused and disconnected lately, as if they are unsure if they're coming or going. It's complete chaos. 
- Managers are lacking the overall knowledge required for their positions and they manage their team using the ""bully tactic"" believing fear is an actual motivator. 
- Myself and many others have not received an annual review (nor raise) in over 2.5 years even after requested several times. Not a single peer is aware of their work performance. One day you're the greatest and the next day you are threatened and worried you will lose your job. The bi-polar management needs to STOP. 
- My RUM is clueless in regards to investor guidelines and is incapable of offering support when asked an investor guidelines question pertaining to ""gray like area scenarios"". His one and only response is ""refer to GR resource center"". It's obvious he is not up to date with standard investor guides. Additionally, he lacks personality and is probably the coldest individual I have ever worked for my entire career.

I must ask how the individuals within management are where they're at within this company? A respectful professional business respects an individual who works hard, who takes pride in their work and consistently seeks ongoing training to further gain knowledge of their role, so they can further succeed. This is NOT the case at this company. Apparently, it's WHO you know and not WHAT you know that provides their advancement. It's unfortunate because GR is going WILL lose good quality employees if they continue on this route."

Candidates have to speak with a host of people before an actual offer is presented. It would be great if there was someone in a position of sales management that was not responsible for production or operations at all. That person could 100 percent of the time be focused on extending offers, interviewing and hiring. That way recruiters can get the candidates to the table.. And there would really be only 1 other person for the recruit to speak with. Some regions are better at this than others, of course. However overall still an awesome company."

One of the people at that level has clear favorites and it is obvious to everyone.  If you aren't one of those people your phone calls are not returned, your emails are ignored and you are assigned few (most poor quality) loan officers and their loans.

There's a really good group of people working in the lower ranks and the atmosphere is definitely the best aspect of the job.,"The upper management puts almost no stock in the post closing side of things, or really much of anything outside of sales unless it's from a troubleshooting standpoint.  They refuse to invest in the infrastructure of their operations departments as they view them as secondary concerns (if that).  As a result, many of the operations departments are forced to work with clunky, inefficient systems and processes that are filled with a variety of workarounds and patches that slow down the whole process.

- The VP I worked under was great, and so was my operations manager. They were encouraging and did whatever they could to help me.
- I saw and/or heard of certain coworkers who were less than pleasant, but in general, every one I interacted with was very friendly and warm.","- Very low pay for high-intensity and time-sensitive work
- Underpaid overtime. Flex pay is meant for flexible schedules (some weeks less than 40 hours, some weeks more), but the schedule at Guaranteed Rate was not flexible - most weeks worked 45-50 hours. Overtime translates to around $5-6 an hour for every extra hour worked
- Expensive health benefits
- There were a lot of small things that made working at Guaranteed Rate difficult. The most glaring example - I would have to scan hundreds of pages, but the company would refuse to fix the scanner despite multiple requests.

1117,,"Treated like a number, not a human.  Watch your step",2015-09-02,1.0,Anonymous Employee,Lot of online resources and training videos.,"This was a miserable experience.  Hired in the middle of an extremely busy time, it became evident they used me when they laid me off in just 60 days because the 'position was eliminated' due to slow down in business.  If they told me up front it was only for a little while that would have been fine.  It was all VERY underhanded.  Initially I was told over the phone it was fine to work from home, but when I came in for the interview I was then told I had to 'prove' I could handle it, but had to work in the office for the first 90 days.  Fine, I was willing to go with it.  They give you a week of online training for 6 hours a day where they dump literally EVERYTHING on you at once, then week 2 you start working on loans.  The branch managers know nothing about processing, and the other processors were too busy to help.  I don't mind being thrown in and learning as you go.  However it's pretty difficult to get anything done when your brand new and can barely get any help.  During the first week of actual processing I was told they cannot justify someone's salary if they don't close enough loans.  Really??  After being in the job a week and a half??  It was extremely frustrating trying to get used to their system which is completely different then anywhere else, then worrying about losing your job on top of that.  We were also told in a group meeting that other processors were fired for not closing enough loans....that's twice in the first 30 days this was said.  What does THAT say about the way they think?  That your just a number.  The corporate office was great at checking in regularly to see how you were doing, which is unusual in a big company.  I can give them that.  But the mentality of the branch was very different.  There was NO work/life balance and everyone there seemed pretty miserable.  I worked very hard often staying up until 12:00 or 1:00 AM working to get loans closed, however I know the business so I know during the boom times this is normal.  I was willing to suffer through it.  However even though I was putting in 110% I was constantly worried about losing my job because as I mentioned I had been told twice (in the first 30 days mind you) that you needed to close enough loans to justify your existence.  That is a miserable way to live.  Seems like this was planned all along.  Talk about churn em and burn em!  It's like walking on eggshells all the time.  Watch your step with these people.  Not to mention the salary was nothing to rave about, especially for the amount of work that is expected.  Then when I turned in my laptop I started asking questions and they tried making up some baloney, even though the week before I asked how I was doing and was told fine.  Really, just be up front and stop making excuses.  You just needed a warm body to get through a busy season.  Oh, and most of the employees there were new too, seems to be a high turnover.  Disgusting the way they treat people!!  Honestly they should be ashamed of themselves.  May sound harsh but I was treated very harshly, and I am a very honest person and not afraid to speak the truth."

Chicago is an expensive place to live and the salary they offer cannot support anyone. I had to work a second job in the evening and I lived in a fairly low rent area. Parking is a major problem. A lack of communication between the loan offices (VPS) and the rest of the company gave us a lot of angry customers and the customer service department was the scapegoat. They are also surprisingly behind the time technologically. Someone in my dept job was to print pdf and then rescan them!!

Working with a supportive and a dedicated  team frees up your time so we can focus more on our business. Culture is great here too!,Sometimes there can be a few extra layers to run through but I realize now that its a compliance of the size of the company so I began to take these layers and learn and learn to maneuver.

Be careful if you are interviewing, they make false promises.","The only employees who actually make some money are the Loan Officers, or as they call them ""VP's"". All the positive reviews are from these VP's and their high producing POD members.

What a horrible company to work for. They make false promises. Don't be fooled by the responses from their social media/HR team - its their job to try to justify their crappy company. Victor could care less about the people he employs - as long as he has a nice check when some people barely get paid enough to get by. I knew people making $10 an hour to do the work for other people is COMPLETELY unacceptable. OT is a complete joke, no such thing. Tell Victor to give back to his employees in the form of fair compensation - someone just may go to the Dept. of Labor. I took some legal and business classes and now have a law license and their business practices are not right at all. Your $40,000 salary might be nice but you will make only pennies per hour in ""overtime."" All they care about is the President's Club and top producers. Everyone else, the do't bother with. HQ thinks their rooftop deck is the best thing about working for GR....REALLY?! The best thing about working there should be their customers, their role in the company, and the impact they make. If that is the best part about the company, spread it to the other offices spread around the U.S. The office I worked in was horrendous...no matching walls, very bare, no wall decorations, no coffee maker, no supplies...seriously?! 

Regional managers...horrible, rude, do not support their employees, could give a care less about anyone but themselves, heartless. Stop acting like a machine, we are HUMANS not robots. You don't know how to do any problem solving, you just expect it to be done the way you want it.

They also made people sign a ""disclosure"" stating they cannot talk badly about the company - glad I didn't sign it! People need to see honest reviews about this company, not these sugar-coated ones that if are bad they will find out who posted it and fire them. How about take a lesson and improve? Not sugar coat everything because they cannot accept the fact that more than half of employees, past and present, are/were unhappy. 

Bottom line, if you are looking for work, steer clear of this company. Find another one - don't waste your time for false promises to be made. I am SO happy I left. I would not have the great opportunity at the fantastic, employee driven, compensated for their worth, company."

1137,,Like being in an abusive relationship with a really pretty girl...,2015-07-01,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"Social atmosphere is great. The overall look and feel of the company is so attractive-- young, popular, hip, etc. Just something about the place makes you happy when you walk in and you feel cool just for working there.

Now let's keep in mind everything I just said is surface buzz....hence the ""Pretty Girl"" reference in the aforementioned title. Keep reading, let me tell you all about her personality and what it's like to be in a relationship with her.","She's crazy, controlling, beats you for slightly over-cooking dinner, and will ultimately end up leaving you for a younger model if you don't wise up and move on first. Oh, and the mother-in-law (CEO)...is an absolute tyrant. Avoid at all costs or you will suffer PTSD later in life. 

Still confused? Let me explain--- It lures you in with numerous ""accolades"" and ""awards"" (self promoted and required of current employees), wines and dines you on the roof top deck and an ""employee appreciation lunch"", shows you off at all the cool holiday parties and events, and then all of a sudden the madness begins. Overtime with hardly any compensation (is that legal?), verbal abuse by management...but then again, they are a product of THEIR environment which is borderline assault by the C.E.O. directly, and a total lack of reward for individual thoughts or good performance. They are still paying recent college graduates and people even a few years out of college something ridiculously close to minimum wage, $12 an hour? Hardly enough to pay student loans...or the cost of the healthcare benefits which are unrealistically expensive. 

It's not a surprise that practically every member of the executive staff has fled the company within the last 6 months..... 

I will caveat this all by saying there are some really fantastic people there. My guess is they either don't directly report to the CEO or they have such low self esteem from working there for so long that they don't know they can do better."

There is a team oriented feel around here and it seems everyone is willing to jump in on any project to help out.  There seems to be a lot of opportunity to take on projects that you are interested in and to grow with the company.  

Coming from the sports industry, I was a little concerned that working for a mortgage company would be boring.  GR really makes what could be a boring industry/company trendy and cool.  They seem to be at the forefront of the industry and are constantly creating new technology to stay ahead of the times.  

The employee/company culture is a top priority for the CEO which is a welcome change from my last company.  There are monthly events for employees, volunteer opportunities, free massages, access to the company gym and rooftop with a view of the city.

Marketing, events and IT has been a big mental shift for me. You really have to let go of the control and let the system work for you.","It would be great to offer stand-alone second mortgages.

There is a reason the attrition rate is over 40%, people are treated like cattle. Don't let the rooftop fool you, unless you're a top producing LO you're completely expendable. With rates going up it's only a matter of weeks before they start making cuts, loyalty is a two way street except at GR. On top of that, the COO just joined the list of top executives that had enough and left the organization. They'll promise you great pay but at the end of the day it's totally not worth it.

Heavy on the micromanagement with Junior Recruiters, to the point where they don't care how efficient you are but how many calls you make to candidates. Ridiculous. The more mediocre your performance was the more they celebrate you. If you are sharp, can think on your feet, and excel they will despise you. Sounds backwards right? It is, I was one of the best in a short time, and they were not happy.

The managers over the Junior Recruiters do not care. They routinely, ""work from home."" OK. And leave you to do the grunt work. One manager in particular is extremely insecure, she is hell bent on being in control. ""Make the calls. Pound the phones."" That was her reaction to someone just joking around to her. 

Oh, and one manager just totally left one day and went drinking and didn't even attempt to come back. Great way to lead by example. I'm sorry but you are not Don Draper."

1177,,Worst company I've worked for - bar none.,2014-11-06,1.0,Vice President of Lending,They do have a good model and use a good version of Encompass,"Depending on the processing hub you are attached to and the management team you can either have a great experience or a horrific experience.  I had the latter.

With their POD model you need an outstanding processing staff as in their model you are largely divorced from the day to day nuts and bolts of a file - it is in the hands of your processors and you are to sell loans as your first, second, and third priorities.  If your processing staff is not absolutely outstanding you will fail miserably and burn your contacts and referral partners badly.  If you try and intervene in a loan file you get your hand slapped because that is not your role - your role is to sell, sell, sell.  Unfortunately for me, and the poor loan officers in the same hub, there was no stopping the bleeding and the management team I experienced were the typical corporate middle managers who assign blame but don't add value.  It was a truely tramatic experience.

And as some others have posted if things go south they really go south.  Guaranteed Rate likes to hold you responsible for anything that happens to a loan file and will revoke your commission at the drop of a hat.  I'm well into process of trying to recoup legally over $45,000 of commissions that GRI has thus far refused to pay.  I've been in the business for a decade and has never come across anything remotely close to my experience at GRI.

I do think that the model does work depending on the POD you are attached to but you can't know going in - it's a crap shoot.  

I cannot over emphasize how much this company can have a deleterious impact on your business if you are attached to the wrong team."

We need to focus on bringing our entire workforce back to our core values and in-turn begin operating as efficiently as we did just few years ago. Management has shown a keen focus on doing just this.

Everyone is sharp and fun – and the challenges we’re working to solve are interesting. There are plenty of times when we need to burn the midnight oil, especially when multiple initiatives are due. Usually though, working with my team is great and I have a perfect balance between work and between time outside of the office.","Getting new business partnerships up and running seems to take a substantial amount of time and approval layers from multiple parties. Streamlining this process would allow focus to stay on the challenge itself, rather than marshalling support for a given solution."

I have been with Guaranteed Rate for over 5 years.  I recently got recited to go to another firm with an ""exciting opportunity"".  The new place had people from all over the Mortgage Spectrum.  There were all individuals that may have been successful in a past life.  Guaranteed Rate has true success stories and they continue to attract people that are true starts and people that genuinely care about customer service and effective product delivery.","This is the only environment where what you put in, you will get out.  I have seen several employees walk in at a entry level position and raise quickly into leadership roles."
1186,,If you are or think you are the best…,2014-10-14,5.0,Branch Manager,"Guaranteed Rate is a one stop shop for all your needs as a loan officer. From rates, cost, marketing, branding, and a process that works, you will be hard pressed to find another to compare. Guaranteed Rate has built a company and a process that treats the loan officer as the client and your actual clients as VIP members of the company.","You must have an “Entrepreneur” state of mind and the willingness to adapt to the culture and not have a mindset of ""your way or no way."" Guaranteed Rate already figured it out. Jump on and learn quick."

Good processing can make a great experience at GR and bad processing can crush it.

Guaranteed Rate is always striving for the best in technology and efficiency and each year, the company continues to improve.  There are some incredibly smart individuals working at Guaranteed Rate and it is truly inspiring to be surrounded by them!","With being innovative and forward thinking, we do go through a lot of change in terms of process flow and that can be challenging.

1193,,Great Company,2014-10-08,5.0,Administrative Assistant,"Guaranteed Rate has an amazing and unique way of preparing a new employees with pre-recorded training videos. Having been with a few different mortgage industries, I can honestly say that they do the greatest preparation for training. Not only do require the training, but they have 24/7 access training videos in any department that you can re-watch as much needed. Rather than having to interupt a manager, you can go back and review the videos and they guide you step by step.",The health benefits package is over priced for the middle class income earners.

Recently pivoted to focus even more on using technology to revolutionize a clearly aging industry. Plenty to do, lots of room for growth and tons of opportunities for self starters. Workspace is an open-room environment which leads to easy communication between team members and teams. Great perks - gym, rooftop deck and daily breakfast/lunch a options are available for all employees. Also love the location, literally next to the Irving Park stop, and it's a nice change of pace to work in a neighborhood that's not downtown.",So many things to do and a lot of processes are still being defined. This can lead to chaos and lots of noise to sift through at times.
1197,,Guaranteed Rate Review,2014-10-01,5.0,Vice President,Guaranteed Rate takes excellent care of me as someone committed to this business across all aspects of my day to day from origination to funding.  I would not be able to successfully network and earn business in the efficient manner that I do without the assistance of the company.,Guaranteed Rate handles the stresses of the industry upfront with me.  Many of the challenges that face the lending industry are dealt with in the best way possible at Guaranteed Rate.

The work flow has been designed to provide the best customer service to our borrowers and have a loan move quickly through the process. I work in the closing department, have worked at some large companies before GRI and the closing process here is by far the best!!! I love the morale and management at GRI. They are extremely positive and upbeat and allow you the freedom to get things done. They recognize achievements and reward their employees for such. They do not act as if they are above you and strongly support that we are all a team working together. And of course, I have the coolest boss ever!!! GRI is definitely an innovative company and one that I am glad and proud to be a part of. I finally work for a company that I hope will be my home for many years to come!","Too many audits - would like to see some of these eliminated (closing, funding, agency, etc)"

My bosses are so amazing! They do not micromanage, which is really a big deal for me and the office morale. Also they have no problem stepping in and helping with my job and doing it if needed. Which from my past experience is very unusual.  Most of the time the boss cant even do my job let alone step in to help!   I have worked for 5 lenders in 13 years and this is by far the best place I have worked and the upper management is wonderful as far as I am concerned!!!  Hoping for many more years at G-Rate!","The only cons I have is the file balance and rush file determination. This is more of a region issue, not really a Guaranteed Rate issue.  But I am a faster closer and believe my skills should be utilized to the fullest. This would benefit Guaranteed Rate, the client and me.  Quite often I see the other closers really busy but yet I am not.  I understand that we all do the same job and close to the same amount of files, but when someone is faster and getting a limited amount of suspense's, that person should always be busy with files."
1202,,Decent Company,2014-09-17,3.0,Assistant Manager,Working for Guaranteed Rate has given me opportunities to advance within the company. I have received 3 promotions during my 4 years with the company. They have given me a good start to a career coming out of college. Working at Guaranteed Rate allows you to learn something new each day and work with exceptional people.,"A challenge I have faced working here is insufficient training across the whole company. There have been numerous arguments with employees in other departments, due to receiving varying information. I would also have to say that working for Guaranteed Rate does not allow me a lot of vacation time that I would like or proper compensation for overtime put in."
1203,,"No one is perfect, but Guaranteed Rate is close...",2014-09-17,4.0,Anonymous Employee,"This company really works hard to make their employees happy. The company and their senior management are not perfect, but they try. Working hard to smooth out the mortgage process as much as possible while keeping focus on good company culture. Company benefits are amazing and lots of helpful training tools are provided. I have been here a long time and can tell you that this is the best mortgage company I have ever worked for so far in my career.",The company needs to look into how some loan officers communicate to their operations team. Everyone should be professional and respectful. This is not always the case.

1205,,Complete Disappointment,2014-09-14,1.0,Vice President Mortgage Lending,Good marketing.  Good use of technology.,"Overhyped, fails to deliver anything to the loan officer, known in the market as ""Guaranteed Late.""   There isn't anything good to say about this company when it comes to getting loans done.  The POD loan process at Guaranteed Rate simply does not work.  As a company, GR does not stay accountable for anything.  When something goes wrong, all of the Chicago personnel immediately blame the loan officer.   At the top of the heap is the founder and CEO Victor Ciardelli.  On weekly calls he rants about how loan officers should know guidelines better than underwriters.  He goes on and on about how the GR platform is so amazing.   Victor thinks that GR makes loan officers productive and good.   That's his assumption.   His mentality is that if a loan officer doesn't do well at GR, it's because the loan officer is an idiot.   This is not a welcoming CEO nor company that is dedicated to the success of people who join.   Rather, Victor is only dedicated to his top producers in Chicago, Boston, and Denver.  On weekly sales calls the only loan officers he talks about ad nauseam are his Chicago top producers.  STAY AWAY FROM THIS COMPANY UNLESS YOU ARE PHYSICALLY LOCATED IN CHICAGO AND RELATED TO A GR TOP PRODUCER AND EVEN STILL DONT MIND BEING TREATED LIKE AN IMBECILE UNTIL YOUR PRODUCTION LOOKS DECENT!!!!!!"
1206,,They say they are different.  They are - just not in a good way.,2014-09-11,1.0,Loan Coordinator,"They do have low rates.
Great marketing support.","No life.  Operations are overworked and underpaid.  Their ""POD"" model is supposed to be a superior process. It isn't. Great in theory, terrible in practice. Pass the file on to close with someone that has no clue about the file and now has to catch up. Management all have really big egos and say that want to hear opinions yet in reality they really want ""yes"" men.  Question them and they smile - but it will catch up to you later.  Seriously if you work here, just smile and go with the flow. Big titles like VP for loan officers are meant to give importance. VP's (loan officer) can choose how they get paid but that can be different for each loan officer. This reflects in what interest rate is charged to the consumer.  Higher pay means higher rates.  Want to give low rates? get paid less.  Terrible concept since what rate the consumer gets depends on who you talk to, even within the same office."
1207,,Fighting For My Paycheck,2014-09-08,1.0,Loan Coordinator,I'm forced to add something in pros. The office has AC,Every pay period I'm either fighting for an accurate paycheck that reflects the hours I work or I'm Fighting to get the correct amount of loans on my bonus checks. Feels like the company makes it so hard to get paid you'll drop the issue. Very disappointing
1208,,Great environment,2014-08-29,3.0,Auditor,"The incentives are great. Nurse, great chef, masseuse all on site and mostly paid for through company. Bonuses can be sweet but base pay can suck.",They will promote you to a new position without pay. I was there for 4 years and although my reviews were great I never received a raise. Your income is really based on your bonus.
1209,,Great People,2014-08-27,5.0,Regional Marketing Manager,The coworkers are the main reason I work here. I love the marketing team that I work with. Everyone has a teamwork mentality and helps each other to complete tasks.,"Sometimes, there is not enough staffing to get jobs done as quickly as we would like to. I work on the marketing for over 200 VP's and at times that is overwhelming."
1210,,Good place to  work as the compensation is based on productivity of the individual. If goals are met everyone is happy.,2014-08-23,3.0,Anonymous Employee,Forward thinking and visionary management open to new ideas to increase the bottom line. Personal growth opportunities and incentives provided to employees.,Company is growing but employees are not vested in the growth much since no incentives are provided.
1211,,"INCREDIBLY AWFUL, do not be a loan officer here",2014-08-11,1.0,Vice President of Mortgage Lending,"Very few pros, other than a Good web site.","If you are an experienced loan officer, do not work at guaranteed rate unless you want to make less money with much more aggravation and headache.   The POD model simply does not work unless your team has been working at the company for a number of years.  It is literally impossible to get a file moved from point A to point B without an astonishing amount of difficulty.  Plus, if the file takes too long, due to no fault of your own, they take away your commission!  In addition, you'll be subjected to a constant barrage of angry criticism from senior management.
If you are doing 10 loans a month at your previous job, expect to do a maximum of 2 to 3, at best.  And if you do jumbo loans, forget about it.  The company has absolutely no idea how to do anything except W-2 conforming borrowers based in Chicago.  Plus your 1st 6 months you work with a transition team who have absolutely no idea what to do with you and couldn't care less.  Then you are abruptly switched to your local branch which has even less knowledge.
You will be screaming and cursing and will quit the company within just a year.  Worst mortgage company on the planet."

The corporate headquarters in the home of the owner/CEO, he is very interesting man he dresses like he just got off a Yacht, wait he has a huge Yacht! The owner likes to scream and swear at his posse(Upper Management) when ever he is in town, not off traveling the world. 
Operations people get paid nothing, what they do get paid goes to their health insurance. 
When you go over 40 hours you make $10.00 an hour before taxes. 
Operations jobs are not stable, after the refinance boom ended in 2013 the sole source of income is from originations and most of those originations come from the northern half of the United States so once the cold weather sets in so do the layoffs! They laid off hundreds in January 2014, the company only had about 2,500 employees at the time.
The company only has ONE source of income(mortgages) not a lot of stability or diversification!

1213,,Great work life balance,2014-07-25,5.0,Quality Analyst ( IT/Software),"I have worked for a start up and a fortune 500 company before I worked for Guaranteed Rate and I will say this is the best company thus far for work life balance! Management cares about employees having vacation time and rest time to revitalize for work. Also, I feel very included in everything as far as meetings and planning. Upper management is very involved, dedicated, visible, and accessible, if you have questions ask and they will give you an answer. Overall GR is a great organization to be apart of. Work hard and will people notice!",Benefits are a bit pricey.
1214,,The company is a great place to work for a work/life balance,2014-07-22,4.0,Mortgage Underwriter,"Working from home, technology is the best, Encompass is the best underwriting software I've used in the business as an underwriter, excellent bonuses.","Benefits are expensive. No raises, need to rely on bonuses for decent pay. No training. Need to have a good amount of experience or else you'll struggle to keep up"
1215,,Disappointing,2014-07-17,2.0,Anonymous Employee,"Innovative way to work files, the process is unique to anywhere I've ever worked.  It's called ""POD Flow"".  In theory, it works.  If you work at corporate you get a monthly massage, gym access, on-site medical care and a cafeteria with a chef.  The benefits are average, insurance is expensive everywhere you go.  Their on-boarding is great!  It's really evolved over the years.  They definitely take time to invest in their employees and get them well trained from the beginning.  They do a lot of promoting from within.  The CEO is great, he's honest and direct.  It's such a big company that I think his vision gets lost on the various egos that come and go.","Work-life balance doesn't exist.  Leadership in the processing department is mediocre at best, you never know who your manager is because there are a ton of them.  Leadership in the underwriting department is a bit better, again, there are a lot of managers, but at least you know who is your manager.  Overall your experience varies a lot depending upon your manager, my first manager was amazing, I thought I was in heaven.  He left the company and I had 4 managers after that, 1 was great.  Be wary, although the on-boarding is great, once your in the waters, they don't give you much time to get acclimated.  This can be daunting for someone who is either new, or has been unemployed and getting back to work.  Pay is low for processors.  It's a low base and then a per file bonus, which doesn't exist if you work for a loan officer who only does jumbo's and only closes 1 or 2 loans/month.  It also doesn't exist if your loan officers don't produce."
1216,,Poor Management,2014-07-10,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"Company does nice things for the employees...parties, lunches, etc",Only look at the bottom line and don't understand that looking good on paper does not mean you are a good manager or employee.  Upper management needs to look at what those numbers actually stand for.  Branch managers are bullies and really need to be reevaluated often and kept in check.

You can find a pretty decent parking and commute can be okay since it is right next to the brown line stop.,Pretty much if you don't have enough friends at the company then there is no other people you can meet around the ravenswood area.  It is a pretty desolate place with very little traffic with sometimes the train rambling right next to the building.    Like I said I believe if you are not going into loan sales then you should look elsewhere.  Pretty much every other job pay way below industry average.

I haven't found another company in our industry that offers more or has a better environment. I've been doing this for a long time and make it a point to be in touch with folks in my industry that work elsewhere.

This leads to him making all the classic mistakes of an inept leader, especially micro-managing and leading through fear and intimidation with little to no accountability for his bad behavior.

1271,,Dishonest about lead quality and ability to succeed,2014-02-17,2.0,Service Consultant,My coworkers are a great group of people. It's too bad that employee turnaround is so fast.,"There are a few reasons GR is constantly hiring, and it's mostly due to employee turnaround since people are frequently fired or just quit as soon as they find something better. 
-Earning a decent salary is dependent on your commission, since your base is so low.
-The online division gets people to accept a job here because management insinuates that we have access to all of these amazing leads. In reality, we deal a lot with poor quality leads, old leads, or people who never even wanted a mortgage. A lot of our leads are lost to Quicken since they contact them sooner than we can. 
-It takes about 2 months to get your first loan in process since they don't do intensive training on the programs we use. I spent most of my time figuring it all out myself. All the programs are really glitchy as well. 
-Despite the slow process in getting a hang of things and the poor quality leads, management does expect you to lock 2 loans per week. This is something that I've only seen very experienced LOs able to do right away. This is because they have their own pool of existing business.
-Despite working in a division whose entire pool of business is supposed to come from online inquiries, you will not make a decent monthly wage without having the majority of your business come from your own previous connections. If you are new to the industry, you are being set up for failure. 
-The company is a huge boys club. I think all of the managers and the top LOs are men and the company culture favors that. I've noticed that most women are given support team member roles, while most of the LOs/sales positions are men. If you read the other reviews, you'll find that the support team members make way less than LOs. It's also not easy to switch from support team to sales, so you're pretty much stuck with that lower salary."

1276,,My Perspective,2014-02-03,4.0,Marketing,"We all have different encounters and perspectives this is merely a review of my experiences so take it for what it is, my experience. I’ve been in the mortgage business since 2001 and I’m well aware of the stress that is simply part of the business – along with the ups and downs of loan volume.  I’ve worked in a few different capacities in the industry: processor, loan officer, owned a net-branch before the recession and now in a creative role. 

I began working for GR a little over two years ago. While I can’t say I was totally thrilled about my job it was work that challenged me and put food on the table. My branch manager was awesome and my co-workers were a great group of people. After a little over a year I grew tired of the stress and needed to address my creative side.  No problem! My direct supervisor hooked me up with the Company CMO and I interviewed.

It’s been a little over a year in my new position and I’ve never looked back since. I’ve been given an opportunity of a lifetime and for the first time in my life I actually look forward to working. I’m also working in the corporate office and now have accesses to all the cool perks. 

There are lots of perks offered here like: on-site nurse (RN), masseuse, cafe (with Chef), gym (with all types of classes), roof top deck (yes employees can eat lunch up there), ability to work from home, schedule flexibility (very helpful when my kids are sick) and opportunity for growth. Most of the employees are young so the office has great energy. 

This is not all rah, rah I’ll move on to the con...","My only complaint is the health benefits are crazy expensive. It’s really quite a financial burden but like I said, I love what I do for a living."
1277,,A mess and extremely unprofessional,2014-02-01,1.0,Loan Officer,"Great freedom in workplace, company laptop, LO's don't have to do much besides sell",They have people at the top making decisions when they have no idea what is going on in the trenches. Any change in the market place and you will be looking for a new job.  My whole experience with them was costly and an embarrassment to myself and my book of business. I would save yourself the money and keep looking for a different job.
1278,,An employee review - from an underwriter's perspective,2014-02-01,2.0,Remote Underwriter,"1) Ability to work remote. 

2) Great people to work with. Processing of files is much better than my previous employers. Appears the company will hire experienced processor more so than they would train new ones which is a good thing for underwriters. IT is usually quick to fix things.

3) Management can be good to work with you are fortunate to have a good manager. I have had both good and bad managers (see below).

4) Bonus was very good when there was plenty of work (not so now!)

5) The underwriting system we work on is pretty good. Rarely are there system issue and when there are they are fixed quickly. Much better than some systems I have work with in the past.","1) Insurance is WAY too expensive – if you ever think of joining this company for insurance benefits, BEWARE! Had I known this before I started with the company, I would have not accepted. Luckily the bonus had help pay the higher amounts. I can’t say the same now. LOL.

2) This company will get rid of too soon. Currently I don't see they have confidence in the market approving any time soon. In addition to the number of layoffs they have had in the past year, I have seen a lot of turnover of underwriters since I have been here. One day someone is here, the next day they are gone. Except for the 3 mass layoffs, nothing is usually ever said when an underwriter is terminated or on vacation, and then one day you could be assigned a terminated underwriter’s complete pipeline. For some strange reason, the company doesn’t like divvy-up a person’s pipeline between everyone on the team after an underwriter is terminated. Disregard the company testament that Guaranteed Rate is one of the best places to work. I really am perplexed how the company has ranked so high in these polls. I do know they really encourage employees to participate in these polls and to offer positive ratings. I would want someone to join the company believing these polls are true for everyone’s own experience. So often I have heard someone new joining the company telling me about these polls. After a few months, these same people have told me these polls don’t seem to be true for their experience. 

3) Management can lack knowledge or not care at times. Limited information provided about the operation of this company. This is especially true of you work remotely. Unless you’re lucky to know people who work at home office, you might not find out about some important things. Management also seems to react to things after the fact instead of being proactive in terms of implementing changes."

I have seen my manager cry after meetings with the owner. management is not trained, generally are managing in areas that they have no experience in, and there is no communication from one dept. to the next. No  meetings, just emails. No training, just scolding. You are not promoted for what you know, rather who you know, so no room for advancement.  processors are new to the industry and managed by sales people. the whole concept is ridiculous. endless emails will jam your inbox everyday. Loan officers are royalty and that's just the way it is. If you are not willing to get on board with that, then you will be fired. Loan officers make tons of money and everyone else does not. They constantly send emails announcing the latest article or interview or news piece about the company and reading them, this sounds like a great place to work. Do not be fooled. I am sure any positive reviews on this site were created by management. I don't know anyone who enjoys working here. You will work much more than a 40 hr week and will not be compensated. Many people who work here are very rude, but unless you are a loan officer, you dare not speak up for yourself."

He made it very clear several times in his management meetings that everyone is replaceable. I’ve gone to those every other week. I’ve never seen a CEO talk about employees so disrespectfully the way he did. He’s a micro manager and does not trust anybody, not even his Executives. He picks what lunch will be served every week at corporate. Really? What are you paying your chefs and the Director of Wellness for? The company only cares about Loan Officers. This is very true and the employee benefits are way too expensive. No one can afford them! Speaking of affordability, what CEO in their right mind builds a VERY expensive rooftop and signs on Ty Pennington at a time when the company is not doing as well as it was 6 months ago in regards to profit. In order to make up for the deficit, the company went through 3 rounds of layoffs in the last 6 months. Yes, the latest one was in mid January of 2014. I really wish this company good luck as there are a lot of good people working there. Can’t wait to see what’s next!"

•  If you have a liberal arts degree or just an associate or don't have a college degree then definitely you can be qualified for the processing jobs and make a great career out of it.  This is just an opinion made out of my observation. So GR definitely takes people who are not that educated but work hard I guess, in my opinion.  
•  Few company organized events.","•  There is not a lot of good restaurants to eat lunch at around the corporate headquarters.
•  Most of the work is too repetitive and boring in my opinion but it depends on what kind of job you get.

Their comp plan was in fact better than at my last employer, but the cons with this organization cancelled out this marginally better pay scale.","The cons of this organization definitely outweighed the few pros that this company displayed before being hired, and for the first few months of hire.  There are 2 divisions within the company, I was in the direct division, which was the side of the business that was set up to take and call leads, and for those that were not 100 million dollar producers, or realtor based LO's.   During the pre-hire phase, I was told that i would have the support of management to close deals within 2-3 weeks, underwriting support, and the list goes on and on.  Training went extremely well and within the first 45 days, i was already closing business from my referral channel.  The first problem came in rather quickly.  As leads started to come in, they were regurgitated leads that many of their GR employees had worked time and time again.  They were not the premier, or LendingTree leads, but old leads that came in from advertised rates that were no where to be found in the market, and had been contacted by not only many lenders, but many of the originators at GR.  Another drawback of GR was the fact that my direct manager, who was the person who hired me, started to care less as he started to hire more LO's for his branch.  His time management skills, and attention to detail, were spot on in the beginning, but quickly deteriorated once time progressed and managing more LO's.  When i came on board, there were 5 others that came with me.  Of that, only one experienced LO is left at that branch today.  All have left due to the lack of support and extremely slow turn times with underwriting and processing.  My first few files closed within 3 weeks, but towards the final months of my employment with GR (i stayed a total of 9 months) turn times took 60 days.

Finally, and the reason i'm writing this today, is that GR decided to wait 90 days to pay my final commission check.  Not only did it take them 3 months to pay me, but they also took $4k out of my commission for various charges that I've been told, violate RESPA.  Now they will not respond as to why these charges were incurred, which leads me to retain counsel to get these monies back.  The way this company operates is entirely different than what I was lead to believe.  I am relieved that I have parted ways with GR, and would never refer them to any LO....period."

I've never worked for a company who gave turkeys to you for Thanksgiving and had employee appreciation days (lunch brought in)  I've never felt more appreciated by a company than I do with Guaranteed Rate.  This is a compahy I am proud to say I work for!  I love the ""team"" concept.  Daily pipeline review with my loan officer, so there is NEVER a question on what is going on with a loan.","Insurance is expensive and not that good.  I'm thinking Obama Care might be a better choice (URGH!)  A lot of hands in ""the pot"" when getting a loan to closing.  Rushes are a scary thought unless you are a big producer.  The only reason I would not recommend this employer to a friend is that, although a great company, there have been layoffs and I don't want to recommend a friend to leave a current job and then get laid off here."

1303,,Guaranteed Rate is one of the best sales companies Ive ever worked for,2013-09-19,5.0,Service Consultant,"Training. Most companies dont train their sales employees and expect them to rely on their past experiences. My previous experience was in recruiting; completely unrelated to mortgage sales. Not only did GR set the expectations accurately, they conducted their own home grown training course, in addition to bringing in an outside expert to supplement that training.
Recruiting: Their recruiting staff was one of the quickest and most responsive team I have ever encountered. In addition to being professional and friendly, they really make you feel comfortable and make it known that you were hired for a specific reason, as opposed to being just another resume in a file.
Great technology. They provide you all the tools necessary to succeed, including licensing and testing.
I like the business casual environment. I like the flexibility in work schedule.","Some departments are not as efficient as others. There is some animosity between different departments. 
Steep learning curve. Lots of testing, waiting for licenses to be approved takes a significant amount of time. Dont expect to be taking home 4 grand after the 1st month. This isnt a job, nor a career: this is a lifestyle."

Upper management makes it consistently known that you are replaceable and cannot talk back to loan officers. If a loan officer calls you out of your name, or yells at you about how ""stupid"" you are, you must keep quiet. Otherwise, an HR rep will be at your desk within 30 minutes asking you to grab your things, because you are fired. I've seen this happen to many employees in the time that I've worked there."

I'm only with GR just over 2 months now, but thus far they have delivered on everything they presented themselves to be.  I've closed enough loans so far to see that each employee, from top to bottom and sideways, cares about the best possible experience for the customer.  And the onboarding process as a loan officer and level of support for same has been incredibly positive!  Great marketing with this company!","If there were any downside, it would be that in some areas of their processing for loans, there are challenges - but I would consider these nothing more than growing pains, and the ongoing challenge involved with ensuring all personnel are adequately trained and on the same page.

- If you're in sales, training resources abound.  If you are unlucky enough to be hired as anything besides a LO/SC/VP (or if you get hired as an HR girl), your training resources are a long, loud, unhelpful series of live training webinars that leave you clueless about how to do your job.

-Very high turnover. The job I took sounded great on paper, but dealing with the CEO isn't worth it. Within two months of taking this job, I knew it was a mistake."
1344,,"If you're serious about this industry, this is the place to be",2013-06-17,5.0,Vice President of Mortgage Lending,"The sum of the parts offered at Guaranteed Rate are unmatched in the industry.  Here, you can be a 100% referral-based loan officer, as well as a 100% lead-based loan officer, or anywhere in the middle.  But the challenging part is that you as an individual have to put the plan together, work hard and make it happen.  
The technology, the pricing, the in-house underwriting/processing, and the products you can offer are among the best in the business.","People who aren't resourceful won't be successful here.  If you need to be micromanaged to meet your goals, and you aren't self-motivated, you're better off working at a bank where they're management-heavy and tolerate this sort of thing.  This is a hard job, but for motivated, resourceful people there's no better place to be than Guaranteed Rate."
1345,,Gotta start somewhere,2013-06-15,3.0,Operations Assistant,"Good hours. 
Very little micro managing 
Excellent IT staff
Very accessible management 
Lots of training opportunities
Company is growing quickly","Expensive health benefits 
Very little recognition for performance
Low salary
Poor initial training 
Loan officers get treated like rock stars and everyone else is at their whim."
1346,,You get out what you put in,2013-06-13,4.0,Associate Vice President Mortgage Lending,"Paid training!  Pretty much unheard of in this industry.
I knew nothing about the Mortgage business before I started at Guaranteed Rate and 6 months later I am closing deals like I am a seasoned vet.
There is always a co-worker next to you to ask questions about something you do not know.
The Marketing Department is unreal.  They get on top of any request and as an originator you are able to put your marketing on autopilot! 

From day one dealing with Guaranteed Rate the recruiters were nice and the trainers really seemed like they were invested in your success.  I never felt like I was lied to.  If you never had a sales job before guess what, they are hard.  Nothing will be handed to you here, but if you do what you are supposed to and take advantage of the marketing and technology offered there is no reason you can not succeed here.","Training was a little long.  Probably could have cut it by 3 weeks.
Wish managers were a little more hands on in the begging, but are always willing to help when asked.
Need to hire another manager for the transition pod 1 person is not enough for 30 people."
1347,,Best company I have ever worked for!,2013-06-13,5.0,Manager,Great work environment.  Coworkers and management are supportive and always have the customer's best interest in mind.,The mortgage industry is challenging and there is a learning curve but it's worth it.

State-of-the-art tools to enhance the experience for employees, as well as clients.",It's the mortgage industry... sometimes there just is not a way to make a client happy (but Guaranteed Rate does the best job it can 100% of the time).
1349,,Great Opportunity,2013-06-12,5.0,Loan Officer,"I have been very happy with my choice with Guaranteed Rate. I first want to mention that no job with unlimited earning potential will be easy, and this opportunity is no different. We were told from the very beginning of what to expect, and they have delivered every step of the way. Internet leads by nature are not easy, so I find it interesting when I hear complaints on how bad they are. This is a sales position and I feel it was properly advertised as such. This company gives its employees everything resource and tool to be successful, it’s up to myself and my fellow employees to put in the hard work in order reach our goals. I have no complaints about this position because I know if it doesn’t work out I’m the only one to blame.","I would have to say that clocking in and out is a bit annoying, but it's the policy so what choice do I have."
1350,,GRU Class,2013-06-11,5.0,Loan Officer,"The GRU class gave a comprehensive overview of the mortgage industry, a little bit of it's history, and a background of the mortgage crisis of the mid/late 2000's and the current laws that resulted. IT provided a good knowledge base to provide a high degree of future success as a loan originators.","Needed more shadow training- individual training with current loan officers and more in depth training on the loan process program, but since my class graduated these issues I believe have been address and improved upon"
1351,,"I am a full-time loan officer with Guaranteed Rate, Wilmington NC",2013-06-11,5.0,Vice President of Mortgage Lending,"Outstanding training for new hires, enormous amounts of tools and resources to utilize to increase business, great marketing department, employee morale is fantastic.  A wonderful place to work!","I have not had any issues with the company as a whole nor with my branch.  It is a pleasant place to work.  Guaranteed rate has taken the drama, stress and chaos out of the typical mortgage career."
1352,,Great company to work for,2013-06-10,5.0,Loan Officer,I really enjoy working for GR! There's a great paid training that allows you to learn a lot and be ready when you are out there on the floor! Very supportive and understanding managers!,I haven't experienced a lot of cons but believe the base salary could be a little better for Loan officers!
1353,,"Hard work, but worth it!",2013-06-10,5.0,Vice President of Mortgage Lending,"The two month ""Guaranteed Rate University"" training left me prepared to hit the ground running. GR pays for all licensing, provides personal laptop, business cards, etc. Great company culture. It's competitive, but in a good way. You get out what you put into it. If you are willing to work hard, make your dials, and make a career out of it, being a loan officer at Guaranteed Rate is unbelievably rewarding. There is a reason why a large percentage of the best loan officers in America work for Guaranteed Rate.","The health insurance is a bit expensive, but other than that I have no complaints about Guaranteed Rate whatsoever."

1355,,Great company to work for,2013-06-10,5.0,Online Consultant,"They pay during the training process 
They pay for licensing
Loan officer is able to sell instead of ""babysitting"" file through close. (huge plus if you are a volume originator)
The advertising is great if and when you get a database of clients going.
The marketing info for realtors is fantastic.  Great programs and tools to get realtors attention.","The constant whining about leads.  All licensed originators get leads.  The leads are often ""same day"" and are from the usual sources.  There are leads to be had, under 30 days old, and leads to be had over 30 days.  You take what you need.
Sales & product training could be better.  There are plenty of web resources, but guidance is lacking.  If I was new to the industry, I would be concerned about this.
Could have better health insurance plans to choose from.
This is loan origination.  You have to be willing to put the time in, to get results.  This tends to make it a long workweek, but in the end, if you do the right things the effort will pay off."
1356,,"Positive, challenging and rewarding.",2013-06-10,5.0,Anonymous Employee,Guaranteed Rate is a great company to work for!

1357,,Great place to work...  If you live with your parents.,2013-05-09,1.0,Loan Officer,"* Paid 8-week ""training"" - (Dollar-Menunaire Fund)","-----------  INTERVIEW

* Initial interview was composed of a painfully obvious scripted phone call in which the organizational representative spoke so fast that she was talking AT me.  I tried asking questions throughout the process but was interrupted by the recruiter saying ""hold on, let me finish this part"" 

* The interview began with a short typing assessment.  I met with two managers and wanted to pick at their brain a little bit.  The interview questions were elementary and I felt like I was interviewing for a temporary position at the traveling circus.  

* I need a temporary job, I accepted their offer a few days later.  Awesome, right?

-----------  TRAINING

 * Training began a few weeks later.  Our first day we all introduced ourselves and I found out that our training group was pretty diverse.  I was excited to find out that many new hires like myself had either left or had previously held rather respectable careers and with top employers.  (Maybe I was in a good place!)  

*However, some were not.  In fact, I was surprised to find out that some of the new hires hadn't even spent a day in a college classroom - contradicting the organizations recruiting flyer.

* The training itself was not terrible, however, highly unproductive.  In order to be licensed as a mortgage originator you need to take a certified 20 hour class and pass a 125 question exam.  Can someone please explain to me why Guaranteed Rate thought they needed 300 extra hours to tackle this feat?  Oh well, at least I was getting paid for it...  (Wait, what are my opportunity costs?)

* I successfully passed my exams and am ready to originate!  

-----------  ON-THE-JOB

*  I just found out I'm a telemarketer and not a mortgage banker.

*  It's frustrating when kids out of college have better business acumen and could manage with greater efficiency and effectiveness than those who currently hold that position.
 
*  We're in the business to sell right?  The flyer said ""act on quality real-time leads in the industry.""  This is not the case AT ALL!!  

* Expect to make 100+ calls a day and have 5 people pick up the phone.  Of those 5,

     2 ""borrowers"" will tell you to fly a kite using their best ""pardon my french"" impression.  (Can you                  blame them?  This ""lead"" is 2 and a half years old and has been sold to 10 different mortgage companies weeks before Guaranteed Rate had originally purchased it.)

     2 ""borrowers"" will tell you they had never inquired about a mortgage in their life and many are false names.

     1 ""borrower"" will reluctantly listen to you ramble on about how great of a company Guaranteed Rate is - eventually you can build some rapport and pull their credit.  ""Real-time quality leads"" are not 540 credit scores, hundreds of thousands of dollars underwater, and have 3 adverse liens on their property.  

*  My day is over. Although, you better not work 9:00AM - 5:00PM otherwise the managers will likely give you dirty looks and start micro managing you.

*  Funny they should say something.  Many of them worked 5-6 hour days and provided little leadership/knowledge for those under their management.

*  Why do our active leads get redistributed every other day and frustrate both the consumer and the employee?  Everybody loses.

*   You have to be very wary to suggest ideas for improvements or strategies for greater success.  They like things the way they are and are not willing to accept feedback from someone who their infrastructure was designed for.  

*  Clock in and out (I feel like I'm 16 again.)

*   It takes more than 24 hours to get a simple question answered by a manager who sits 4 desks away from you.  

*  Management isn't cautious when talking negatively behind other employees backs in front of your peers.   (Be careful - most people are looking for jobs already!)"
1358,,Deception. Only if you need income of any kind. Last resort.,2013-05-07,1.0,Assistant Vice President of Mortgage Lending,Easy interview process (I now know why). Laptop and they pay for your licenses. Some coworkers were good people. Good for people who have zero income and need some money.,"Wow where to begin.  Completely lied to in the interview process.  I was told about all these good leads and all the money I would make, but that was completely false.  The leads are years old and have been called so many times.  You are basically a telemarketer and not a loan officer like they say that you will be.  Company politics which means that some of the good leads will get sent to other people.  Everyone is so miserable and frantically looking for jobs because we all realize that this job was not even close to what they said it was.  Went into the job being told that I would be making 70k and quickly realized that I would be making more like 24k.  Sad what is going on there because so many people are going into the company thinking that they are starting a good new career and its going to be a complete disaster for them."
1359,,Being unemployed is more beneficial. Do not ruin yourself,2013-05-06,1.0,Loan Officer,"you get a laptop, paid licensing, relaxed atmosphere... and a stress ball","-licensing tests are difficult
-Training doesn't prepare you for actual daily job activities

Now lets begin... It is your typical ""you can make $37,000 a month"" type business scheme. You must bring a book of business and previous clients to the table or else you will be stuck making $11.53/hr. The leads they purchase are extremely old (some over a year old) and have all been called hundreds of times by current loan officers. Providing you actually get a human being on the phone they are irritated with the amount of times they have been harassed by previous LO's. Managers are extremely careless to your performance and do not provide any help or guidance as they are originating loans at the same desk you are. The company does not even know your name unless you are a top producer. You will be expected to make a minimum of 50 calls a day, but realistically you will have to make 250 to even have a chance at talking to a legit client who wants to talk business.Beware of the questions you challenge your manager on regarding the leads... you may be kicked to the curb very quickly.

All in all, this is a cold call center that the company hires and trains new people in the industry to call all of the old leads that their superstar LO's do not want to call. Also, they take deals away and give them to more experienced LO's, without even a reason why. The company shows extreme favoritism to their experienced LO's and will do everything in their power to give your deals to them and cripple your success.

Biggest mistake you will ever make in your professional career. Do NOT join this company or you will be sorry!"
1360,,waste of time and not worth the stress of licensing,2013-03-26,1.0,Loan Officer,laid back.  you get a laptop! great...,"they do NOT buy good leads. Sometimes they do NOT buy leads at all.

1365,,Loan Officers could do much better elsewhere,2013-01-25,2.0,Online Service Consultant,"Cool environment with the latest technology, freedom to work from home when needed and the ability to work ""like an adult"" instead of constantly having someone look over your shoulder.","Management pretends they care about employees, but only the top performers are taken care of while new employees are often over-looked. If you have trouble producing, don't expect any support from management and termination can come out of the blue with no prior warning or meetings to discuss performance. Work atmosphere is a call center, so expect to sit for 8-10 hours a day calling all day long. It is difficult to build relationships with coworkers since the ""call-center"" model does not allow much interaction with employees, despite sitting about two feet apart from your co-workers. No matter what time you come in to work, you will be judged by the time you leave for the day. Managers also originate loans, so if you have issues prepare to wait several hours or days to get even a simple answer back."
