Promotes Mental wellbeing but doesn't deliver, support options are limited and don't expect support from senior managers you'll get a generic HR response.  

Be prepared to work hard but unwillingly give the credit to your managers. Those who work hard get less and unless you constantly blow your own whistle you won't get recognised. 

Expect to get low performance grade for any authorised absence such as Maternity leave even if you've been a top end performer for as long as you can  remember.  

Performance goals aren't always achievable be prepared to be greeted with cancel culture if you happen challenge them. 

If you decide to work for the company use your time wisely and get all the experience and skills you need to move on as you'll have a short shelf life. 

Don't be fooled by the benefits you get NONE, work perks is the biggest con, you actually get a better discount through the retailer. You don't get any staff discount on any of the products either.  There are better competitors out there."

Pay and Promotions: Promotion within this team is near impossible so do reconsider if you are ambitious or experienced.  Other banks have better risk and control functions and do pay well."

Great Share plan",Senior leadership have their favourites if your not amongst them you will not progress upwards.

It is is only for the performance outward display sake of it. Progression is not based on merit but by how many years you have been at the company. Very old school practices and is not open to the current change. Marketing is appeared to be more progressive as their is more female leaders however they are still lower in the grade banding than their male counter parts and are really an acting middle management. The female senior leaders still enforce the glass ceiling ironically onto the other females that are non British or from other ethnic backgrounds.

1343,,Work Culture & Growth,2022-01-01,2.0,Software Engineer,Brand Value and Good Learning Resources ( although the second point is given by almost all big organisations),"Following are the list of cons as per my experience with scenarios for you to decide:-

1) Poor Work Life Balance- I was working as Software Engineer in a Department of HSBC wherein they followed mostly traditional waterfall project management model to run projects and these are not efficient as compared to other project management techniques like Agile (Scrum, XP) in terms of managing project timelines, scope updation during project and mainly over-utilizing the resources (team members). Hence, it leads to poor work life balance of the team members.

2) Pay not upto expectations- As per my tenure there hikes are pretty low (around 3-4% pa)

3) Biased Management- I was hired as graduate and they hired for two types of profiles (Strikers - 7 LPA and Acers - 16 LPA). The distinction they made in these two profiles was Strikers were meant to give basic support in projects while Acers were meant to give basic support and play lead roles in projects. But in practice, the type of work Strikers and Acers did was pretty much the same (Really no difference in these two profiles apart from pay). Also, in the next appraisal cycle, Acers got pretty good hike (around 20-30%) while Strikers good pretty low (around 2-3%) creating further gap in their pays. Hence, the management is biased and I didn't really understand their basis of this discrimination.

4) Not much to learn in a long run career perspective- The department where I worked used pretty obsolete technologies like AS/400, Mainframes which are still used in 
many banks due to security and other reasons but as an individual you won't get much to learn and grow as compared to the fast growing technologies in software industry. Also, as per my experience, the bank is not much ready to evolve to better technologies so easily. (I don't know why??) But, as an individual you won't evolve here.

5) Bad Work Environment in terms of people (This is just based on my experience) - The team where I worked was not that efficient in having healthy discussions internally or contribute to solve problems (It was mostly copy and paste others work.. ). Also, there was too much individualism (depending on one individual) instead of collective collaboration (team owning the task) for any task. There was no cross collaboration across teams (I don't know maybe because of too much complicated rules/processes to communicate across teams). Lastly, bad office politics like blaming each other, not having healthy discussions, misuse of power among the hierarchy and senior management not helpful to resolve concerns of employees."

- You are thrown into the deep end on day one, and not given much help
- Poor documentation everywhere, you will literally pull your hair out to find information and find out what team can assist you
- Senior management doesn't care about you or your team unless there is an issue that would make them in trouble, only then they will assist
- Things are very very slow-moving
- Hesitant to move to the cloud 
- Since there is not much help from others and team-members on how to do things and gain information, you often feel like breaking down
- No team/company vision passed down, and as a result, morale is very low
- Very lazy and useless people, that are freeloaders. Give them a task or ask, they never do it, or come up with excuses to not do it, and get a free paycheck"

The managers never motivate him and speak like a servant to him. He was not given permission to go visit a doctor.

I didn’t know what I wanted to do straight after graduation, so I went for a retail banking graduate scheme at HSBC UK, I was lucky to get some good rotations and then decided to switch to data 
- Good work life balance - people are nice and chill, very rarely do an entry level grad (at least for teams I worked with) need to work over time, data team can sometimes be busier, but still very chill compare to other companies
- can work on big projects with strategic importance
- can get involved in very hybrid projects in certain teams, good to get data skills, i.e. you could be a full-stack data person, from initial analysis with visualisation to sketching out machine learning solution and productionising it to make real customer impact then monitoring the metrics throughout the product lifecycle/ upgrading through different iterations","- Hard to align incentives of different teams. Teams are very specialised, and one project typically include many internal/ 3rd party vendors, and they all have different priorities. So one project can hardly progress according to its planned timeline
- Broken data pipeline because systems are in migration all the time, which increases dependency on other teams and you return to problems in above point
- Unclear career ladder. My department only has junior and senior level and the gap between these two levels are big and hard to define + project delivery is very slow, there seems no decently quick track to progress to higher position

Very Self-focused environment, rather than building a great team community in the workplace. 

Management team not available for support if you have a problem, they don't come back to you at all and are difficult to get hold of them, even though they tell you to give them positive feedback for their staff survey appraisal, tell you which boxes to tick for the questions that apply to them. 

Sadly not a place where females can thrive, very few opportunities in this decade, even development programmes as female management. 

Not flexible if you want to work part-time in management role as a woman, very rigid, old fashioned.

They are not transparent on salary, hide benefits from you, stop you from talking with other peers and women are not on the same pay as men for same grade. Other employees advertise more honestly and you know what you will be getting as its all on the job posting. 

Didn't look after staff at all over Covid, made lots of job cuts and didn't provide furlough at all, even though the Government made this specifically available for businesses to use and to help their employees, this in itself says a lot about this brand, when other smaller organisations such as NFU did not make any job cuts at all. In the media they ran adverts to say how they are helping over Covid, but behind doors reality is a different story. Not honest in the media that they didn't use Furlough and that they cut jobs. 

I would recommend candidates to invest in a brand which is more up to date with Modern times, as they will struggle to hold onto good staff (this isn't the place for millennials who are ambitious and for women who want to progress), has ethical practices in place in the workplace, transparent and cares about how it treats its staff."

2656,,How Simple Becomes Complicated,2021-07-31,3.0,Manager,"Hand on heart, decent company culture with most of the senior managers truly passionate about diversity and inclusion. The UK retail bank is making great strides to become a financially inclusive brand that cares about the vulnerable in society. 
The company embraces flexible working, should you in a head office role, part-time, condensed hours, job share, flexible start/finish time, sabbatical, and the number of days in office are all open for discussion with your line manager.

From personal experience, there are plenty of line managers that are passionate about your development and really care about your wellbeing. You may call this luck, but remember, recruitment is a two-way thing. Try to learn about the job, team, and department beforehand, and my humble advice is to choose a good team and/or line manager over fancy titles.","How Simple Becomes Complicated is a well known phrase in HSBC. 
The executives have spent years trying to streamline and simplify, but the truth is: multiple layers of governance meetings are taking over everyone's time, and teams' responsibilities still overlay each other. 
With the recent job cuts, most departments are operating under bare skeleton. A lot of fire fighting on the ground every day.

This organisation rewards tenure over talent. Unless you started on a graduate scheme, you may usually find colleagues below your grade who has been with the Bank for 20/30 years earn more than you do. This obviously will discourage young talents to stay with the Bank and look for opportunities elsewhere."

Your direct line manager is amazing & will do everything in their power to support you. Great team dynamics .,"Literally everything else. Above your direct line manager, management don't care about you & let you know this on a daily basis. They make changes that almost never work which causes chaos. If they do respond to feedback, it's so slow & by the time it's implemented, it's out of date. Abuse off of customers is horrendous, from death threats, racial abuse & all sorts of other horrific things. You're expected to just get on with it. Upper management talk about mental health & how much they do, but it's empty words. They try to show how diverse & inclusive they are but its superficial & concerns aren't taken seriously. You're made to feel like it's your fault for interpreting it 'incorrectly'. Staff outside of BTB speak to BTB as if they are dirt beneath their shoes. You'r expected to do ABCDEF but given no support & very little guidance. They will not train you no matter how much you ask, always making up excuses as to why you cannot be trained on more lines. Keeping in mind, that if you are trained on all lines, you can move up a grade level. They have also recently gotten rid of this accreditation meaning you're stuck at the lowest level. Software & procedures are out of date, slow & difficult to use. You are not a bank worker so are expected to work bank holidays. Shifts are badly designed so at times you can be the only person from your management group on the phone. Referrals for customer questions are painful - half the time there is nobody available to answer so you're waiting 5 minutes +. Other half of the time, depending on who answers, you'll have a different solution. The job is mentally & emotionally draining."

HSBC is it's own world with vast career opportunity, you could spend your entire working career in various roles and departments, (and many people do).","Suffers from its size. Central functions v global businesses v regional governance across thousands of people and layered hierarchy results in an incredibly bureaucratic organisation where senior leadership is so far removed from the real issues that they're left managing by spreadsheet, powerpoint and email rather than being able to truly value it's people to focus on outcomes and deliver true value. It's an ingrained culture across most of the organisation that's nobody's fault, but it's an almost impossible problem to solve at that scale without radical change and leadership. It's unlikely to come under any genuine threat from challenger banks anytime soon so there's little impetus to make the necessary changes in any reasonable timeframe."

Great gym and canteen

Not aggressive culture both in terms of people and redundancies","My particular team was one of the worst I had experienced. 

We had a turn over of 100% staff in the team every year. This included contractors and full time staffers. Contractors would come and stay for 6 months and no more. Team manager and manager's manager was particular bad:

1) Boss would watch our tea breaks. When we come back from tea break he would always give us work. If contractor left early he blocks them at the lift and told them to go back to desk. 

2) Boss himself did no work and was on the phone with recruiters the whole time looking for work himself, at the same time trying to make sure we were all glued to our desks. We say him downstairs on the phone and even sitting at a cafe having tea with recruiters during office hours. 

3) Colleague bought a flat. Asked if he could buy some fx fwd at the time to hedge against Brexit. Boss ignored him. Brexit happened. His mortgage was in euros, he was earning pounds. Pounds crashed. 

4) Contractor found a new job. Out of politeness he told boss he was happy to stay for a few weeks to help with transition. Boss had a chat with his boss and next day told him this would be his last day. He didnt have enough money to pay for his downpayment as he was buying a property and needed the last couple of weeks of pay. In the end had to borrow money from one of us. 

Too many stories in my team. Any wonder that our team's turn over was 100% every year?"

The role specifically is pretty good, the jobs monotonous but thats as expected. It's generally a good atmosphere.","The biggest con for me is how the bank handles progression and talent. Theres very few opportunities for progression, especially for those starting out there careers (GCB 8-6). The bank fails to adequately invest in retention and personal development. Theres people in the team with real talent who have worked in the same entry-level role for 5 years+, or at best moved 'sidewards' to different but similar roles.

I'd highly recommend those starting out their careers, people driven to progress and wanting somewhere to develop a career, to look at other companies. 

On three separate occasions I've contacted someone in the talent/recruitment team to ask about a role advertised on the internal careers, just to have my email ignored. These are 'colleagues'... ignoring my emails where I'm simply inquiring about a role... that's how poor the 'talent' team is."

4511,,Excellent career growth opportunities but unclear outlook of company,2021-02-20,5.0,Assistant Auditor,"1. The learning curve is steep and there is a strong mentorship culture among seniors within internal audit.

2. It is possible to participate in audits with global teams and for seniors (usually for senior auditors and higher), there are global career opportunities within HSBC.

3. The management is respectful and the workplace is peaceful.

4. At least for juniors, the work-life balance is decent and the job is not too stressful.

5. The company cares about the health of its workers. During the COVID pandemic, the company has switched to a fully remote model and as of February 2021, there is still no plan for going back to the office.","1. The policies are complicated and some procedures are outright Byzantine, making life difficult. Also, internal tools are hard to use.

2. Outlook and strategic priorities of the company are unclear and upper management does not properly communicate its plans. On the local level, HSBC periodically considers exiting the Turkish market, e.g. in 2020. Globally, growth and profitability have suffered for a long time, resulting in massive restructuring plans and uncertainty. Also, there is a clear disconnect between local and global management.

3. Even though the learning curve is steep, the small size of the local audit team (~20 people) means opportunities for specialization are few. If you want to focus on a specific area, e.g. model risk or finance audits, that might be difficult. However, if you can join the global audit teams or if you prefer being a generalist, that is not an issue."

-I think Noel Quinn is solid, but he has some work cut out for him.","If you work in data and are good avoid HSBC. Leaving my prior job for HSBC was a massive career mistake. 90% of the leadership (GB3+) isn't technical, lacks creativity and has no vision. 

-From getting the official offer, onboarding to day-to-day it was the most disorganized, to the point of being unprofessional, company I've ever worked for or with. 

-After a year I found myself making less money after a massive cut to my bonus - with no explanation, with less control, with fewer resources, and in a less progressive business culture than prior roles. 

-My manager cared more about political land grabs and PR than building legitimate machine learning programs. Their focus is on not making waves, looking like they are building something despite being clueless, and or avoiding owning any decision at all cost. Standing out, even for good things, was a bad thing.

-There is nothing you can get at HSBC that you couldn't another F100 while making more money and being in a more professional environment.

-Everything was undisciplined, reactionary, and disorganized. Basic things like paying vendors , or decisions in general,  are typically 6-12 months overdue months late because of incompetence.

-Do not trust what they say about resources in the interview - there is no real  process. Budgets  are 100% dictated by ""ExCos,"" who hear and repeat buzz terms like ""agile,"" ""transformation"", ""cloud"" or ""AI"" understand none of it and allocate at random. 

- For the ambitious or innovative there are no professional development or mentoring opportunities. There is no reason to stay past 18-24 months. 100% of people with modern skills were miserable and looking to leave within six months shocked by how low the bar is. 

-Most executives are either ex MBB consultants or IM's that have been there or are going to be there 10-20 years. No one in between. I thought most of the IMs were solid - much more so than the consultants who were given leadership roles. It felt like they cared. But if you aren't one of the two, I can't recall upward mobility past GB3.  

-Never saw a person promoted for skill or originality, but executing, often I'll thought out, plans and not questioning the powers at be. Mind HSBC's stock and profits didn't drop 55% and 35% percent over the last two years because of good decision-making. They are in desperate need of creative and sharp thinking."

4627,,Conservative organisation searching for a role in the new digital world,2021-02-12,3.0,Implementation Project Manager,"-	Depending on where you are in the organisation it can be great to be able to move around if you are younger and have the qualifications.
 -	Can pay well if your role is in demand.
-	The painful process Noel Quinn (CEO) has embarked upon to shed 35 k staff is going to shake up the bank and its capabilities which is welcome unless you're living it internally the negative impact is that there is incredible pressure to cover roles which are no longer recruited and people in some areas they doing long hours with no end in sight.
-	Female managers see more chances of promotion than previously but there are still large enclaves of male-dominated non-white sexist pockets in different areas. ( btw I am male )","-	Managers can be particularly arrogant but may have multiple faces.
-	Hard to move roles at some stages of your career, seniors closed about some people if they have formed a negative view.
-	I saw lots of people who are in the older generation 'locked' into their role and unable or unwilling to put their hand up for change as the result could be negative.
-	Some senior managers manage to stay in role for years without developing themselves or being able to be developed.
-	It started to become more autocratic in management style choosing to command and control. This probably depends on which area you work in.
- The chain of command can be so vague that your manager doesn't understand what you do and what your skill set is and hence development can be challenging.
-	Achieving band 3 middle management is an achievement but every 5 years they have a clear-out and more band 3's are removed at every cull.
-	The middle market is dominated by HSBC and it beats other banks hands down, the market is more lucrative generally that S&P 500 which has razor-thin margins, the negative side is that RMs typically handle huge portfolios of 80+ clients and do not get to know their customers and can be worked intensively."

Especially those that have worked there for years as they have the very old school culture and fear of the manager / seniors embedded in them. There’s a culture of empire building which binds a lot of people from doing the right thing. 

Red tape: The bureaucracy is incredible and unnecessary.  Yes it’s a highly regulated industry, however some decisions take too long to be made and not because of regulation, but because certain teams don’t want to spend budget or want to play politics. 

Waste: there are a lot of people in management roles, especially at grade 3 who do nothing and bring no value. Often times these are the ones that let it down for the rest, cause bottle necks and badly manage people.

5637,,"Honest, fair and true of my experience",2020-11-21,1.0,Mortgage Associate,- Pension and benefits are good,"The Swansea ‘contact-centre’ is one of the most unwelcoming and toxic work environments I’ve ever experienced. 

From the get-go you are treated as just a number by management and ‘colleagues’ around you. 9 other people started the same time as myself and within the first three months 6 had resigned largely due to job dissatisfaction. The training group I joined were all herded on the telephones as quickly as possibly with abject and minimal training (3 days out of the 20 days training was spent covering a topic which is not relevant to the role). 

The training provided was by a third-party company and not HSBC, therefore, information that was being provided in training was out-of-date and not in line with current policy and procedure.

Myself and others had first-hand experiences of harassment and bullying from selective colleagues and managers. One particular incident I remember is a ‘senior’ manager trying to make an example of me in front of the office floor of 15/20 people. I cannot give the specific example because it will probably identify who I am , and I’m confident the managers will have a good-laugh about how they tried to belittle me . This example is just one of many within the Swansea ‘call-centre’ of management being pedantic about trivial issues instead of managing staff properly and providing a high level of customer service. 

After this particular incident I lost all respect for management within the ‘call-centre’ and immediately started looking for alternative employment. 

Conflicting information from employee to employee! Because the organisation is so large, it’s hard to have consistent messages communicated. I found that i’d come in one morning and one senior is telling you one thing and another manager another, which in a customer service role can lead to very irate and annoyed customers if you’re not providing accurate information.

Finally, I found the job to be repetitive and soul- destroying as you deal with 40/50 calls a day, the large majority of these customers are already irate before you speak to them because they’ve been waiting in a queue for 40-50 minutes (on a good day). 

This job could be for some people but not for myself, the ‘call-centre’ environment has a low ‘ceiling’ when it comes to progression and pay, the mortgage department was littered with employees who had been in the job for 10-15 years and were still earning £17,500, for people with ambition I would say the ‘call-centre’ is not for you."

6140,,Commercial Banking Graduate Programme,2020-09-23,2.0,CMB Graduate Trainee,"Strong company culture, good work-life balance (dependent on team), friendly and inclusive culture, above average pay for a graduate scheme","I would like to add to the review left on 29 June 2020 for the Commercial Banking (CMB) Graduate Programme to reflect that the sentiment described was definitely not an isolated case - a lot of graduates had similar experiences.

Removing subjective judgments the CMB Graduate Scheme has been plagued by numerous problems - I would address two in this review. First, mismanagement. Across different cohorts graduates have been told at the very last minute of “sudden business changes” which required re-assignments from value-adding placements to basic call centre roles, and in at least two instances even a mandatory extension of at least six months to the 18-months programme graduates signed on to. What graduates signed on to was an 18-month national mobility situation, not what inevitability transpired as described. It was widely felt that there was complete disregard for any personal circumstances, where everyone was expected to accept this out-of-contract, unforeseen arrangement without protest (for any protest received admonishments for graduates being “ungrateful” and “entitled” and “having bad attitudes”), uproot themselves and resolve any logistical or financial issues at last-minute notice, with minimum to no support. 

Second, under-qualified graduate managers. While the above described could be explained as top-down instructions outside of the graduate team’s control being poorly executed by the graduate managers, the managers’ lack of CMB knowledge and lack of initiative to remedy that after years of being in the role was inexcusable. This was particularly problematic was because graduate placements were allocated by graduate managers, who screened placement applications. Graduates were told to write their applications in laymen terms, because if graduates included “technical banking terms”, the graduate managers would not be able to understand the application and would disregard those parts as irrelevant. This greatly affected the chances of graduates being placed in teams that best fit their skills and desired career paths. 

Numerous other issues could be raised with ample examples which would result in this review being unreadably long. I hope, however, that the detailed examples given in this review could give some context as to how the CMB graduate scheme was run. 

I could confirm here, however, that as stated in the 29 June 2020 review, favouritism and preferential treatments were existent, and that the high dropout rate of graduates particularly in the past year, as well as graduates taking time off due to the graduate programme compromising graduates’ mental health were true."

- Misleading job offers, they can change your team or your work or your shift after you join. They can change your position after you join. This is cheating as we join a company after careful consideration of other alternatives. They will use every loophole in the game to do that. Position and team can be inconsistent in your payslip just so that they don't have to give you salary correction.

6663,,"Some careers open more doors than others, but HSBC is about to end your whole career.",2020-07-12,1.0,Anti Money Laundering Investigator,4000 HKD medical benefits included.,"Very poor management inside the company.
Case: 
Restructuring every half a year, resulting in a very high turnover rate within the team.
The company infamously fired up to several hundred contract staff in a single day when HSBC escaped from the Money Laundering punishment.
Politics are everywhere within the office. 
Some teams would make your job way harder and would not cooperate at all, just because they hate the big boss on your team. 
This was particular true for me with a very hot-headed team head.

Seniors did not respect juniors and did not admit to their own wrong doings.
Case: 
Taught some investigation skills on Day 1 and pointed out the exact methods were wrong on Day 2. 
The manager also verbally abused me on my age and my working experience. They did so because HSBC officially cannot fire an employee unless they make a serious misbehavior or mistake, so they were trying to set me up.

Very poor HR.
Case: 
HR did not confirm my new position after I arrived the office for 2 months. 
I also waited for 1 month for my laptop delivery to literally start working. 
The HR eventually got fired.
Another HR even lured me into joining the exact same team again after I left HSBC, meaning they didn't even look at my previous files.

Discrimination inside the office exists.
A lot of teams consist of a full team of female employees, while other teams will try to have a male team head and several female managers on his command.
This left very little room for male starters to climb up the cooperate ladder.
Hard work came second and attraction came first.
Case: 
One time the female COO came by the team with a box of fruit cakes. 
She passed to one of my female colleagues and told her ""Share among yourselves, but only for girls."" 
I was so shocked that it happened in a company like HSBC which were told to have such noble values."

You cannot talk to them about a concern without worrying you’re jeopardising your career, they treat you like children and show zero respect to you. They have clear favourites and, if you’re not one of them, good luck getting a recommendation or decent rating from them. Would never recommended this graduate programme PURELY because of those who manage it. Which is a shame, because the leaders in the rest of the bank are pretty great.

The environment for new joiners is not great at all. The culture in HSBC is so thick it can cause newbies a feeling of alienation. 
You can work from home but with the strain of back to back meetings (there is a strong meeting culture which in my opinion is unproductive) it’s better to stay in the office.
Management is awful, juniors are promoted too early which shows through the calibre of the Individuals within the teams.
Highly competitive to detriment. Too many people scared  to loose their jobs and to be shown up so there is a culture of throwing  people under the bus, lying and blaming. I would say the worst is the management."

Many women in senior and management roles","Some colleagues are homophobic and one of them in my branch kept making vulgar sexual jokes
Diversity sections in the employee training sessions were skipped right over, probably because they think it's not important.
HR did a really bad job of dealing with my complaint. All they said to me is that the issue has been handled and due to privacy reasons, they can't tell me anything else. No apology, no empathy, no general gist of what they did or how the investigation went, or if they accepted my accusations, no feedback on my suggestions, no nothing. The ones handling my case were completely clueless about homophobia.
Bank tellers (not a sales role) were imposed sales quotas
Employees are highly expected to attend company events in their private time to ""network"" and ""increase chances that you will be promoted in the future.""

Managers are trained to be slave masters as working there i heard “crack the whip” being used plenty of times. If you are unsure what to do managers will look down on you instead of help you. They never knew what was going on themselves. Managers will never listen to you especially in one to ones where its all about how im helping the managers look good. My time in branch muswell hill was run by a man who liked seeing His staff fail. He was pathetic. My manager at private bank and premier came across discriminating and like to try bully staff. My time at remediation dawson house was the worst with my manager not knowing what she was doing and was a Narcissist. There is a poor moral all over the company where people just care about themselves especially gcb4s and above. Im so glad to have left and found working for a smaller company was much better as we all support each-other and managers make quick changes when something is not working.

7075,,Worst Hiring Process,2020-03-19,1.0,Test Analyst,Not Applicable .The cons sections is self explanatory,"************This Company has never been my employer*********

Interview process lacks clarity since they hire u after multiple quality analysis or technical rounds.Then discuss with u as if it's an HR round where salary expectations and notice period gets discussed on.Then they say that they will inform you soon.The soon never comes.You are kept in dark for the results.On multiple follow ups they say that you are hired and can put papers if needed as we have blocked the requirement and you are selected anyway.Please don't put papers after this ,cos, they surprise u by calling one fine day saying that expected CTC and notice period is an issue suddenly.
Bonus points:
-Interviews scheduled on weekdays
-5 rounds of interview in one shot
-Technical panel won't be present inspite of having F2F scheduled by them resulting in multiple invites for F2F.
-Whilst you follow up after clearing all rounds of interview regarding updates, you'll be told that some sort of approvals are pending because they are planning to pay you high.
On the whole, even if u get in , better to not keep any hopes on this.

Thus the ""Pros"" section has got ""Not Applicable"" mentioned in my review."

6. You never know when you will be laid off because the US operation is actually losing money and not bringing the company profits. They’ve shut down quiet few locations. 
7. They promise you $8k-12k in bonuses. Don’t fall for that it’s not true

Maybe that's it,"HSBC has been on a significant cost-cutting program for nearly 6 years now. It's the same old year after year cutting FTE around 150 per year and bring people back the following year because they cut too many people.

I was with HSBC for 15 years and finally left because the environment is absolutely disgusting.

Because of nonstop layoffs in the Vancouver office - everyone is throwing each other under the bus to try and save themselves. On top of that, the situation has become so dire that Management has started communicating to all managers that they need to artificially lower staff ratings to poor performers because they do not have any budget to continue laying off staff. This now creates a false image of staff being poor performers so they can be let go with just cause. This needs to be clearly communicated to all staff to ensure appropriate legal action is taken.

This year specifically management was pushing ""Project Oak"" which essentially made all staff hunt down individuals to cut. It's become a circus and almost sad as all management is throwing each other under the bus to try and save themselves.

I know of 5 individuals who have launched lawsuits directly with HSBC Bank Canada - and they have now produced lie after lie to try and hide their behavior.

My suggestion is for everyone to stay clear of this mess."

They don't take your complaints seriously until you resign after which they make big promises which are LIES, to keep me there at a critical time.
They might lie to you in their interviews, ensure to take down the benefits promised in writing especially if you are a fresher.
They treat Indians like a bunch of chumps, for example scheduling calls after 6pm in India or at night to suit their timings in UK.

There are so many channels for putting the Open positions - through LinkedIn, Naukri, IIImJObs as well as Agencies, that even recruiters can't manage properly. From the companies side, it is always hard to find the right candidate, all thanks to recruitment team and process, and even if a candidate is found, the onboarding Process takes ages! In many cases, the candidate either gets another offer or ends up following with the recruiters for initiating the onboarding himself!

- Interesting work - you have a lot of opportunity to work independently to produce good work. The surveillance side of work is both interesting from a financial crime perspective and interesting to see the affairs some colleagues conduct on work communications.

- Global opportunities to take your career all over the world.

- Great culture that successfully delivers results and finishes things, without sacrificing humanity.

- Good management - very unpretentious; forward thinking and gets things done, meetings are not just talking shops. Good work is recognised, they are good at recognising good analysis over good presentation.

- Very flexible in accommodating employees' work patterns, John Flint's personal 'Healthiest Human System' campaign. 

- Fairly effective audit ensuring that outcomes are monitored and tested.","- Terrible IT systems, I've never seen anything as bad in anywhere else I've worked. There is no effective shared document platform which results in a fog of email chains and contributes my second point...

- Beyond siloed - departments often seem to be at war with each other.

- The organisation is so large and the systems (IT and org structure) so bad that there is not effective communication so experiences and approaches vary wildy.  One office will interpret a governance document completely differently from another and they will be so siloed that this will go on for years. Messages are not communicated effectively and the rumour mill is often weeks ahead of official announcements.

- Control of information is ineffective. Information barriers too often depend on your seniority rather than a genuine 'need to know'. This is either the cause of- or symptom of being so siloed.

- Poor pay relative to its competitors, benefits are standard for industry.

- Favoritism and deliberately opaque on pay and promotions. 

- Product, regulatory and analytical know-how is surprisingly poor, again below the standard at other organisations."

People who have worked on outdated technologies continue to serve as Leads and seniors even on newer technologies. This doesnt make sense as they have no expertise on the new technology, yet they lead such projects purely on the basis of the 10 to 15 years they have spent in HSBC.

Most of the senior technical people here are ones who have spent more close to or more than 10 years here. And they are woefully unaware of how the technical world outside HSBC has evolved in the past couple of years.

Promotion of buddies without credentials or peer respect. 
Layoffs of quality employees.
Overworked employees who are left after layoffs.
Senior executives constantly spewing spin and carefully crafted ""truth"".
Illegal activity leading to compliance requirements and penalties for which employees who had nothing to do with it are made to take training and adjust their behaviors while no mention is made of oversight of or penalties to those who were actually guilty.
No training provided for technical staff, no respect whatsoever for technical staff and their need to keep skills current or value them as a resource.  No symposia, conferences, expos etc attendance provided - except for the fat cats who don't use it anyway.
Adherence to the philosophy that paying a foreign employee less money for less time is cheaper than paying a USA employee a little more (and retaining them beyond a 3-year visa) who will do the same job in 1/3 of the time and retain a valuable knowledge base and skills that can be leveraged into future projects.

- Sales/Referral goals most of the time seem unobtainable.

- If you don't make your quarterly goals, you feel that you're job is at stake, & that goes for both part-time & full-time employees.

- They recently got rid of tellers having the opportunity to become full-time or head tellers. In order for you to move up anywhere, they tell you that you MUST become a personal banker in order for you to move to any position, ""there's no other way""

-You will do MORE than what is required of you & your role, again, without recognition.

- No promotion's (unless you bring it up yourself)."

8360,,Oh dear.....what a car crash company,2019-06-28,1.0,HSBC,"Prestigious name (just about) - HSBC still remains one of the world's biggest and oldest financial institutions.

Pension - One of the strongest in the financial services sector.  'Lifer's in Back Office accrue huge pensions!

Salary - HSBC pays above market rate for the level of work performed.   A lot of roles in Head Office include back office processing by individuals on high salaries (and costly pension programs).","Chaotic - HSBC is still incredibly disjointed, with basic systems not working, PC's crashing and not even having functioning lifts and building passes (this was none other than Head Office!)

Culture - HSBC is still in the dark ages with how it operates.  There is a clear divide between Junior Management (G4) and those beneath within departments.  There are clear themes of nepotism which breeds only a shielded culture and no openness or willingness to admit fault.  

Competencies - Unfortunately, a lot of staff are not equipped to work within the sector.  Hires are usually based upon whom managers personally like as opposed to just capability based therefore staff are generally within their 40's as an average and not exactly dynamic & challenging.  This unfortunately maintains the same poor standard and people do not think, they just do.

Progression - forget about it.  Speak to any former employee and they will repeat that there is a glass ceiling; Junior/Middle Management look after their own and that's it therefore sadly progression just does not happen.  Performance reviews are designed to talk you down for fear of creating more work in having to recruit new people therefore it's no surprise to see back office analysts at the age of 39!"

Most first year analysts from outside hires get 70k, again below market. 

Bonuses in 2018 were 6% after HUGE cuts for no reason, despite the bank doing $20 billion in profits. Most banks on street pay more for back/middle office support in both fixed and variable compensation.

2) Strong leadership in their Retail (RBWM) Network.
3) Little chance of being made redundant.
4) A wide choice of charity and fund raising events to join.
5) Good benefits.
6) Wide network for job opportunities.
7) Good training programs.","1) Low salaries and bonuses - Most jobs within HSBC offer just over 50% of what competitors offer.  The only few individuals you hear of having any decent salary (albeit still underpaid) are the external recruits.  Low salaries also regrettably prevent most employees from taking full benefit of the benefit schemes on offer. Bonuses are increasingly being stripped down to nothing even for those who perform well at their jobs. 
2) Culture of micromanagement - I could go on about this for hours but I have even seen first hand management follow employees to the toilet and stand by the sinks waiting for them to finish only to walk them back to their desk.
3) A culture of covering up issues - This by no means reflects the entirety of HSBC.  I have friends who are very happy in the departments they work in however there is increasingly a culture of mid and senior management covering issues up, including but not limited to, thieving (i.e. employees being caught stealing money from colleagues), discrimination (i.e. racial and sexual), sexual harassment (i.e. mid management groping intimate parts of junior colleagues without their permission), workplace misconduct (i.e. mid management coming in to work virtually every day stinking of alcohol, shooting off for a boozy lunch and never returning).  Reporting these issues to HR very rarely led to any action being taken. 
4) Overall poor working environment - You are contracted 09:00-17:00 in most jobs with a 1 hour lunch break.  With that said, in most jobs you are expected at your desk before at least 08:45 with your computer started up, if you are seen packing up even as early as 17:05 you are judged for it and there is no paid overtime."

You can tailor what kind of benefits you want but doing so means a certain percentage cut from your salary in order to have them. 

Laid back job because branches are not busy 

Management are nice as people.","Pushed to upsell so much in the London branch I work at. Management will literally tell you go to people at the cash machines and talk to them about credit cards. 

Management are actually down to earth people but get on your case not because they want to but because they have to. 

The systems HSBC use are so outdated it looks like windows 1998. They take forever to load and are constantly crashing it’s embarrassing in front of customers. 

Low salary compared to the same job elsewhere in other banks. 

You’ll be sorting out more compliance issues then actually opening accounts. 

It’s a very boring job you’ll find yourself standing around most of the time or fixing issues around your account openings. 

Progression is slow and if you rent out/ live out it’s hard to get by especially in London

Bad tactics used to sell things people don’t need such as credit cards and loans.

Most of the work is third grade, that they want to hide behind domain knowledge. You will be just doing production support in most projects..

Also before joining I heard of their hire and fire policy, well it has been one month here and I can say it is very much true.. each year they are short of budget, each year their policies change, sometime they want contractors , sometime they want permanent..If a projects does not have budget, they will just fire you, they won't even consider moving you to another department, even when there is opening out there..HR is almost non existant here.. Technology is very outdated, at the time of recruiting, they tell about clouds, mongoDbs, block chain, etc but all these are just there marketing strategies..I have also heard they have this habit of removing the whole team for cost cutting, like in my project there is no testing team, same thing they plan to do with L1 support team, they want these tasks to be handled by dev teams, so that they can get away with support teams as well and reduce cost..

Moreover employees are almost treated as cattle, literally resources, there are no benefits apart from your salary.

When starting there is a lot of team-building and training and throughout the time spent there was consistent training and up-skilling. Therefore, there was quite a lot of support and you are provided everything that you need to do your role. A lot of the skills I learnt in this job I have continued to implement in my role today. If you work hard and take on board all of the training and feedback you can get a lot out of the role in terms of personal growth. I worked within the Contact Centre so there was a lot of people in the office all working together. There were some people who were absolutely wonderful to work with.","Due to the amount of people who work there it can be quite hard to be recognised. If you do work hard and get on with your work a lot of the time you can be overshadowed by the companies favourites. Career progression is very slow and when a role does come available there are a lot of people competing for one job. This means unfortunately people who have been there for a long time aren’t in the positions they deserve to be in. Again the favourites do usually step into these roles. Therefore, although there are a lot of people within the workplace it can seem quite small due to the way it’s managed and structure is set up. This is not to say all of the managers are like this, there are some who are fantastic, its unfortunate that others can let the structure down."

The 5% of minorities that are hired are not supported , tend to get bullied and this has led to a culture of aggressive, ruthless behaviour from the handful of people from minority groups, that have made it into senior positions.

- very aggressive culture. If you are Asian , Black or Latino there is little chance of succeeding . There is a strong culture of racism particularly in global finance change . 

- white managers do not  support the minorities, despite them bring less than 5% of the department. They don’t enjoy coaching or encouraging staff from minority groups and don’t have any concept of the challenges those minorities face when it comes to voicing ideas, trying to get a plan in place to deliver on a project.  It is only possible to get any momentum from the wider teams when a white person is leading. 
- I have seen that many of the white management  did not go to university, but worked into senior positions after several years at the bank. They have serious issues with diversity and don’t even tend to speak to people from minority groups. They aren’t the most sophisticated or cultured. Leadership in the modern sense , is non existent.

9907,,"Bullying, Sexist, Covering-up behaviour and culture",2018-07-07,1.0,PPI Complaint Handler,The pension contribution is higher than average.,"I worked in PPI Complaints, Edinburgh. The behaviour and culture of the vast majority of the department staff was absolutely disgraceful and lacking in all integrity.

There was rampant bullying from a big group of complaints handlers who had worked for HSBC a long time and had moved into this department, 'to get the redundancy when PPI finishes.' These people singled out a few of the complaints handlers who they had arrogantly decided were 'weak.' They constantly loudly shouted out degrading insults and stereotypes on the office floor based on the appearance and personality of the victim, which created a very hostile work environment. If a complaint handler was quiet, the bullies would shout out that he had nothing to offer and was a drag on the place. If a complaint handler was slim/sporty in appearance, these people would shout that he was a horrible competitive person who is trying to be better than us. If a complaint handler was English like myself, these bullies constantly shouted out that he was coming in and doesn't know our how things work around here, even after I had been there a long time.

The worst thing that was shouted out on the office floor were the sexist comments. A group would target complaint handlers who they found attractive and shout out comments - often very positive - about their body/attractiveness. However, these comments were mixed with insults about that person's personality and even their appearance at the same time. So they thought they could have everything their own way with the person which is totally sexist. It's worth noting that men were just as often the target of this sexism as  women.

The majority of the managers were shockingly self-centred and self-serving in their behaviour. They, like the majority of the complaint handlers, lied and pretended that they did not know what was going on every day, whenever an incident of bullying was reported. This was part and parcel of the back-covering and lying culture of the company whereby people denied all knowledge of anything bad that happened, just in case it might put them out  in any way. The manager who the incident was reported to would make it clear that they thought they were too important and had too little time to do any people-management, despite the fact this was part of their description."

9937,,Don't waste your time,2018-06-28,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"Work life balance
Nice people - I made relationships here that I will keep after my time at HSBC
Decent pay","Unable to accelerate growth locally due to being dependent on both HK and UK to give their permission to move forward. To set the context, HSBC has the majority market share in both HK and UK,  but remains a challenger brand in Australia - the company does not give the local market the freedom to innovate at the pace that they are capable of.

Political culture - Management are unable to reconcile their differences and are too scared to step on each other's toes leading to a general stalemate with employees being unable to move their initiatives forward.

Disabling culture - most companies do everything in their power to enable their workforce. This company is the first that I have witnessed where managers from different teams actively block employees from trying to do whats best for the business.

Alpha mentality, leading to meetings with people talking over each other to get their point heard. While this isn't necessarily a negative con if things get done, I found that the conversations were generally deflecting or pushing back on almost all requests for assistance, without any tangible alternatives or solutions being brought to the table - meetings can go on for an hour, only to lead to no outcome or no actions.

Too many disengaged employees due to their lack of control to execute and deliver.

Decisions to hire people not made on merit. People are within technical roles that do not have a technical background, and people are in managerial roles without the ability to manage people/programs of work. There definitely seems to be a certain element of favoritism in the organisation.

Catfishing - multiple employees felt that they were lied to regarding role and remit. Instead of utilising these employees to the best of their ability, and developing and nurturing their skills or passions, they were forced to become glorified project managers."

It really difficult to put all the cons here  coz thats only what is there in the software development/IT division.
1)Huge disconnect between business and IT , business treats developers as slaves .
2)Filled with incompetent and helicopter Managers (these are people who hover above your head all time asking for updates and see what you are doing ie when you are coming in , what time you are going , how many breaks you are taking etc,
who have been with organisation for many years and don't know anything else other than   micromanaging.
3) Too much of open nepotism  and its openly celebrated.E.g if  someone who has a big mouth and a boot licker will easily get into good books of the Management or business .So if someone in the above  category gives an update in stand up days after days I don't know what i did yesterday , today i am not sure what  I am supposed to do it perfectly acceptable and no one questions but if you don't fall into that category where you would be ask to update what you did on a hour by hour basis, it happened to one of my friends there not with me."

Assessors for work highly subjective, 1 assessor will have a different viewpoint to another, meaning you can fail your monthly targets due to subjectivity and it is a hard battle to get their decision over turned even if you have a strong case.

10639,,AML Compliance,2017-12-20,1.0,AML Compliance Officer,"Having gone through some pain (DPA, fines, etc.) AML compliance resources are better than many similar banks.","The AML Compliance at HSBC space grew very rapidly circa early 2010s, meaning that, in some cases,  existing employees with extremely limited skill sets were promoted (in some cases several times)  into management positions out of necessity.  As I witness first-hand, the single goal of these chronically under qualified employees then became keeping up the charade that they had the requisite skill set to handle these management roles.  The charade often included over reliance on more capable, more junior management and staff as well as throwing other staff ""under the bus"" in order to save their skin.  Suffice to say it created a toxic environment where I had zero trust or confidence in many in management."

10652,,Run Like a Government Agency,2017-12-17,2.0,Compliance,Pay; Paid Time Off; Holidays,"I worked in Compliance in the US; my comments are related to that Dept. This is a big organization and that comes with it's own issues, but I have worked at a number of big banks that did not have these problems and to the degree HSBC Compliance (in the US) does. 

Here are some quick hits: 
• ""Tone at the top"" is lacking coherent strategy, planning and execution. This causes (1) management to run from one fire to the next; and (2) everyone to confuse activity for achievement
• Compliance is fundamentally unaware or out of touch with the line of businesses they support.  
• Technology/Data Integrity is poor. There is no attention to detail, no questioning of data integrity, causing people to accept what is put in front of them. 
 
As a result, work product is relatively poor and key deadlines are missed. In order to fix it, management hires more people to do the same tasks (thus no real value is being added) - much like govt agencies often do. Consequently, they rely HEAVILY on contractors and junior level personnel to complete all tasks. As you can imagine, this causes contractors and jr. level people to quit more often."
10653,,Limited growth,2017-12-14,1.0,,"1. Flexible with lunch hours

2. They're quick to blame you for mistakes, but rarely express gratitude when you succeed
3. No recognition for hardwork but rather how you bootlick your boss (Common scene: buying coffee and tea for boss everyday)
4. No intention to retain good workers but insist on keeping workers just because they have been with the bank for long. 
5. Interviewing process not consistent throughout the bank. 
6. HR leaves everything to business/ line manager to handle hiring process/ complaints. No involvement from HR when there is a need. Not sure what have they been doing. 
7. A lot of unnecessary roles with overlapping responsibilities."

The environment in audit (outside FCC) is very good and is the environment within HSBC in general.","FCC Audit has a very high attrition rate. This is mainly down to the management of the team. The environment is toxic and your voice is not heard, so most people speak with their feet. Unfortunately no one will point out the real reason for leaving (not wanting to burn bridges) so there are no lessons learned."
10658,,Large organisation with a very flat management structure.  Hard to get promoted,2017-12-14,3.0,Infrastructure Architect,"The people!  It is a very diverse, multicultural and multinational environment.  You do most of your interaction via video and audio conferences (at least in IT) and you often have no idea which city some of the people on calls are in - could be India, US, Switzerland, China, you name it.  

You need to grow your network and get your name known for good positive work.  This will help you get good feedback and increase your performance review. 

People listen to anyone with good, strong and sound ideas.  Given the size of the organisation, not a lot of emphasis is placed on seniority, and you can quite happily engage with people several bands above and below you.  Just learn to treat everyone with dignity and respect, be brilliant at what you do, and you can make a name for yourself!","You are not likely to get promoted unless you are very junior.  The career bands are very protected and you have to be exceptional to get moved from GCB5 to 4, and a god to move from a GCB4 - 3!

Bonuses and pay remuneration of late have been quite suppressed, especially if you are a 40% tax payer already.  I had no pay rise for 3 years running with a ""strong"" rating.   If you are an average employee (70% of the population), you will get a ""strong"" rating.  ""Strong"" is just average - thats it.  No matter how clever you are or how hard you work, it is very hard to get recognised as ""top"", unless you are well connected and spend more time influencing than working.  I have found this quite unfair, as the people recognised are generally the loudest rather than the best.

With interest rates already going up a quarter point and set to rise again, the remuneration and bonus situation could change."

Pay is OK.  It's not competitive but it's not the worst
Great colleagues
I can't think of anything else.","Hours and responsibilities have increased greatly for retail banking and wealth management division without any increase in pay or even a thank you.

The core problem with the bank is that they are behind in times in terms of technology and strategy.
Another problem is that the firm is extremely top heavy.  We have so many managers on top of managers that layers are 10 fold than what it used to be.

We were in a meeting and our head was saying our revenue is pale in comparison to our spending.  So what do they do? Cut tellers who are making 14-15 dollars/hour.  All I've thought about was why not trim the fat up top and create more transparency and save 100s of thousands of dollars? That's because layers are safer for the guys on top to protect their position.

From my understanding the heads run the bank by a spreadsheet.  It's similar to Marxist theory.  Works on paper but doesn't work in real life.  

The branches are thirsty for resources and now the hours have increased.  So now we have increased hours with less resources, which leads to poor customer service.

New tech has led to even longer hours because there's no alpha or beta testing and they just roll it out.  

I really hope the top management gets their heads together and think things through before making any big changes like this."

That's it!,"Where do I start, the company is using software from the 1980s based on DOS, you have over 4 passwords to sign in 4 different systems to do your job. Then you have to use a CRM software that is just an excuse to take time away from your work. Since you are REQUIRED to input your activities in order to demonstrate that you are ""working"" your book. This is a joke because it's used to justify your quarterly payout regardless of you exceeding your goals! Then you have Management that is so out of touch and also very much have no idea what things you need to complete and do your job. It's a disgrace that a company of this size, at least in the NY area, treats its employees like ""disposable"" rags with no regard to your career or how to improve your job. And NO, this is NOT from a disgruntled employee, this are facts of daily life in RBWM at HSBC. As an employee of HSBC you ARE NOT GIVEN the tools to do your job. All of the forms have to be completed by hand which increases the likelihood of you making a mistake which then increases your job insecurity. Management has no regards, nor do they care, on making sure that you decrease mistakes as these issues are not resolved.  Management has no liability and you as an employee have ALL the liability and risk of risking your reputation. My advise is stay AWAY from HSBC, it's not worth it."

11412,,It can be good or it can be bad,2017-06-06,2.0,Customer Manager,"- Very flexible working arrangements. You can work from home whenever you want. Some people basically work from home all the time and only pop in to the office once or maybe twice per week. Other people go to a branch and work from there instead of making the trek in to downtown. Essentially HSBC doesn't care where you work so long as you work. It's an interesting perspective.

- Good use of technology. Related to above, use of tech in HSBC is high. Laptops all come with soft phones that actually work as well as video conferencing. In the downtown offices, video conferencing is normal and pretty much everyone knows or figures out very quickly how to work the tech on laptops and in the various meeting rooms. The state of tech in meeting rooms is taken pretty seriously and if something is broken, it gets fixed very quickly.

- Opportunities for international placement are incredible. HSBC is perhaps, the most international of the global financial companies. They really do operate basically everywhere. Moving from one geography to another is actively encouraged if that's what you want. When you do move, there's a well-oiled machine to take care of you. Movers will come and move your stuff; they actually pack and unpack everything. A tax expert will take care of your income taxes for a couple of years to ensure that everything transitions properly. A very informative website will help you figure out how to rent a new place at your destination, how to hire household help if applicable, how to find a good school for the kids, what you need to know about getting a driver's licence, where the good restaurants and grocery stores are ...

- Related to above, working with international colleagues is baked in to the company DNA. You're never in a national silo; it's very normal to work with people around the world and to share ideas effortlessly.","- Training at HSBC is nil. You do get the usual web-based training modules but those are all so that HSBC can claim they've trained all employees on ethics, anti-money laundering etc. The training you need to be successful at your actual job simply doesn't exist. You need to figure it all out on your own and you need to figure it out very quickly.

- Management politics completely obscure the ability to be truly successful. Middle, and I suspect upper, management spends inordinate amounts of effort and time managing up instead of taking care of the people who report to them. This is not isolated as I both saw and experienced this phenomenon across roles and across different departments. Middle management is mostly concerned about presenting a good story as opposed to managing the issues. Real business problems and correspondingly, real business opportunities go unresolved because it's more important to spin a good tale than to actually move things forward.

- Because of management politics, motion is mistaken for progress. As long as you can show that you're ""busy"" you'll generally be OK. But actually accomplishing things is of relatively minimal importance. 

- Again, because of management politics, coming up with a good tale to make your boss look good is of paramount importance. With an attitude like this, it's really no wonder that HSBC has been plagued by scandals and multi-million and sometimes multi-billion dollar fines from regulators. If you think HSBC is operating above board on everything, you're completely off base. People are working to show that they're adding profit at any cost. So long as the profits roll and so long as no one is caught, that's perfectly OK. 

- Your immediate supervisor will be given wide latitude over your progress at HSBC. If you get a good boss, you're golden. If you get a bad boss, you could end up in a very bad situation. This is made possible because HR is completely non-existent at the employee level. There is little to no local HR support. Calling HR gets you to a call centre in the Philippines where you can ""press 1 for ..."". Once you get to a live agent, you generally get some useless answer.

- I called HR once for an issue I was trying to deal with. The agent gave me the name of someone I could email. When I looked that person up, it turned out that I was being referred to the Senior VP of HR in my country as opposed to an HR business partner which is what I asked for in the first place. (I did not email the SVP and my HR issue was never resolved.)

- Management politics (are you seeing a theme yet?) means that senior management tend to treat certain geographies as stepping stones. So they parachute in, do their tour of duty for 3-4 years, then move on to bigger and better things. This leads to a somewhat short-term focus on (the illusion of) results as opposed to tackling real business issues. It's the old focus on quarterly benefits instead of looking to play long-term.

- The time off policy is bizarre. You get say, 20 days off which sounds great. But if you're sick, that counts as a day. So you really have to manage if you should call in sick or if you should drag yourself in to work just so you can save a day off.

- HSBC is huge on security. You can't print without swiping your passcard. Everything you do with HSBC equipment is highly monitored. I get it that it's company equipment and the company reserves the right to check up on things. But the degree to which HSBC takes this is, in my opinion, extreme. Certain documents for example, cannot be printed without filling out a security requisition form. Again, in some cases I get it but in many cases the degree of security becomes a barrier to doing your job effectively.

- As a result of the focus on security, the ability to just talk to your colleagues about various work issues is curtailed. Some projects are code-word only and employees are forced to sign very strict NDAs. Of course, once the project is implemented everyone learns about it. I never did see a project implementation that I felt justified this level of internal security. Certainly there are some things you don't want the competition to find out ahead of time, but internally I think things can be handled differently.

- There is a high level of entitlement at HSBC. If you've been there x number of years, there's a general attitude that you're due a promotion or some level of benefits. Earning your benefits is secondary to time served.

- In part because HSBC is such a giant beast, and in part because HR is essentially non-existent at the local level, employees are treated as assets. Which is to say, they are used in the production of various bank services, and they are depreciated over their useful life span. At the end of their life span, they are written off then disposed. In other words, don't expect any corporate thanks just because you may have done a good job."

The people - You're just working with a bunch of friendly regular folk; albeit unambitious ones that seem to think it's normal working for such an awful company 7+ years @ £20k. They prioritise recruiting internally; once you're in, you can ""sidestep"" in to other jobs they have within the company fairly easily, for example from the mortgages department over to customer services. Pay doesn't vary too much, and there isn't really much benefit outside of finding what you prefer. But they frown upon stepping in to another role before spending at least a year in your current role.
Cold heartless corporate feel to the company, there was a girl that had to drive her brothers infant child to hospital as it was having difficulty breathing. She came in 1 hour late to work, they didn't really care about the why, and told her she would need to stay behind and make the time back.","Dead end - not much progression... You can move up to management if you jump through hoops, but then nothing from there. Starting salary is awful (£16,350... recently upped to £17,350) with little to no pay rise (1-3% if lucky)... When they announce that there will be no pay rises for a particular year I just chuckle to myself... they're one of the biggest banks in the world, I find it hard to believe they did not turn enough of a profit to reward their employees. Lots of office politics involved... favouritism etc. About 80% of the time it's not about how hard you work, it's about making your superiors laugh and enjoy your company. The most successful managers are the ones you see chatting and giggling with other managers.

Many different areas of information technology. Relatively aggressive about keeping up with modern technologies, providing opportunities to learn and do new things. As a Financial Services organization, there is lots of focus on controls, which has its benefits.

The culture is quite excellent in many ways, with pervasive messages about collaboration, inclusiveness, safety, and sustainability. There is a lot of focus on ""doing the right thing"", and it's such a broad and consistent message, with lots of support for things like whistleblowers, I do believe the messages are sincere. To be sure. HSBC has made headlines because of some very illegal things done by some of its employees. The company rightly is held responsible for this, but those actions don't seem to represent the company culture at large.","Because it's a Financial Services company, the focus on controls can mean the ship is large and slow to move, meaning a lot of the organization does focus on older, more staid processes and technology. For a number of years (5+) there has been significant organizational change as the bank tries to become more streamlined. Some of this change has been good, but it is very disruptive to employees, including a heavy focus on moving IT jobs that are not country specific to countries with the cheapest possible labor costs."

Yes, some were not that great, but that's at every company.  Loved the casual dress code.  From June 1st to Sept 1st, you could wear shorts and flip flops.

At one point they decided we couldn't have waste baskets at our desks anymore!!  This was the Worst company I have EVER worked for starting with the hiring process which took over 6 weeks during which the recruiter changed and my inquiries went unanswered for a 2 week period AFTER face to face interview with the hiring manager.  The onboarding was as bad or worse and there was NO orientation or training.to ensure I had all the tools necessary to perform successfully in the position.  Further, they failed to do a formal 1 on 1 meeting to go over the position and establish me in the HR system.  My manager called me 1 week after I started to inform me that my title had changed but gave no reason??  When the year end rolled around 6 months later they discovered I was NOT in the system.  There was constant turmoil with restructuring as the portfolio shrank and fewer staff was needed to service the remainder.  I was moved in/out of 3 different positions in 18 months.  Employees were generally indifferent to new hires from outside as they perceived them as a ""threat"" so they didn't want to train or assist in any way.  As the downsizing occurred non managed employees were mysteriously promoted to supervisory positions without any formal training or background in management.  Time off was comparable to similar companies but insurance was definitely inferior as HSBC continues to shift more costs over to employees."

The company is quite restricted (in terms of being able to grow at the rate it plans to) by the regulations in place and the DPA it operates under, and, while I was there, the turnover of employees in key roles made it difficult to have any kind of continuity to drive some of the large programmes.

The other type of employee can be at lower, middle or upper level of the business. They orbit around the ones who do the work. Especially at upper levels, they make desultory comments on what is put in front of them (this unwillingness to understand means even good ideas are executed badly), and spend their days co-opting the work on meetings and business trips.

But people like that are always under fire and quickly moved aside so they don't ""make waves"".","Horrible, horrible, horrible place to work. The company itself is great with really good pension benefits but no career progression and the senior managers are horrible person to work for and to work with. Money isn't everything, especially if you go home crying and/or constantly stressed out because of the nasty working conditions. 

Senior management are absolutely unscrupulous and when challenged over the way people are treated, you are pushed aside to another team, below your skills in the hope you'd shut up and leave by yourself. 
Fake disciplinary actions are raised against staff members to pressure them to leave instead of having a ""dismissal"" on their records. 

Contractors work under a lot of pressure including verbal abuse by their Line Managers and constant threat of dismissal. They are hired as contractors (self-employed) but must oblige by the hours and conditions imposed by them, including mandatory holidays (if you're self-employed and hired as a contractor, isn't this unlawfully and therefore you should be classed as an employee?)

They really give meaning to the expression ""corporate world"". If you don't have any integrity, if you don't care about other people's well being apart from yours, if you can deal with constant change in procedures because no one knows what their doing and no one takes responsibility for it but that impacts your wages, and a lack of professionalism, then this may be the right place for you. 

on the other hand, if you don't identify yourself with that description, you'll end up leaving with a little less faith in the human race."

- International environment: team is diverse and you can expect to work closely with teams from all around the world
- Friendly culture: generally, most people in HSBC are willing to teach/guide you. Mostly is the caveat. You still meet your fair share of nasty colleagues, but in general, you will be in safe hands.
- Learning curve: as a universal banking with global operations, HSBC offers a full suite of financial products and one is expected to be up to speed with most of these products, at least at a generalist level. You may expect each transaction to have different characteristics, and frequently, dealing with more complicated deals. Again, just to caveat, working on complicated deals does not necessarily mean winning them.","- Poor systems: arcane systems result in lower work efficiency. Systems also tend to be different across individual countries.
- Remuneration: bank is well known to pay below market, especially if you are someone who started with the bank or have stayed for a long time. High salaries are generally reserved for bankers poached from other shops.
- Bureaucracy and complicated processes: HSBC is well known for its internal complexities and difficulty in resolving even something simple. Get used to that."

12373,,I'd rather chew my foot off than go back there,2016-10-10,1.0,Financial Administrator,"Strong track record, one of the few financial institutions that weathered recent storms relatively unscathed
It's a large organisation and there are lots of opportunities: some staff seem to do very well in terms of promotions / responsiblities etc
They're generally well-organised
""My choice"" reward package gives you some good choices of non-cash benefits as part of your remuneration package e.g. BUPA healthcare for you & your family.
Good training programmes.
Most colleagues are decent people, some departments have a good social life.","Wages are deliberately set at 10% below the market median.
Frequent restructuring and re-orientation of goals etc means there is a lack of continuity - 100s of man hours invested in projects & initiatives, then one day your boss says ""we're not doing that anymore"".  Inefficient and frustrating.
Excessive red tape and a ""can't do"" attitude amongst middle management.  
A big vote up here for the brainwashing.  Every day you're told HSBC is ""The Best Place to Work"" - this slogan is plastered across foyers in letters 6 foot high.  And for years I believed it... TBH I started to believe there must be something wrong with me, always missed out on promotions, getting poor reviews, very undervalued.  Back at School, Uni and everywhere else I've worked I was always a high achiever, yet at HSBC I always felt like a ne'er do well.  Why?  Because line managers generally don't like people with ideas and initiative, they want Stepford Wives.  
[BTW, HSBC is not ""The Best Place to Work"".  Back in the days when *all* staff completed the staff survey, we used to score 55%-60% staff satisfaction.  There are 100's of companies in the country with staff satisfaction ratings >90%.]
Bullying is rife.  Too many managers throwing their weight around.  Over 12 years I had 9 different line managers, I made complaints against 3.  Not only were my complaints not investigated, HR told me I would be placed on a disciplinary for gross misconduct if I didn't retract a formal grievance. In case you're thinking I'm the over-sensitive whiny type, one complaint was i.r.o. a physical assault, witnessed by numerous colleagues.  Nothing was done about it, no-one would back me up.  People didn't want to ""get involved"".
My opinion is that HSBC's anti-bullying policy is there for show, like a lot of their other policies.  e.g. I also suffered RSI whilst working at HSBC, they took 3 months to undertake a workstation assessment and refused to provide me with an ergonomic mouse - I had to buy my own.  
Morale is low, so many staff I've seen in tears, even threatening suicide because they hate their jobs so much.
Poor communication & secrecy at every level of management.  e.g. Time and time again staff have found out from BBC news that HSBC is making 1000 UK staff redundant, but there is zero internal communication about it.  Staff are left to worry and speculate, whispering in corners.
Regarding IT systems - yes a lot are fairly stone-age.  HSBC overall tend to ""play it safe"", which is one of the reasons they didn't fall into the money market sinkhole back in 2007/2008, but it also means they choose to avoid being at ""the leading edge"" of anything, because the leading edge is often the bleeding edge.
Also ofc new things cost money: if you've not worked for a financial institution, please understand that everything is about money.  And it seems nothing else matters."

12587,,The Worst of the Worst - RUN away from any job offer here,2016-08-08,1.0,,"There are some very nice, honest, hardworking and moral people who I have had the pleasure of becoming friends with. Work experience counted for something as I have now been able to move on.  HSBC does pay decent and the bonuses are ok, however I understand that this is likely going to change in the near future.","Where can I start with HSBC?  It is a very large, slow, short-sighted global bank that will most likely be the worst place I have ever worked.  I spent 5 years there in 3 different positions, so I got a feel for multiple departments.  At every turn there are incompetent, mean and disrespectful managers who continue to get promotions.  These are often the suck-ups or the relatives of HSBC C-level execs or high value clients.  I can think of one key example of this, a manager I used to have.  This was a woman who types with two fingers, wears low cut shirts and cannot understand the most basic of processes.  She has prevented her own staff from promotions and new roles because she is too lazy to rehire.  She effectively shut down 20% of the team at HSBC Canada and now works in HR. She clearly favours promoting men over women.  She ""works from home"" all the time when we all knew she was just dropping off and picking up her daughter from school

This is just one small example of the nepotism and futility at this company.  As an employee, goals were unrealistic and there was extreme pressure day to day.  The convoluted, every changing corporate structure made it nearly impossible to be effective in your job.  Things changed constantly, and often half-baked.  Departments were merged and un-merged.  Local structures became global overnight, with many people reporting to managers in remote locations and forced to take 3am ""team"" conference calls.

My advice would be to run away from any job offer at HSBC. This is a sinking giant in an outdated industry. They only got e-mail transfer payments in 2015 for godsake!  The pay and bonuses are not worth the stress on yourself, your family and your health.  This is not a place I was proud to work at ever, and I'm glad I'm gone."

Customers regularly abuse staff without recourse due to lack of backbone amongst management, who in turn take it out on other staff.

Opportunities to go on short term attachment abroad. Management acknowledges need for change.","In terms of change initiatives, satellite sites (non-regional hub countries such as the Philippines) come last in the chain. Management makes an effort to execute changes based on employees feedback, but their efforts fall flat due to various reasons (lack of understanding of how the process performs on the ground level, regional politics, budget constraints, etc). High turnover and attrition adds stress to remaining employees, with management having to ask for approval to replace the headcount, usually with little success, so overtime of 2-3 hours is the norm.

Management is all now from London (with an intervening layer of numpties in Asia), it takes numerous people to say Yes (but only needs one to say No and block everything), and mostly they just deflect and finger-point. Very much a ""cannot do"" (or, ""will not do"") culture in places.  The Transformation function doesn't know where it's going and will likely progressively disappear into IT or business units, and rightly so as it has hopeless leadership.  Pick your work department very carefully!!  They preach HSBC Values endlessly (and as a way to justify why newcomers just cannot ""fit""), but the backstabbing and negativity on the job - and then the way they treat people when exiting them - contradicts those values 100%.

HSBC is good about hiring recent grads to learn about things on the job, where a lot of other banks want you to have experience doing this kind of work in order to get a job. I was left alone most of the time to do the work. I'm self-motivated to learn, so it was easy for me. I had a great boss, so life was good for me, I was able to work remote most days.","The layoff caught me by surprise with no warning. If you are not a self-starter and not able to figure out how to do the job on your own, this might not be the place for you. The managers were demoted to senior analysts before the job cuts came, so maybe I should have seen this coming.

- no stress, no target but don't expect too great of a compensation
- Often you find yourself helpless but as a consolation it's not only you but most of the employee feel helpless. 
- KPI is very easy to achieve once you understand how to game the system. Often when the so called expert try to improve on the system. Individuals will find ways to innovate and game it. And often improvement of the system does not mean improved profit or revenue. 
- it's an Organization where you can learn as you work, taking over a team or department without experience , no need to understand the local market and trial and error even if you fail, you can use your position to eliminate all your critics. 
- ability to write or articulate well often bring you to places.","- since there is no target, individuals can't be bothered to build their business, learn or improve. 
- learning curve often flatten rather than steepen after day 1 as the inexperience would try to figure out how to run day to day business. Leaders themselves do not know what the directions are or how to move accordingly. 
- there are more individuals trying to game the system in order to get better bonus payout rather than doing quality work. 
- favouritism runs deep and discretionary bonus is creating an imbalance in compensation. Those who brings in cold hard profit often get short change while those who can write and articulate well but a major cost often get compensated better. 
- no clear understanding of the business, how to plan and how to work. Try to reinvent the wheel when the basic of business and key driver is revenue. U need income to cover your cost and not reducing your cost to build your profit. 
- cost are reduce on essential business but increased for incompetent individuals or redundant individual coming in to local market.
- often employee will hear news via Internet or credible news source than the top management memo or email. Sometime it make the employees wonder why outsider knows more about their Organization then them. 
- management whether top, mid or front are great firefighters, it just shows how well they can plan. 
- telling employees who contribute if you are not happy you can go leave is degrading those who love their job or Organization. And often such brainless comments come from mid office management, who do not even bother to understand how the local run their business. And most of the time these people do not know how to run the business. Using their power and position in the Organization to cover their incompetence."

HSBC has a collaborative culture where many opinions are sought and respected, and in my experience usually there is a pleasant working atmosphere. Senior management and people across the company mostly are serious about doing the right thing, and if ever HSBC can wire itself together to its full potential, there is so much opportunity for the company to be a real force for good.",The banking industry is going through a pretty grim period of reshaping itself and HSBC is no exception. Recent high profile failures mean that implementing a complex regulatory and financial crime compliance agenda is critically important also recent disappointing financial performance is driving continual reorganisations. Both of these mean the company's rhythm can be focussed more on internal issues rather than looking outwards for opportunity and inspiration.

Bonuses are 1/4 to 1/2 of those given by other banks for similar positions/performance. Negotiate well your entry salary, as it will never be raised until you are promoted, unlike other banks that provide yearly raises (which is the norm for global banking and global markets positions in tier 1 banks).

Colleagues are being let go instead of the senior people which is very hurtful. RWA reduction is being pursued aggressively which should have been done 5 yrs back. They should be expanding into India and USA instead of focusing all their energies into China. No doubt a third restructuring  will be announced in 2 years as top line growth will remain challenging.

I can put my bet here, after 10 years, HSBC will be worse than what it is now.

favouritism: couple years ago, a new guy got hired, and he started reading documents. But half month later, he was awarded employee of the year. And more, half year later, his wife was hired as well. And even more surprisingly, similar thing happened not just once.

A recent example, a guy in India, who is the team lead, worked so hard, almost day and night. Then a new manager from nowhere was inserted between him and his manager. We all felt surprised. If this team lead quits the job, the productivity of this function will be cut half, as most other experienced people were gone already. 

bureaucracy: before release, testing server got memory issue, and I found the time out setting got extra 0, so it was 10 times as it should be. But the direct manager could not dare to make go/no go decision, then all the managers in the team(big team including other functions) had meeting at least 30 hours long to discuss this go/no go decision. 

I am saying this, not because of I got laid off. I had had my chance to move to other team before laid off happened, I chose to stay in order to get severance pay so I could move on. I am saying this just to hope that the current work force can be treated fairly and HSBC can improve. It was HSBC gave me the opportunity to convert myself to be marketable in current job market."

It's a big company with a long history. Some people still think it's prestigious. While in fact, if you work here, you'd be surprised how this company can still be in this business. Just take a look at its data system. So messy, disorganized and mismanaged. Nobody knows anything about the data. There're also many customers' information missing. The bank doesn't even know if the customer is paying the money back or not.","EVERY single person who have had interactions with HSBC, both customer and employee, described the company as horrendous. The customer experiences are terrible. HSBC has this attitude of ""yes, I'm a big bank, if you don't like my service, go somewhere else."" Thus, its customers suffer so much from poor services. All you can expect from the bank is ""There's nothing I can do."". As for employees, it's such a shame to work for this company. The pay is rubbish, especially when the bank is being fined EVERY SINGLE YEAR! If you want to generate profit by doing illegal business, at least don't get caught! Those fines have taken a huge toll on the compensation and the morale is so low within the bank. Every management person is looking to jump ship. No one is really there to work. There's no sense of impact. Actually, all the employees that I have met described their work as ""add no value"". And some of them are from the Global Banking & Markets, which is supposed to be the house of the firm. Still, those GBM folks hate HSBC so much, not only because of the pay, but because of the culture here. I am not going to mention the garbage IT system, HR people and incompetent management. Just so you know, the IT infrastructure is so out-of-date that sometimes you want to smash the laptop and leave."

Inefficient - Internal inefficiencies brought upon by mindless adoption of a one-size fits all regional/global company structure that is not reflective of local operating needs. 
Indifference - a culture inherent in HSBC where functions are shoved around in hopes that a problem gets solved. Very few throughout the process chain genuinely feel responsible for their function/work and it makes you feel like you're working with mechanical drones.
Bureaucracy - painfully slow speeds to get anything approved, implemented or communicated to top management. If you're in a regional office, good luck if it needs to be escalated to say Hong Kong and thereafter London.
Get ready to NOT do business - be drowned in compliance processes and paperwork. Top down emphasis on buffing up anti-money laundering processes (to keep the DPA alice) without the proper setups for execution (even if there are, it seems like its more for show). Front line and coverage teams seem to be penalized to prioritize this over business growth.
Poor matching of positions to individuals - some people have no idea what they're to do.
Seniority by tenor and ranked held - Perceived value from tenor of service with the company in a non-meritocracy culture. 
Extremely poor training programs made mandatory - mostly superficial HSBC-specific content that doesn't add value or facilitate technical growth. Absolute waste of time.
Poor career advancement opportunities. 
Poor remuneration packages."

Lots of young fun people 
Some good managers (generally the older ones who've built the business from scratch)
Comprehensive training offered to get you started
Easy to achieve senior job titles due to high turnover; looks good on resume, other banks have started to catch on, though.","Constant rotation of international managers into senior executive positions in different countries, leads to change for the sake of change. They are only around for 2-3 years (sometimes less), which is not enough time to effect meaningful change in a company the size of HSBC. But they need to put something on their resumes in terms of achievements, since their next job posting depends on the wonders they bring about in their current job, so they start reinventing the wheel, over and over again. Clients get mad, staff gets stressed, turnover goes crazy, paperwork (never in short supply in banking) escalates....and then the executive is transferred out, to his next position, a new guy comes in and the fun starts over. 

Limited advancement for local senior management, despite numerous years of service and significant contributions brought to the business.

Very low pay, especially for recent graduates. Bonuses are often a joke. They sent threatening emails every time bonus time comes around, to warn people off sharing the info. People do anyways. Caveat: they will pay market rate if they hire you from a different bank. But if they groom you internally, you will make less than new hires at the same level, coming from a different bank.

If you have any HR complaints, good luck to you. They do not care. 

Very high turnover. Some departments are literally a revolving door. One time, an entire department quit the bank in two tranches, 2 months apart. Most upsetting many old time managers which built the business and actually provide good training and guidance, end up leaving or get pushed out. 

Due to change for the sake of change, people's job titles can suddenly change radically, according to the new executive's re-organization scheme.

Vacation is scarce and must be taken according to the bank's core leave policy (i.e. you are forced to take a big chunk of it in one go, whether that suits you or not). Sick days deducted from vacation, unless out for at least 3 consecutive days, and can present doctor's note.

Very stingy with tuition reimbursement or study days. 

Long working hours, primarily filled with endless paperwork.

Some departments and managers actively try to impede their employees from switching jobs or getting promoted (to be fair that is an issue in some other banks, as well).

The bank pays lip service to how the employees are their most valuable resource, but actually treats people as disposable and easily replaceable. 

Generally low morale."

Due to the bank's scandals HSBC does not want their fingerprints on any actual downsizing in AML compliance. They also do not want to pay any unemployment and severance packages. However, HSBC is more than content to keep salaries low as employees leave on their own. Another negative is there is a global standards assessment all employees must now take and pass with an 80% grade to impress regulators and integrity monitor. This assessment is to be taken on an annual basis. Unfortunately, the wording of the test is flawed. It's a multiple choice/true false subjective test that his resulted in massive failures. These ""global standards"" often contradict the procedures employees are given by their line managers resulting in massive chaos. In many respects this bank does not know what its doing.

You hardly ever see people getting fired. Even if you're actively seeking to be fired. 

- International Exchange
You'll be in touch with people from all around the world, every day, and it's going to broad your perspective over time. Chances of getting sent overseas are decent, but not the norm.

- Weekly Massage
A reason to be glad you're going to the office, at least one day a week.

- Young blood
The employees are usually young (mid twenties-early thirties), so the environment is as energetic as you might expect.","- Cheap
And it shows. Everywhere. And it's the one characteristic that defines GLT as being GLT. The salaries are the worst in town, and finding budget for anything is a nightmare, which in turn leads to...

- HR is the worst.
Some of the worst recruiters I've ever seen, but the administrative side of HR is terrible of it's own accord. Doing Resourcing the right way is expensive and require well-trained professionals, and since GLTb is cheap, don't expect to see those working on any overhead department, starting with the head of HR. And bad HR in turn lead to...

- The wrong people, at the wrong place, at the wrong time
HSBC (and IBM for that matter) have long lost track of the difference between instrumental values and terminal values, with the first overtaking the importance of the later, and in turn what you see is people making into management by their capacity to display good metrics instead of the track record of their work. 

- Nobody competent stays for long
It's true. If you stay more than 3 years at GLTb, it's because you're looking for a place to lean back and settle down. There's no reason to stay longer, as your salary is unlikely to raise at a competitive rate, and as soon as you join HSBC, your skillset starts deteriorating, as all the technology they use over there is lagging some five years behind the rest of the world.

- It's dangerous to go alone
...because the company is headquartered right by the side of the most violent favela in the city. I'm not kidding, Google ""Vila Torres 190"" and see what shows up. Scary stuff."

They don't plan for it and don't provide preventative upgrades. When something stops working it leads to prolonged, days or weeks long outages. Getting something fixed is done through a labyrinthine system of helpdesk tickets passed through a hopelessly idiotic system of first level technicians incapable of resolving or even understanding the most basic of issues. They often pass along tickets to the wrong department. Recently a productivity monitoring program was introduced, however it is self reported. Poor workers submit dishonest information which inflates their figures while honest employees are penalized on their performance ratings.

My manager would throw numbers at you in the morning, ask how far along you are before you leave for lunch, then again before you leave. a Huge waste of time, and makes all employees miserable.

Contradicting strategy between department due to lack of communication between team, ie: one department introduce new initiatives and procedure, however another team will stop this new initiatives due to another reason. Although salary maybe higher than other banks, however due to overtime spent during work, it works out that hourly rate is lower compared to similar position in other bank. Incentives aren't great for sales team, very hard to get unless meeting all your sales target and behavioural component (which is very very very subjective, depending how good you are with your boss). That goes to prove that doesn't matter you have met your sales target, if your relationship with your boss is not good, he/she can give excuses not giving you incentive due to your behaviour. That is so unfair. All in All, as one of a client said about HSBC, How Simple Becomes Complicated, I thought this is really true."

Communication is awful
Compensation is probably the worst of any high street bank. They allegedly base it on the average across the high street.
Individual teams are so worried about their own little fiefdom and ""beating"" other teams that they might as well have stuck with incentivised selling.
Good employees lose out to employees who interview well but don't have the skills to back up the interview. No promotion based on merit either - which means no promotion essentially unless you don't realise that a branch/department is bad and apply there and no-one else has.
Manager will rate you badly because they have lost your employee file. (Seriously.

Pros -
(1) Well evolved processes are a true strength of this place. These processes distinctly allocate parts of responsibilities to various individuals and keep things moving faster.
(2) Org as a whole works on building a specific work culture. 
(3) Managers and other employees are true brand ambassadors of the ethics.
(4) Satisfied employees take a lot of pride in being associated with such a sophisticated and global brand.
(5) You are considered an important cog in the wheel, the environment is not that of a software mill.
(6) Great thrust upon soft skills which polish the employees and make them superior in the market outside too.
(7) Aspirations of employees are understood, respected and acted upon.
(8) Some of the managers are a true asset. They are clear, upfront, regular and constructive about feedback. They are organised and have a vested interest in bringing new joiners on-board and making them feel attached to the org. They are approachable and this is a pro because the organisation mandates it for them to be approachable. I haven't been lucky enough on this front in other places.
(9) Most importantly, a global brand like this offers diversified international experience with clear thrust upon customer satisfaction and efficient delivery.
(10) Employees across departments do truly feel like being a part of one big family striving to achieve an objective.
(11) Overall there is a clear sense of brand, culture, own responsibilities, strong sense of team, truly purpose driven deliveries and lots of focus on employee's growth.","(1) Different org units reflect the philosophy of their heads, and my experience could be restricted to my own unit. So you have to be in the right team.
(2) Many past employees tend to continue with the org for years, leading them to occupy key positions deservedly. But at times this acts as a deterrent / dissatisfaction for the new joiners. 
(3) Going vendor supported may cost permanent employees to feel challenged and less valued."

Generally salary is capped early in the career and it is difficult to move up to a higher job band.

If something goes wrong somewhere  down the line, this back fires because you made the changes to the model. This is not in writing so you can't prove your innocence. Eventually i resigned.

This was something many people across the board complained about. White papers written with no clear guidance on who the intended audience is, so you cannot really gauge what to write. most of the time papers sit in somebody's outbox - very demoralising. Its a big, old company, with a lot of old, political people. If you are good at playing politics its a good place.

The culture predicates you must look out for yourself, even if it's at the expense of a colleague.  There is a lot of button pushing.  At times, I felt like management was more concerned about completing menial activity tracking tasks as opposed to actually generating revenue.  You have a role and you are expected to only act within said role.  There is no allowance for creativity, thinking outside the box, or taking an entrepreneurial role to your job.

• Great investment research

The company do provide a decent work environment. If you are fairly efficient and effective, your should be able to achieve work life balance easily. The recent changes and shake-outs in management has been a net positive for the company. There are a lot more direction and focus now. Colleagues are generally friendly (if you can ignore the few oddballs that may unfairly account for an enlarge d experience), and are help if you know now to ask nicely. Financial recognition is awarded to those who have contributed to the team and help their boss know that they have contributed to the team. Finally, due to the global nature of the bank, they have a fairly deep benched global research team that provide great analysis on a variety of events and they are exceptionally strong in the Asian fixed income space.","• Some cost departments have an inflated sense of ego, and that usually hinders business activities.

14936,,Could be good but isn't,2014-06-20,2.0,Anonymous Employee,"Work / life balance is OK. Employees at my level are actively encouraged to work from home 1, 2 or 3 days per week. During the day there's a lot of freedom to go about doing your thing without having people hover over you. As an employee you're treated as an adult with appropriate give and take.

The company is also by far the most global I've ever been a part of. Many companies claim to be global by nature of having offices everywhere. But at HSBC there is far more global collaboration than what I've experienced elsewhere. If you serve your time, there are opportunities to move internationally as well. The majority of people I work with are not from Canada even though we all work out of the same office now.

On the whole, corporate values are fairly open. Right now for example, HSBC is sponsoring a few events for World Pride. Internally there are posters encouraging employees to participate in Pride events as well. World Cup 2014 is currently in full swing in Brazil and many employees are taking full advantage of excellent TV coverage to watch games, participate in pools etc. So there is definitely a light-hearted aspect of HSBC which is embraced.","I consider my pay to be low. The time-off policy is not overly restrictive, but it's an oddity to me in that you get x days off (depends on seniority) but if you're sick that counts as time off. So you're not supposed to take 100% of your time off as vacation, but rather leave a day or 2 ""in the bank"" just in case you get sick.

The biggest con of HSBC Canada though is that there's no sense of urgency in anything and thus no sense of direction. To me it feels like I'm working with a gigantic blob of Jello. The mass kind of jiggles and moves in a direction that's roughly forward, but it's really slow going. And when you contribute your bit, the mass just kind of jiggles some more without really feeling like there's forward momentum. 

Without a sense of urgency, everything just slows down as people ease up. So we end up doing stupid things like creating spreadsheets which then need to be manually copied to Powerpoint which then gets emailed out as an update which no one really pays attention to anyway. But hey - we have a deck and somehow that's perceived as being a Good Thing.

People development does not seem to be a priority either. As a new hire I was thrown 20 or so web-based trainings (which taught me nothing new really) and I got to attend a couple of conference call / trainings. Other than that, I find I need to rely on my own initiative to learn how stuff really works at HSBC and who does what. There is essentially no formal training for on boarding a new employee and as far as I can tell, no policy for internal training let alone external third-party training courses. I suppose if I build a case and ask I might be allowed to attend some course somewhere, but it's up to me and my initiative. I don't think HSBC will proactively initiate training unless it's another web-based compliance thing."
14937,,Okay,2014-06-20,2.0,Anonymous Employee,The benefits are really good and that is something that you need in todays business.,The challenges working there was the favoritism.

Yes, these are the pros compared to the cons.","Let me just state that the DPA of 2012 wasn't surprising given the far flung, year after year shenanigans at the bank; the feds velvet hammer triggered an internal shotgun response where a scalpel was/is needed.  In the past my response to 'where do you work?' was met with 'what's that?' Later some would say 'oh I had my mortgage with HSBC' (not happily I should add)....now, I respond by just saying 'computers' and leave it at that. I can not hear the word 'mistake' again without screaming. Oh the shame.

- One of the very few organizations, where you wont feel the ""work pressure"". However, I have heard of some managers who do pressurize their subordinates. But again you have many doors open to raise your concerns.
- You would rarely be stopped by anyone for learning, irrespective of whether the learning is relevant to your job or not
- Best place if you are of the kind who prefer to spend your lifetime in an organization!","- Lack of challenging work 
- Although you are permitted to learn a great deal, you may rarely get a chance to implement them in your day-to-day activities.
- Since roles are fixed among different teams in a project, you may seldom get a holistic view of the project that you are working in.
- Beware, you may end-up being assigned to a job profile which may not relate to your skillset and experience.
- Fresher are most likely to end-up as a Mainframe or AS400 programmer/tester (although some of them may get better opportunities)

- This in turn causes lots of overtime, which BTW is unpaid.
- Business owners are haughty and disrespectful.
- Red tape is out of control, even after factoring in the strong auditing needs.
- Short-sighted resource management - most tech resources are offshore and have a very high turnover rate (some are gone as soon as they've been trained - clever if you ask me). Can't blame them when you see how they're treated.
- Reliance on consulting firms to ""help"" with business decisions.
- The Atrium building in Buffalo is by far the worst office I've ever worked in. No personal space, noisy environment, sub-par canteen with very limited outside options, undersized restrooms, surveillance cameras in the actual work area...
Global level:
- Known money launderer - all banks probably are, but not many are bad enough to get caught...
- Corporate culture is all ""Do as I say, not as I do"" - tone at the top doesn't match what's required of you in the mandatory propaganda sessions
- Too much middle management being of seemingly no use, except leading political battles against each other (common in big companies I guess)"

After working with the company for a significant amount of time they discarded me like trash, even though I was a consistently top performer. (grossing the company over 100K plus monthly and giving them numbers never seen before) and really enhanced the companies brand, and brought back the trust of clients whom where adamant in reference to speaking with me (which management saw as a bad thing). You can not blame the employees for poor production rates within the company because it starts with the management first and they could never lead by example to guide the employee to high production levels. They need managers whom can lead by example and not by observation or politics. If you show your leadership skills and are not apart of the click you WILL become a target. Only use the company as a stepping stone and move on. Individuals whom have been employed here for a substantial amount for time are at the bottom of the rank and lack to show business knowledge (no threat just getting by for a paycheck), personally involved or related to some one within management.

Company is run by a cadre of International Managers that occupy all executive management positions and start their careers at the top.  They rotate them around the globe to groom them for Group Head and CEO positions.  The IMs act as a ceiling for career growth as nobody gets into this group unless recruited there out of college.  It also ensures that you will have a new IM running your Business Unit every 2-3 years and that all strategy decisions are based on a 1-2-year time horizon.

The majority of staff are very nice and helpful as people","HSBC are experts in brainwashing staff into believing that HSBC is the centre of the universe and their way is the right way. Life does not exist outside of the Bank. They are experts in spin doctoring.
Very poor wages and poor promotional opportunities above a certain level
Lack transparency in review process - its a popularity contest and is dependant upon how best you can suck up to your manager
Lack of unbiased validation of personal achievements for performance reviews- this means that some individuals can massage the statistical evidence of their achievements to make it appear they are doing a better job than they are. Specific examples provided to the bank by me were brushed under the carpet and disregarded. 
Misuse of authority - a great deal of bullying - instead of embracing the skills of individuals, managers with inferior skills will suppress the individual to avoid being exposed themselves. The bank officially takes bullying seriously but seems incapable of preventin it.
Very much a parent:child culture - managers condescendingly dictate to how you should feel, what your personal values should be. You need to leave ""you"" at the door and act as the person they want you to be in this unnatural, contrived environment.
Far, far too much politics with managers putting their own egos before what is beneficial to the company or the customer. This must be very expensive for the bank with wasted effort, wasted time in meetings and wasted use of resource.
The bank stopped undertaking general staff surveys years ago...... But now select a sample of individuals....... Read between the lines.
Don't believe that your working week is 35 hours. ""To show your conviction and commitment..."" expect to work somewhere between 45 and 50+ hours per week (for no extra pay) travelling in your own time even if this takes 3 or 4 hours on the train to attend meetings or site visits, and setting off at stupid-o-clock in the morning..... And does the bank value this? Read between the lines.
Most companies will say that their staff are their most valuable asset. HSBC does not appear to subscribe to this.  Their policy appears to be one where they will make life difficult and intolerable for longer serving staff so they leave and can be replaced by new (cheaper) staff. They do not value knowledge, experience, skills, innovation.  Don't get me wrong at interview they will test all of these, but they will knock any individuality out of you in the first 6 months.  They must have unreserved subservience. ""If you don't like the way we do things..... hard cheese.... Leave!"" this is their attitude. 
The bank is unreceptive to feedback and arrogantly ""knows better"".
I gave 3/4 of my working life to HSBC and feel stupid in that I have just realised how little they value you and I am horrified that they blatently do not even care that they do not value you. Moreover, many people you speak to seem to know someone who has had similar experiences with the bank and had to leave. The bank appears to have no humanity at all."

Doing work smart could not be the reason to get promoted, but if you know the rule of the game, you will probably win. Example: when everybody looks like idiot in the meeting, and someone is doing the job incorrectly, the best idea is shut your mouth up, and act as an idiot as everyone else, otherwise , you will be ""let go"" soon. whenever anythings up, the first thing you should do is cover your own a**!

If you want to stay there in the rest of your life, you should either work hard as a DOG without no respect, or you work as an a**hole to get in good relationship with those big a**holes by ALL MEANS, this is the rule of the game at there forever.

The fourth biggest pro is that the facilities are well maintained and properly secured","The constant shift in management of the HSBC Group creates chaos in HSBC GLT.
HSBC is after all a bank and it will do anything and everything to show a profit, which includes firing people left, right and center.
HSBC GLT has lost a lot of money on many initiatives that failed. The only people benefiting in these failed ventures are the top level management. Although they are asked to quit, but these guys make a lot of money to suffice for a life time before they quit. This has been a constant in HSBC GLT since 2008 to 2011. The current CEO change has ensured that this has come down to a minimum but still what was lost earlier is hard to recover.
New management has tightened the screws everywhere, but it is only adding to severe employee unrest. Although this has ensured minimal malpractices, but it has increased the frustration in employees."

Employee growth was encouraged through company paid trainings, as well as, tuition assistance.

From what was blatantly said by senior management HSBC is liquidating their mortgage portfolios and there are no plans to generate new ones.  They have been fined for regulation violations (predatory lending) and are looking to sell the portfolio altogether.  This has already been done w/ their credit card portfolio.  The time frame given 'long term' was three years, so don't plan on being there long.  I believe HSBC is a wonderful company to be employed with, if you are in a higher up position.  For  collections and customer service they're simply hiring bodies at this point to help liquidate the portfolio before it is sold.  This has led to very lax employment requirements, in my training class I witnessed racial slurs ""that's just one more white person I can check off my list, I don't like them anyway"", obscenities, markers and such being thrown, passing gas loudly and purposely in the elevator, and sexual comments as well.  I believe there would be less disorder in a prison yard.  The employees who have been there for a while seem to be equally disgusted in the new-hire classes.  One last thing, the dress code is neither interpreted or enforced, much of the time I felt as if I was in a club; abundances of cleavage, spandex, six inch platform heels, bamboo earrings, bright orange hair, tattoos,etc. (see posted pic).  If you are at all looking for a job that utilizes skills or education go elsewhere.  If you're looking to get in and out and make some fast money in the next couple years then this would be a good place for you (the job itself isn't that bad if you can make it through the god-awful subjugation of the training class)."

HS listens to people's feedback through GPS, treats the front-liners fairly and is a very generous company. As one of the Senior Leader of HSBC Global Resourcing in the Philippines I have never worked of a greater company than HSBC","When I joined HSBC in 2007 my first comment to my SVP Nikkie Harris was that we have such a small span of control and that we are VERY top HEAVY.  I felt at that time that I was not relevant as an AVP since I was only managing 100FTE with 3 Managers under me. I mentioned that this type of span will not be profitable to any company. It has to make some drastic change before the CEOs and the CFOs realize this and demands a quick resolution which will be very unpopular to the greater percentage of the workforce. A yr after that, my VP left for another company but he was replaced with not one for TWO VPs. Imagine my surprise that even with so many Senior Managers in the office 2 were still promoted for a single open post.  Fast forward to 2011 when  Stuart Gulliver announced selling of HouseHold to Cap 1 and  the mandate to streamline the organization. The same strategy I was pointing out 4 years ago."

- Salary not synchronised across departments, resulting in staff with same level of experience and/or performance but huge gap in salary range.
- Fresh grad salary (entry level) is almost the same with permanent staff salary (junior level approx. 2 years working experience in GLT) resulting in dissatisfaction among junior  co-workers"

15974,,Good Experiance in Banking Domain,2012-08-19,3.0,Team Leader,"HSBC present a great opportunity for Software Professional who is good in technical. Because HSBC have grown so big in short time through acquisitions and mergers that it’s systems are disintegrated and its a good opportunity it you have technical skill to integrate different applications. If you can do this kind of work then you can grow quickly.

Very Good place for work life balance: If you want relaxed job, this is good place for you. Just keep doing your work and come to office at 10 and go home @ 6:30 and keep getting average annual hike i.e. 8-12 %. Best place for working couple.

Anyone with any banking or commercial knowledge knows that.  Once you finally want to get out of HSBC, it looks great on your resume.  If you are lucky enough to get laid off, they treat you well and give you good severance. Also can work from home. occasionally","1.  HSBC in US is a dying cause:  The only area the company places major focus on is commercial banking arm.  Retail banking and GB&M are both shrinking in size (though still will exist), and all of the finance company has either been sold off or is in run off.  There is opportunity to move up, but if you want to work in an environment where everyone is on their toes for lay offs, then that is up to you.
2.  The atmosphere supports no entrepreneurial attitude or creativity in your job (at the staff/manager level).  They just want someone to complete part of the process, and they could care less about what you can bring to the table or who you are as a person.
3.  The office is really nice, but it is in the middle of no where.  No body socializes at work due to the uptight office culture (although gossiping is worse than it was in HS), and certainly no body goes out after work for happy hour.  
4.  Just a depressing atmosphere in general - everybody in this office knows lay offs already have or are soon to occur and that HSBC USA is not mainstream HSBC at all.  We are a portion of a global bank that is a major drag on group consolidated earnings (due to our mortgage portfolio)."

They are not able to retain their staff hence burdens the current employees with an overload of work. This is especially true in contact centres, it creates a very stressfull working environment. And do keep in mind there are a huge number of people who work in the night shift, which changes a lot if things in their lifes, they need to be compansation for that.
HSBC also has the policy of hiring college graduates with degrees and school leavers for the same position and offer them the same salary, regardless if their academic qualifications. It creates an unease among co workers, and as a result they tend to leave the company."

Unfortunately, if you are part of IT and  you're based in NYC, their is almost no opportunity for advancement or job rotation.  You will be stuck doing the same thing, day in and day out, no matter your skill level.  In order to move  up or experience working on different technology, you will need to be willing to relocate out of state or country.   If you want any chance at doing something different, but are determined to stay in NYC, you have to wait for someone to vacate a position, because they rarely create new positions for HTS in NYC. 

Chances are that you'll be reporting to someone in Buffalo, NY, Mettawa, IL, or Vancouver Canada.  Your team will probably be spread through these locations as well.  Therefore, your relationship with your manager(s) and colleagues can suffer.  

If you have exceptional skill in your field of  IT expertise, this is not the company for you.  Their processes and refusal to allow you to grow will dumb you down to the point of self doubt.  

Lastly, HTS members are always the first lambs led to the slaughter when the company decides that it is necessary to cut jobs."

They got rid of 1500-2000 with the Capital One sale (this includes other sites around the country). And in the past two weeks about 200-500 more HSBC Buffalo employees have been laid off.  I  wouldn't be surprised if hundreds if not thousands more will be laid off by the end of this year due to the sale of the branches to First Niagara last weekend.  On to other cons...HSBC likes to move uneducated management around within the company - managers from one dept to another who have no clue about their new dept. and also promote people who have no college and/or don't have enough experience of the job.  Why do they do this?  Because then they don't have to pay what the job is worth, because that would require hiring someone with a degree and/or previous management experience in that field who would require a lot more money.  When management doesn't have a clue about the job, it trickles down and makes everyone's lives miserable.  (see 'Advice to Management' for a continuation of this).

My advice - get rid of the complainers and start fresh with people who appreciate the fact that they have a job. 

I have never worked for a company where mangement goes overboard like this trying to keep staff happy. Gift cards, free lunches, lots of meetings and an open door policy and the funny thing is, the biggest complainers probably get the least amount of work done, yet expect the world to be handed to them.

The company has zero regard for its employees and staff. Senior management changes are constant, and disruptive to execution and employee moral.
