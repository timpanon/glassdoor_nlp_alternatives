Although I’ve been informed there was understaffing issues before joining.,Pay appears to be below market. With the recent merger I foresee a lot of the talent that was retained leaving for better paying opportunities.
287,,Solid Company,2021-08-15,3.0,Anonymous Employee,"Great Benefits, solid work life balance, smooth hiring process. Very generous salaries and lots of great people working in the organization. Opportunities for growth in other areas of the bank.

The bank was seemingly focused on culture as a whole and has tremendous people in place to instill Huntington pride and values. Very friendly towards the LGBT+ community and excellent resource groups for minorities and other marginalized communities. At a macro level, great culture. But micro-cultures was a different story, unfortunately.","Constant fear of layoffs and organizational changes that could impact job and duties. The bank went through several layoffs during my time and many high-performers were let go. Their work was then shifted to other employees already dealing with full plates. After one set of layoffs, another team proceeded to add many positions out of thin air. Very difficult to process.

Extreme lack of diversity, particularly in the department I worked in (marketing and communications). Lots of lip service paid to the importance of diversity and inclusion but during my time, only 1 or 2 minorities actually had direct reports in the organization. I’d guess there was 10 or fewer minorities on the entire team, which was pretty massive and bigger than most agencies. Wonderful opportunities for women which is fine, but the lack of true and total diversity in this area of the bank was very glaring.

Biggest negative - many with direct reports in the organization faced serious pressure to perform. This pressure is expected in a corporate setting but because of this, leaders managed around results instead of working to better understand and build relationships with people. This was a familiar complaint with many colleagues across the bank.

Culture across the bank is way too focused on reviews which are not great indicators of employee performance in my opinion. Lots of subjectivity in reviews and no true understanding of how bank performance impacted reviews and bonuses, etc."
288,,Great inclusive culture,2021-08-13,4.0,Branch Manager,Huntington has a great inclusive culture that truly wants everyone to succeed. The leadership at the top is very strong and looking to grow the bank properly.,The systems can be a little slow but they are working on all of those issues on a constant basis.

I have been with them for 5 years and they have been good to me.,The only negative thing I can say is that management needs to be improved.

Huntington clothing, yes they have their own branding of clothing (think of the movies from the 1950's). This is a good indicator of their culture.

378,,Overall review,2021-05-24,3.0,Customer Service Representative,"Good company to work in. My managers were very nice and accommodating with my schedule especially me being in college. There were a few managers who were rude that I didn’t like but thankfully I wasn’t in their teams. Salary is 17.65 (incentive included) and you get $90 bonuses every month if you hit your goals. Part-time employees get 60 hours PTO, and all the benefits of full-time employees. Where I worked there was a free lunch area. Two 15 minute paid breaks, and one 30 min unpaid break on days you worked 8+ hours. They are very diverse and don’t care about tattoos or piercings.","Phone bank sucks. I had people call and cuss me out, hit on me, say perverted things and I couldn’t hang up the phone I just had to take it. I’ve been called stupid, dumb, etc. the job can be very mentally draining so make sure you have tough skin before accepting the position. You have to sit at a computer for hours and you’re scorecard goes down if you even stop for a restroom break or any kind of break. The job itself is very hard to understand because of all the different equipment, systems, etc but once you have it down you know what you’re doing. You HAVE to work either Saturday or Sunday EVERY weekend. Not every other week but EVERY WEEK. They say it’s good work/life balance but working every weekend isn’t good to me. And it’s hard to try and change your schedule. Overall, the company is great, managers are amazing, staff was nice, but the job itself sucked so bad and the cons outweighed the pros."

If you even think or want to be a salesman, this is not the kind of job for you. I would argue that this was the hardest job I have ever had because I could barely keep my eyes open all day or at least look remotely focused. I have now been with 2 companies since this job have been making over $150k a year each of the last 3 years, this is not a job or even a ""career"" that can provide that for you. But it is meant for those who, like I said, want to just get paid for showing up. Maybe you can make some money? I dont know, never could get motivated enough to even try. I have recommended this job to many people ironically but that is because its for people that just want a job and not much else, which is completely fine."

439,,Awesome company to work for,2021-03-31,4.0,Relationship Banker II,"Very thorough training, the people you meet along the way, the salary and benefits","One con that comes to mind is there aren't many remote jobs. Each remote job has to be tied to a direct branch nearby. Another is a common ""con"" (that you will find at many employers that are seemingly ""behind the times"") is the lack of being able to express yourself. Worry less about what color your employee's hair is and more about their work ethic and their work itself. People with tattoos and ""unnatural"" colored hair are more than capable of being professional and it's time to end that stigma that they're not."

Flex time, and the ability to work from home during COVID (since MAR 2020).","Low pay, no bonuses for non-sales staff, as their bonus structure is tied to the federal government and whatever happens there... And that seems to be a GREAT con, as the company has been super profitable to the point where they are buying over other banks...

742,,Learned The Hard Truth About Coporate America,2019-12-25,1.0,Business Analyst,"1.) I have been through 4 different departments, 3 as a contractor and my last one as a permanent employee, and no matter which department my Co Worker were all amazing. Kind, helpful, and team orientated.

2.) In Secondary Marketing department there was a spefic manager that was knowledgeable, helpful, and geniuely cared about her team.

3.) In every department I've been I notice that Huntington is very customer focused, delivering the best to our end user the customer/ client.

4.) Once hired on I notice that Huntington had great benefits.

5.) Your ideas are easily heard and considered especially if it means doing things a better way.

6.) Senoir Management above my direct managers are incredibly smart, helpful, and kind. They will make time for anyone in there organization that's interested in talking with them.

7.) There are smart and hard working individuals that makes it a great ecosystem, naturally your start to develop and improve professionally.","1.) In my first department, there was chaos from numerous amount of work, and the department had a new manager from an acquisition from a different bank. I was inform overtime will be mandatory when coming on as a contractor, and time off will be frowned upon. I accepted the challenge worked hard, worked the overtime,  took no time off, and had ideas to combat the work load. After some time the volume of work resided and an opening was given to hire someone on permantely, at the time it was me and 1 other contractor who took time off as a traveling baseball coach. But unfortunately I was moved to another department, and the baseball coach was given the position due to his pre established relationship with a SVP, who knew the person for years. My cold hard lesson to neoptism triumphs hard work and process improvement.

2.) My next department as a contractor, I was inform by a new manager that I will be replacing a contractor who is being hired on permantely and if I can do as well as him, I might be given a full time position. 1 year passes and I totally revamped the process of work and create reporting tools for management, and revamp other processes as well. I was always praised for my ideas for improving work process. The process no longer needed many contractors, but just a hand full, from 9 to let's say 3 or maybe even 2. Unfortunately, the work was utimately outsource to other permanent employee, I was told I was the best contractored they had but was laid off with all contractors, and was inform all contractors was let go to budget constraint. I found it odd that this department historically utilize contractors and would adjust the amount of contractor based on volume, so my assumption are they had to budget out for contractors, how could they forecast I would come on broad and share so many process improvement idea. So my rude awakening to false promises, and you can work so hard and add so much value, you can put yourself out a job. I learn work to work as hard as the average person, but dont improve the process or share ideas that can come back in bite you out of a job.

3.) My 4th department I was finally hired on as a full time employee after 2.5 years as a contractor hoping to be hired on. I was brought into a new role as a business anaylst. But I discovered with time, my direct manager was a toxic, deceitful, unethical, and who ultimately was clueless in his role as management. I and other members on the team was given lecture to boast himself and his ego, that had no real point other than he can because he was manager. He used  fear as tatic where was told to always prove our self that you never know when the company will lay us off, constantly reminded me that he did me a favor because he hire me and without him I'll will still be a contractor and to always remember that, and made sexist inappropriate comments about our co workers and how attractive other females where. In addition not only did my manager offer no guidance on work or reporting, I had to work with my co workers and other managers to figure out reporting or the assignment, and come back and teach him, literally walking him through each step, explaining legends, y axis, x axis, and simple percentage break down I learned in the 6th grade. Every question I ask he could never assist but would direct my question else where, I started to realize as I work with other account managers in the department there was this mutual unspoken understanding that my manager was clueless about many thing in regards to his role in Huntington Insurance. He micro managed the team where we kept track of all our hours, and he boastlyfully displayed he works less than 100 to 80 hours a month, but will not assist other co workers with claims when the work load was intensifying. He would use fake praise when some how me or my other team mates got through an assignment or rough part of the work week, but we knew this was all insincere with his behavior and his moments of rude comments. Never had I had a manager such as him where I was disgusted and ashamed that Huntington did not have a system to monitor his behavioral. It's gotten to the point where 1 person forced her retirement early than she would like, I left after being there for just a couple months, and others planning to leave once an opprtunity arise. A lesson I learned was it's important to vent not only the job, but the manager, and awful person can and will be in charge."

They cut incentive pay for some sales positions. They then lower the ways to make revenue making it almost impossible to be successful. If you don’t hit your goals you can be reprimanded or fired. If your service scores are too low, you can be fired. The teller salary went from $10/hour to $16/hour in 2 years. Managers and sales team can only increase IF you’re eligible for a merit increase (by hitting unrealistic goals) and then that is only a recommend 1.5%. They ask for your input annually with the “Voice Survey” but guess what? They’ll do one good thing and act like a hero (example, allowing the teller staff to have 2 chairs behind the line, but having 6 tellers that doesn’t accommodate everyone). There is no incentive for longevity as new hires get paid more than long-term employees. The only thing they seem to want is a good public image."

So unfortunately, the con is that they literally look the other way when people who absolutely hate their job are consistently and constantly doing whatever they can to hurt the good people around them and hurt the company.  It hurts so much of the good work that's being done.  You can observe the most egregiously unprofessional, sociopathic, sophomoric behavior and report it to HR and they will literally just give the lady a slap on the wrist--I honestly have a hard time wrapping my head around this."

If a customer complains, is doesn't matter how petty or ridiculous the complaint is, you will face disciplinary action. Kiss the customers butts or get a complaint. They don't even care if the complaint isn't specifically about you.  

And Branch Management won't help you when it's busy. Long lines and you and a manager are the only people working? Too bad, you're on your own. All they do is sit in the office, only caring about the customers that can make them more bonus money.

Hours at the In store branches are terrible.

810,,Management needs a change,2019-06-05,2.0,Senior Teller,Pay is very competitive with other companies. They strive to make sure you are getting paid fairly.  With the 3 years I was there I got a raise every year plus two other ones that weren't the yearly review. The pto to start was 12 days that I had received by the end of my time I had 16 plus two extra days I had received. There hsa program is really good they have total health thing that if you do the items you could get up to 500 and they give you 250.  They have great maturity leave.  Some branches are great to work for and have a good work life balance but that really depends on were you are at.  There was a lot of change in the 3 years I had been with Huntington some were really great changes and some not so much but that's with any company.  Compared to other banking companies Huntington was a lot better from what I have heard from people that have worked with other companies.,"Management is awful. No guidance what so ever if you want to advance you have to figure it out on your own. Depending if you know someone hire up or at other branches you may move up within to other branches. There’s no appreciation within Huntington. Most places are under staffed and you typically wouldn’t get a lunch. Customers would get upset for being under staff but we couldn’t do anything. Most times I ate out of my drawer when customers weren’t in the branch because I wasn’t able to go to the break-room. You work hard for this company and nothing shows for it. I truly loved my job at first, but it went downhill quick. There is one manager who is an awful person to work with. He would Taunt you and tell you call HR on him. Everyone was afraid of him. He would make people cry and then laugh about it. He made you afraid to call HR and I’ve heard there’s a few managers like that and the district managers were buddies with the managers so plenty of time people would be afraid to say anything because they didn’t want to get fired. Also, some managers were too lazy or didn’t want to see you advance. There is a lot of unprofessional people within the branches/ Huntington all together. Also, there is no consistency from branch to branch. As a customer you go to one branch get told one thing and then go to another and get told the opposite thing. It was hard being a float teller because nothing was consistence you were taught one thing and then go work at another branch and its completely different because the people who have been with the company the longest think they know everything and may need a refresher course every now and then. You also were expected to do  test about subjects and typically never had time to watch the videos or read the material so we all would copy each others answers or take the test and save the answers . Grass isn't greener on the other side left a great branch to move up within the company and got sent to an awful branch. Huntington is like high school. If you don't have your name out there in a good way your not moving up theirs a lot of clicks who knows who basically."

813,,Awful,2019-05-29,1.0,Branch Relationship Banker,"There were two pros to working here, vacation days and a dress code.","Where to begin, the Public Square branch was absolutely awful. I came to Huntington because I had heard so many wonderful things about this company and was massively disappointed when I began working here. The first three weeks my boss didn't do anything to help me, he sat in his office and ignored the fact I was even there. As a new employee I thought I would have some guidance and had none. The manager was a joke, had no idea how to manage a branch or have proper structure. The employees are about as lazy and disrespectful as they come. The one sits the entire day and avoids any type of work, when she does work she makes a lot of mistakes, the other two girls are disrespectful and racist towards coworkers. When issues were brought to managements attention, the manager brushed them off or completely dismissed the issue. The branch had an extremely hostile and toxic work environment. Multiple complaints were made against two of the coworkers for their attitudes towards customers and other employees, however, management dismissed them. It was clear that something was going on that wasn't right when larger issues were being overlooked. There was a lot of miscommunication among the branch as well as a lot of unfair treatment.  Personally, I have never worked in such a toxic work environment that I felt I had to leave. It is concerning that such a large corporation is allowing such behavior in a branch that has a lot of higher ups visiting frequently."

We are told to balance and take time if you need it but that is followed up with “when will you be done?”  No time for lunch or a work out so what is the point if the gym? Increases are always small.  If you take a job here make sure if they tell you to expect a $$ bonus and include it in your “total compensation snd benefits package the you get guarantee  in writing or they’ll forget!  Professionals made sure your a minimum of a grade 73 and a VP (it a bank remember do titles count) to get any bonus or decent vacation. Plan on leaving if you want to make a jump in salary!

This really is a great company and the ideals are there, but if you're in retail, you might as well be in another world.","Huge disconnect between retail and everywhere else in the bank
In-store employees treated like second class citizens
Depending on your leadership, you're lucky if you get any type of praise
Promotions and opportunities for advancement dangled in front of you but seeming to never be within reach.

Being at an in-store means 10 hour days with no lunch  break are the norm. Management only cares about the numbers. The tellers are required to be the sales colleagues and are often asked why they aren't pushing  a product during every single transaction. This company is more concerned with getting credit card sales than they are maintaining customer relationships and loyalty. Very little room for advancement unless you want to become a banker.

Wells fargo syndrome on steroids. Hostile work environment, constant micromanaging and coaching and meetings to increase sales, it was honestly a nightmare & traumatic experience getting out of bed and going into work.

905,,Relationship Banker,2018-10-09,3.0,Relationship Banker,Incredibly fast turnover of management which allows for personal growth and advancement. The sales training was significant.,"Satisfaction with the company entirely depends on the Management in place. The goals can be daunting and if the branch is not very active or if the branch manager is not ambitious with businesses and relationship building, then the branch goals can seem unattainable. Extremely high standards. I was told directly by a district manager that if I was not over 110% of my goal, I was not part of the conversation. Employees who were focused on selling instead of helping were praised. Customers routinely complain about the pushiness of Huntington staff. 

If you work at an In-Store branch you have to deal with the longer hours and being open 7 days each week. These hours would not be a problem if the turnover rate wasn't so high.In-store branches usually run short-handed and understaffed, causing employees to work 6+ days in a row on average. Before I left the company I was working 10 days in a row on average. This contributed to a terrible work/life balance."

Inconsistent management - no training or guidance for managers so they are all over the board.  Your experiece will depend on your management chain and whether or not the have any actual authority to do anything.

Inconsistent policy enforcement - it seems policy is only important when they want to use it against someone.

Inconsistent communication - many ways to receive communications.  Good luck finding the one you should have seen.

Management fails to recognize or ignores the fact that trying to force an in-store channel into a tradition branch model doesn't work and is counter productive; HR at Huntington is amount the worst I have seen...disorganized, inefficient and frustrating. Talent acquisition seems clueless. Lest the reader thinks these criticisms are from a disgruntled employee who is not successful, I have been in retail at HNB for 5 years and have consistently exceeded my goals by a substantial margin and received good reviews.

Customers would rather you make the line move faster than to hand them a dum-dum pop or a pen.  You get spied on to see if you are doing lobby management, even when the lobby is empty??  Those that rate the CEO as highly as they do, or say the people under him should learn from him as to how to treat employees are blind.

I wasn’t even one month in on the job before I was getting yelled at for not offering a credit card to a customer who was in the middle of filing bankruptcy. Managers are ruthless, there is absolutely no room for excuses. Sell. Sell. Sell. Service comes second. 
Every day at work, it’s completely normal for your email to be filled with emails from branch manager, community manager, area manager, district manager, berating your branch for being down on sales. 
They don’t train well AT. ALL. They throw you in the deep end and scream at you for drowning. 
So glad I don’t work for this company anymore.

Forget about breaks, once you clock in there’s nothing until you clock out. Busy days you may not even get a lunch, and managers will schedule accordingly so that days they know are going to be busy or short staffed won’t include a lunch so you don’t go on over time at all. Huntington is moving more to grocery store locations which is horrible for work life balance and overall happiness. Since those locations are open 7 days a week, you might work 13 days in a row with never technically being on overtime, and that really wears down.

1038,,"If you like banking here, don’t get a job here",2017-11-16,2.0,Collector,"Really the only positive thing I have to say about Huntington is the pay. The base pay is relatively competitive and it’s better than average for the industry. Even then, the incentive bonuses aren’t awesome and meeting the criteria to even qualify for  them isn’t worth it, it makes you daily job miserable.","There is a wealth of misinformation circulating in headquarters and little to no action is ever taken to mitigate it. People tell customers one thing and say another the next time they talk, management has conflicting answers, no one knows what is going on in any department. It’s been acknowledged more than once since I’ve been hired but no one has mentioned implementing anything to stop it. 

Most of the decisions that are made on a company-wide scale only benefit the board of directors, to a ridiculous degree. They’re so out of touch with their company it is insane. There aren’t even enough parking places at my center to fit how many employees work there. The software that we use is older than I am, it crashes on a daily basis. The building we’re in is a remodeled grocery store, and it’s also a call center. There are virtually no walls in the building and it’s about three stories tall, you can imagine how the sound carries. Your desks are about two feet apart, it’s extremely difficult to take any calls while you can hear the entire building around you.  I could go on. 

They’ll tell you that once you hit a certain time period after working there that you are eligible to post to another internal position, provided you’re performing at par with your current position. This only happens if your manager really likes you. 

The only food available on-site is ice cream, pop, chips or candy and the gym is more expensive than one with better equipment off-site. There are many “amenities” offered but few, of any of them are what they’re said to be, or beneficial at all. 

They took over another bank, First Merit, a few months ago. The clients who were previously with first merit are understandably frustrated with Huntington’s customer service and we call them during their grace period on a daily basis until they make their payment. Why even bother giving a grace period? 
They were given a survey of their opinion on Huntington, it came back overwhelmingly negative, and no changes have been made. No one seems to care. 

Honestly I’ve worked for several financial companies along the same lines and this is my least favorite. They’re horrible about telling you what you want to hear to get you hired, or to keep you working there, without following through. It’s good for the money but the hours are awful and the so is the day-to-day job, along with a culture of apathy and laziness."

Huntington required us employees to get phone numbers to repeatedly call and nag the customers that we spoke with. I don't know about you, but when i am out buying my necessity items- i simply want to get in and get back out. I don't want to be hassled about opening a bank account.

These were single moms, fathers and individuals working two other jobs at a time. My peers are friendly and professional and did your best with very little support from management.","In my interview they promised me a state of the art training facility. What we all got in training was a windowless room in the basement  with poor ventilation and manila paper taped to the wall for projection screen, a lap top with a cheap projector propped up with books. 

 In the interview they promised me tremendous benefits, wonderful training great chances for advancement, tremendous pay and work environment etc. etc. 

My interview was in May 2017. My interviewer said they would be adding more call center reps by August 2017 and we would be up to 400 CSR's by then. We were going to be the largest call center of all three.

 What I received were lousy benefits with a high premium a massive deductible. They misled us about being paid a shift differential for 2nd shift...it turns out that 2nd shift doesn't start at 3pm but at 5pm. So, I was paid a standard rate of pay from 3pm to 5pm. Shift differential didn't kick in until 5pm which lowered my overall hourly pay averaged out over 8 hours.

Training was truly only a few days and we were thrown into the phones.  Three days isn't long enough to learn your A,B,C's so how do they expect call center customer service reps to learn 20 systems and all the bank products  in three days when it took took the trainer 30 years to learn everything? Complete madness.

After 60 days in the phones our call volume jumped from 20 customers in que to 160 with a hold time of one hour which is insane in the call center industry. When I asked my ""supervisor "" why she said, ""Oh! Well, um we have a lot of people out on vacation and Oh, they closed the call center in Holland, Michigan. ""
So after 60 days as an employee they closed one call center and laid off 129 people.

Then all of a sudden important support departments that we would call for questions about customer loans and another Dept. We called just to get  help with general questions we didn't know the answer to were shut down until further notice. 

Then one day our floor ""supervisors"" started to refuse to take escalated calls. That's when a customer gets so upset that they ask for your supervisor. One time I asked my ""supervisor "" to take a call and she said, and I quote, ""I am sorry. I am not taking another supervisor call. If I do I am afrai I will say something that I will regret . You're going to have to handle it yourself. I was dumbfounded. In all my professional ""career"" I have never heard someone openly neglect their duties and refuse to do their job. Ever. Not once but a Huntington they do and they did. 

One day I got called off the floor and into a training class. We were told that we had to learn how to sign customers into Online Banking. You know, help people create user ID's and passwords so they could do banking through huntington.com. The trainer said it was easy and her sales pitch was, ""It's actually going to reduce your talk time."" Oh come on! I had one call with an elderly gentleman who had a man iphone and the call lasted an hour because he didn't know how to operate his phone and his vision was bad. My talk time for that day alone was more than twice what it should have been.

People in my training class got promoted six weeks after getting out of training. My ""supervisor "" became supervisor a few months after being in the job and had no, ""0"" supervisory experience. Not even a college degree.  So, if you're inexperienced I guess you can get promoted but they are putting people into positions of authority who have no right to have been out there."

-Pay is excellent.","-There are too many incompetent leaders - they must have compromising pictures of someone. Many don't have a college degree, which creates insecurity and backbiting.
-HR is a joke without a punchline. They are constantly 'reorganizing', which they think passes for actual work. There is no vision or leadership in HR.
-There are different standards for different employees. Higher up people can make racist comments and get away with it. (See above about HR being a joke.)
-You don't want to be over 50 years old and working here - they will get rid of you.
-Leaders are known to simply throw temper tantrums to get their way. Ruling by intimidation is not leadership.
-Biggest challenge is complete lack of planning. The CEO demands something and everyone scrambles to do it - work/life balance is out the window. The culture has changed greatly in the last 15 years and not for the better.
-They find out who wrote what on the annual employee survey - please don't provide them with 'candid feedback' if it's negative because you'll have a target on your back."

Managers are asked to run teller drawers every day and have very higher business banking goals. Business Bankers only handle deals over $300,000 but managers cannot facilitate deals over $100,000 so lots of work never gets done. The company claims there are plenty of advancement opportunities, but will never actually follow through on openings. The few openings that did come up were given to select employees without interviewing all candidates. When employees leave, management's response is never to try and keep anyone, but to hire brand new people with little experience at the lowest possible base salaries. The difference in pay is all over the board, with many BMs making $53,000/year and others making $80,000/year in similar markets, with less experience. Zero support from senior management, who will take zero effort to thank you for your efforts or get to know you at all. You are literally a number who Huntington feels can be ""easily replaced""."

Heard a lot complaints that the Huntington people then take credit for the work at meetings with senior management.  Lost of waste and inefficiency.

- Strong partner support to help retail colleagues achieve goals 
- Strong partnerships within lines of business to deliver a consistent customer experience
- Branch, Community, and District production goals are attainable stretch-goals and are well-aligned with each other.","- Retail leadership depends on paid time-off alone to create work-life balance, which effectively does not exist for Branch Manager, Branch Community Manager, District Manager and Area Manager roles. 
- All levels of retail leadership appear to depend too strongly on retail blitzes/sales focuses, exposing the company to reputational, compliance and financial risk. It deviates significantly from the corporate culture and creates a sense of duality in the colleague that is nearly impossible to manage to.
- Colleague turnover always falls on the Branch Manager: When a teller/banker quits, the BM is now a teller or banker and bankers take on overtime.  When a BM quits, another BM runs multiple offices.  Turnover is never felt by DMs or RAMs outside of increased talent acquisition activities.
- Relationship Banker and Personal Banker goal levels align poorly to BM/CM/DM/RAM goals.

Huntington has been in great communication with me since I went back to school.","My team was great to be on, but not all teams/managers are like this. I met some managers I would not want to work for. Another con is the compensation and benefits. The benefits at Huntington are steadily declining in just the year I've been here. In addition, their salaries do not make up for the poor benefits. The salaries are often well-below the Columbus market and Huntington regularly gets ""raided"" by other local companies that can sometimes offer $20,000 more.

And its really hard to defend the company for something you know isnt right. The direct supervisor was terrible. The last two weeks of my employment was filler with my fellow tellers begging me to go to the hire ups about her. Turns out yelling, cussing, and sending nasty emails doesnt get a good reaction from people. You get barked at about customer service from people that sit around and chit chat in a office with a window to the lobby where they can see the customers in a line out the door. Dont bother using the inter office instant messaging to ask for help because it will be ignored. They expect one person to run three lanes of drive through traffic by themselves and offer credit cards to each person. It doesnt matter if someone has already waited in line for 15 minutes you still have to try to talk them into a new product. And they try to trick people into it. You cant ask when can someone contact you. You have to say they are contacting you at this time. That way they cannot say no. The supervisors change rules to meet what suits them at that moment. There is no consistency what so ever. They give you a very small clothes allowance and anything extra you have to pay for out of pocket. One sweater is 50 dollars. And then you have to give them back when you leave. The teller supervisor will sit at a desk moving her mouse around on a blank screen rather than helping anyone. Ridiculous sales goals. You have to get two referrals a day or you have to stay past business hours and call people until you get them. And even if you do and the person you close with doesnt you still have to stay.

Treats employees as good or better than competitors ( but that may be starting to change)","Reorganization of channels seems very disorganized with little if any transparency or benefit to front line employees and lower level management. The customer focus and doing the right thing which has been responsible in great part for Huntingtons growth and prosperity in recent years is gradually giving way to focus on maximizing short term revenue from customers without regard to their best interest. This is being driven by extremely aggressive raising of sales goals, at least in the retail sector. Extraordinary effort is required of bankers to achieve the new goals and many will fail. The in-store channel ( Giant Eagle) has been particularly hard hit with goals being raised for branches and bankers by almost double with no change in the market. There is a wave of people bailing out of this channel due to the changes and what they see as a channel that no longer a place for opportunity, recognition and advancement."

As of January 2016, alot has changed with the bank. More in-store bankers are quitting and finding better paid banker positions with other banks. The hours are ridiculous, Mon-Fri 9-8, Saturday 9-5, Sunday 11-4, (with working most holidays while traditional branches are closed). Goals have doubled this year, without increasing product value making it harder to meet to get paid out with incentives.  Very high turnover rate, not much of a job security if you ask me. 
In-store Bankers are looked down on by traditional branches. Traditional bankers are spoon fed by the teller referrals, which makes it easy to meet goal."

There was no work-life balance. Huntington was very harsh on sick time/pto. They didn't care if you had medical issues; you would get no sick pay or medical leave (besides fmla), just points which can get you terminated quickly.

Broken is the new successful.","Majority of IT management is from Chase.  Chase isn't known as a great place to work in Columbus - guess how it is to work at Huntington now.  Innovation is hunted down and killed.  And Innovators are driven out of the company.

Few highly skilled developers.  Huntington IT is sort of an elephant graveyard - where careers go when they are ready to die.

Some areas perform well - Architecture comes to mind.  Many perform poorly and that seems to be acceptable.  The information management group is probably the least skilled and appears to be a dreadful place to work - poor leadership, bad tool selection, runs by the ""just rig it and make it work"" principle.

Huntington made an effort to take our .NET development area 'Agile'.  But the organization couldn't understand something that wasn't command and control and most of the truly talented left for other, more progressive organizations.  Twelve month 'Projects' that last for 3, 4, or 5 years and never finish are the norm for any major development efforts.  It seems that instead of changing the burnt out light bulbs, Huntington IT is more comfortable declaring darkness the acceptable standard and patting themselves on the back for a successful implementation of Darkness 1.0

One of my managers left, the person who replaced him quit five months into her job, one of my colleagues got fired and the ""temporary"" group head accepted the role permanently, creating more of a sense of uncertainty and instability for the team. The group head had never managed a team, nor had she had experience in one of the main fields of the position. It was a mismatch through and through and affected the team in a negative way.

He and his ""plans"" have done nothing to further the position of his shareholders and infact has demolished what was once a wonderful place to work.  He needs to admit to himself that he doesn't know how to make real revenue and that expense cutting is not the way to pull the wool over the eyes of Wall Street.

Huntington's products are great and there is a genuine feel that the company truly believes in looking out for their customers. Same can not be said for most of the other larger banks.","Turnover on the retail side is pretty bad and it isn't hard to see why. Huntington does not seem to be concerned with retaining talent. Rather then putting resources into retaining top talent, Huntington makes great efforts to increase their market share, regardless of the cost. Merit increases in retail are scarce, while the management's stance is that employees should focus on selling more and relying on incentive payouts.  The biggest problem with this is that incentive payout opportunities decrease on the bi-yearly basis, while goals and expectations keep going up. Additionally, there is a lack of focus on professional development of employees and a huge lack of promotional opportunities. Huntington tends to give preference to hiring candidates from outside, rather than promoting from within."

They force you to call customers constantly, if they don't call you back call them again and again.  You start to feel like a stalker.   District managers are ridiculous.

Upper management has no clue what they are doing.  They seem to put bandages on the problems rather than fix the problem.

The senior IT players are changing constantly, so there are, at least, short term opportunities to do something new or stake out a claim to things you'd like to work on.  

If you've previously worked at J.P. Morgan Chase, it's a definite plus as 6 of the top 7 positions in IT are from Chase and more ex-Chase employees arrive daily.

The compensation package is very good.  Especially the PTO package.  It's not unusual for HNB employees to have 28+ days off per year.  You can also purchase an additional 5 days of PTO time","IT is in a state of constant Chaos.  Since I've been there (October 2012 until April 2013 - date of this review):
1. The CIO left on an extended (6 month) medical leave
2. The interim CIO reorganized the IT department into a shared services model and started an ""Agile transformation""
3. Cubicles were taken down and open work spaces were created for large portions of IT
4. The CIO resigned/retired/something - he isn't there anymore
5. The interim CIO was let go
6. The new COO/CIO (from Chase) arrived and reorganized the IT department out of a shared services model into three core groups (Consumer, Commercial, and Corporate)
7. The new COO/CIO dislikes Agile, so everything is swinging back to a Waterfall approach
8. The cubicles that were taken down and going back up - just much, much smaller so we can pack more people into Easton
9. The Segment CIO's and Senior VP's have been shuffled around and/or fired

IT works (primarily) in Easton, and the parking situation is just silly - there are a couple hundred more people who need to park than parking spots.  Advice:  arrive early, don't leave for lunch

Work/Life balance is a huge issue at HNB - IT employees normally work 60+ hours per week. Late meetings, conference calls, and lots of uncompensated overtime are par for the course."

Shortly after, the branch was given a new team lead, personal banker and a branch manager. The team lead was a bully and would raise her voice at the employees on a regular basis. I went to the branch manager multiple times about it and how it made me very uncomfortable. She did nothing. She allowed the team lead to insult me in front of her and did nothing. I contacted HR. HR isn't on the employee's side. I was threatened for contacting HR and called into approximately 6 meetings with the branch manager and team lead after contacting HR. I was retaliated against and told that I wasn't allowed to call HR. Ultimately, I quit because of the bullying. HR stopped returning my calls after I started getting called into ""meetings"". I tried to call the HR rep about a dozen times during my last week of employment to no avail. Huntington does not care about it's employees and the customers are well aware of that.

Too little promotion from within - many managers are coming over from Chase and they're bringing friends along and creating various sub-cultures that are not compatible with Huntington's stated values.
Some of HR has been out-sourced.  What's left of non-out-sourced HR is spread incredibly thin, so it becomes easy for management to participate in bullying behaviors that will never be addressed as HR can only take time to address actual legal or regulatory violation.
Training beyond regulatory requirements and very basic skills will be nonexistent in most areas.  Most of the time, that training will be computer-based.  Some managers will actually provide colleagues with answer-keys to get colleagues back to work ""faster"" instead of stressing the importance of learning materials.
Colleagues are given internal policies to follow that are not consistent with external commercials and branding that are presented to customers, which puts individuals at odds.  Mangers are then able to override colleagues, further alienating the customer/colleague relationship."

Nice benefits and PTO, but it's just a job - not someplace to vision a career of growth. I hear their Retail products are great, although they are lacking in Commercial product solutions.","- They stopped promoting from within because they wanted ""outside"" talent, which makes it hard to be devoted to the company. 
- They hired so many layers of management that they were completely out of touch with the customer. 
- They stopped Michigan from being able to use their expertise (when MI's customer wanted the local touch), and wanted all work flow to go to Columbus. 
- Sales goals were obscene, impossible to reach, and punishable. 
- Sadly enough, management used terror to prevent people from voicing complaints, suggestions, or comments of any kind [at the beginning of meetings they started announcing ""We will not be taking comments or questions!]. 
- There were so many layers of mgmt that they made it clear that if it you didn't fit it with their new rule you were easily replaceable.

1838,,Great place to work if you are a mindless sales robot,2011-08-22,2.0,,"Great benefits package, great new branding, offering a lot of services unique to Huntington.","This company only truly values it's sales associates. Tellers are told that they are the face of Huntington and the branches wouldn't function without them, yet they are paid as little as possible and treated by far the worst. Tellers are literally not allowed to sit down at all while working. Often times they will work with days off and no lunch breaks on top of that. There is very little consideration given to how hard the tellers really work to keep the office going. Unrealistic sales goals, both on teller and platform. Pay raises are miniscual, if not non-existent. Employees basically have to sell at all costs."
1839,,I wouldn't reccommend that anybody work for Huntington.,2011-08-19,1.0,Teller,They have good insurance to offer.,They are rude. HR doesn't care about you. They have secret rules in their guidlines book that state they can fire you for NO reason. They don't respect their employees. They won't help you to better yourself and work your way up because they are all threatened they will lose their job because you'll take theirs. They have nothing but dissatisfied customers and ridiculous accounts that constantly have errors and problems occuring.
