Sexist- do not consider women employees anywhere
I literally went through mental trauma because of my reporting manager!
Though my team & work profile was good but there wasn’t any growth opportunities & the senior management & our Manager hardly cared about it! Our manager used to literally treat us like slaves coz no respect was given to us. & even after 7-8members of the team reported this wrong behavior of our manager to the senior management they did not care at all to take actions against our manager. Because of the pathetic culture i quit! Coz i literally felt it was better to be unemployed in this pandemic than to work under some1 who gives a mental torture 24*7."

409,ICICI Securities,experience at icici securities,2020-04-10,3.0,Wealth Manager,"Flexibility 
Good bosses not seniors","not even a single saturday off
highly target oriented job (insane for senior roles)
growth is restricted i.e you cannot expect a profile change within the company
pay not good in first year"
410,ICICI Securities,"If you are a human being, you should not work here",2020-03-28,1.0,Equity Advisor,"NONE for ICICI Securities.
For the job role as Equity Advisor:
1) You get knowledge of the stock market and equity, derivatives and MF products first hand
2) You understand the value of investing","1) Orthodox work culture- My boss specifically asked me to call everyone by Sir/Ma'am. Very vertical organisation, upper management is not approachable, pathetic infrastructure
2) Inhuman treatment to new joinees and freshers- To visit my father who had a heart attack, I got an unpaid leave even though i had many leaves. Have to come to work on saturdays and you will not get any pay for overtime. the seniors try to get the work done by their freshers. freshers are forced to come to work even on public holidays.  I was forced to come on Diwali, i did not though. 
3) Biased HR- the HR policies of the company is like a dictatorship regime. Strict and biased against the freshers and very complacent for the seniors. It is very easy to manipulate HR. The HR will not tend to your needs as an employee.
4) the role of equity advisor is just a fancy term it is just telesales. the targets are completely unrealistic. 
5) no perks- on diwali, they took Rs 200 from us and then fed us cold biryani and rock hard gulab jamun and decorated the office with paper craft thats all. 
No parties ever. DO NOT WORK FOR THIS COMPANY IF YOU WANT TO DO SOMETHING IN FINANCE. This company is just a glamorous telecalling company. Pathetic management, pathetic seniors.
6) no work life balance- you are expected to come in at 8:30 in the morning and go at 8 pm in the night and then do almost full day on saturdays as well WITHOUT ANY PAY. they dont care about your personal life and your personal things.
6)  no growth- after 5 years you might have a better package of 8-9 lakhs if you work day and night but you cannot afford a very swanky life with it. and even if you become the regional head, you still have to deal with stupid people on call who dont have any manners and they literally insult you on call."

ICICI securities offer employees both Learning, Assignments to manage & Salary correction over the period of time, off course you need to be above average talent for organization if you want yourself to be on track.

Above average talent means you are critical resource in given job role & gained sufficient ability to manage it.

I personally feel people suffer when they want their career in combination of ""Highest Benefit + Lowest pressure"", We forget that in professional career, specially in today's world both don't go that way - It actually directly proposionate  to kind of efforts required in given role. Eg. Sales, it requires highest level of efforts hence deserve and offer remuneration & growth accordingly where a backend/operations/Just basic finance job will offer Low rumenaration/growth Including learnings.

When I see people writing against their job role than mostly reasons are they don't have understanding on above shared formula & they want things to go as per their convenience which don't happen in life.",You just need to OWN your job as a self business to eliminate this category in professional career because than you will see things working in favour of you  hence YOU are HAPPY PROFESSIONAL always.
