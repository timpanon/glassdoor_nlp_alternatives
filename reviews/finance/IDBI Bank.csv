Lots of work pressure till 8.30 even if you get placed in a semi-urban area and 9.15 PM if in metros or a state capital. Managers and RH's are hypocrites and all they care and scare(others) about loans , CASA and tracking them. The BH's are liars and they keep pressurizing the newcomers and there's no Bhaichara among employees. They ask you to come to the office at 9 AM and there's no closing time as such. And there're dramas on Life Insurance an'd others that an employee has to go through. See, if u r posted at a pathetic rural or semi-urban place no one will show interest to take an LI and tell that to your manager and he'll say it's ur fault. No holidays like the state govt or central govt employees get. And the biggest lacuna is that u will never get the right path to choose from ur colleagues to follow if needed some help in something bank and system related.
