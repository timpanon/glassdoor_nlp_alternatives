0,IG Wealth Management,Good Compliance Opportunity,2022-04-09,4.0,"Manager, Compliance","Salary is reasonable, work-life balance is very good, up to 5 weeks vacation, 10 health/wellness days per year, ability to work remotely some of the time (hybrid), strong leadership team, high level of autonomy in role.  Our team is at the forefront of decentralized/virtual work arrangements within IG.","At entity level, excessive focus on DEI.  Sometimes behaves more like an activist organization than a for-profit corporation.  Very SJW/politically correct/woke culture.
Very siloed, tough to engage with colleagues up/down, across organization
Favours on-site employees who work in corporate offices vs those who work in regional/remote with respect to job postings/promotions.  Was more courageous/open to alternate work arrangement during peak COVID than now, overly concerned about where employees work, demonstrates an old-fashioned approach to workplace (at entity level, immediate dept is far better)."

13,IG Wealth Management,Dishonest management,2022-03-13,1.0,Associate Advisor,"Nice location 

Close to many amenities","Note: This review is for North Vancouver location (1200 Lonsdale Ave)

They first get you to take a test to see if you are suitable for the position. There’s nothing wrong with that. The manager determined that based on my test result I would be better suited for an associate advisor role, supporting one of their advisers, not being one. 

He also said that before I start the job I had to sign up for the mutual fund course paying from my own pocket. He promised that if I pass the test I would have the job and they would help me get licensed. This was all verbal and nothing was written down. 

I paid over $600 for the course and I passed the test at first try. I started working with the advisor they appointment me to, who seemed like a very scatterbrained person. For the same reason working for her was extremely challenging and inconsistent. She seemed to be suffering from extremely low self-esteem and I felt like I was babysitting her or mothering her to make her feel confident. I simply felt terrible for her. Even though she was 20 years older than me. 

They never reimbursed me for the $600 that they forced me to pay. 

One day - about three weeks after I first started - that advisor  just burst into the office out of the blue, never said hello to anybody, sat in front of me and said she didn’t want me to work there anymore. It was mixed feelings for me. I was relieved not having to deal with her because she was extremely difficult to work with/for. But also came as a shock. When I asked why, she said she didn’t know she had to teach me her procedure. Hello! I’m not a mind reader! She has to tell me how she wants me to handle her affairs. Everyone is different. 

Anyway she never signed anything with me and told me that now that I have passed the test I could find jobs easier as if they actually did me a favor by forcing me to spend so much money. And I repeat that they never helped me get licensed!!! At that point they hadn’t even started the process to do so.

To be honest, when she dismissed me it felt like a big burden was removed from my back. 

I finally found a job a month later, but it was insurance related. Mentioning that I had passed the mutual fund course did absolutely nothing positive in my job search at all.

For the person considering joining their North Vancouver branch, I’m not asking you not to work for them. But keep your eyes open. Nothing that they promise may be true. They promise very easily and they never ever act on it. 

If they’re asking you to spend $600 of your own pocket, there is no reimbursement down the road."

20,IG Wealth Management,Admin,2022-03-03,1.0,Administrative Assistant,"The benefits package is quite good, hours were 9 to 430 mon to Thur and 9 to 4 Fri.","Training was not what I expected. I was given transactions to do on my 2nd day. With 0 prior experience in the field, I was expected to be able to pick up learning 2 different platforms, how to do transactions, and logging information within the first 3 weeks. The expectation was that I could do these by 3 months. The person training me had little time to sit with me and go through things until I understood as they were very busy. The online training is geared towards consultants and not the admin role until the last few modules of the course, which felt like a waste of time because I essentially didn't learn about how the systems operate until the end of the course. I was told that pay is weekly in my contract, and only learned that it was semi monthly after asking why I hadn't been paid after my first week. Overall, I feel that if they had trained me properly, I would have been able to get further ahead than I was."

34,IG Wealth Management,As soon as I find another opportunity I'm gone,2022-01-04,1.0,Financial Advisor,"There are pros to working here, not as many as it used to be. And honestly lately the pros of before aren't really here anymore. I will say you do get decent support from our head office, specifically financial planning support. Compliance seems to be very good too. The tools are slowly coming into place to protect your financial practice.","I suppose you can take what you want from this review. First, if you search glassdoor reviews, the majority of the 5 star reviews are either employees or management (VPs, Regional or Division Directors). A very small minority of the higher star reviews are from advisors who are working on the front lines everyday. That should tell you a lot. The new CEO is about the share price, and as such has made moves to cut back ground level support across the country. These cutbacks have occurred for a few years now, so its not all on the current CEO. The company seems to like Vice President and Senior Vice President titles as there seems to be a lot of management positions opening up. I truly feel the disconnect between management and advisors is probably the largest its been in years. Management in head office seems to treat their positions as jobs and have lost touch with the ground level. Its great to be in the ivory tower earning your salary, but advisors on the ground live the real world with clients. On a daily basis I find it challenging on most days to get timely answers to my questions from region level, or head office level. This has nothing to do with the personalities of management at region level and simply more of the fact that DDs and RDs seem less focused on consultants and more focused on head office wants and desires. Our technology has all the makings of being a great tool, but its so scattered right now across multiple platforms that it becomes a mess to understand at times. You would think I could easily bring up a list of clients who make monthly RRSP contributions, well it doesn't seem so easy and certainly not a click away from getting that information. But alas, maybe a VP position will be created to find a solution. I suspect our monthly technology fees will go up in 2022. I currently pay nearly $8000 a year for monthly technology support between myself and my assistant. And yes, if you want to survive at all, you need an assistant even if you're starting out, which is on your own dime (everything). I read a review on here from a VP suggesting industry leading compensation and benefits. That might be a half truth, I would question what industry leading benefits include, because the company cut back our benefit credits in the last few years which we would apply onto life, disability, dental and drug plans. The cost of those plans haven't gone down, but the benefit credits certainly have, so in essence it costs me more to get the same benefits as a few short years ago. Lots of talk, but a dwindling service experience all around from head office."

Perhaps quite disturbing, is the large number of VP and Senior VP positions that have been created recently. All of these positions undoubtedly come with high salaries (six figures), and lately it seems that the company is on a management hiring spree. This isn't necessarily a bad thing, but given the financial upfront cutbacks to mutual fund commission over the last several years, its becoming clear where that money is going and I can't say for certain if its to the benefit of advisors or clients. Specifically funding cuts at region level have seen our on the ground support decrease (admin staff), leaving those who remain to be overwhelmed. Additionally, very poor service levels at various departments in head office. Delays in processing seem fairly common.

They do have great training resources available but it is all self driven. 

If you go in with the mindset of doing everything on your own but having the resources to learn/ask around you, you will succeed. 

Nothing is given in this job. I compare it to professional athletes. You train, you practice and then go out and get at bats and hope you can hang/keep your spot. You can't control anything beyond that so that is a mindshift that is required. It's also the reason I like it though!"

163,IG Wealth Management,Saturated Market,2020-05-17,3.0,Consultant,Some industry leading experts in financial planning support. Attempting to catch up to the rest of the industry in terms of technology.,"Very saturated market in terms of number of consultants. In my City this has thinned out some book sizes and led to consultants leaving role as making a living now much more difficult with the overall cut backs to compensation. As an advisor there is a lot of overhead expenses, some you see, others you don't realize exist until you talk to other advisors in the industry and compare total expenses. It would be helpful if the company provides some sort of salary support for admin assistant as the only way to stay on top of IG Compliance is to have someone work with you.

Bottom line no one place is perfect but do your homework and make the best choice for your career. Some big asset advisors have left IG recently, when the big hitters leave that should raise a few tough questions.

Not all places are created equal. It should go without saying that you need to work hard to succeed, which is why I don't understand the reviews that suggest this is the only con to working at IG. That goes for everywhere. You have to decide if working in an entrepreneurial environment that caps you until you hit sales targets is the best option for you. You're essentially self employed but have to try to climb up the compensation ladder. That's the key, there are places out there where the ladder might be easier to climb. Be educated and be informed. Work hard yes, but also work smart and know what you should be paid as a professional planner."

199,IG Wealth Management,Stay away from IG,2020-02-29,1.0,Consultant,People are mostly supportive and friendly,"IG Wealth has really taken a turn for the worse over the past few years. Company routinely downloads costs onto consultants. Fees are still too high and performance is lacklustre at best. Compensation has been significantly reduced and bonus structures require consultants to jump through hoops to achieve. Even when we think we hit a bonus, IG finds ways not to pay the bonus. This leads to consultants not trusting the company and creates an adversarial relationship between the field and head office. Many consultants, including the biggest and most productive left the company. Many more are in the process of leaving also. 

Do your homework when reading reviews, and dig deeper. Company gets employees to write positive reviews to push down negative reviews. You can see most consultant reviews are negative but employees of the company are mostly positive. This is because they are being directed to post positive reviews to mislead people."

203,IG Wealth Management,Review from non-Management/Head Office,2020-02-03,1.0,Consultant,Industry leading Advanced Financial Planning team.  Compliance support is very good in an industry that's ever evolving.,"Company is implementing change, but can't keep up with said change.  If you're a consultant in this company, you've experienced significant financial cutbacks to compensation including but not limited to, reduced commissions, cutting of company matching program for retirement, reduced benefit credits which indirectly means reduced health benefits.  The response I typically hear is ""we're doing what everyone else in the industry is doing"".  That being said, why not be different and think outside of how the competition treats people.  The truth is in the last 4 to 5 years compensation and benefits have been dramatically reduced.  This can be painted in numerous ways, but the reality is a pay cut is a pay cut no matter how head office positions it.  So, that all said, if IG is doing what the rest of the industry is doing with regards to compensation, then I would suggest comparing the costs of doing business.  Unlike compensation, the cost of doing business at IG has increased (eg. computer subscriptions).  So reduced compensation and increased costs to work independently as a consultant.  What I haven't seen is a comparison to the industry on just how much it costs to work at other financial institutions such as TD Waterhouse or Scotia Wealth."

The culture is toxic and starts from the top down.   The division directors act like they care, they don’t.   People in your own office talk behind your back.   

The corporate level only looks out for themselves and the shareholders.   

Direction is to go into high net worth space and to forgot about others that invested with what is deemed small accounts.  

If you have under $50,000 stay away.   Number will be higher next year.   One day $250,000 won’t be enough to work with them.

242,IG Wealth Management,Would strongly not recommend. There are simply better options. 5 years at company.,2019-07-12,2.0,Consultant,"Strong financial planning principles. One of the best in this regard, in the industry.  Although many other brokerages such as TD, RBC and others now are adopting the same financial planning focus.

Freedom. Sink or swim. No-one is going to bother you. But if you don't perform or break a rule, I've seen 3/5 of the advisor base drop out in the last 2 years. 

If you are a top producer. Not the worst place to go, but the thing is why would you go to a middle of the pack firm. Just go to a big firm for the same feel but with a better platform and brand. Or go to a better boutique firm for more pay.","Management is stuck in the 90s. Technology is merely catching up, not innovating.  My simple advice is, if you want to be a wealth manager, go to a brokerage with a real tech and brand backing like TD or RBC. If you don't want the big corporate feel and value more freedom, go to a boutique firm somewhere in the suburbs or the city. IG is a boutique firm atmosphere. But they are trying to be like the bigger Toronto firms, with their pay structure and model. The problem is their branding and platform does not match.

Warning. Management is very friendly. But can be ruthless. Head office gets rid of advisors for many reasons, don't forget they are a cold corporation just like the banks, although they try to give off otherwise. 

The work environment. There are some great people at IG, just like any firm you would go to. But it's very old school. Management and specialists do not develop new planners, and  only focus on the top 10-20 percent of producers. They are what new tech founders laugh at.  No vision or long term plans, just focusing on the current quarter. The morale at the company on a whole has deteriorated over the 5 and a half years at the company. 

It was a great ride but the industry is changing, and IG is not."

- system is in stone age, most tasks are still paper based
- very stingy, they make you pay everything even for photocopy
- lack of training, consultant knowledge and experience very inconsistent
- not much support, regional office just helps organize useless trade shows, and you have to pay half just to attend, not a good place to prospect for clients
- IMPORTANT: The company terminates people without any prior notice, even though you are on commission 100%. I know a colleague who's in the middle of transferring some assets in, got terminated, gave back his computer; the company left him with some unpaid expenses as debt and never transferred over the computer lease properly, which he could've easily cover if he got paid for those assets transfer.
- Conclusion: Unless you are confident that you can, by yourself, figure out a good market to continuously prospect for high value clients with at least 250K investable assets or comprehensive insurance needs, this company will only lead you to a path of failure."

There are many, many pros for working as a financial planner with Investors Group.  For me the career has basically ticked off all of the boxes for what I want out of my work.  Helping others to achieve financial success has in return provided an exceptional life for me and my family.

What makes me most proud of my association with Investors Group is the focus on education, not just for clients but for consultants.  IG, to my knowledge, is the first firm in Canada to make acquiring the CFP designation mandatory for all consultants.  This shows a tremendous commitment to providing the right advice to clients and to ensuring we have the right people on the front line giving that advice.

I left a previous career making close to 6-figures with a great benefit package to jump into the unknown of starting a practice based on the potential of this opportunity.  I'm still here 9 years later and can say that my only regret was not making the leap sooner.  Not only has the career provided me with a level of income I'm happy with but there is no cap on what I can achieve and I've built equity in my practice at the same time.","It's an exceptionally demanding and challenging start up - building a client base from scratch.  Dealing with the ups and downs as you build your practice can be daunting.  It's not the right career for everyone but for the entrepreneurial-minded individual it can be a tremendous career choice.

The industry is going through immense change so the need to be flexible, nimble, responsive, etc. is a must.  Investors Group is a big boat... and sometimes it takes a while to change the direction you're heading.

There are low start up costs to be an independent business owner (Computer, licensing, personal marketing are some initial costs...). You receive excellent training that you don't event get in a university commerce program, as well as mentorship, trading platforms, and income support in the first 1-2 years. Management does a very good job of walking you through a financial planning case,  and case by case, as you grow. They will ensure you run a compliant practise, and that you are doing the right things to be successful and in your client's best interest. A good division director makes all the difference and there are many good ones.","You have to be ready to make a long term investment in your practise, which means that high salaries don't immediately materialize. You are not paid a base salary, so you have to get through the initial years while you build a client base. With hard work and focus, it can be very rewarding."

The same applies to our insurance platform. True independence is what will allow us to retain HNW clients and attract them to move from other institutions.

Our technology platforms and systems are outdated and make us seem archaic as a company. We need to get in touch with global and industry changes in technology and move to the forefront of innovation rather than dragging our heels in the past

The stabilization program for rookies is definitely a big plus","The stabilization program lasts for 2 years. It takes more than that to build a successful financial services practice.

The turnover for rookies is out of this world.

Success is not based 100% on meritocracy. There's lots of politics involved in order to get clients from senior consultants for example or more client leads from management.

In the hiring process, the consultant goes through a POP test in order to assess his chances of success @ IG and the type of management he needs to succeed. Not all DD takes that into consideration while coaching their rookie. They should."

There are no territory limits outside your licensing
Very supportive to continuing education","Training - the training is limited and the focus was bias based on the segment of business my trainer is most comfortable with.  It is fast - relies heavily on your ability to know what you don't know.

Compensation - other institutions offer base + commission, where IG  gives bonus based on minimum sales volume which is not easily attainable in your first year.
As well as you do not get even a minimum book to grow or leads to start your business IT IS TOTALLY FROM SCRATCH!

IG also charges for EVERYTHING including your computer software and every time you print a page, send a letter.  You are charged for the regions general advertising and are not provided any leads.

The only products that are ""in house"" are Investment products which means for all banking and insurance you are dealing with partners which adds layers to processing and complications in approval rates on lending.

Their is a culture of ""everyone is out for themselves"" and because you ""eat what you kill""  there is no motivation to spend time with peers learning and coaching when it does not provide income in anyway it only take time away from them growing their business.

I feel Investors Group hires anyone with a pulse putting the value on their warm list that they bring to the table instead of building their brand with reputation by working at reducing attrition.

I work with many Great people but I can say if you can just barely make it with Investors Group you can be a top performer ANYWHERE ELSE."

We do really good work for Canadians and we are proud of it. We have the best comprehensive plan in software in the industry and are working with security regulators to prepare for upcoming changes in legislation. 

Training is magnificent and each region office works as a team to support new Advisors.

Yes, finding new clients may be tricky but this is also in your control, and you knew that when you signed up.

Years ago IG was a company to aspire to work for but since about 2008 the only focus (and major income source) is hire anyone who sticks. It is really sad to see. It really isn`t even mgmt`s fault as RD or DD, it`s mandated from Head Office. It`s too bad your only income is if you push IG Funds, because if they would pay you to hold 3rd party funds like an independent or broker, they would have many more happy advisors (and more importantly, clients). Great place to start but get out by year 3-5 and grow a practice as an independent (like Valley Wide Financial).

668,IG Wealth Management,Associate Consultant Role,2015-10-02,5.0,Associate Consultant,I have been with Investors Group for over 5 years and working as an Associate Consultant for 4.5 years.  Working with a Senior Executive Financial Consultant and team has provided me with a first class financial planning education that could not be duplicated anywhere else.  Working on a team with experienced advisors has allowed me to develop my technical financial planning skills at an extremely fast pace.  I have been able to build relationships with fantastic clients while providing them with unparalleled financial advice and contribute to the success of the team that I work with.  It has truly been a rewarding career so far and I look forward to the opportunities the future holds.,Investors Group was slow to recognize the benefits of working in teams but that has been corrected and I feel like the future for advisory teams at IG is solid.
669,IG Wealth Management,"A life changing opportunity, for the right personality",2015-10-01,5.0,Recruitment Coordinator,"I would like to offer up a unique prospective from the standpoint of a Recruitment Coordinator here at IG. I have worked as a recruiter in many different roles and many different capacities both in Not-for-Profit and For-Profit areas, so I've seen my share of various work culture environments. 

The support and mentorship you receive is second to none at Investors Group. The Directors really do want you to succeed both as a new consultant and moving forward as a Senior Advisor. They do this by providing you with exceptional industry leading training and continuous professional development in the way of the CFP designation. The Certified Financial Planner designation is a global standard in financial planning and Investors Group pays for it in its entirety. Specialization and certification are becoming increasingly important in today's business professionals and IG is right there to support its consultants. 

Yes, this is a commission driven environment but with the newly develop income enhancement program and with over $75,000 in yearly bonuses available for 1st and 2nd year consultants, it's really hard not to succeed if you simply work hard and work closely with your Directors. 

There is a reason why we administer a personality profile to potential candidates. This profile assessment will typically tell us if someone is suited for an entrepreneurial environment. In many cases, many candidates are not prepared for this level of autonomy and self-direction. You just have to ask yourself, what organizational structure are you striving for long-term? If the answer is, the freedom and flexibility of being your own boss with a world class support system at your side, IG might be the right place for you. Want to punch a time clock and receive an average guaranteed salary? IG may not be right for you.","From a HR recruitment standpoint, there is a lot of overlap. Head office needs to implement a CRM system company wide so that candidates can be tracked and screened appropriately."
670,IG Wealth Management,Division Director,2015-10-01,4.0,Division Director,Professional development support is a solid collection of best practices from the industry.,"Non-unified management strategies.

Investors Group financial planning is the best in the industry, it's specialists are cream of the crop and it's technology keeps pace with demographic, socio-economic and statutory changes.","Requires a lot of hardwork, self-motivation and a clear vision to be successful.

I came straight out of an engineering position at a major aerospace firm in Toronto. I had no financial planning experience or natural market, and no idea of how to run a financial services practice. Investors Group took my desire to learn and turned it into the most rewarding experience of my life. They brought me through the finest training program in the business, helped me define my practice, taught me the skills I needed to be successful, and I nurtured me through every stage in my career from rookie to manager to senior consultant and now  Private Wealth Management.  Today I manage one of the largest books in the country and take care of clients who remind me every day just how important this company and I are to their well-being.

The Regional Director and Division Director were a great support system and this helped me to grow and learn. The training program was excellent, even the head office support is a great advantage to new consultants. What I enjoy most is that I have the ability to be creative and have the freedom to develop my own business. I realize that this may not be possible at another firm.

IG has a state of the art financial planning software and helps us build credibility with the clients.  

The best part, my flexible schedule allows me to have a good work/family balance.","My biggest concern when I started was financial security but I overcame this with hard work, focus and discipline.  Your earning potential is directly linked to how hard you want to work. Having a flexible schedule and independence can be difficult to manage.

689,IG Wealth Management,Times have changed. Investors Group hasn't.,2015-08-12,1.0,,Compensation can be good.  They have lots of money to pay the advisors cause they take too much from the clients.,"Company is only interested in selling their own inferior and high fee products.  This is not financial planning, it is aggressive sales.  Compensation is structured in a way to lock clients up for a seven year commitment (nobody else in the industry does this anymore).  Clients feel trapped.  Firms reputation is horrible and will continue to be bashed as more individuals become financially literate.  The company owns all the clients you bring in, which makes it very difficult to leave.  Almost all of the expenses are dumped on the advisor (most other firms pick up some of these costs)."

Of all the similar ""be your own boss"" business models, this one does offer bonuses to assist new hires.","Pyramid compensation scheme.  Unless you are well networked with wealthy acquaintances, the market is saturated and hard to break into.  There is a very low success rate of successful consultants.  Succession planning to manage your friends and family that become clients, should you choose to leave the company, is poor.  Awards and trophies based on numbers (how many people you call), not financial success.  Poor client care.  Their head office and bank often make mistakes and as a Consultant you have to be vigilant and proactive to ensure your clients are being taken care of."

Very similar tactics used by used car sales dealerships.","The products they sell are severely overpriced.

The road map and training provided in your years as a new consultant are unique in the industry. The focus on the financial planning ethic also stood out for me. My Division Director has your interests in mind as they help you with every case and situation you encounter and work with you to market yourself and build your business. 
As you are self employed, you are able to create your own schedule - which is important to me. I value my work life balance and this was not something I was willing to compromise.","It takes a leap of faith to go in to a variable compensation role.

The training was very repetitive. It soon became less informative and was more of a 60 minute ego boost for the top performers and Directors. Often times other Consultants were ridiculed during these meetings. 
There are MANY hidden costs associated with becoming a Consultant. 
The Directors are very egocentric and unprofessional. Many shouting matches were witnessed between Directors and Consultants.

Continuous training is offered within the company and managers concentrate their efforts in smaller teams that enable communication and a friendly work atmosphere.  
Their compensation and benefits system is very interesting. Something that you wouldn't have as a self employed person.
Growth in the company doesn't depend much on accumulating years and years of work experience, when a person is knowledgeable and shows stability and proved performance, she or he is able to advance in the company.","Being an entrepreneur needs a lot of discipline, patience and perseverance. You don't make money or get clients just by showing up at the office. You need to go out and look for your future clients which isn't easy for everyone.

If you have a desire to help otheres and get ahead personally, this is a wonderful career choice.","Really no cons, but can be very difficult to build a client base initially. It takes a determined person to put in the time and effort in the 1st few years in order to reap the rewards in later years."
770,IG Wealth Management,Commissioned Salesperson selling Terrible Products,2013-11-28,1.0,Consultant,"I'm going to try to be as balanced as possible with my review.  A financial advisor/consultant role with ANY organization is going to be 95% sales based.  Expect to prospect and sell from day 1.  You will be doing this until you have built up a book of business that generates residual income and client referrals.  At that point, you'll be able to focus more on planning/investments/client management.  This is how the industry works.  That being said, there is absolutely no reason why you should choose to work at IG.  

First, the positives I encountered:
-  You set your own sales targets; management allows you to work (or not work) autonomously.  
-  Work/Life balance is completely at your discretion.
-  Broad shelf of insurance products; can sell insurance from a number of major companies.  You could survive by selling only insurance, but if this is your goal, you would be paid much better as an insurance advisor at another organization.
-  Offices are reasonably well equipped.","The negatives are as follows:


Investments
-  100% commission based.  So at the beginning, you can only survive by selling DSC funds;  these funds lock clients funds into the organization for 7 years.  DSC is becoming a dirty word in the industry today and many people are choosing No-Load options instead.  
-  You do not get compensated on any 3rd party funds (commission or trailers).  Again, this forces you to sell IG funds if you expect to survive.
-  Trailing commissions are low, and will not sustain you until you have millions under management.
-  And to top it off, IG funds are HORRIBLE!  Terrible returns, inconsistent performance, some of the highest MERs in the industry.  Simply go on Morningstar and take a look at their offering.  
-  IG funds cannot be transfered out 'in-kind' (ie- held by another institution).  This means that the people who purchase DSC funds cannot transfer their funds to an advisor at another institution.  They must cash-out and pay a redemption fee if they choose to leave.  This is unlike most large firms in Canada.  


Insurance, Credit Products
-  Limited compensation on Insurance and Credit Products.  
-  Must work through regional ""specialist"".

Culture / General
-  IG has a terrible reputation within the industry and with the public.  Spend some time on Google and you'll see what I mean. 
-  Training is very poor.  While I know this will vary by location, my experience was not good.  Entirely sales and back-office processing based.  Forget any training on financial planning.
-  It seems like they will hire anyone to be a consultant.  This leads to tremendous turnover, which further erodes the company image.
-  Most Division Directors/Regional Directors are mainly concerned with recruiting.  This is how they generate their income.  More consultants working under them, means more potential revenue as they get a piece of everything a consultant sells.  This is similar to Primerica, World Source, and other quasi-MLM organizations.     
-  High cost to work there:  technology charges, E&O insurance premiums etc. are high by industry standards.

Honestly, I could go on, but I think I've made my point.  If you are serious about this type of career and understand the challenges and pitfalls, there are organizations that will allow you to build a successful practice.  As things stand today, IG is not one of them."

It takes at least average 2 to 3 months to close a deal from a cold call( if you are lucky to get one).

So If you are profiting from your relationship with your warm market. You will be fine, and even think this is best place to work.  Since you land those 800k account from your old uncle: your division director will be kissing you from head to toe (they just got 8k from you to get their ticket to mexico for a week). You have another thing coming:

When your warm market dries up and you have to get into the dirt with anyone else. You may feel it's too challenging since it was such easy win with the past deals. And once you stop the momentum, the management will think you are expendable (they got what they want: your relatives money and your relatives money only).

And worst of all. you will be repairing the relationship you have damage since your success was short lived. Your uncle's money is locked in for 7 years with super high management cost (MER) from little or no work from the company( the only manging cost is mainly from consultant's effort, not from the company)

So if you are a fresh grad. Treat it as it's a learning experience and DO NOT GET INTO DEBT(The company charges you $500+/month to work for them in office expense).

BECAREFUL OF WHO PUTS INVESTMENT WITH YOU, because those money can damage your relationship with your loved ones. (Or atleast it will create awkward moments in the chirstmas party) Once you leave the company, you have NO CONTROL WHATSOEVER TO WHO MANAGES YOUR BOOK. The director will like to your face on who you can choose to leave your book to. IT IS NOT TRUE.

If you are an experienced worker from the industry you might like this gig. As long as you have plenty CEO friends you can mooch off of with a game of golf and talk about old times. You are smart enough not to let the company take advantage of you. You take advantage of your friends and the company. $500/month is not a problem."

- develops your sales skills and forces you to come out of your shell if you're a shy person 
- very laid back work environment, since everyone is a self employed business owner 
- unlike the banks, they push consultants to consider the client and their needs first, and not push sales of certain products or sales in general
- it can be a very successful career for some, but definitely not for all
- 100% commission based - you get paid for how hard you work","- they sort of downplay the hardship of the job while highlighting the successful people in the company
- during initial training, interview process, they put a lot of emphasis on the successful individuals making 7 figure salaries and sets your expectations high, but unless you are very highly self motivated and are willing to put in the effort, what ends up happening will disappoint
- 100% commission based - you need to sell to get paid."

In that case it can become a well-paid and easy position.,"Unfortunately, there is little evidence of successful consultants who came without warm market or who didn't inherited their clients from other consultants. Also there's very little financial planning, most consultants sell 1 product for each of their client and those products are one of the most expensive on the market.

You pay for your own office space
They will tell you that on average people earn 100k.  It doesn't seem true.  The people I talked to who worked there for 8 years only gets on average 25 to 35k.  Too much PR protection online.  I believe that the financial industry in Canada in general is wrong... The reason why I say this is because it is a job where you pay to work.  The company loses nothing... It is a win-lose situation.  So as far as the company is concerned, they will hire anyone. With this in mind, it is hard to be proud of your job because anyone can be a financial adviser as long as your willing to pay the fees.  Although I have earned decent commission from acquiring clients(25k a year), I still have to convince myself that this is a respectable job.  This explains the high turnover rate."

- Need money to make money in this position
- Must pay monthly fees for this job of about $400-$500/month depending on your computer and other options
