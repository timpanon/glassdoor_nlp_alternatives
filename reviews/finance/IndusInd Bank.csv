Bonus is 1/4th of what you get in other Indian private banks. Cost cutting is so much that you are given absimal reimbursements for food, petrol, substandard hotels. Make sure you ask for joining bonus and ensure that you get your bonus amount written in your offer letter. Additionally also ensure that the profile of your boss is similar to yours otherwise you'll never get appreciated for your work. There's no 360 degree feedback system. Non tech people and non-finance people are put into fintech projects and there's allegedly illegal commission culture also at certain positions which was a shocker to me. Join at your own peril. Appraisal process is purposely done from August to August so that you get deprived of getting considered for appraisal when you join next company."

1211,IndusInd Bank,IndusInd - Hell on Earth!,2016-10-26,1.0,Senior Relationship Manager,"While I am a seasoned professional who has got extensive work experience, I cannot think of a Positive Reason to work here. The worst part is that they make you sell Insurance whether you are in their Select Team or in their Exclusive Team. 

The only good thing is that they give you a designation as a Partner, although it doesn't mean anything.","Those who are keen on joining IndusInd  should first go through these points before making a decision. 

1. A lot of false promises, misinformation and lies are sold to candidates during the interview. A rosy picture is given. On joining the bank, you understand that it takes more than 2 months to get your issued laptop. As a Senior RM, you don't have a place to sit. There is no clarity on branch allotment. There is nothing right with this place. And you get paid peanuts for going through this own personal hell.  

2. The client book given to you does not have purity. Anyone from across the bank can pitch to any client. The only exception are those few RMs who are close to senior management and no one is allowed to touch their clientele. Unlike the bigger better banks, this one is a den of unprofessional conduct and lies. If you are a perfomer, they will extract and extract some more with the promises of bonuses and awards. Most of these either never come or they come with a huge delay. The reason for this is that their Select and Exclusive Teams have the highest attrition rates in the industry. Delaying incentives prevents people from leaving the organization in a hurry and allows the bank to extract some more.  

3. If you are in a habit of listening to street swear words and unparliamentary language gets you a kick then this is the bank for you. Everyone from the Zonal Head are case studies in Narcissism. Some of them need psychiatric help. Mind you no support will be given to you - even your laptop wont come on time, but there will be pressure to bring revenue. The day you bring your clients from your previous workplace everyone in the bank pounces on them to get business. As mentioned earlier - no purity of book and no ethics. Everyone says that the CEO Mr, Sobti personally tells people to work in this manner. 

4. Let me give you a small statistic. Of the 10 people who joined this place, 8 left in the first three months and most people would not remain beyond six months. If you are joining the bank you will notice that besides the senior people, the entire RM Team vintage will never be beyond 6 months. The credit goes to the environment in the bank and the resultant high attrition."

There is no professionalism, h r team is helpless. 

If u dont sale life insurance, health insurance, CASA, credit card, u ll be asked to go to head office to meet your zonal head daily after finishing all your operations work ( i.e., at 9 a.m u should be at branch to open the cash and sit in cash transaction counter at 9.30 n work begins from then, do all cash , non cash transactions, maintain proper registers, reconcile cash, reconcile atm, handle lockers, as well properly handle auditing things till 6 to 7 pm without proper lunch brake ) as well need to do sales.if u dont do sales, u ll b asked to go n meet zonal head after ur working hours to hear worst slang abusing language from that fellow irrespective of u r male r female. There is no public holidays, no sundays saturdays for these ppl. they treat employees like labours.

They r not paying fresh candidates for 3 - 6 months by saying silly reasons, so once i thought of  complaining labour court. Actual reason for Why they r not paying new comers is, by seeing this worst bank, they wont stay back, they work for 2 months n take 2 months salary, dont resign also, they are walking out from this bank without serving notice period. so its a loss to the co. The attrition rate is 500% out of 100%.

They are following short cuts to sell their products, n which is not legal. so anybody can complain RBI by keeping evidences.

They are harrasing employees in many ways, like by abusing, by asking to stay back unnecessarily, by not giving leaves if u have not done any sales, and even public offs,saturdays n saundays.

Everyday will be a big day of selling one r the other insurance products, n even if u reach your target, u wont get rewards which was promised by bank.

If u have not done sales, u ll be asked to quite the job. if u dont quite, u ll be harrassed to quite the job.

If u dont sell, u have to sign ur policies, means every month on month u have to take or purchase your own policy.

except top management, nobody ll give positive opinion about this bank.

except top level employees,nobody can survive in this bank more than 6 months to 1 year.

If someone is working in that bank for more than 1 year .. then either he is extraordinarily good at sales, or he ll be a god or its his necessity to lead life.

Branch manager ll resign frequently, n will see new BM for every 6 months, n customers ll be shocked as well as shaked by seeing 2-3 new BM'S in a year.

Being a lady, it was a worst experience in my career life.

Its not a bank, its a hell.

PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE DONT JOIN AND SPOIL YOUR CAREER AND PERSONAL LIFE.

IMPORTANT NOTE : I DONT WANT TO GIVE EVEN ONE STAR ALSO TO THIS BANK."

They have a hobby to use extremely good talent as Guinea pigs just to try and test their stupid strategies, which they implement in creating a channel and than after 3 quarters they realize that it was a mistake and they shut it down..leaving you at a mercy of your own fate.
HR is just a mock ...which picks up a phone and always says"" we appreciate that you have approached us for your concerns and as of now we have no idea , but we will get back to you soon , on this"".
