5,,Negative Experience and Poor Leadership,2022-04-09,1.0,Marketing Director,Invesco moved into new offices in 2019.,"Over the past few years, the marketing team has gone through substantial changes and doesn't have a positive culture.  Unfortunately they don't treat minorities well and there is no room for growth.  On several occasions, minorities complained about their experiences and there was no action by leadership.  The organization and team talk about diversity but there is no plan in place to achieve their goal of improving diversity.  Also one of the leaders, was identified in lawsuit.  To learn about it, type in Invesco marketing lawsuit into Google.

There is close knit group of corporate communication and marketing leaders who do not value their employees.  

There is high turnover and the marketing leadership team only looks for people who enforce their ideas.  

If you are planning to apply, do your homework by reading other reviews.  Also take the time on LinkedIn to research the marketing team.   You will notice how posts don't talk about the culture but instead only take about products."

11,,"Horrible Clients, Good Coworkers.",2022-04-06,3.0,Client Services Representative,"Invesco isn't a horrible company to work for. Many of the management in Client Services seem to realize that working as a call center representative is a very mentally taxing and stressful position, so they make an effort to not make it worse. My direct supervisor, for example, made a point to not micro-manage us. The people you work with are all amazing, and a lot of them have been doing this a long time. They make themselves available for questions and there is also a mentor queue you can call when you are stuck on something. They also offer generous PTO (just don't think you'll be able to request off Jan-May as that is tax season).","This a financial institution, so when people are calling customer service, they're most likely having issues with their money and are therefore stressed out. Sometimes you have to deal with the most miserable, ridiculous people on Earth. It also doesn't help that some company policies are outdated and convoluted which seem to do nothing except make things more difficult for everyone involved. It's also annoying having to worry about your metrics and time management. It can be a very stressful job. Upper management also seems dead set on making everyone transition back to the office, which is contrary to what most people want."

Comp and benefits are low compared to industry (the health insurance is by far the worst I've had in a 15+ years career), they are constantly restructuring/firing people - in the past 10 years they have managed to fire substantial amounts of people and groups every year - causing everyone else to restructure and ""adapt"" only to have it happen again in 6 months. Senior leadership is absolutely clueless, they think they are doing such a great job but there are so many internal problems at this organization including the way teams interact and communicate with each other, silo's between groups, managers who don't know how to even manage themselves and end up micromanaging everything you do, and ZERO room for growth unless you are already at the top. By far one of the worst aspects is the internal systems that are used - you spend more time doing administrative/operational work rather than doing your own job.

184,,Unethical Treatment,2021-08-22,2.0,Management,There were no good attributes working for this company.,"This company does not need to hire into the management role until they rid themselves of the antiquated and outdated performance of their current management staff.

Many people in the team recently left as they realised they were simply here to support the investment risk team IRF(they haven't been told that when they joined).

217,,"Great Notch to your resumé, but that’s about it",2021-07-05,2.0,Client Service Representative,"Invesco took care of its employees during the Covid pandemic, I believe they plan on having WFH until this fall where they will then have a hybrid schedule,  speaking of schedules you will most likely have a 7:30-3:30pm schedule for training then a 9:30am to 6pm schedule until you get to submit a bid for their quarterly shift bid lottery which base times from 7am open to 6pm close, they pride themselves on inclusiveness and have internal networks based on what group you identify with however there are cons to this, lastly you have the chance for Internal promotions but there are cons to this as well. 

You get 20 Paid vacation days, 2 personal days, and 7-10 sick days a year. 10 vacation days roll forward to the next year if you didn’t use them. NYSE holidays off. 

Semi annual bonus: 1-16% of what you made in between those six months paid to you if you get any of the incentive categories. On top of that, an annual performance review where you can get a % increase in pay. 

This position is a foot in the door to a respectable Investment Company.","It’s asinine but Invesco has 3 call center departments, two are in Canada(PEI,Toronto) and one here in America (Houston), soon after working here if you ever have callers complain about service, it’s either usually about an employee who dropped the ball or a severe language barrier(9/10 it’s going to be the fault of the Canadian office for both because they’ll list “NOT TRAINED IN THIS” and let it slip) you’ll realize the Houston office is the best. 

Second, your supervisor and Team Lead will either make your time here great or they will make it horrible, in my case the last, you depend on these people for answers on unique situations and either they’re busy or not in due to other issues. You get a bonus depending on your call grades and Time Management, pretty straightforward and hopefully your Sup will communicate these figures with you rather than having you stuck in a suspense come pay time and then by that time to appeal it’s too late the deadline passed see you in 6months type of deal

Lastly, if you are a person who trades on their personal account(which you should if you considered finance)Be prepared to lose gains/profits due to Invescos horrible trading compliance policies: 60 day hold from date of purchase before you can sell for profit, and the annoying one making sure Invesco isn’t actively trading that same stock. MAKE SURE TO NOT REPORT YOUR ACCOUNTS because they don’t know about them if you didn’t tell them. It’s annoying because even after you held for 60 days you still may not be allowed to sell it until Complaince says it’s okay. YOU WILL NOT GET INSIDER TRADING INFO FROM CALLERS, WHY CLIENT SERVICES REPS ARE HELD TO THE SAME STANDARD AS TRADERS IS BEYOND ME. So in essence this policy will hurt your investment opportunities, you aren’t even allowed to trade under your significant others accounts if you work here without getting permission. 

Actually last, Internal promotions. If you aspire to stay a client services rep your whole life and make $40k -$50k that’s cool, but if you want to be more than that in the transfer agency good luck, PDP (client services department job post) postings are rare, and Invesco somehow thinks shipping jobs off to India will promote a “Superior Investment Experience” (their mission statement btw). If you want to move out of Client Services altogether, there is an internal job post website for Invesco. If you live in Houston though, the postings are rare once again for non IT careers like Finance/Accounting. You must prepare to move to Atlanta (their HQ), or NYC if you want finance careers here. Good luck if you have little experience other than being a CSR because they’ll probably pick an external applicant for D&I reasons if you don’t meet the goal. D&I is being a huge push with Invesco and that just has to do with being forced to do so from ATLs mayor."

GPS team is mostly in Toronto Canada and supports North America regions. 

During Canadian holidays, 2-3 employees are forced to work (They call it volunteering, but you don’t have a choice.) Canada shouldn’t be the main hub to support North American Regions. More resources should be allocated in Atlanta or NY. 

There is such thing as late shift for this team. To work until 8 PM Sunday - Thursday.  This should be given to the team located in Asia. 

So many useless meetings to attend with no agenda. 

I would not recommend working here. Management team needs a refresh for this whole group."

Work-life balance is better when compared to other firms in the industry. 

Career advancement and opportunities are there if you are willing to move to HQ in Atlanta. Houston also has some opportunities but department-specific.

Pay is above industry standard for back-office but average for middle office/corporate roles. 

Good 401k match ~ 6%

The company transitioned from 15 days PTO to unlimited PTO as of 2020. Pretty good for the industry, but lagging behind other industries such as technology.","For an organization that prides itself on culture, they have done quite a bit in the past 5 years to erode the sense of pride and loyalty that employees have for the firm, especially in Houston. To some, Invesco is just another company in the industry at this point.

Layoffs in the Houston office are now a normal occurrence. The former AIM Investments (before the merger with Invesco) familial culture has eroded. It is slowly being replaced with a generic corporate culture full of politics and passive aggressiveness. 

I would throughout research the department and location before committing to the firm. You want to make sure the department won't get moved to Atlanta and New York in the next decade."

543,,Once a great place...,2020-02-24,2.0,Anonymous Employee,"If I was asked this question 10 years ago, I would have had many 'pros' to list, but it is hard to come up with just one. 

- Benefits offered are okay for Charlottetown. 
- Work/Life was pretty good nearing the end of my tenure due to the department I was in. However, this is solely dependent on the department you are in and your manager.","- Non-Competitive Salary - PEI is a ""cost-savings centre"" that is what we were always told. If you're in PEI, don't expect a fair wage for the amount of work you're expected to complete. 
- Management does not listen to employees - they spent hours (and $$) implementing an employee feedback portal. Once implemented employees provided lots of ideas on how to improve the Canadian business, but senior leaders then started posting negative feedback within the portal for all employees to see. Ultimately the project was tossed without any follow-up or project implementations. *face-palm*
- VERY corporate - employees were once treated like family, but have since become just an employee number within a large organization. 
- Mass lay-offs are frequent but unreported - having been with this organization for over 10-years, I have seen many individuals laid-off, but don't expect to find any news articles stating such due to their severance agreements with former employees. 
- Call centre atmosphere - Invesco Charlottetown has always tried to steer clear from the term call centre, but when you hire employees fresh out of high school at a wage that is comparable to a call centre... it is what it is."

Your colleagues and business teams are very friendly and there's less political motives among most of the 'working populace' .,"I'm speaking on specifically my experience within the IT/Tech department. 

You are at the mercy of whomever the senior folks are on your project. Most of the senior managers are SME's within their duties but really have no business being a ""manager"". If you're lucky you'll have the aforementioned manager but there are a few that are just incompetent in their role and serve really no purpose to the firm or yourself, these are the ""lifers"", that the c-suite executives are desperately trying to trim with annual lay offs. Your middle managers don't take your goals/objectives meetings seriously and never think of the big picture (your potential career outside of Invesco). 

I'm actively looking to leave and don't regret joining but every single  external hire in the last 3 years is either considering leaving soon or has already left. The majority of teams are people from different teams transitioning or consultants they have kept on.  After about a week on the job you'll notice most of your project team are primarily consultants, whom are usually ""YES"" people which emboldens the incompetent leadership."

649,,Not a good place to work if you have a life outside of work,2019-06-11,2.0,Anonymous Employee,"The health insurance prices are the lowest I've ever had at any job but all the plans are high deductible. 

Free soda and gourmet coffee.","They are a very controlling company to work for. I've heard multiple supervisors make statements like ""get used to not leaving until WE say you can."" Or ""just because it's your shift end time doesn't mean you can leave. You leave when we release you."" They give you no notice of mandatory overtime. So you basically can't make any plans outside of work... and if you have children... all I can say is good luck! They will tell you right before you leave for the day that you're required to be at work the next day at 6am. Definitely not a good place to work if you have children.

Also, they're coming close to violating labor laws because they tell hourly employees that they start at a certain time, but tell you that you need to arrive 15 minutes before that time to login to all their systems and get your work area set up. Then at your start time you should already be pulling work, but they don't pay you for that extra time that they expect you to work. Even in training we were encouraged to come early, stay late, and work through our lunch breaks to complete required company online trainings, without pay.

When they're trying to get you in they tell you how the company is so great, how work life balance is ""wonderful"" because you supposedly only work 37.5 hours a week to make your full salary. They REALLY need to stop selling that story to potential candidates because they fail to tell you they expect you to be at work getting set up 15 minutes before your shift without pay and they don't tell you about all the constant mandatory overtime with no notice and if you're late even 1 time during training (even 5 minutes or so) they'll call you in a meeting with multiple members of management to explain why you were late. 

Don't expect to get many if any days off.  About the only time you'll get time off other than the required holidays (and some people are asked to work those too) is when you're sick. Pretty much any other request gets denied because they only allow like 2 people off at a time in the entire department (of over 100 people) regardless of your team or what function you're trained on. 

On the topic of training... don't get too comfortable or excited about quitting another job for this one because they don't tell you when you're hired that you have to get a certain score on multiple tests in order to actually pass training and KEEP the job. I saw multiple people lose the job for this reason. Depending on what trainer you get, you'll probably need to do lots of studying on your own for the info to make sense.

They brag so much about the ""work from home"" option when trying to hire you. But once you're hired they make sure to tell you don't get too excited about that either because they can pop up at your house whenever they want to see what you're doing/if you're working. Which is ridiculous because they can monitor your productivity anyway without showing up at your house.

Bottom line, unless you want to work for a company that treats you like a child with no rights, I wouldn't recommend this company."

666,,Invesco is chaotic and management lacks proper direction.,2019-04-24,2.0,Marketing,"There are many highly intelligent, dedicated and hardworking people at Invesco. The fund managers are dedicated and hold true to the core strategy beliefs associated with the products they manage. There are also many innovative thinkers and sales people who work hard to propel the company forward. The transfer agency is impressively managed to run very efficiently.  The health plan is very expensive to employees (very high deductible) but it very broad and covers more than you would expect in a company plan. The work/life benefits are good and the company also offers some work from home days each week in certain departments. Friday's are usually casual and employees wear jeans. This is repeated for the summer months as well. Most full time positions are 37.5 hours a week and the starting vacation allotment is 3 weeks and goes up a week every 5 years until you reach 5 weeks at the 10 year service mark. Employees also have the option to buy or sell a week if they choose. The 401k plan has a 6% match (5 year vesting) and IVZ will add around a 4-4.5% additional salary based allocation to it each year if feasible. There is also a ESPP for employees to buy IVZ stock at a discount and you can buy into any of the IVZ products without paying sales charges.","Sadly, growth at Invesco is not organic its acquired. Innovation at the firm is seriously lacking and the company as a whole follows trends more than leading the way. The company is also in the process of moving a lot of jobs away from Downers Grove and Houston so if you are applying  in these two cities be mindful that you may be asked to relocate or you could eventually be let go. As for the day to day issues, quite a few departments are run by senior leaders or managers that do not communicate and provide minimal training at best. They have extremely high expectations but rely on employees to figure out solutions on their own. Other groups that you work with are uncooperative and there is no sense that we are all on the same ""team"". A lot of the managers and employees prefer to avoid problematic issues and look negatively at those who want to resolve them. Invesco has lots of meetings and conference calls. They hold meeting after meeting and send out lengthy emails to tout how they provide clear information. However, none of those actually provide any real direction, expectations or actual information. At times its baffling.  Most senior leaders and the departments they cover (Marketing, Sales, various Distributor teams, Compliance and IT) have issues with favoritism which leads to a culture comprised of a core group of ""yes"" people who reject outside ideas and unexcepting of different cultures and backgrounds. This results in senior leaders/executives who are unaware of the many brilliant people who work for them and the value they add. The core group's unwillingness to listen to others also causes the company to miss out on unique ideas and shifting trends. There are good teams here as well as toxic ones that should be avoided or at least entered into carefully. Be mindful of that on any interview and pay close attention to the mannerisms of the people interviewing you. If you find that you take a job and you realize that you are on a toxic team the best thing to do is to start looking elsewhere."

You don't have to wait for the vacation days to accumulate, you basically get them all up front.
- Once you're clocked out, you don't have to worry about doing any ""work"" at home. Pretty nice work/life balance.","- Very low pay compared to other companies in the industry (I guess thats why they try to make it up with giving you so much time off). You're basically starting off making less than INTERNS. The company always boasts about performing so well and all the big bonuses are clearly only going to the higher ups who already make more than enough. 
- Management plays favors, lots of politics internally. You can basically get away with anything if you kiss up to your Supervisor or Director. Bad for those who aren't raised to act in that kind of behavior because there are some exceptionally qualified people who have been there for over 5-10 years that are still working in the same entry level position while there are others who just started 1-2 years ago and already getting promoted to management/other departments.  Pretty sad.
- Extremely micro-managed - If you want to be treated like you are in high school again, this position is for you. Supervisors and Team Leads are extremely power hungry and watch over everything you do from what time you clocked in/out, what time you take off for breaks, and how long you have been away from your desk. They will also call you out about it.
- Aside from your paycheck, don't expect the company to give you anything more.  They don't do anything to show appreciation to their employees even during the holidays."

792,,Beyond the glossy facade lies disappointment,2018-03-22,2.0,Anonymous Employee,"Nice campus in Henley.  There's a gym, GP, private healthcare, etc. – although these are actually fairly standard benefits within the industry. In fact, some benefits aren't as good as those offered by competitors.","This review is about the Henley campus. On the surface, the Henley campus looks like a nice place to work in, but it's a glossy facade. The company tries to portray itself in a certain light. However, you'll soon realise that many line managers don't stick to the script.

- Cliques abound - 
How you experience the company lies completely with the team/department you're working for. In the UK, some are alright but others are cliquey as hell. Some people are made to feel crap every single day and no one actually cares. The US office is more professional and less like a high school canteen.

- The 'managers' -
Some line managers have ridiculous expectations they themselves could never meet. You do good work and it's forgotten the following day. People who often end up in management positions are the ones who choose to do what they want to do, delegating the things they don't like to others. Whoever the more difficult tasks are delegated to often end up being the scapegoats for everything.

- Two-tier system -
Investment team members have special rights, whilst everyone else has to crawl around them. Some people have serious issues with their egos. They think they are better than others, and yet, the truth is they wouldn't be able to do the job of the very people they believe to be inferior to themselves.

- Secretive management -
Certain information is only sent to 'managers' (reinforcing that 'cliquey' vibe) that should be made more public, e.g. where competitors have posted these on their website, whilst other companies have sent such info to all employees. Why the secrecy?

- HR department -
There are some 'good guys' in HR. However, most of them just side with management whenever they can. Some HR representatives also have a bullying streak. They should keep their eye on the media more because recent global scandals have shone a bright light on the ineffectiveness of HR departments.

- Detached from London -
Henley comes close to the fictitious Stepford... once you're there, it's difficult to get out. You are detached from London and the wider financial industry, which makes moving to another company a headache.

There are more many, many more issues... but that would warrant a dissertation and not a mere Glassdoor review."

- Good work/life balance","- HR leadership team is stuck in old ways which has led to a very tactically-focused HR organization that unfortunately lacks forward thinking/strategic business partnership.  

- Lack of career opportunities in HR.  The HR function doesn't proactively manage talent as you would expect from an HR organization (especially given that HR is responsible for managing talent across the firm).  Instead, there is a mindset within HR that opportunities are only available when an incumbent leaves the department or organization.  Quite reactive.  This comment is specific to the HR function.

- Poor communication - the HR leadership team unfortunately does not understand the importance of cascading relevant information to their respective HR teams.   This becomes a major hindrance as HR employees are regularly relied on by the business leaders they support yet are not armed with pertinent information (nor are there other avenues for obtaining the information).

- Toxic environment within HR.  There are regular conversations by HR employees related to when certain personnel changes are going to be made.  Unfortunately, changes aren't taking place.  Most of the employees who are still in the department have been with the firm for 10+ years and unfortunately, have outdated skills/competencies and aren't as likely to find opportunities outside of Invesco.  The rest of the employees aren't there for long - usually a year or so."

Unprofessional management and toxic environment
Don't expect any support from your management, they just do politics and don't care about you, the company and the job
Don't expect to meet a lot of smart people in the business, they mostly just expect you to crawl in front of them and tell them that the impossible is possible
Heavy and inefficient process, on the paper it looks standard to big companies process but it is applied as if they were running a bakery
Overall, Henley has, by far, the worst results at yearly employees surveys, a lot of people are not happy there and try hard to move to another company"

E-ve-ry-thing is moving to India, contractors hired in perm positions are being laid off not even a year after. 
This company used to be the real deal, now its just a corporate meat eating grinder. Dont be suprised that because of all the friends politics that your colleague who just joined gets double the bonus as you do and earns 40k more.

I highly recommend Invesco for non IT careers. My ratings are only on the IT group.","The IT dept is controlled by a group of (mostly Texas A&M) ""Christians"". When they aren't praying, using business trips to India as an excuse for missionary work or passing judgement on everyone else, they work to stifle all innovation and waste millions of dollars on obsolete architecture projects.

This middle management mafia tells executive management that they have adopted Lean and Agile methods but it's a joke. Useless training classes and ridiculous Rapid Improvement Events are all that are offered. Any real attempts to execute Lean/Agile ideas are snuffed out and ""agile teams"" are not empowered to make decisions or realistically plan their work. The CI team seems to be a another scam that exists to show senior management they are ""innovative"". 

Anyone who attempts to introduce new ideas or push back on antiquated processes is labeled a trouble maker and ultimately these people leave in frustration. 

Women are second class citizens, a review of the org chart will show only a handful of women in management roles and absolutely zero women on the IT Leadership team."

They set you up for failure instead of coming up with a structured plan to help the employee develop. If you don't brown nose then you aren't getting anywhere in this company. Lots of office politics involved causing the environment to be very unprofessional. Pay is way below average and good luck getting a bonus as your overtime accrued throughout the year affects that.

-- Opportunity to earn NASD licenses and also obtain other industry-related training on soft skills and financial products and services
- Strong emphasis on having a good work/life balance. Entering employees start out with three weeks of vacation and can roll over 20 vacation days a year (at least when I was there). Also, at least when I was there, benefits were affordable with a large network of providers.
- A few good managers that are fair with raises and are able to mentor and give good advice to their associates","- Many politics and cliques in this company, which you'll notice after you've been there for at least six months. Behind all the smiling faces welcoming you to the company and telling you that you can always come to them for help is tremendous backstabbing and unprofessional behavior. Some departments honestly feel like high school all over again.
- Management always spends time talking of plans to help associates grow in their career paths, but for the most part, only care about themselves. Lots of talk, but not much real action. This isn't true for all managers, but probably the majority of them.
- Related to the above point, promotions are not very common here and are generally politically inclined. In other words, they're based more on favoritism instead of merit. If you ask for feedback as to why you didn't obtain a position, you'll usually receive an evasive generic response such as ""We found someone who was a better fit"".
- If you have a college degree from a second or first tier school, you'll be frustrated having to work with a good number of the managers here who are just high school, community college, or third/fourth tier college graduates. Their thinking process amongst management is outdated and inefficient, but many house inferiority complexes to their more intelligent associates. 
- The smart people who start working here leave after two to three years, obtaining needed experience and licenses, to get better paying jobs at other financial institutions or at Oil and gas companies. That leaves the  company with mediocre employees who later go on to become mediocre or below average managers. Get the picture?"

You realize the true atmosphere of your department when employees from outside of the department communicate what they see and hear.
For a multi billion dollar firm, having a high deductible health insurance plan as the only option is EXPENSIVE to the employee.

When the task isn't completed it's total blame game. The person who took up task at the end of the day feels as though he is fit for nothing. You are not given the work you like to do. You will be forced to do things which you are not interested. Basically it's a place where there is nothing much happening related to technology."

In most of the cases you work under global managers. But your fate will be decided by the local managers who even does not know what you are working on. As long as you obey and salute them you will be promoted and rewarded.
Some leads even does not have basic knowledge of what they are working. 
This is the place for persons who want to relax and enjoy the facilities (Gim, indoor sports, free snacks etc.,)
It is not the place for learning new technologies."

I felt that coworkers were collaborative in projects.,Internal jockying for limited promotions was frustrating. On the whole there was no clear path to promotion or advancement.

Although the reporting line goes directly under the global managers, local managers never consult the global managers and take their own decisions. Needless to mention that employees are least heard. All Administrative Support functions dont have their mouths and do what is asked to do by the local senior management - kind of slavery.

--Good management.
--Good benefits.
--Good employees.
--It's a good place to work if you want to be in the world of Finance.","Specifically in the Houston office, unless you are high up in investments, executive management or senior management, the company is not very generous with its pay/bonuses.  This is mostly due to the fact that the only major financial institutions in Houston are AIG and Invesco.  As such, since competition for highly skilled finance jobs are low, Invesco can pay highly skilled employees less.

Also, the bonus structure is designed to pick and choose which employees management want to reward.  When the bonus structure was explained to me, it sounded as complicated as the tax code.  With many companies, there is a flat percentage given to employees and another discretionary percentage depending on performance.  At Invesco, the entire bonus is relatively discretionary.  The company may do really well, but if management does not think that you performed very well, you may very well not make a bonus at all."
