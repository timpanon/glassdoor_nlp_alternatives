Convenient lack of clear job titles which is used against you in all engagements. All young talent inevitably leaves. Every second review here discusses poor pay. HR completely anti-employee and at best all they aim to do is ‘look into it and take these matters seriously.’ If you’re not in the select club, you are on your own no matter what you do.

By far the worst place I have ever worked.","The wealth management arm of Investec is stuck in the 1970s both in terms of technology and attitude. Salary is appalling for a London firm and bonuses/salary come out of the managers pockets which means most managers are reluctant to pay their assistants well. Equally there is little investment in improving infrastructure as it means less money in the investment managers pockets. Promotion to Investment Director is based on AUM and somehow that means new investment directors can suddenly manage people or a team without any prior experience or training. Studying for exams/ working hard is pointless unless it is convenient for your manager that you progress, which is unlikely as they rely on you to pick up the slack whilst they're out on 3 hour lunches. Nepotism is rife with fathers, sons, and uncles working on the same team and people are hired/promoted based on who they know rather than being right for the role/merit."

Lack of job titles equals flat opportunity to represent firm and not be pigeon-holed by a set role.
Excellent opportunities to run deals at a relatively junior level.
Great for the CV.","Conversely, lack of job titles equals no promotions, so difficult to argue you're doing a job above your pay-grade and get a corresponding bump.
Brand loyalty borders on obsession - naff corporate slogans all over the walls and endless internal presentations where misty-eyed tales of client service abound.
There are popular and unpopular departments and these are not linked to performance.  The former have unlimited budgets and senior buy in, the latter will be largely ignored.
Salaries c.25% below market, in part made up by slighter above averages bonuses (25-50% basic) at 'VP' level, but these can fall to zero in a bad year.
