Name on the resume - externally people still highly regard the name

You will test your mental health and resilience 

You will become accustomed to accepting peoples resignations","Even if you have decades of experience you will be treated like a child.

Jamie and his millionaire management keep all pay rises and bonuses to themselves. 

Technology is decades old.

Bureaucracy kills everything. 

Marcomms is the most inept department I’ve ever been apart of, it is lead by press for press. They constantly remind the wider team how busy and great they are and take the majority of promotions and pay/bonuses.

Micro-Management and bulling across the team/firm.

Loads of weekly meetings for absolutely no reason.

Promotions for failure, a manager had all their staff resign, they were subsequently promoted.

Constant back to work drive - they are not building a new HQ for you to sit at home, along with repeated attempts to coerce & force individuals to get vaccinated.

DE&I agenda actively discriminates against a large proportion of the firm.

Weekly emails to constantly remind you what to think and do, whilst management do as they please as long as targets are hit. It feels more like an adult play group than a workplace.

I can think of 23+ resignations off the top of my head within the last 2 years which is shocking given the pandemic, I’ve probably even forgot some.

The US office culture is horrific, management sit in offices looking down on the worker ants holed up in depressive cubicles. London office culture is better I believe although the US are doing their best to destroy it, it won’t be long until the best members of staff leave and its already started to happen."

Leadership is chosen solely based on performance which ignores a leaders ability to actually lead.   Performance metrics are antiquated and impossible to understand.

Morgan Wealth Management, Technology, Self Directed Investing specifically the work environment is one where women are few and planning resignations at a dramatically high rate for the number of women working here. The CTO and various male colleagues across ranks (definitely Executive Directors and Vice Presidents across the board) are verbally abusive to women, they don't listen to women and they act like when women bring up fact they are crazy or problematic. Facts don't matter here only what men in positions of power say and do.
You have no choice but to push back and when you do you are blamed for all of their pitfalls.
It is unhealthy and I do not recommend to any woman/womxn to work here. There are many great places as JPM is a great company. This is not it. 
Many women have left and are leaving. So as long as this is the culture it will not be a good place to work.
JPM is a great company and should not be defined by this one space. It has many women in positions of power and positions where they help , mold and cultivate others. Also many men outside of this group who are competent, intelligent, helpful and help others by upholding the code of conduct at the company. Overall an amazing place.

- Every 3 years you can re-qualify for the $1,100 work from home reimbursement to update your equipment
- Great experience and looks good on your resume
- Opportunity to grow within 2+ years of being in your position
- Generous vacation time
- Able to work in the Salesforce tower downtown","- No parking reimbursement which is expensive around downtown Indianapolis
- You don't qualify for tuition reimbursement or any sort of tuition help until after one year of being employed
- Vacation was limited in that you had 3 weeks worth as well as sick days but it had to be scheduled all at once well in advance (as if people are going to know when they're going to be sick) and that was only due to the manager choosing for it to be that way and not being able to take off on the same day as another teammate
- My manager ended up being a complete control freak, micromanager, and highly concerned with making her look good especially to the Vice President (her manager)
- Training was incredibly difficult as you're screen sharing with other people and the system lags a lot
- HUGH lack of diversity even though this corporation screams diversity and inclusion yet it only seems to be for show

No say in anything, they try to make you feel heard but it's just for show. You are micromanaged down to the millisecond; prepare to get to work at least 10 minutes early every day to make sure your ancient computer boots up fast enough for you to clock in on time. If you log in even a minute or two late more than a few times, prepare for a very uncomfortable conversation with your boss. They love to call everyone ""family"" which is manipulative. If you deny overtime, again, prepare for another uncomfortable conversation with your boss. Work, work, work, work, that's all this company knows. They are big enough that if you quit, retire or even die, they can fill your spot in a second. They do not care about you. Also, they do not care if you are being harassed or bullied by your coworkers, unless someone straight up hits you or inflicts some sort of physical pain unto you, HR doesn't care."

Good perks like private healthcare

Salary is good for graduates

If you are lucky you will get a good team that have interesting projects and/or good managers that don't take you for granted

They are building a nice new Glasgow office","Technology & Career Growth

Outdated technology and mundane programming tasks. Code quality is poor. Too many ‘Yes’ men push untested code into production on a regular basis to get things out quicker to impress management.

Absolutely no time or resources dedicated to training or personal growth. Any training you do get is minimal and you have to fight for it. If you are not diligent at spending time outside of work learning new technologies, you will be left behind. 

There is a lot of internal technology to keep people trapped in their jobs with no transferable skills. Avoid CIB and ‘Athena’ for this reason. 

Half the job is being on support or calls rather than coding. No concept of agile or proper programming practices. Those who have been at JP Morgan for a while are very stuck in their ways and refuse to try anything new. 

It is very hard to try anything new because of all the red tape. 

Compensation

Once you roll off the graduate scheme, your pay rises become minimal. Those who just completed the grad scheme are getting paid substantially more than associates who rolled off the grad scheme two years prior. As soon as you get promoted to associate, get yourself out of there! 

Record breaking profits in pandemic haven’t reached workers who have hardly had pay rise in 2 years (at least in Glasgow), yet CEO gets 9.5% pay rise this year.

Work Culture

Promotions based on box ticking rather than meaningful contributions. People who are the backbone of their team are often overlooked and management take them for granted. 

Many stay at JP Morgan for their whole career and focus too much on getting promoted (not their fault, the culture is rewarding the wrong behaviour) and playing politics rather than becoming better software engineers.

Forced return to the office despite majority of employees prefer working from home. They are expecting 3 days a week in the office for tech staff. I was forced to go back into the office for a day to ‘show face’ last year and there was 5 people on my floor in that day.. 

Toxic work culture and pressure to do longer hours and even weekend work. American colleagues answering emails at 4am and on their days off. Colleagues in India are expecting to work 12+ hours regularly and not appreciated at all. It is a depressing work environment.

‘Asked’ to work weekends with no compensation in terms of pay or time off with little notice. I had to work 12 days in a row a few times and was not given anything in return, and when I tried to ask for 2 days back I was told I could leave an hour early on the Friday.. 

Managers are not given enough training and it shows. I had a manager that told me that I had to stop leaving at 5pm and put in more hours if I wanted to be taken seriously, despite me having one of the highest work outputs on the team. He also made a lot of unprofessional comments about the diversity training that made me very uncomfortable."

1267,J.P. Morgan,Good company for early career,2022-01-17,3.0,Senior Associate,"Good company for fresh graduates to gain experience. The company's culture, diversity, inclusion is competitive in industry. The benefits are competitive as well.","The compensation is low comparing with competitors and it's hard to get a fair salary increase by moving internally. Top performer could also be the one who make least money in the team. The salary gap within the same team could be very large depending on your starting salary with the firm, internal vs. external employees, etc. For example, employees who start as Teller or Contractors who make $14/hour will be at the lowest range in 10 years if they later move into higher value corporate functions. One could make $60K vs. peers $120K, while performing better than others.

JPMC encourage mobility but it's not a real mobility. It's easy to move internally doing the same thing with little or no salary increase and no career advancements. The valuable and well-paid positions are highly competitive and a lot of these positions are external hires or Investment Banking positions (Hiring Ivy graduates). There is little or no chance for loyal internal employees who work in JPMC for 5 or 10 years. Even if experience and qualifications meet the job requirement, it could be harder than going to the moon.

The management has problems. When the team lost US employees, management hire offshore teams to re-fill. The offshore team is larger than US team in one of my roles in JPMC. 

The senior management needs to figure out where the budget was spent.
Management makes top money but some associate-level employees spent years with JPMC are not even making as much as entry-level employees.
Myself start with a ground level job in JPMC making as much as a cashier, when I move into higher value teams, my pay never go up that much to stay competitive with my peers or industry average, I am always the lowest range no matter where I move internally, even though my education and certifications, experience and work attitude are superior. The good reviews could mean nothing. I accepted a better external opportunity offer me 60% increase in salary. I also have a co-worker got his salary doubled. This is not rare at all. In my opinion, by no means this could happen."

You can only deploy to production during nighttime (regular overtime basically), and the process is quite manual too. You are also expected to provide production support on a rotational basis, even on a public holiday! With this you get to witness how fragile the various systems can be on production. Code quality is questionable, once in a while you'll see code without any unit test, and the original authors are all gone, nobody dares to touch those files. The codebase also has nonexistent or outdated documentation. Most importantly the compensation is peanut, which doesn't help improve the retention rate, the firm's strategy to this is to outsource more and more of the software development to cheaper regions."

1545,J.P. Morgan,Women first culture while Men get marginalised unless you bootlick,2021-12-17,2.0,Anonymous Employee,You are really just working for the brand name. The Compensation is not competitive.,"Increasingly you might realise the company has a “woman-first” culture. If there are two equally capable candidates who are top performers, the female will be promoted first. This is very prevalent in internal mobility situations as well where you might realise in the top jobs, female candidates only require to meet the minimum criteria for the role to be accepted while males will be required to overcompensate for the same role to be moved forward. This is only for Analyst/Associate positions which generally is very still very junior. If females were in this position, they would be complaining that there is no gender equality. On this end, there must be controls to protect both females and males equality chances and not just conforming to social pressures to blindly give opportunities and chances to female candidates first.

For males to succeed in the company you probably need to bootlick well and play politics right to get promoted. I had a co-worker who was really close to my manager, didn’t contribute anything to the BAU tasks but was promoted twice in 2 years. They were so close such that even the spouse were friends with him. Clearly the promotion came from favouritism perspective.

Pay is not competitive and the firm is not trying to keep you. You will realise this once you start going for interviews for the same role."

- The promotion process is completely broken.

However, Getting to 603 is incredibly hard. You need to get very important sponsors (ED, MD level) and they need to build your case in a very good way. You can find 602s coming out from college with 2 years of experience, but also people with 10-15 years experience, waiting to get a promotion.

1995,J.P. Morgan,Good Company,2021-11-05,5.0,Branch Manager,"Pay, benefits, bonus, opportunity,technology are all good. I want to be clear I think Chase is a great place to work.  The people are amazing, the culture is real. I'm just writing my honest review. I have leared so much in my role in only 3 years. Bonuses were good also between 18K-60K per year for BM.","This is a high sales job, always focused on selling products to clients. It's called the One Chase. Selling, Credit Cards, Investments, Home Lending. Branch staff has been cut over the years. Staffing depends on branch location, some branches have 3 people, while others have 5-9 people. 

Technology is changing in the branches about 90% of what we do in the branches can be done online or over the phone. With this increased changes banking will continue to become more digital. You will spend a lot of time on the phone calling and emailing clients. I would say opportunity depends on the location you work. Each location has One Chase Partners; however, they tend to focus on busier location compared to other locations. Your bankers will be hit or miss depending on the branch. Most of my time as BM was spent helping coach bankers, calling banker support, or doing operations work needed in the branch. Some days are slow, some are busy depends on the day of the week. Your bankers have to call about 60-100 people per week in addition to meetings. As mention you will spend a lot of time on the phone. 
The only reason I left was because I think banking is changing, everything will look different in the future. So much of our job can be done online. Promotions depend on your MD signing off. Some people get promoted multiple times a year while others have to wait. Market Directors need to be more visible in markets (Branches). Be consistent around treatment of all employees."
1996,J.P. Morgan,"Some Good People, some not so good people",2021-11-05,2.0,Transactions Specialist II,"Good starting hourly pay, decent benefits, easy overall work. You can just turn your brain most of the way off and listen to whatever you like on an appropriate MP3 player. Employment is about to be contingent on full vaccination, finally.","Constantly changing (not that change is bad mind, just is when the changes are bad in of themselves or prioritized badly), badly designed program used for keying. Management will constantly pretend that they care about your feedback. Weird hours (for now?), four ten hour work days or nights. Current (November 2021) expansion construction is disruptive."

Working conditions were deplorable. So many nurses quit because the temperature in the tent was 102 degrees most of the time and nurses were covered in extensive PPE and not allowed an air conditioner or a bottle of water, which made them sick and forced them to resign. The EOA did nothing to accommodate the nurses and in fact laughed at their requests, even though some were exposed to dangerous sun rays. This individual thought production was stealing her paper towels and nurses were degraded and forced to sign out paper towels. So absurd!! She was suspicious of everyone. Very difficult to be working around her. I have 2 degrees from UCLA and this was an all time low. I worked on movie set as a set nurse all the way back to 1970 and I was treated very well and paid very well .....things have changed with these EOAs. They need to return to school and learn about infection control and how to treat other human beings."

WFH half the time - should be less IMO.
Pay is alright and usually scales with cost of living. Once you're in, you're in and it can be a cushy job for many.
The 'fun' is really dependent on what you are doing, it's fintech so it can get ugly but it can also be super cool AI/ML.
You can get into some cloud projects as well.","Upper management is afraid to get their hands dirty. They push for things without telling the underlings their goal, nor get their feedback on the feasibility. They only understand the projects at a surface level.
 
Nobody helps each other or does the bare minimum. 

As a result I feel like Soviet Russia where people say ""everything is fine"" yet no progress is being made. There is a lot of obscurity between upper management and their engineers.

Health insurance pays literally nothing until you've met your deductible, and then only does reimbursement, so you're still paying out of pocket for everything up front. And then if you're lucky, Aetna will mail you a check. It's nearly impossible to keep track of what's owed where with how their insurance works. 
Managers have no idea what's going on. Go months at a time without coaching or development. 
Customers are generally upper-middle class and awful. Metric goals aren't clearly communicated and you're not given tools and training to be successful. 
There is an actual policy for how to handle a customer holding you hostage on the phone. 
Currently on a short-term disability leave and should be receiving 60% of my pay. But they can't figure it out so I'm actually receiving closed to 40% pay and missing pay for almost an entire pay cycle, after not being paid in 3 weeks. Last time, I went 5 weeks without being paid. They've also shorted me for 2+ months on shift differential. 
Largest bank in the world and they can't manage their finances for their employees. I imagine they're probably ripping off thousands of employees pay, and I bet it just slides under the radar."

My team became more productive during the 2020 work from home. And the 2021 kerfuffle and lack of planning only caused stress among the tech staff - dates/times for return to office changed on a whim. 

What really gets me is how management DOES NOT CARE about you. Many people rightfully complained that it is difficult to schedule their lives around a constantly changing return to office schedule. And instead of doing anything, there was a mass email basicallh saying 'thanks for complaining, deal with the stress and stop bothering us'.

Cultural stuff - I was on a line of business call with our leaders and found out the hard way that they really do not care about mental health or the LGBTQ+ community. I brought up the fact that several mental health conditions would cause people to struggle with a rotating office schedule and a fixed one would be better. I was hoping for either the fixed schedule or a recommendation to use an internal mental health source - at least lip service. Instead I was told that everyone has to deal with their own problems and find your own help. Took until after I put in my 2 week notice and were hemorrhaging tech talent till they actually gave people mental health resources to help transition out of the pandemic.

Also, if you are a contractor you are at best a second class citizen."

3393,J.P. Morgan,review PCA,2021-07-10,4.0,Private Client Advisor,The bank can be a great pipeline feeder depending on Bankers experience. In additional having the bank can be a huge plus for clients. Lots of autonomy to build out your day. Tremendous access to critical research and calls.,"Huge lack of sales training and prep for bankers new and old. This then leaves it to branch partners (HLA's, Advisors and business relationship managers) to teach sales training to Bankers. In addition many bankers are hired without really understanding that they are in a sales role which leads to confusion and comfortability and ultimately higher turnover.
Lastly, as much as having the bank as a plus for clients it can also be the reason you loose clients. If your clients are looking for local credit union flexibility you will not find it here."

Room for growth.
Large teams, so lots of expertise if you can find it.","The development environments available to do your job are by far the worst I have ever used in my life. You are denied basic permissions such as deleting desktop icons and everything you need to access is on internal resources that fail to load the first few times.

They started me off on a Windows 7 VM and eventually gave me a Windows 10 VM but in order to use the Windows 10 VM you had to open it through the Windows 7 VM... can't make this stuff up. The Win10 environment ended up being useless because, despite the sub company I work for being part of JPM Chase, it still has a separate domain that the new environment didn't have access to. So every dev on my team, set up this new environment just to find out it was not usable and go back to our derelict Win7 setups.

They force internal tooling on you for installing needed applications such as Postman and offer no support when things don't work. My helpdesk tickets are often auto-closed and tagged with comments completely irrelevant to the issue forcing me to re-open then. When a ticket it finally picked up by a person, weeks later, they usually also immediately close it and tell you that can't do anything about it.

All in all, it's astounding that anyone gets any work done in this environment and, truthfully, quite a number of the developers I work with don't. They are forever just reporting blockers at the daily scrum. So they through even more developers at the project who are, in turn, constantly working against the very tools we are handed to do the job."

3472,J.P. Morgan,Incredibly Toxic Working Environment. The Very Worst of American Corporate Culture,2021-07-04,1.0,Operations Associate,None at all if I’m brutally honest. Name on the CV I guess.,"Where to begin…The most toxic working environment I have ever worked in.

1: Very Hierarchical. People, especially newly promoted VPs like to broadcast their status in the pecking order. If you spend too long at Analyst or Associate (over 3 years) nobody will respect you.

2: Promotion process past Associate very opaque. If you’re stuck in certain roles, good luck getting promoted further as it won’t happen. Management want certain people to stay where they are as they can't be bothered to train people up to do their roles. Also, Management are unwilling to change the scope of roles to allow you to progress.

3: Talk a good game about mobility, but in reality, very difficult to move to a better role. Management often  refuse to engage in conversations about career development, if the desire for development takes you out of the area you are working in.

4: Very easy to get stuck in a dead end role and get pigeonholed.

5: Senior Management in Operations treat us like children.

6: Keep banging on about Diversity, Culture of Respect training etc, however this doesn’t filter down to individual teams. Personally seen so many examples of bullying, racist and xenophobic comments, ableism etc which in any normal company would lead the perpetrators to be sacked. Been on the receiving end of a number comments and actions that would be considered bullying. Was personally told by a previous manager not to escalate a number of incidents I was on the receiving end of to HR as ""there's a very high threshold for what the firm considers as workplace bullying""

7: Management favourites are protected. Double Standards seemed to be applied daily.

8: Incredibly Bureaucratic. Very onerous controls environment for no reason. Obsession with reducing costs

9: Pay progression is below market value. Can often experience a real terms pay cut if your salary increase is below rate of inflation. Pitiful bonuses in Operations which seem to get smaller and smaller every year.

10: Work-Life balance is for Management and Management favourites only.

11: Feels like the firm is rushing back to normal because the CEO doesn’t like work from home, and there are plenty of Middle Managers who love to micromanage and control their minions. Work from Home has arguably kept me at the firm for at least a year longer than I wanted. 

12: You are ostracised if you refuse to acquiesce to the culture and drink the “kool aid”.  Colleagues love to be nosey in your personal life and criticise you if you don’t follow their way to live your life. If you stand up to people like this here, they quickly become vindictive and encourage other people put in spurious complaints against you."

3893,J.P. Morgan,Young white men not welcome,2021-06-10,1.0,Vice President,"By the time you leave, you will have developed an unparalleled level of personal resilience due to the toxic management culture.

And if you don’t leave, you’ll be blissfully ignorant of your Stockholm Syndrome and buy into the subliminal message that you should be happy to work for the biggest bank in the world.","The Diversity and Inclusion narrative comes across as disingenuous. You have a bunch of white billionaires attempting to show that they understand what is actually going on in the world and simply react to the topic du jour. There is no real strategy, only action for the sake of saying something about a topic.

There is a constant barrage of US-focussed messaging that is disenfranchising for international colleagues and creates an obvious sense of “them and us”.

Operating Committee members are openly stating that they are giving their MDs targets linked to Diversity and Inclusion. This can be loosely translated to “quotas” based on racial and gender profiling. This effectively makes it a hostile environment for young white men and there have been many examples of people feeling forced to share their harrowing backgrounds and difficult stories in an attempt to fit into the narrative and prove that they’re not just some privileged white guy.

The general management style of ED+ is transactional and focussed on execution. A really good example of this comes from the very top: ""We want people back to work, and my view is that sometime in September, October it will look just like it did before,"" Dimon said at The Wall Street Journal CEO Council. ""And everyone is going to be happy with it, and yes, the commute, you know people don't like commuting, but so what.""

This general disdain for staff percolates through the executive, senior and middle management levels. Middle managers often demonstrates elements of coercive control and psychological abuse through a pattern of manipulative behaviours and exerting power over a direct report, often through intimidation or humiliation.

The culture, particularly with the CIB, is toxic. Narcissistic behaviour is encouraged and rewarded.

You will rapidly go from earning more than your peers to being the lowest earner in your peer group. The compensation practices are designed to align you to the prevailing rate of inflation, regardless of your performance. There is a huge amount of secrecy around pay band by title, but it is easy enough to discover. When you get promoted, you will be given the title but not the compensation and will spend the following years just trying to scrape into the lower end of the range."

There’s no way to work towards equal pay or treatment. It’s based of kissing butt and who you know, bad leadership is my main concern. Minorities get the low end of the leads and they’re targeted when the department needs to cut down on staff. It’s all about preference, they pick and choose, keep your mouth shut and hope managers like you. I’ve seen talented people get bullied and forced to resign.

- Like any company, it really depends on your location, your managers, and your colleagues. It's a roll of the dice. Some people have had a negative experience with their managers or the team that they're on. Personally, I like my team, the department I work in, and I enjoy my managers. 
- Flexible schedule. 5% 401K match. Good benefits. Good work life balance. Affordable insurance plans. Tuition reimbursement. Business casual dress code. Flexible with their tattoo policy.
- I feel like Chase has handled the COVID19 pandemic with ease, in my opinion. They've allowed us to work from home, kept us in the loop regarding any important updates, were understanding if we had computer issues, provided us with the necessary home equipment, provided us with extra sick time, and were overall really flexible.","- I started out as a phone agent in collections, and I was able to be promoted to a Real Time Analyst within a year. Perhaps I just got lucky. But over time, I've realized there is hardly any opportunity for promotions or career advancement. My suggestion would be to start out as a call center agent or any entry-level position, to at least get your foot in the door. Especially if you've just graduated high school or maybe need a decent recognizable brand on your resume. Since Chase is a large company, try and move up the corporate ladder if you're able to. 
- The biggest issue I have while working here, is the low pay. Despite having excellent annual reviews every year, management claims that I'm on the ""high end"" of the pay scale within my pay grade, and that I'm ineligible for a pay raise. But with Chase not offering any career advancement opportunities, I'm pigeonholed until I can find another job that pays more. So that's something to be mindful of.

Even if the individual has no related experience at all yet they can be made the manager of a team just because the boss would like to bring in their own people.

engineering excellency wont necessarily be rewarded as top priority for many managers is to keep a happy shop. 

not much technical growth but this might depend on teams.

project wise, little ownership for individuals. 2 reasons: 1. Singapore is not the dominant office . 2 bloated team structure."
4148,J.P. Morgan,Cheap Fishbowl,2021-05-30,2.0,Full Stack Developer,Salary paycheck and office is close to my residence now that we must return post pandemic.,"Worse than the new typical collaborative “open office environment” concept seen in similar corporate facilities. The Plano campus consist of the new theme to squeeze as many people as possible into a fishbowl. This is even more pronounced in the IT Developer areas.

The company offers medical coverage but there is a tier system in place so the more successful you have been with your career expect to be penalized with higher cost of coverage (socialism mentality).

I joined as a software engineer and began during the pandemic time working remote. No laptop or any type of WFH stipend offered. Expected to use your home personal equipment to work via VPN. Return to office and must work from a shared computer where you log into a desktop with personal credentials to identify yourself as the user. This is so they can move you around at moment’s notice and save the fee on laptops. Kind of cheap for a billion-dollar company!

Company invested a lot of money into these new facilities pre-pandemic so now is forced to reject the work-from-home or even hybrid concept to justify real estate investment and receive local and state tax incentives. Nothing to do with collaboration. That is an excuse. Call it for what it is! 

If your political views don't lean to the far left this might not be the right fit from a culture perspective."

The pay is pretty good (at least in San Francisco) and the benefits are pretty good. Three weeks of paid vacation and annual onsite health screenings and flu vaccines are a couple of examples. The people are welcoming and warm initially and if you fit into the “finance culture,” you’ll do great here. You could even walk away with a few friends and mentors like I was able to.","Lack of diversity is a huge issue in the industry and at JPM. The San Francisco office is supposed to be one of the most diverse and it still lacks greatly. Favoritism and popularity contests are rampant. Executive assistants are treated like waitstaff by many analysts and associates, even when the executives try to include them. The worst part is you can’t say anything about it because HR is useless. Turnover is high because people (not just executive assistants but at almost every level except top) are burnt-out and suppressing their true feeling in this environment. It’s exhausting to be in. It is a clique filled place to be. It’s also a huge company and assistants don’t bring in the money so you’re a number to them. Nothing more nothing less. Training is never really provided. You just get thrown in the deep end. hope your team is good to you."

There are systems that are used so frequently in the industry and no other company wants to take the time to train you in them. Their work life balance is terrible. They pay significantly lower than other companies and you’re expected to do so much more than your average loan processor. I had to train myself to do my job basically. Training is poor and they tell you “you won’t need to know that” about so many aspects of your job. When in reality they are putting you at a disadvantage . Their training is very poor. Again, this makes you a very undesirable candidate for other companies even with years and years of experience !! I think it’s strategic.

They do everything to show you that you are incompetent, are rude, sometimes will scream at you, not helpful, if you are in doubt and need them they will ask you counter questions that will leave you even more confused. Will point out every single mistake and ask why? I get it but when you're working on hundreds of loans a month there will some mistakes. Even when you are in your learning stage. This is not coaching, this is standing behind you with a stick. Which makes Job extremely stressful and that leads to mistakes. And complaining to higher up Management doesn't do anything, even if you can prove unprofessional behavior. How big of a hypocrite you have to be to treat your employees poorly but with other people around be super nice...
They are news of return to office circling around, which is very unsafe. Why would you want to wear a mask and risk another sickness because of doing so if you can satisfactory perform your job from the comfort of your home office. 
I will tell you, its because management its supporting micromanagement and they don't trust anyone which is very sad in such reputable company as JPMorgan Wealth Management is, and wants to be.
You will think because Wealth Management is designated for high profile clients the operations will be treated good. But unfortunately that will be a lie."

Most everyone was reasonable and good to work with. You must be a great problem-solver, be able to hunt down solutions across multiple business areas and be able to deal with lots of personalities, but this is simply required of all project managers.","There are often long hours and late or early morning hours due to international teams balancing time zone constraints.

4738,J.P. Morgan,JPMorgan Chase Mostly Cons and a few Pros,2021-05-04,2.0,Technology Services Manager,JPMorgan Chase offers great benefits. The health insurance and life insurance benefits are very good and the out of pocket expenses are very reasonable compared to other companies. They have a legal benefit that is very inexpensive and well worth it. It's nice to be able to have free checking and savings accounts for the whole family. I like the fact that the company is very ethnically diverse. The company always makes it a point to make sure that it's on the forefront of all the latest technology only for customer facing applications and systems.,"*The company has grown too large and is out of control with too much red tape and bureaucracy. 
--It takes too long to get anything approved and there are too many manager approval levels involved. 
*Senior managers are involved with approving menial expenses instead of spending time on more important issues and concerns. 
*The company is top heavy with far too many directors, managing directors and executives, and there are far too few employees to actually take care of business and do real work. 
*JPMC does at least 3 rounds of layoffs each year, and each time they layoff more mid level and entry level employees that do the work.
--Consequently, those employees that are left to do the work end up doing the job of 3 - 4 people. 
*Also, it's very important to note, that when they do the 3 rounds of layoffs each year, they target workers that are 55 years and older. 
--So while JPMC is constantly bragging to the media and to their employees that they champion diversity and inclusion and that they don't practice discrimination of any kind, they are clearly and openly discriminating against workers that are 55 years or older. 
*Global Technology Infrastructure is the worst line of business to work for because the company treats GTI as an expense. 
--If you're going to work for JPMC, it's best to work for one of the other lines of business such as Chase Investment Bank, Asset Wealth Management, Commercial Bank or Mortgage Banking. 
*JPMC makes internal applications and systems for employees their lowest priority, and it makes it very difficult to get work done. 
--In addition, JPMC has gotten rid of most of the help desks where employees could talk to someone to get help.
--Unfortunately, if you are having issues with an application or tool that you need to get your work done, you will be relegated to opening a ticket through a clumsy automated system and it could be several days before anyone addresses your issue."

4743,J.P. Morgan,Pros and Cons to everything,2021-05-04,4.0,Associate,"I started my career at JPMorgan out of college so they're great for that.
You make a lot of connections and friends as well.
With a big company such as JPMC, you'll find it difficult to not find a role you'd probably enjoy.","You can get pigeon-holed into doing stuff that nobody wants.
There's a lot of people who get promoted just out of circumstance and really shouldn't be in a managerial position.
The salary is very low in comparison to other companies."

4746,J.P. Morgan,Lowest base salary in the field,2021-05-04,2.0,Private Client Banker,"Great benefits, it used to have a decent incentive plan.","Too many changes. They expect private client bankers to pick up the slack when they layoff other positions. They are so demanding with productivity and calls. Expect you to do your job and cover for other roles and manager when they’re not there. They also made most bankers managers on duty to cover when manager is absent. Without any pay or bonus for the much added responsibility which will distract you from doing your actual job that makes you money to compensate for the embarrassing low base, even when you make good commission you are heavily taxed on it which at the end of the day you are better off have a high guaranteed salary. Because they change the incentive plan on you with just 1 week notice. Also no flexibility to work from home or have access to at least an email. Chase have changes a lot it’s all about the big bosses pockets and not their employees that are the ones that doing all the hard core job and hustling to bring new clients and new money."

I started as a fraud specialist, moved to auto financial service advisor, then recruitment sr. specialist until finally I became a Reference Data Analyst which is really a Project Management Role. This all happened in a span of 5 years. If you're interested of growing your career and really moving up the corporate ladder, this is really a great company for that.
-Teaches you the importance of finances
Before this company, I hated credit cards, loans, and vehicles in general. They gave me the financial knowledge to understand how to manage this privileges to bring me to the next level. At the age of 29, I already have a condo, a wife, and a car without the help of relatives or parents. I'm not even earning that much!","-Old culture
There will be a road block someday as people tend to see years of experience is better than a yuppy who has a heart. You just have to really prove them wrong.
-No nonsense work environment. I actualy like this but I'm certain some others won't.
-Love of frugality
Love it or hate it. This is the reason why the company is striving against the others. Upper management does get mores bonuses than the little one and hey I'm getting some of the benefits since I'm in the middle. I do see how sad it is at the bottom."

Some locations require you to work weekends and depending on location they may only approved one person to be off on any given day (so good luck if you are competing with senior bankers for a day off in December.) Your overall happiness depends on management and it's difficult to know their management style until you've already been placed at a branch. Transfers can be a little tricky to achieve at times as well.

-Health insurance is crap. 
-Reaching out to team leaders is difficult as they're always in meetings. 
-Just sitting all days.

-a few decent people that will support you during your time there and beyond
-salary","I have PTSD from working here especially as 1) a woman 2) a person of color. Forget it. Save yourself. It’s an awful culture. They act like this is IB when it’s not. Not everything has to be so urgent. They will talk down on you if you’re a woman and again especially if you’re POC. It’s a white male dominated industry. That will never change. Wake up! It’s 2021. The women who work here are intense because they have to be and in turn I never felt supported by them. They felt like they worked hard to get to where they were and that’s that. 

There is so much bureaucracy.

I was also client facing but the client service associates who do all the back end work deserve to be paid more. That will reduce turnover and make them a bit happier.

So many politics. I hate office politics more than anything and this is one place people will backstab you. Be prepared.

They also hate when you want a higher education. Beware. I’m going for my MBA now and they laugh at that.

I would have stayed for the actual work but the culture is just so, so awful."

4936,J.P. Morgan,Not a company for tech employees,2021-04-24,2.0,Associate Engineer,"Free on-site medical clinic is nice
Columbus McCoy center is awesome with plenty of food options.","Job grades need modernized; there are 2 levels of associate and then you become a VP. Trying to get promoted to VP is nearly impossible because it’s not about merit but how many executive directors you know. If you come from tech with levels like engineer 1-5 and principal engineer and the ability to easily get promoted then steer clear. 
Bonuses are under par from most other tech companies, my other employers had targets like 10-15% but at Chase they give you no idea; my bonuses were 7% and 9%. They only care about making bankers and brokers happy not the people keeping the systems working. 
Raises are very poor after 1 year I was not given a raise and told my 7% bonus was high which is why I started looking for new jobs, the next year I only got 2%.
401k matching is horrible, they do not match every pay check and will deposit the funds January the following year if you are still employed. 

No one takes responsibility for their products, if you have an issue with a system good luck trying to get support and it fixed. I had open tickets for bugs for 8 months that were never resolved. Most documentation is nonexistent or outdated.
I understand having to deal with risks and audits but the people managing risk are incompetent. They will say you need to fix this but tell you no information on how to or where to find resources. The whole SDLC risk team have the worst archaic system for getting an application from dev to prod, you have to paste screenshots in excel documents and post it to sharepoint. Every tollgate basically asks the same questions and you just end up copying and pasting from one worksheet to another.
I was told our team would hire new employees to help alleviate the team workload and over a year later they finally opened a couple contractor roles not even FTE as promised. By that time I was burnt out and already planning on leaving. 

Health benefits were great before changing MRA requirements, before you did some activities every quarter to get funds but last year they switched to making you wear a step counter and walk 7,500 steps 20 days a month. I don’t like wearing watches or things so I just decided to forfeit about $500."

* Need to make noise to make yourself visible, hard to be promoted if your silent worker and want your 9-5.
* You donot get promoted or get higher position because you're capable, you need to tell leadership you want it and then prove them.
* Negotiate well before you join in terms of salary because after that hike is negligible. Only promotion gives you proper salary hike.
* You may need to sometime spoon feed business people if you're technologist. And that is an expectation hence part of your job."

most people around are great.
You will get your hand dirty with an unbelievable amount of tools. Think about a technology, it is there in use.
When you are done for the day you are really done.","US centric company, meaning cool projects are done mainly in the US and other regions gets the boring leftovers. 
Internal reorg wanted people to focus on some areas, which means it gets more repetitive.
Not tiered monitoring model, which means even after years you will be due to work ""shift weeks"" which are very stressful and repetitive, especially during hiring freezes where workload is essentially double.
Requires to answer the phone (call center like) from internal employees that want to report security issues.
It is going to take long time to progress internally. 
I would personally recommend this role to someone not very senior to get more experience, or if you get the Senior role which does not require the monthly shift work.

Health insurance benefits
401K contributions
Cheap Gym Membership
Good Pay for no college degree necessary
2019 they gave every employee a free turkey (Supposed to be yearly, but 2020 we all worked from home)
Fairly generous time off allowances (You can take Leave of Absences for Maternity, Bereavement, etc.)
They say that they drug test, but its randomly selected so you have a decently high chance of not being chosen","You're a debt collector; A lot of the calls will be pretty repetitive as you're just catching people up on their bills, but every once in a while, you'll get a really depressing call where they tell you their entire life story and they cry and stuff. You aren't really here to help them. You're supposed to negotiate and compromise with the company's interest at heart which made me feel a little dirty and heartless at times. You're basically a salesperson trying to sell ""no debt"" to a captive audience. On top of that, they try to create a positive, lighthearted environment which clashes really hard with the nature of the work at times, and it feels super cringe. Imagine listening to someone explain that they've been laid off and are having money issues while someone is blasting pop music and handing you candy. That literally happened to me once. I only really stayed as long as I have because of the pay and benefits

Standards can be a little hard to hit consistently. It feels like the luck of the draw. Your ability to sell to people without money will make or break you.

Typical customer service issues: demanding and entitled customers, idiots, high call volume at times, strict scheduling, team leaders can be unavailable, lazy, out of touch etc."

When I first started I could atleast get paid for getting people to open accounts and credit cards, and referring them to our HLA & PCB and other associates. But now I get nothing and absolutely no recognition while fattening up others jackets, with numbers that wouldn’t exist if I didn’t personally take the time to find them our individual customers, face to face. I thought if I worked harder I’d actually move.

Not a promotion. But I was saddled with the responsibility of two roles w bs pay, no incentives, no scorecards and wasted time. A product of bad management. “Diversity & inclusion” a lie
