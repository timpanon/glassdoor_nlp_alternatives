1,,Salary Considerations,2022-04-11,3.0,Banking Operations Specialist,"I have been with JHA over ten years. It has been a good career. I have seen the company grow tremendously.

Strong vision for future.","JHA needs to look at salary grades, schedules, etc.

It is a little disheartening when new hires are recruited into positions, with no JHA background, with grades and salaries higher than someone who has dedicated over twenty years with the company. And others are leaving their roles to go to other areas where there is the incentive to make more money. This creates a larger cost, when training must be done backfill vacated positions."

8,,Worst job I’ve ever had in my life,2022-03-30,1.0,Fraud Prevention Representative,None I can think of,"Wow is all I can say! This company is a BIG mess. From management, down to their stupid unethical rules, unrealistic targets and expectations, to the low pay and crappy occurrences they give for things beyond your control. 

They expect you to be okay with the mental abuse from their card holders! They have NOTHING in lace if you’ve just finished a call with a bad person. This company has THE most disgusting set of human beings I have ever been involved with and I’ve been in customer service 15 years. I get abused daily and I tell my supervisor and NOTHING…ABSOLUTELY NOTHING IS DONE ABOUT IT! In fact, the first time I told my supervisor about being called a B- word he told me I had to grow thick skin with this job. WOW 
If you are a fraud prevention analyst you can forget about being treated with dignity and respect by Jack Henry. They tell you in training how “GREAT” working for this company is but that is a LIE! Maybe it’s great if you’re not a low paid phone worker because they truly treat us like scum of the earth. 

My morals, integrity and values will not allow me to work for such a horrible corporation and the minute I find a company that cares about me as a person and not look at me like a number expecting me to be a perfect robot then I am out the door quicker than I can say bye! 

They have a stupid attendance policy so don’t get sick working here. Even with a dr excuse you’ll get an occurrence. Internet goes out because of a thunder storm your supervisor will be asking are you able to go to your back up location?! If you can’t….occurrence. They expect you to drive out in bad weather conditions to get to a place where you can work (if you’re remote) which indicates they don’t care about your life or your safety just as long as you can take those abusive calls. 

This job has me dreading waking up to get on those phones. They expect so much but they do so little for us. This company gave us $10 for employee appreciation day to use in the Jack Henry store and we had to pocket the rest to make a purchase just another way to get us low paying working to further make the company more money. What was suppose to be appreciative about having to give money to a company to buy a cup or a t shirt with a company’s logo that doesn’t even care about us a person.

If you are on a long call they expect you to let them know why you weren’t able to take your break or lunch at the time scheduled. That’s the craziest thing I’ve ever seen in my life…. You can see that I was on a call and the call went over into my break YET & STILL my manger expects me to use my break time to send him a message /email letting him know WHY I was late what a joke! 

You’re watched like a thief here but truly they watch the wrong things. Watch the mental stress we endure on 90% of our calls and how it affects us as individuals. Watch how management shows favoritism to certain people and treat others like nothing! Watch the low hourly pay you give us! Watch the attendance policy and see how unrealistic it is! Watch the turn over rate….. no one enjoys working here that have to be on the phones talking to those nasty people day in and day out and te company has no destress procedure. Y’all are truly watching the WRONG things and you wonder why the turn over rate is HIGH it will forever be high running a circus like this. Good luck with your company but I won’t be here much longer."
9,,Solid Company — Mediocre Leadership and Poor People Development,2022-03-28,2.0,Senior Manager,Voted Best Work Place in IT year over year. New COO is doing good job making unifying silos and understanding where company has status quo thinking. Company has a lot of good things happening with removing legacy systems and building new corporate management approach that has been neglected for years. The new CTO is a star with vision for Digital Strategy. CIO is working hard to fix legacy thinking and systems and is a solid caring leader. CEO has done okay job removing leaders slowly that have preventing change by believing that their strategic differentiator was “customer service”. New Marketing leader did a great job showing how leadership was wrong about what differentiated them in the market. New leadership has done a great job creating catalyst for change.,"Company is struggling to overcome acquisition strategies that allowed new companies to operate for years with little to no mandate to act like One company. HR is trying to develop lack of career paths for employees and talent departures due to ill equipped managers that were hired as best operators. Still has no strategy for developing talent and keeping it, but they are making progress. COO has great vision for building One Jack Henry, but to many areas of business lack transparency into poorly documented processes. IT department is still riddled with poor visibility, and company is suffering from lack of corporate processes, governance and continue customers have put them on notice they need to fix their services. Company has suffered from clicks left over from early days and over reliance on old philosophy “Do What Every It Takes” that was well intended but has also allowed their people to suffer under poor legacy systems and processes that have been allowed to operate in Silos and customers feel that every day. They have the right vision now but too many employees have been leaving due to failing systems under HR and Support areas. Lot’s of talent has departed due to CEOs slowness to respond, however share prices keep climbing."

21,,Utterly Disappointed,2022-03-13,1.0,Product Support Representative II,You get to work from home and the company provides the equipment to work remotely,"I’m highly disappointed in this company. I was referred by a family member and I don’t know maybe she wanted the referral bonus or maybe she just doesn’t know how bad fraud analysts are treated. I have never worked for a company with such low pay and such extremely high and unrealistic expectations but this is what I have experienced so far here in my short time at JHA! You are set up to FAIL as soon as you are out of training 

Micromanagement is an understatement, you’re stalked here. Right down to the mili-second, as an older adult I should never have to email another grown adult when nature calls but they expect that here. Tell your supervisor you have logged off to go use the rest room or get an occurrence, your choice 

Abusive callers daily and I do not mean irate or upset these people are a different type of mad it goes beyond the average upset caller these group of card holders are BEYOND mean, rude, disrespectful, nasty, uncivil, 
ill-mannered, discourteous and the most hateful group of people I have ever talked to while working in the corporate world. Can’t say you weren’t warned. JHA provides NO support if you have just ended a call with someone threading to cause you harm and screaming to the top of their lungs calling you out of your name. You are expected to forget it happened and take that next call.

The company forces you to stay in the same position two years until you can transfer or apply for a different position and this is why most people don’t stay. The toll that talking to 100+ people every day literally weighs on your mental health and as much as I wanted to love this company this isn’t what others made it out to be. There are better opportunities out there and I know that this low hourly pay is not worth sending me into a stroke due to stress. 

I tried to see the best in this company but the bad outweighs the good. This job is toxic and you have to be perfect on each and every call in order to not be dinged for a mistake! Imagine working for a company that doesn’t even care enough about their employees to give them a decent employee appreciation gift. They do what’s beneficial for JHA. They gave us a $10 credit to use for the JHA store and guess what mostly likely you’ll end up having to spend money out of your check to cover the rest of what you want from the JHA store so the company profits off of the already low pay that is provided WOW mind blown! What a horrible way to treat your hard workers that show up everyday and make the company what it is . 

Inadequate training because it was lot of reading and PowerPoints and not sufficient time for practice or hands on you’re just thrown to the wolves. The calls we listened to in training the lady was so rude to those people I can’t even imagine how she still has a position and a supervisor position at that. Which indicated anyone is allowed to be a supervisor. I should’ve known from listening to the way she talked to those customers & the fact they chose those calls to let us listen to in training was a major red flag, I was behooved! 

I’m just utterly disappointed I thought this was going to be the last company I worked for but I refuse to settle for the worst when I know better is out there."
22,,Troubled Waters,2022-03-10,1.0,Network Security Engineer,"Great co-workers and support

24,,Good Company,2022-03-07,5.0,Asset Protection,Good company and worked with a lot of great people,Not much to complain about the position I was in
25,,Worst Call center job I’ve ever had,2022-03-07,1.0,Product Support Representative II,"Lots of Overtime available 
Remote work 
Equipment provided","A few things to consider when choosing JHA as your potential employer from an honest worker who has experienced time with the company for 12 months. 

Company does not offer sick time nor do they accept dr excuses. So yes, you can provide one but honestly you’ll still get an occurrence for something beyond your control. They don’t really care if a family emergency arises, if “LIFE” happens and you need to leave early or can’t make it in. It’s an Occurrence. 

Mental health is not a priority here. The company offers NO type of relief for fraud analyst who endure verbal abuse from callers. We take 100+ calls a day during a full shift and after being in a call center setting for 16 years this company has THE rudest, most disrespectful customers I have ever had to deal with in my entire life. They get very personal on calls. You’re yelled at, cussed at, belittled on a DAILY basis and because METRICS are most important to the company they do not want you off the phone AT ALL. So if you’re threatened or if you’re verbally abused in any type of way you are expected to carry on like nothing happened and take your next call. Sometimes there were days I would rather be dead than to get back on the phones and deal with these type of customers. It was me knowing that every single day, there was going to be an abusive caller that I had to deal with and nothing would ever be done about it. This job sent me into depression and I stayed long as I could because I was hoping things would get better. 

LOW HOURLY PAY most states this position is starting at $16-$17 but some JHA competitors are starting at $22.50 - $27 based on experience. The pay is not competitive and while everything else in life increases the little fish at the bottom is living check to check barely surviving to make the bigger fish at the top the real money. 

Last minute meetings. The supervisors here don’t care about how big of a distraction LAST MINUTE meets can be especially since calls are 100% of the time back to back. I get messages from my supervisor WHILE IM ON THE PHONE WITH A CUSTOMER asking me to join the meeting when the call has ended, me not even knowing a meeting was scheduled because I check my calendar at the beginning of every shift and he ALWAYS meets with me at the very last minute. They never give a notice on when the meetings will be so that you can fully prepare yourself to be ready…you know, ready with any questions or concerns you may have. They expect you to finish your last call, and hop straight on video to meet & no time provided after the meeting has ended to marinate on what was discussed. Straight back to the phones you go. They treat us phone workers like trash, so yes I get it you may view us as just another number because you have so many that come & go but look at your retention rate. How many people actually STAY and if that doesn’t open your eyes nothing will. Numbers never lie. 

Full breaks are none existent here. When you log out for break you have to change a status in teams. Log a code on your soft phone. When you get back you need to make sure you’re back at your computer at least 3 minutes before your 15 minute break is up because the systems time out so you have to spend break time making sure everything is open for your next call. If you’re late signing in from break it’s an occurrence. 

If you’re late taking a lunch or break they want you to update a tracker. Like who has time for all that. They want us so closely here you’d think they would know the exact reason why we were late going to break. But no, they want a detailed reason as to why we were late but we don’t get extra time to provide this so again this cuts into break time so we never get a full 15 minute break when a call has went over. 

Say goodbye to healthy kidneys. Because the company doesn’t care about your health your kidneys will likely deteriorate right along with your mental health here. You are given ONLY 15 minutes once a month to use the restroom and if you exceed your 15 minute “Ebreak” you’ll get an occurrence. 
They encourage you NOT to use ebreak by rewarding those that don’t use it with FIVE fraud dollars, very comical. Fraud dollars given in that amount are useless. Let’s see, if I held my urge to use the restroom and didn’t use ebreak for 12 months I would have 60 fraud dollars and what can I do with that you might ask? Absolutely nothing. 

It’s mandatory that you to work manual cases, these are cases that are accessed without having a customer on the phone. Meanwhile calls are never slow enough to to really focus on a manual case but if you don’t reach your percentage you’ll be called out for it."

I had been clearly advertised as someone who had a particular skill and would have to learn the other skills required for the job. I would get a LOT of training and things would be great. Unfortunately, it turned out that the ""training"" was taught by another coworker who was clueless on too many things. I decided to train myself and would contact coworkers in the areas I needed training on and then was severely reprimanded by my supervisor for ""wasting their time"". Shortly after I got reprimanded for not knowing enough, I tried to explain that I had been promised training and had not received it but those were ""excuses"". All my ideas for classes and/or training environments were rebuffed as ""useless"". Finally during my last month, the reprimands were getting severe and personal which totally ""disabled"" my ability to do anything.
Only now, 3 years later, I have been working for a proper manager who ""listens"" do I understand how bad my supervisor at Jack Henry was. Some people are not supposed to be managers."

Remote work but that’s pretty common in this generation.

The company provides work equipment.","I am a fairly new hire. 2 months in to be exact so in my honest review I will share my experience so far. The job makes you emotionless because they don’t want you on calls for an extended period of time so you have no real time to empathize with the customers. The more calls you take the more money the company makes so they DO NOT want you spending any unnecessary time on the line with a caller even if you’re trying to empathize with them. 

You are only given FIVE minutes at the start of your shift to be in “not ready” I was told this 5 minutes should be used as reading time to catch up on emails and policies. But let’s be honest, what pertinent information can one retain in FIVE minutes??!! And this is the first of many problems with their policies. 

There are too many disconnects within this company. For example, Quality Assurance will send you an email once a month with your calls and the emails will ALWAYS say, “when calls are slow take time to review your attached calls”
So this leads me to believe ONE- QA doesn’t know that the daily heavy call volume will NEVER allow me to be able to review my graded calls or TWO- they know and just don’t care. The problem created here is that when you treat people this way it creates low morale within the company. It also creates and very stressful work environment. How can I better myself within the company if you never give the proper time to do so??!
If the company would stop hiring 3-4 people at a time….guess what you would have sufficient people to cover a shift and you won’t have to place four work loads on ONE person. 

CALL VOLUME- You will take anywhere from 75-130 calls a day. There is NEVER any downtime, since I’ve been out of training there hasn’t been ONE shift of mine that I have worked where I’ve been able to catch a breather. So again, this goes back to the Quality Assurance team telling you to review your calls when calls are slow. They know that calls are never slow so those emails are a slap in the face. Unless, you one of the ones that like to work off the clock and with JHA this goes on more frequently than not. 

Customers get away with calling you B- words,
 r-slurs, threatening your life and nothing ever gets done about it. You’re screamed & cussed at on a daily basis. And guess what? You’re expected to stay logged in to get the next call and forget about the mental anguish your last caller just caused. 

PTO- good luck trying to take time off to spend with your family. All the tenured agents have already taken the most important holidays of the year because they do PTO one year in advance. So very little work/life balance. 

PAY- The pay is ok but if you add in the work load plus the verbal abuse daily from callers as MF the strict policies. The starting pay for this position should be at least $22. 

BREAKS /LUNCH - You’ll get two 15 minute breaks and one 30 minute lunch. Talk about taking a child in a candy store then telling them not to touch anything. This is what the “emergency break” feels like because it’s not something they want you using but they give it to you just so they can penalized you for using it. I exceeded my ebreak because I was on the toilet and guess what I got. An OCCURRENCE, they’re extremely passionate about slapping you with an occurrence in fact they love to give those here.

Don’t expect this company to excuse an absence if you’re sick or if you have a sick child. Doctor excuses mean absolutely NOTHING here. As if I can control when my son gets sick. My son had the flu and even with the doctor notes, copies of prescriptions…guess what I got? Another OCCURRENCE. Lord forbid you are human and you get sick they could careless. Occurrence it is. 

They never ever point out all the good you do but when or if you have a verification fail or an autofail on a call they will be SWIFT to point out the wrong you’ve done. People are HUMAN and people really do slip and make a mistake sometimes. Show me a perfect person…I’ll wait. Even machines make mistakes since the company expects people to perform like robots.

There is absolutely no discretion within this company. If you’re going to be late, absent or even if you have a family emergency. Your absence or tardiness will be shared in teams for every single person that works for JHA to see. They even send emails to EVERYONE with your entire name when you’re no longer with the company. The most unbelievable thing I’ve seen at a corporation before. 

They want you to work on Manual fraud cases, grade your own calls & review policies without giving you proper time off the phones that leads to working off the clock.

Also the trainer I had she made it seem like she would always be available to answer any questions we would have when we went into “production” but guess what she did. The way we would communicate in teams, she turned off her read receipts so we couldn’t see when she actually read our messages, she stopped responding to questions sent in teams by disabling the way we could see if she read our messages and if that isn’t grimy I don’t know what is. I became friends with someone in my class and we are both looking for better employment elsewhere and this says a lot considering we came from a previous fraud analyst position so it’s not the work it’s the company’s lack a care for employees. AX same fraud position starts at 23.50 so the $17 here is just not worth jumping through rings of fire. She constantly had her cats in the camera which was very unprofessional and you’d think with her being with the company for 15 years she would’ve set a better example. 

The last thing I’d say is that the turnover rate with the company is high because they treat you like a number here and not an actual person.

This job does not care about your mental health so if this is an area that you struggle in please take this honest review into consideration. You’ll face some level of stress no matter what corporation you decide to become a part of but at least make sure it’s more than $17-$18 and hour."

This being said it felt like adding insult to injury seeing the webinars thru mental health awareness month...
 And feeling completely iced out by that time. I could tell that both hr and other management after a certain extent n as there last priority. It took over a week at one point to get a response from my hr contact. And that would ALWAYS at that time take whatever issue it was and just try to get me to go to someone else. There was an issue with scheduling soon before I left that went thru all 4 different people or department to telling me to reach out to each other one. My overall experience with them was not ever a negative or really bad experience.... I just really feel again that they may need to work on being prepared to handle this more appropriately so that in the future as they are taking more employees they will not put them in the same position I was .

Management always plays the shell game to keep the balls in the air so they do not upset the clients, but never reaching processes to where they truly need to be.

To that end, executives hear the good, the bad, and the ugly. As a 45 year old software company, pay, titles, benefits are not as competitive with the market place, even though their data says otherwise, and some employees are leaving for this reason. The company likes to be in the middle on these topics but it should attempt to lead and figure out how to sustain it's fiscally responsible budget too. Yes, a little bit of a miracle, but with dedication and talent, I know this can happen. Being in the middle isn't good enough and comparing ourselves to others might not be the right thing to do.

No sick days, you just use your pto and it counts against you. Zero support if you get COVID- “Gee hope you feel better but we aren’t paying you for any time you miss and it may still get you fired.”
They continuously postpone the above promotions to the next fiscal year. Since moving remotely, they decided to be even more strict about time away from phones and will give push back if you struggle because you don’t have the ability to work in a bubble.

-Company health insurance has changed their policy each year and has changed providers once since I've been hired
-Very little training, just some shadowing and you are left alone to learn a complex, buggy product on your own. There are many defects and different product versions which makes it very difficult to be successful in a customer facing role

Supervisors and managers are overloaded with large teams. Promotions and pay increases are pain staking and not sufficient. There is no margin for error, no wiggle room in the budget. Leadership makes rash decisions that set back certain divisions instead of progressing and improving systems and processes. Their philosophy is to acquire companies rather than create homegrown quality products. This leads to massive waste as the purchased systems rarely integrate smoothly, if at all.

245,,Mentally Harmful Over Time,2020-06-11,2.0,Product Support Representative,"There were pros working here, for instance, the employees. Other employees were normally great, but it definitely got wore once shut off from any other employees. There was paid time off for part time, which was great, but it was halved as should be expected from full time. That being said, it's hard to get off a day that is more than 5 hours with part time paid time off at times. In fact, it was hard to get time off in general. But that's going into a con. As a list of pros they have, good starting pay, pto, and good employees to work with.","I felt there were a lot of cons that were never addressed. Despite being a software company, their systems were more often than not down, and management would blame you regarding this situation, especially when working from home. I had to maintain a work balance that was potentially harmful to mental health considering there was technically one break throughout the day and they expect you to only take one or two five minute breaks if that, for bathroom or otherwise. PTO was incredibly hard to get off unless you could go at a time that no one was taking the time off at all, or if you were full time. Even full time had trouble at times. Management was great at times, but there were many times that I had supervisors that reached out to me that were not in any way , shape, or form to know what was happening regarding my system or if I was working on something another supervisor set up for me. They normally would scold even if there was nothing I had done wrong and I had reached out to my own supervisor regarding it. After over a year of working there, and keeping myself to more than the expectations that they had, they treated me as though I knew very little and rewarded new people that had done less than what I had. I realize that sounds pretentious but I felt very belittled despite working for more than a year and seeing brand new people do less than me and get rewarded for it when I never had gotten recognition. Their training wasn't amazing either, and with stress they put on their own employees, they would still expect the employees to train the new people properly when many were too worried to hold up their standards. There was also many hardships over schedules, not just with me. When I first started working and warned them I had school they paid no mind to this and tried to schedule me during times I couldn't work, and I had to get HR and my supervisors involved almost every time it changed, which I hated doing. Over all, they were not wonderful to work with, and their minimal help in regards to stress was awful."

The team atmosphere is incredible, and the supervisors are by far the best I've ever had the pleasure of working under.

Pro: You can progress your knowledge with Active Directory","IDM has had a history of horror stories, to which those unfortunately still continue. When someone continuously lashes out with rude comments, that attitude will not be adjusted by your management unless you escalate to higher management/HR. Thus leading to the next point of favoritism on the group. 
There is a severe workload imbalance, causing a fraction of the group to do most of the work while others are able to play video games on their phones, make personal calls, etc. 
There is no teamwork, and many seem to have authority issues. Example: When a reasonable employee sees someone made a mistake, they may just correct it if they can tell it's an honest mistake. Members of IDM however, every time they see something, instead of taking the initiative to correct said item, may email you and cc your manager saying you need to fix this. There are lots of power struggles where members feel obligated to demonstrate a sense of authority. 
Management is not okay working from home.
There are Teams status limitations. You are not allowed to manually set yourself to 'Busy'. 
There is little structure. When asking someone a procedural question (including your manager) you will get responses like ""I do such and such"". When each person does their own thing that induces chaos. There has to be a set of rules. There are rules set in place, however they are riddled with grammatical errors and structurally laid out in a confusing way."

281,,A Competitive Company--Both Locally and Nationally,2019-10-17,4.0,Fraud Analyst,"JHA has a lot of pros. The pay, the benefits, and the ""you matter"" treats that are provided are great. There are prizes, games, and other little perks that, in addition to the good pay and benefits, make the oftentimes stressful job more bearable. Some of the managers are very laid back and friendly as long as you are good at your job and meet/exceed expectations. Overall, the company is definitely competitive nationally since not many companies offer good benefits and a (relatively) healthy work culture anymore, but the true competitiveness is local (depending on the employers in your area).",The biggest con is the stress linked to some of the positions themselves. The standards and expectations and the criteria you are graded on can be a little nitpicky and inconsistent. The size of the company and the nature of the work means that your manager could be hit or miss and the workplace is fairly traditional with how they do things. This means that it can feel like micromanaging and that there isn't the kind of trust placed in employees to simply do the right thing as you might find in a smaller family business.
282,,Awesome job,2019-10-15,5.0,Product Support Specialist,Great pay and benefits,Rarely have days off together
283,,the ASSOCIATES,2019-10-13,3.0,Banking Operations Associate,JHA has many great associates.,"Taken from the Annual Stockholder Report, ""After identifying our median employee based on the actual base salary earnings, we then calculated the annual total compensation for this employee using the same methodology we use for our Named Executive Officers as set forth in the fiscal 2019 Summary Compensation Table included in this Proxy Statement. Based on this calculation, this median employee’s annual total compensation for fiscal 2019 was $69,325. The annual total compensation of the Chief Executive Officer for fiscal 2019 (as set forth in the Summary Compensation Table on page 29) was $4,851,479 resulting in a pay ratio of 70 to one.”  Such a disparity.  If  you look across the board, the ratio of management to associates seems to be out of control.  Top heavy management.

I work in an area that seems to focus daily on income to such a degree that customer service takes a backseat.  That is somewhat disappointing from the ole’ Jack Henry days where taking care of the customer allowed the rest fall into place.  What makes it worse is that the never ending search for money and more money makes one feel unstable and insecure in a position that has a great value to to the company.

JHA has many great associates.  Narrow the above mentioned 70 to 1 gap.  Sadly, this past year it seems to have widened between management and associates by how they changed the 401 K plan to remove the cap for contributions.  Why not treat those in lesser income geographics  (SW MO) more equitable.  And the new bonus plan was just a thinly veiled way to reduce annual raises.  The pay could be better; however, benefits such as PTO is good.

Suggestion…..  Remember the associates.  Without the ASSOCIATES’ hard work, they are the ones who help raise up the company from development to installation to support."

Managers don't take performance reviews seriously; they will give everyone top scores. If an employee is not meeting expectations, they will not communicate it. They will let it become a problem to a point that termination is considered. And, unfortunately, this is one of those companies that give performance improvement plans as a means to pressure employees to resign."

289,,Fraud Analyst,2019-08-28,1.0,Fraud Analyst,"Pay ($16/hr plus up to $1.50/hr shift differential)

Equipment is provided","I work part time, and I get one 15 minute break during a 4-5/hrs shift. When an employee needs to use the restroom outside of that 15min break we use what's called ""e-break"" and part-time employees get only 15min/per month of e-brake. I ended up with a verbal warning for exceeding my e-brake because there is no bathroom in my remote office. I'm excellent at the job, so out my verbal was for something unrealistic.

!!!!Micromanagment!!!

1) If an employee is late 5 mins twice in 1 year, you are fired. 

2) If you do recieve a write up (and write-ups are for trivial things like bathroom usage) it stays on your record for 1 year. Once you have a write up you can not move shifts/bid for anything. 

3) When I was recruited for this job I was told that there was a lot of room to move around the company within 6 or so months. Lie! You must remain in the same position for 2 years before being able to move anywhere else in the company. 

4) I've worked call center jobs before and JHA takes the cake with all the hoops one must jump through. When you do take your break you have to sign in/off 3 platforms (only 2 foot 15min breaks). It takes 10 minutes to just get the equipment up and running but that will never be an ""excuse"" to be late for a shift. 

5) You have 15mins of sign on time. In that time, you are expected to get on the vpn, clock in, sign on to soft phone, sign on to vdi, then sign into 5 platforms. After you do that you must answer emails. Now, as if that weren't enough, you'll also have to answer to pesky persistent emails and will be told that the cases you worked wrong, you have to go back and one by one correct. The calls/cases are constant. The platforms are not user friendly at all. Even the trainer gets 2 monthly reports full of mistakes. But, there is zero time to be able to fulfill this request. And, you are not given any extra time ""off the phones"" to do anything, at all. You only have 5 minutes to sign off everything and clock out."

They have early retirement option at age 55. They have a great family work life balance. They offer work at home to most employees a couple of days a week so a lot of employees work from home.",They don't pay as well for technical jobs as most technical companies and I find it common that women generally get paid less than men for the same job.

They are very reactionary, always cutting jobs and closing open positions we really need to succeed in the future. Mandatory overtime is required in support because staff is always so short. Symitar's system is undergoing major technology changes, but instead of staffing up to handle that transition, they cut down staff and have no plan for training or preparing existing support staff to handle it. The system is huge and the way work is divided makes no sense. You will spend the first year just trying to figure out who does what."

Many of the problems in the area I was in were the result of many different points of failure to address smaller problems resulting from being reactive and addressing the results of the problems instead of the roots of the problem.
Workload is so heavy there is no flexibility in staffing to allow for education on the system, it would take years to become expert in one subsystem as duties are spread thin across too many of them to gain a good understanding of data and processing workflow to the point you can confidently address new problems as they come up and see how the subsystems relate to one another."

Absolutely no knowledge sharing you can forget training  for new employees. New ideas are  not shared in fear that if it fells accountability is met with humiliation. Software development ideas are stagnant or non existant from within the company.  Competitors technology is always the driving force for software ideas. Upper level managers will belittle the whole team for failure to execute the next best feature against competitors. Mid-level managers talk about amployees to other employees. Development teams work in silos. No one knows what they are developing and what is being deployed. Project timelines are good practice for doodling.

342,,Product Support Specialist I,2018-09-26,1.0,Product Support Specialist,Good benefits if you are full time but this did not apply to me.  You will also get to work from home after 6 months if you survive the onboarding process.,"Training was scheduled for 3.5 weeks from 9a-3p.  The training consisted of our ""trainer"" telling the group of 6 new hires to watch 3 recorded webinars . This was to take 3 days. They turned out to be the same webinar over and over again with no pertinent job related info (only corporate culture, safety, etc). Then we had about 50 safety and banking terminology videos to watch which were also of little to no practical value to performing our particular job duties.

When we were done with all these videos (entire first week), our trainer promptly disappeared. She left us no instructions on what to do and we literally sat in the training room  doing nothing before she popped in 2 days later saying she had been sick.

Then the rest of the training time (1.5 weeks) we were supposed to ""observe"" others do their job. But the problem was none of these people were officially trained either so every day we would get different instructions from different people. There are so many different systems that may or may not be used on specific calls that it was virtually impossible to practice solving many types of inquiries while shadowing during training. Help resources for specific tasks are piecemeal and hard to navigate. Many are incomplete and outdated.

There was no chance to practice navigating the multiple information systems on our own apart from shadowing others while they were taking calls.  We did not have credentials for these systems or computers until the day we went out on the floor to perform our job independently. 

Hence, the first time  taking calls independently felt like entering a war zone with no formal combat training. 

Then my manager failed to approve 2 of the group's hours in full for the first pay period.  As a result we only received half of a first check.  Next, myself and another trainee were scheduled for evening shifts we had not agreed to nor were available for ( I had specifically stated my shift availability in an email  to recruiter before signing their offer letter). I  gave this to them.

On the last day of our training they had still not revised my schedule to reflect a correct shift starting time for the next day.  But it is important to note: Regardless of your scheduled shift start, you will need to arrive at least 15 minutes prior.
Call center employees have to ""share desks"" with other shifts. This requires a 15 minute unpaid equipment setup before even being able to clock in."
343,,Great for people who love office politics and power games.,2018-09-09,2.0,Anonymous Employee,"Please note that JHA is a large organization and experiences will vary from one division to the next. This particular review pertains to Symitar.  When I started, initially, it was tough but learned a lot (great growing opportunity) and folks were passionate and worked together to solve challenging problems and deliver quality product. Senior and seasoned members mentored peers and new comers, creating a strong robust team environment. Over the last five years this has degraded. Despite the dysfunction, there are still a lot of good people who really still care about the actual product.","In development, some management out of touch with the day to day work of their teams and true needs of customers and this is causing massive dysfunction and chaos.  More concerned with posturing, managing up and getting ahead than in delivering quality product.  Management blame their poor strategy (or lack of thinking things through) on implementing teams when things fail (then lay people off instead of taking any accountability). Huge mental disconnect between a management decision and ensuing outcome. Due to distance from the actual product, management often fires the few SMEs there are mistakenly thinking that all employees are generalists and easily replaceable (they wont remember this months later when they realize they actually do need a rare SME). Poor and inconsistent implementation of agile have left many bewildered and a created a strange anti-process culture making it challenging for those removed from management to know how to complete their work. Worse, those that get ahead are not afraid of  throwing others under the bus or criticizing others behind their back to elevate their status. When management makes a decision that doesn't make sense, or is perceived as a bad idea - employees are discouraged from questioning that decision or speaking up."

346,,Worst mistake I ever made,2018-08-31,1.0,Call Center Representative,My co workers were awesome,The training for the job is lack luster at best and non existent at worst  Essentially your expected to train yourself based off of videos he managers record on what downtime they have.  The company isn't very forgiving about time missed and when it seems like they might be due to the death of a parent for example they end up just throwing it back in your face after a few months.  Anytime I ever needed to talk to a manager they were either to busy dealing with Financial Institutions or down systems to actually help out.  Honestly it's the worst company I have ever worked for they just use people up to the point that you don't even want to get out of bed in the morning. I've never felt more depressed or on the verge of calling life quits than when I worked for these people. Avoid this place at all costs they are a joke.

She is known to have gotten several employers fired. The manager also does not care of what hardships you have; When concerns about supervisor are brought she blindedly agrees without investigating. Talk about being alone, even HR department is in cahoots to teaming against you.

My advice it to look for other positions within the company if you cannot work with your current manager.   Once the new position is obtained, file a report (include your notes) on the manager.

They also allow travelling employees to keep their airline miles and hotel points which is a nice perk.,"As with a lot of older software companies these enterprise software solutions are implemented via old processes that need major overhaul.   Documentation is severely lacking.  Executive level management sets unrealistic time frames for major software projects yet refuses to hire on the necessary  resources to complete the projects on time or pay competitive salaries to retain good employees.

The desire to increase profits leads to questionable, but not exactly illegal, accounting practices and absolutely no loyalty to employees.  Departments are moved or removed with little to no thought for those impacted by the changes which often leaves displaced employees who are given very little time to find another position.  Decisions by management on who to keep and who to let go is based entirely on an impersonal score that is subjective to the point of being useless.  The behind the scenes politics and backstabbing that goes on in some groups makes for a very hostile work environment where there is a constant fear of getting fired for providing an honest opinion."

We do not even look in the most obvious places for our needed talent to back fill the positions of those that are leaving, because our Senior/Advisory level pay is mid range for most companies of our size or in the Technology industry. 

They are becoming very slow moving and are starting to audit every move within the company to ""determine resource needs"" accurately. We have been told this is the only way to approve additional headcount since our positions are not budgeted but rather approved on the fly at the GM's discretion. While the nature of the work is great and the people overall are good to work with. Management is starting to run things into the ground. We have to try and convince people why we need headcount whenever we've had more turnover in the last year then all of the previous years combined. People want to be paid fair wages and there is nothing fair about a Hiring freeze as well as stagnate wages, when people are jumping ship to add to this situation. Hundreds of millions in yearly profits (another record year) and we are in a hiring freeze.

We have the worst internal helpdesk system I've ever been around. jSource is a eyesore, monolithic, and actually degrades work. There's no direct live reporting service or API. And it's made in house. 

 Within the last 1 year i've seen about 8 people leave that shouldn't have. All the way from Director level to low level support. If they don't see things are going south I don't know what will."

Company culture is not what it was at one point, but my group tries to keep things light-hearted and keep the JHA motto of ""Do the Right Thing, Do Whatever it Takes, and Have Fun"" alive.",Only the cons that typically come with a large publicly traded company.  Sometimes the pleasing stockholders means sacrificing of employees without much return to the employee.
615,,"Nepotism, favoritism, and setting you up to fail.",2015-09-28,2.0,Technical Support Representative,The pay isn't terrible and some of the people there are nice.,"The employee share of insurance costs is constantly going up along with increasing deductibles. If you aren't comfortable with a workplace where the managers and supervisors are cliquishly friendly with their employees (read: having lunch together with only a few employees and constantly chatting with just a few employees) then I would stay away. 

The workload for Customer Service (Card Services Department) isn't distributed evenly. Some people get a ton of work, while others have to beg for extra work, yet their metrics for ""success"" are based off of the amount of work you actually do. Managers can manually place people at the top of the phone queue, or at the bottom. Call metrics are also included in what they consider to be ""successful performance"". 

If your metrics fall below what they consider to be successful or acceptable, they place you on  a ""PIP"" or ""Performance Improvement Plan"" and offer no real help to get your stats up. You basically have to beg for more work. And if you happen to be on one of these PIPs come bonus time, regardless of how well you performed before the PIP (You know, how much money you helped the company make), you don't get a bonus. You could have had the best stats in the department, but fall below the line and get placed on a PIP right before bonus time and you get nothing. 

Even though there are constantly requests by many employees for healthy snacks rather than cookies, cakes, candy and pizza, and despite the obvious number of employees who are very obese and/or have full blown diabetes, they still rarely offer a healthy alternative. Unless you count the bananas that are usually found sitting next to the cookies, snack cakes and candy.

They used to offer standing desks as an option, but removed them all a few years ago to make room so they can shove as many employees on one floor as they can. You can't even request a foot rest without having to prove that it's ergonomically necessary for your health. 

Regardless of the overwhelming evidence that sitting for extended periods of time is extremely  detrimental to health, you're required to stay seated at your desk ready to take calls, and if you step away for any reason, you're supposed to place yourself in ""not ready"" on your phone. You're supposed to do this literally any time that you get up from your desk and they monitor every time you place yourself in ""not ready"". Almost none of the ""long term"" employees do this. They simply roll the dice and take a chance at missing a call for fear of getting in trouble with management. However, once you've caught managements attention (for following protocol and being honest about when and how long you're away from your desk), if you try to do what anyone else there does, and walk away from your desk without placing yourself in ""not ready"", the management will get into the phone system and place you in not ready, rather than letting an actual missed call do this."

One's personal experience may vary depending on the department in which you work and the person who is supervising said department... But that is the struggle of any large company. From a corporate viewpoint, I feel like I am valued and respected. I don't feel like upper management is out for their own purposes with no regard for those of us on the front-lines. I feel like they understand we are the ones making customers happy and ensuring JHA's products work on a daily basis. And that goes a long way in making me happy at work.","The pay is a little low. I took a small cut in pay from my last job when I was hired. But I would do it again. The workplace environment in my previous job was terrible in comparison. I feel compensated in ways beyond money-- like work/life balance, respect, and independence. I think one would be hard-pressed to find a company that does a better job than JHA at providing a well-rounded environment with all things considered. You may be able to find places doing just as well (there are some good companies out there!), but I think it would be tough to find someone doing much better. (Apart from your iconic workplaces like Google, etc).

To reiterate, the experience is individualized and depends largely on your department and supervisor. But JHA allows movement inside the company to find your best fit. And my supervisor will not be in the same place forever, either. It is better to work for a good company and a not-so-great boss than to work for a crummy company and have a great boss. The company is larger than the man or woman for whom you work. It is also larger than your department."

Advancement is impossible.

Decisions are frequently made by upper management that vastly affect us or our products with no input from us.

Expectations that you are available 24/7.

Higher education gets you nothing except for more student loan payments. I have a graduate degree in my field and I can't even get an interview for internal positions.

Rarely they give out bonuses and when they do you can just about guarantee raises will be lower to compensate for the bonus. Which in the long run saves the company money but gets me no where."

Very fair with raises and compensation.  Get your work done and you get rewarded when reviews come around.","Paid Time Off policy leaves a lot to be desired especially if less than 5 years with the company.

Management seems to change direction a lot leading to the feeling like your not making any progress.

The Pro I listed about freedom in how you solve problems is somewhat reversed by some of the senior development management and groups in Monett as they like to tell you how and what you can use to make your software.  While they may provide a solution to how to solve your problem its never the optimal way to do it and they force it anyway.  It can be frustrating as these groups stand upon their ivory tower tossing down solutions when they don't fully understand the problems.  Leads to a lot of wasted time solving simple problems.

Job Title advancement gets blocked indiscriminately for an entire office, despite that there are people who deserve a promotion."
656,,"Fantastic place to be for anyone seeking a 'career'.  Not for ""McDonalds mentality"" workers.",2015-03-18,5.0,Senior Manager,"Benefits, while could be better, anything could be better.  For the cost associated compared to what you get, JHA's benefits are quite good.  Flexibility - JHA is extremely flexible with employees with regard to telecommuting or permanent 'remote' status.  Competitive - JHA is very competitive in the marketplace in all aspects.  While multiple reviews have outlined less benefits and low pay; as a senior manager for the company (but not an executive level manager, to be clear), we have management models and training and we have a model we follow:  ""C=C"" (compensation = contribution).  If you work your tail off and 'smarter not harder', find efficiencies and cement yourself (in whatever role you fill) as ""the go-to person"" which only requires your determination to be excellent, you'll be compensated more than fairly, if not quite well.  Advancement - speaking from experience as someone who entered this company ~10 years ago making $30k/yr, I worked my tail off and became that ""go to"" person and had numerous situations present themselves to me to better myself.  I took those opportunities and 10 years later I'm pulling down 6 figures.  Gosh, that's horrible.  All it took was dedication to providing quality in everything I do and asking a lot (a ton!) of questions.  If you settle you'll be unhappy or 'so so' anywhere; challenge process, improve process and product and the sky is the limit. Truly.","With any larger business there are things behind the scenes that govern direction, movement, and decisions.  Of course the almighty dollar drives many of those; good, bad, or indifferent.  As such, sometimes what the management levels see and convey differs greatly from what the people in the trenches see/feel/want and that can, and often does, lead to a tug & pull with the end result being the front-line staff feel overworked/pressured while the the executive levels are trying very hard to ensure that the company turns profits and high margins for our shareholders and customers.  Some years we are able to relax on that a tad over other years, depending upon the market, but from sitting in both management and front-line roles within the company I have a pretty good view on what's happening, and why, and it makes sense.  Show me a company that doesn't have this problem and I'll show you a company that's destined to fail."
657,,Is Jack Henry a great place to work?,2015-03-17,1.0,Support Manager,"Like most companies, the culture of the organization is from the top down. Over the years, the company grew at a steady, but encouraging rate the past 10 years. Management focus is primarily on the banking business with core software, ancillary products and API's to most if not any and all 3rd party vendors or service providers. The credit union market surged in recent years as the sales mentality shifted from pushing in-house products and services to the upcoming EASE platform. Flexibility is their middle name with exception of managing products or services within a financial's internal network.  Great business, especially since the key client is on average $130B for EASE and $50M for CruiseNet. Very affordable and where can you get all the products and services in one place for such an attractive price while reducing the regulatory headache of managing a financial institution.","The credit union market outsourcing product (aka EASE) took a while to gain ground. This was primarily due to sales incentives heavily weighted on licensing in-house systems. The rhetoric at the time was that the outsourcing product was an inferior product/service along with no incentives compared to in-house sales. Another key problem was the Symitar organization only made a small percentage of the outsourcing business as well as absorbed most if not all the upfront costs associated with the sales and implementation cycle. The support model was in-house only and EASE clients and operation staff had to go it alone. The banking outsourcing was the primary money maker and that's where the attention was focused. From the lack of involvement or understanding from the GM level to the $14 an hour computer operator, the outsourcing model was broken. As the product grew the service model could not sustain all the demands placed on the support and operations personnel. Being setup to fail is not a particular good position that no employee wants to be in. Regardless if you are an A or C player, just not good environment to be optimistic about your ability to deliver a superior product or service. The culture of pointing fingers from internal support groups was the norm while the business units suffering the most were the ones with the least control of the product or service,  but holding all the accountability."

I had a premature child and they allowed me to work from home to care for him. They also have never laid anyone off due to economic reasons in their history. The company has decent benefits including medical, dental, vision, 401k, stocks at a reduced rate, and an above average amount of paid time off including holidays. The upper management including the CEO actually listen to their employees opinions and advise. While it doesn't always result in the change you desire they will always take the time to explain to you their reasoning, usually personally.",I have been with the company for 8 years and the wages do not increase enough with even good reviews to keep up with the increased rates for insurance. When I started it was no cost for the basic insurance now it has risen so high that I was forced to drop the company insurance. While my department has a fair work/life balance I know of many others that do not. These employees work well beyond standard full-time hours on a regular basis.

Employees who are unwilling to spend a lot of their free time participating in 'events'  can expect a stall in their upward mobility.

PTO is  You won't have to worry about down sizing. Casual environment with generally no micro management. Very profitable and I believe genuinely most everyone cares about the customers. Depending on management flexibility to work at home and take vacation is good.,"Cons. This can be a novel. Let's start with software development. Software is the bread and butter of this company. To bad much of it is terribly developed. Most of the support for these applications is terrible as they hire people who can't seem to grasp much outside of basic task. They are also worked to death as well. 

Not a good company to start your career. If you are looking to learn and grow as a Sys Admin good luck. All you are is a glorified high level application support. The company has your normal admin job split out between so many other departments it's not even funny. Patching, hardware, Anti-virus, VM management.

If you are someone who is seasoned and is looking for a cushy job, then this is a good place. Many departments are run bare bones with too much work and high expectation of performing miracles with little to no time. They are so profitable yet Senior management is scared to spend any money on head count. They have to look good on paper. So much that promotions and raises are of little increase that you aren't really benefiting job title change. Someone promoted Senior within would make a heck of a lot more outside the company. They just don't like paying.

They will pay someone externally a lot more yet not promote within as well. Data Center Upper Management bows down to application development/management. Whatever they want they get. Push updates to the program constantly to makeup for the previous muck up.

Management is overridden with constant customer appeasement and audits. Audits are overkill here. Yearly cost of living raises are barely that. Does not really cover the cost of living and/or increased insurance. 

All in all it's not a terrible company. Most management is easy going just cheap. Don't expect tools to get the job done though."

Honestly, there are plenty of other places to work.  If you have cause for concern or complaint, then please get out of our company.  We would much rather work along side of someone that wants to be here and has pride in our company and solutions.

Pay scale borders on insulting, raises are like unicorns. 
Favoritism is so rampant that performance is a non-factor for some.... you're either in or you're out.
Training?  you mean story time, right?  employees listen to thier orientation, and then get read a conpletely convoluted, unhelpful manual and sent on thier merry way to sink or swim.
Promotions are also a non-entity, based on time, rather than skill when occurring at all. and forget about inter-department transfer - those are also pretty much a myth.
Management - way too many mid managers, upper management completely detached from all but a handful of pets.
Absolute zero incentive -  performance means nothing if you're not one of The Chosen, so why bother?
Completely understaffed, leading employees stressed and frustrated at inability to ever stop the hamster wheel, while constantly being reminded about unatttainable quotas - 1 person is generally expected to do 5 peoples' worth of work causing morale to be non-existant.
Appreciation/regocnition is seldom given, with the exception of peer-to-peer pep-talks (mostly convincing each other not to hang ourselves with the phone cords)
Policies are randomly enforced, be they attendance, appearance or productivity.
Annual employee surveys are also a joke - individual links per employee do NOT make one feel secure in thier annonymity - not that anyone listens anyway.
Communication is sporadic, incomplete and contradictory - At best.  Top down communications are rare, and inter-departmental communications are vague and unhelpful.  Mid-management communications are generally random and critical - complimentary seldom enters into the thought process.
There is no career-pathing or goal setting.  At all.  You'd better have a relative or childhood friend in a place of power for each department you'd like to move to.
Dead weight sits on the payroll at all levels, but is significantly detrimental to the management team - a manager should be present more than they are gone to be effective.
Work-life balance is nearly impossible in somedepartments, and shift assignments are not conducive to any kind of family life.
Performance evaluation process is a bloated waste of time and energy - manager responses are simply cut-and-pasted from before the dawn of time.
Change is an anathema - which is really NOT a good stance for a company dealing with banking technology.  Ideas for improvement are met with disinterest (if you're lucky), or a trip to the doghouse for suggesting something so subversive as updating the manual."

697,,Honest Review - The glory days are over for JHA,2014-08-06,2.0,Software Engineer,"There are some intelligent employees (not management).  If you are lucky you can work from home some.  You get a laptop so you can work 24/7 from anywhere.  If you invest, the company continues to break record profits quarter after quarter by keeping costs down.","Since all of the employees got an email pleading for reviews on glassdoor to boost the company reputation, I guess I should spend my evening doing so.  They must realize it is getting harder to find skilled workers to come work here.
Simply put, this company pays well below market average.  If you decide to come work here, negotiate a good salary starting out or you will be stuck with a low salary the rest of your life here.  If you ask for a promotion or inquire that you are not being paid for your skill set and performance, management does nothing.  All promotions and favoritism are based purely off seniority of JHA years, not overall career experience.  
The annual review process takes 6 months from start to finish, and we still require self-appraisals.  Although reminded that annual merit increases is optional for the company to give to employees, it barely covers the cost of living increases for inflation.  Management here has no clue what is going on and is just a bunch of ""my hands are tied"" repeaters.  You can never get an innovative idea to go anywhere, as we acquire companies rather that innovate.
If you ask any tough questions to upper management, they say they will get back to you and you never hear a word.
I am not sure who does our salary market analysis, but the evidence of high performers leaving and the struggle to hire skilled workers is enough to prove we do not pay well.  Our strategy is to hire right out of college so we don't have to pay much.  So if you are a college kid reading this you are in luck, apply now.
Teams across the board are understaffed and management uses this strategy to keep costs low.  This is how we can continue to beat profits quarter after quarter.  They force employees to work longer hours to make up for hiring additional staff.
We get reminded that we have the best benefits around, and that was true oh so 5 years ago.  Times have changed and we have slipped a bit and other companies have caught up.  They continue to use this response anytime they are asked why we pay so little.
In summary, if you are a college kid or you don't care to get paid well or ever get promoted, JHA is a good place to work.  You will learn a lot from the intelligent employees that have stuck around so far, and then you can use those skills in your career."

The benefits are great and some of the best in the industry. You can advance if you are willing to work.  Promotions opportunities come to those who work for them.

Management can be overly conservative on some issues. There isn't as much synergy within different divisions of the company as there could be. For a company that is primarily technology oriented, it can be a bit backward technologically.

I feel like if someone applied here with my experience they'd pay him/her at least $10k more.

It's still good though.   The 401k plan is good.   On a more personal level, the company at the unit level needs to be managed better.

Managers usually come from other business and have no idea on how to manage a department.

There seems to be limited communication between departments and even less in documentation.   Managers seem to be very territorial and will not permit communication between departments.   New products are rolled out/implemented without notice, hence, the support team is left out in the cold and appears to be ""stupid"" when dealing with the customer.   FYI...the CEO is located in Allen, Texas but 95% of the employees are in San Diego.   What's wrong with this picture?   Also, a lot of units are short staffed so for an employee normally working days may be rescheduled to temporarily work swing/graveyard or weekends at least once a month -- it's a crap shoot."

Gradually, we've become more integrated with the corporate way of doing things, and that's been tough at times; it's a good thing, but a hard thing too.  One of the biggest challenges about evaluating JHA is that many of the offices represent acquisitions; the culture in Monett, MO is different than Norcross, GA is different than Allen, TX.

Health benefits are great; PPO is the base, so you can get care pretty much anywhere you want.  Salary is reasonable for the market you are in, and I'm a full time remote worker (which is a NICE perk).  Stock is available for purchase at a discount. Makes it tough to leave the company.","Every group has a different way of doing things, and there's a lot of assumptions about processes.  Usually not a problem, but if there's a big push to get intra-corporate project done, it doesn't go smoothly.  The corporate training I've attended has been really bad at times, but there's a big push for continual improvement, so things do get better over time.

People stay with the company a long time, so it's tough to advance.  I've worked with most of the same team for nearly 8 years, which is a long time in an IT company."

Not all divisions suffer from this if you are lucky enough to find yourself in the ProfitStar circle of influence you have it made.  But the other lines of business are just like the industries that they serve which is banking/Credit Unions.  

If you're looking at adding experience/stability to your resume this is the place.  Get on and stay a couple of years and you'll get a better job.  But understand you'll be paid 30% under market and will need to be available around the clock.","Management by crises myopic in view.  While most have advance degrees they have little real world experience in the industry.  Top management is clocking and collecting stock options, turning them over, just check the SEC form 4 filings.  Most perks are long gone so don't expect cool high tech goodies.  They'll just stare back at you and smile.

A ton of time is just wasted trying to keep up with relatively stupid policies and ""required"" training in things that don't even apply to your parts of the organization. It is more about appearing to do the right thing as opposed to doing the right thing. Although the company has many disparate subsidiaries, they want a one size fits all approach to everything. A lot of policies conflict with the reality of what happens in the field and what we have to do to get the job done. They can't make the perfect policy so to keep the business running (and making money and satisfying our customers) some policies are bent or just ignored.
2) Company has lost some of its cultural roots regarding employees. It used to be that employee satisfaction was more of a concern for top management. Now they will sacrifice employee satisfaction for short term stock price increases. 
3) A few very poor General Managers who are non-supportive and unknowledgeable. I think that they keep their jobs because of inertia and the businesses that they manage are just naturally doing good in spite of them.
4) Little bottom up communication, No way to get ideas out and evaluated. Some middle managers just close down all communication. This is almost a cultural thing now. A lot of people have given up trying to get ideas out because they'll be shut down. It only takes one person to kill any idea and there seems to be lot of people who kill ideas.

It is like a ""B"" list actor, which is better and ""C"" list, and better than no list at all.",In my department there was a lack of backbone at the top (director level). They knew there was a problem with the software development leadership but they did not do anything about it.
785,,Great company to work for,2012-10-06,3.0,,Solid company and recognized leader in the credit union software industry.  Work with talented individuals with a vast array of products and services.,"No concrete career pathing program where an employee can identify a career path or position they are interested in, and obtain the necessary skills to transition into that position."
786,,Best example of a psychopathic company I have ever worked for!,2012-09-29,1.0,,"Benefits are great, disability for a whole year, which you may need when they run you down as if a tank drove through you!","They will chew you up and spit you out, and make sure you are ruined.  Read the book 
Snakes in Suits: When Psychopaths Go to Work, to prepare yourself! Oh and advanced age is not looked upon kindly. This site suppresses bad comments regularly, so take ones you can see posted seriously!"
787,,Behind in Technology,2012-09-27,2.0,Senior Software Engineer,Excellent benefits and pretty stable employment,"Not flexible with the type of software used. Company stuck on their proprietary language which is procedural, and very slow in the transition to a object oriented language. If you are a software engineer looking to work with an object oriented language, and relational database, stay away from this company."
788,,"Great company, inexperienced leaders.",2012-09-26,3.0,Anonymous Employee,"Environment is fast paced, fun and engaging.","Supervisors and Managers have no experience in leadership, coaching or otherwise."

Average associates (employees) are good people
Company has a solid grip on its 'niche'","Work/life balance not what they claim it is.
Employees at main campus in small company town favored above all others.
Most management levels rife with cronyism.
Publicly held so focus is 100% on revenue - no true concern for employees - no matter what they may claim"
790,,Great Benefits,2012-08-16,5.0,Programmer Analyst,"Benefits are great; low employee cost for health insurance, 19 days PTO/year, Flexible work schedule and remote work","Office environment is noisy, close quarters cubicles without sound reduction makes it difficult to concentrate"
791,,Good Company,2012-07-28,4.0,Anonymous Employee,"Strong management team

Good work/life balance

Good benefits package

Strong focus on customer service

Flexible working arrangements","Geographically challenged - company is not that large, but because they are spread out over the entire country, it is easy to get ""lost in the shuffle."" This can limit growth opportunities.

Due to acquisitions, company does not always leverage synergies among different divisions well.

Management struggles with maintaining a very high level of customer service within a growing company."
792,,Good company,2012-07-17,4.0,Anonymous Employee,"Despite going ""corporate"" the individual divisions still manage to maintain some of that ""small company"" feel (since most of them used to be small companies).",Banking software... not the most exciting stuff in the world
793,,Great company; great benefits!,2012-06-29,4.0,Operations Manager,"Health care benefits are very good, and hte company does try to keep their compensation packages very competitive.  The culture is very laid-back, but professional.","Very few that I can think of; I do think that because JHA/Profitstars is made up of several small companies, there's a lot of right-hand/left-hand loss in communication."

796,,A great place to work!,2012-02-23,5.0,,"Jack Henry works very hard at creating a pleasant work environment for it's employees. The companies founders believed that valuing their employees was a top priority and the company seems to strive very hard to keep this philosophy in place, dispite growing pains.  Employee opinions are sought and valued, as shown by the variety of  avenues the company provides to  voice ideas and complaints directly to upper management.    Compensation packages are excellent as well.  Overall, JHA is truly is a great company to work for.","While upper management makes a great deal of effort to show employees they are valued, mid- level management seems less inclined to pursue these same ideals.  In addition, the good ole boy ""I'm promoting you because we hang out together on the weekends"" is still very much alive within some departments of the company.  Managing people is about motivating your employees to give their best and making sure the company'svalues are adopted throughout ALL the ranks.  Crunching numbers and meeting budgets is only part of what it takes to be a good manager. Acknowledging accomplishments, from simple pats on the back to promoting individuals fairly, based solely on knowledge and accomplishments is a great motivator.  Being able to truly understand your employees needs and show empathy to them further promotes the ""valued employee"" company focus.  JHA' s mid-level management misses the mark in this area."
797,,The best company I have ever worked with or for.,2012-02-13,5.0,,"Great ethics. Good management. Fairness and openness. Employees are treated with respect. At least in my experience, there is above average consideration of work/life balance.","At least in Monett, the salary scale is somewhat disappointing but that is understandable given the location. It is at least comparable for the area."
798,,Avoid like the plague.....,2012-01-13,1.0,Senior Software Engineer,"Benefits - Great Insurance, 401K matching
Holidays and Vacation Time","Corporate management is a joke.  If you like being treated like a child and constantly lied to then this is the place to work.  Beware, corporate management at this company is part of a ""good ole boy"" network, meaning if something goes wrong at that level, it is swept under the rug even if it is public knowledge. 

Don't expect cost of living pay increases, management will tell you they are coming and most likely will deduct you pay because the company wants to acquire another technology firm, so they have to cut cost somewhere..... your pocket.

No budget for career growth, training, etc.... They expect you to learn this on your own.  The will compensate you for training, but only after you have to shell out the money yourself, which is very expensive, and has to be approved by management."
799,,JHA is an outstanding place to work.,2011-12-04,5.0,Operations Manager,JHA understands that their employees are their most important asset and works hard to help their employees provide the best customer service in the industry.,"Many divisions and departments that need to work together, and sometimes the left and right hands do not know what is happening."
