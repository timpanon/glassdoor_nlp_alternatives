515,,Distinctly Average,2016-05-24,3.0,Associate,Jefferies provide a decent employer if you have already worked in finance. It is very risk averse and avoids even the most vanilla of derivative products.,Junior staff are paid relatively little compared to similar pay packages at investment banks and promotion is more weighted toward time served rather than merit. If you are a seasoned financier then you might do well if you can negotiate the extremely tight balance sheet requirements but if you are a junior then I would not make this my first choice.

Last years management conference, they completely forgot to introduce any of the senior management on the stage. It just simply skipped both of their minds, which was nonprofessional. The business has outgrown the leadership, and yet the leadership believes that they are still the smartest guys in the room. That is comical since their stock price has been declining for five years, and current leadership has made painfully expensive missteps in strategy and execution, costing shareholders hundreds of millions in nonrecoverable losses. Not only are they screwing up, but they seem to feel that nothing ever is their fault. There is always someone or something else to blame. Their explanations are getting worn out. If the leadership was graded over there by the staff, my guess is that at best they would be a D. Especially after another failed year, and with the stock near all time lows, they give each other a 5 million dollar bonus. What an FU to the firm and its shareholders."

Generally a ""shoot first, ask questions later"" mentality.  Great place for self-starters.","Zero firm-wide culture despite Rich & Brian's monthly, repetitive newsletter.  High turnover and ""celebrity"" hires means that culture will never be formed.  Since LUK acquisition, R&B much less visible and much less in touch.  Unlike the big banks, senior managers and less senior managers are rarely moved or exposed to other areas.  Accordingly, the next layer of executives will never come from the inside, making development of culture not possible.  Mentoring is non-existent unless someone happens to take you under their wing.

615,,Good to place to work if you're hungry,2015-02-01,5.0,Investment Banking Associate,"1) Can be a junior person and, if you prove you can handle it, can run transactions from start to finish. 

2) Jefferies is about hustle, people work very hard, and crave competing and winning (a theme that has been and continues to be noticed across Wall Street).

3) CEO is a very passionate guy and attends a ton of I-banking pitches with clients.... many firms claim ""senior level support"" to clients and transactions, but its a known fact that a CEO of a trillion dollar bank with massive businesses across the world can't possibly stand by that kind of a commitment; Jefferies CEO and #2's ability to stand behind clients with their time, energy, and deal-making skill is a real advantage for Jefferies. 

4) With a large capital base supporting the growing I-bank, it is now safe(r) from the market sensitive risks that hurt the company following a somewhat baseless and poorly thought-out research report a few years back. 

5) Not a bank holding company... this is a big marketing point for Jefferies, but it is nonetheless an advantage.  Regulatory bodies across the world are restricting the type of business banks can participate in (i.e., high yield debt). Bank holding companies are being forced by their credit committees to turn down good clients that are levered up above regulatory standards.  Jefferies is picking up this business.","1) As mentioned in the Pros column, bankers work hard.  It is not for everybody.  Good junior bankers here tend to be very efficient (or quickly learn to be) and commit a great deal of time and bandwidth to the job.  Not necessarily a con depending on the person, but it is certainly a reality for some

2) As a more efficient firm (not speaking to comp) sometimes the resources larger BHC firms enjoy are not available to junior bankers at Jefferies.  We get more than we need to do our job, but occasionally you notice a shortfall (i.e., no access to certain research reports).  Again, not really a big con, but costs on non-comp items are managed closely."

+ Good health plan","+ Terrible working environment
+ Claw-backs and extensive restrictions on bonuses
+ No cohesive culture, all IBD teams have their own culture
+ Every man for themselves and blame culture
+ Some very incompetent people at the top"
656,,Great Company to work for,2013-11-17,5.0,,Great work environment with even better people,Cant think of any at this time
657,,Interview,2013-10-23,5.0,,"It's relaxing interview. I was asked some questions about finance, like swap yield curve, options and futures. And I did some questions about what I did in my academic courses, what my contribution was in the project.",I think they hired the highest qualified people. People as a employee at Jefferies will have lots of knowledge about the financial markets. Your responsibility ranges from the beginning to the end.
658,,Left in the garbage,2013-10-14,1.0,Information Technology,"There are not many Pro's to talk about, the only thing that comes to mind was having longevity, however all that has changed now.  The benefits where fairly good compared to other companies.","Treated like a second class citizen, support staff is an afterthought, the only thing that drives this company is their producers.  Staff is treated like an expense that no one wants to on their budget sheet.  Leaving no opportunity for growth and little opportunity to enjoy working around fellow employees."
659,,Great place to develop an IB/securities career,2013-09-08,5.0,,"Dynamic company growing market share, motivated employees, good work/life balance - generally the firm gets it right as the results have shown.",Typical downsides associated with working for any investment bank - nothing that you wouldn't expect to encounter at other similar institutions.
660,,not somewhere to start your career,2013-09-04,3.0,Analyst,great people to work with....infact the best i have!,"no career progression, which means no wage progression"
661,,over worked and under paid,2013-08-15,2.0,Anonymous Employee,Really not much pros at all.,Too many to list here.
662,,decent place,2013-08-05,3.0,Associate,"Excellent IT to work with, good HR profile, great people to work with. Robust processes in which to get things done with clear workflows to track items.",Rigid pay policies and lack of transparency around them. Advancement within teams and to new teams is not always transparent - many senior positions appointed through networking and not through advertisement and interviews.
663,,"strong entrepreneurial culture, good management",2013-07-26,4.0,Anonymous Employee,"pay, culture, people work hard",nothing bad to say here
664,,Worse company I ever worked for,2013-07-04,1.0,Web Developer,"Pay was the most competitive I ever had, gave a great sense of global perspective.","Horrible work/life balance, disrespectful co-workers who made the most gross generalizations and racially insensitive remarks ever. Boss was endorsed and promoted for being a small minded jerk who even dipped chewing tobacco right in the middle of the office. Constantly made fun of people with disabilities and try to do nothing but cover up their awful behavior."
665,,It was an enjoyable place to work,2013-06-28,4.0,Anonymous Employee,The people were friendly and great place to learn,Not much room for movement
666,,Tough hours and work environment,2013-06-25,1.0,Analyst,Pays well for someone right out of undergrad,Sell themselves as a flat organization and different than other investment banks in terms of respecting your work/life balance.  They are no such thing.  Just as bad (and if you include the below the street pay and exit opportunities they are worse) as any investment banking gig out there
667,,"fair, conservative, no growth",2013-04-25,3.0,Anonymous Employee,"conservative, sails through tough times","B leage, too conservative, cheap"
668,,associate ibd,2013-03-06,3.0,Investment Banking Associate,overall decent people. some have a chip on shoulder bc not at a bigger bank,work on smaller deals that take up just as much time as bigger ones. zero brand name recognition if you try to move on
669,,"Does not value junior bankers, quickly growing company with opportunity to make impact",2013-03-06,3.0,Investment Banking Analyst,"Some deal teams are lean and you get a lot of responsibility and interaction with senior bankers and clients as an analyst.  More opportunities to run a deal.

Jefferies used to provide good perks (lunch, mobile plan reimbursement, huge discount to LA Sports Club for analysts, etc.) but then they disappeared during the downturn.","During the downturn, they laid off junior bankers first and then made aggressive strategic senior hires.  

They claim that analyst bonuses were on par with the rest of the street, but very few actually get that top bonus relative to other banks.

Certain IB groups have a terrible reputation.  Tech (formerly Jefferies Broadview) used to do great deals,  but now run by mostly political senior bankers."
670,,Company has a serious lack of communication within members the team and between management and employees.,2013-02-24,3.0,,They are willing to pay well as long as you contribute. New hires are also paid very well base.,Bad credit rating. One minor crisis and the company will get blown out of the water.
671,,Poor development,2013-02-18,2.0,Analyst,"Lots of deal flow
Lots of pitching
Long hours
Good place to start if this is your best choice. Top of the middle market","Poor development - mid tier is very weak, you either come in knowing all the finance / accounting or you're out of luck. Can be annoying working for seniors with unreasonable demands who have no idea how to do what they're asking you to do."
672,,"IT Dept is low expectations, low output. A few stars carry a lot of low contributing head count. Can be bureaucratic.",2013-02-14,2.0,Vice President,"Potential career growth if you are willing to fight for it. Old guard (Equities) is ripe for shakeup if you have the guts and can play politics.
(IT) Easy to fade into the low productivity curve and exert minimal effort. International opportunities.","Sometimes felt like a special education prison (IT)
TPS reports can be a drag. A lot of hairy legacy processes."
673,,Poor staffing and resource management,2013-01-03,1.0,Analyst,There are some driven motivated and intelligent bankers who you can learn a great deal from.,Some of the team members are very poor managers and do not take an intelligent approach to the pitch generation or deal management process. The high attrition rate of employees reflects this shortcoming.
674,,Unprofessional to an incompetent degree,2012-12-24,2.0,Vice President,Easy to shine in short bursts,unprofessional environment populated by friends and family rather than by the talent.  Senior management unaware that a company is made up of more than just sales and trading - it actually requires capable IT and middle office as well as a thoughtful investment in infrastructure and assets that support the business process.  Penny wise and often pound foolish coupled with extravagant waste thrown at the wrong people
675,,Review for 2011,2012-12-13,4.0,Equity Research Associate,"Good pay, good people, but very intense","intense, little support, not good work life balance"

677,,Equity research - Glad I got out when I did,2012-11-15,1.0,Equity Research Associate,"-Serves as a good ""boot camp"" for people new to sell side
-You will appreciate all future jobs much more
-You learn the ""red flags"" of a work environment
-Decent resume-builder","-Unending hours, not great pay under senior level
-Absolutely no regard whatsoever for employees as human beings. Actually not exaggerating.
-Zero, and I mean zero, HR supervision. Picture 1960's.
-All the negatives of unvestment banking lifestyle but not the pay"
678,,Associate,2012-11-02,3.0,Investment Banking Associate,Great momentum for the firm since the recession in 2008. Picked up many talent along the way and is a fast paced firm.,Lack of work life balance. Different position within the investment banking industry being in the middle market space. Working on improving the position though.
679,,Great company. Amazing culture. Quickly rising to the top,2012-10-09,5.0,Investment Banking Analyst,Junior level employees given lots of challenging and meaningful work. Great exit opportunities. Excellent opportunity to work with intelligent and driven people.,"Long hours as an analyst, but doable. Limited deal opportunities due to smaller balance sheet, but that is changing quickly fortunately."
680,,"Outstanding company, great promise for the future",2012-07-22,4.0,Investment Banking Associate,"Jefferies' investment banking franchise is fast-growing and well-positioned for the future. If you want to make a career in investment banking, it's one of the best places to go.","Work/life balance is nonexistent. If you want to be an investment banker, be prepared to regularly work 100+ hour weeks and not take vacations for a year at a time."
681,,Great place to work,2012-06-30,4.0,,Working here is more relaxed than the big institutuions - the hours are also less. The people here give a good environment to work in,The bonuses paid to back office staff last year were very poor. Although this may be industry wide with the current economical situation
682,,Jefferies,2012-06-08,3.0,Equity Research Associate,Growing opportunity but possibly too fast,"Given environment and growth expectation, job security is minimal"
683,,Middle Management is a major gating factor to taking this company to the next level,2012-04-09,2.0,Associate,"Executive management is top notch, too bad middle management does not follow suit","There are middle managers at this company who are dinosaurs that are NOT willing to grasp new technologies; as these technologies threaten their existance, i.e. sand box.
Dealt with some children type mentalities in the technology department, i.e. I was here first attitude and I will force you to reinvent the wheel and waste company resources, i.e. sand box
Union-like mentality, 'seniority' supersedes everything else, its not about your skill-set, its about how long you have been with the company.
Co-workers purposely hide information and provide erroneous information for political/personal gain
There are very few team players in technology, its a lone ranger mentality, I don't think many played sports."
684,,Good learning experience.  Somewhat abusive culture.,2012-02-25,2.0,Investment Banking Associate,"Commercially aggressive
Broad product and deal flow","Lack of integrity
Poor culture
Revolving door"

Fewer chances to win deals"

688,,"Great place, good management, great vision",2011-12-28,4.0,,Good growth opportunities with a growing firm. Focussed management team with vision. Talented individuals from reputed firms working together towards a common goal.,"As the firm grows it develops qualities of a mammoth organisation, and often tends to overlook individuals and their contributions"
689,,"Great company, quirky, unfair group leadership",2011-12-07,3.0,Capital Markets Analyst,"Competitive pay, smaller groups, some great managers, a pure investment bank, great company outings, workhard playhard","Mostly great managers, however, my group seemed disinterested in mentoring/fostering/training the junior guys."
