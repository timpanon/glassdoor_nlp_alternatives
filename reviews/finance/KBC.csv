Almost no crunch/overtime.","For the Touch project:

Code reviews are used for hammer down anyone the reviewer doesn't like. If the reviewer wants to hurt your career, he just has to write 400 comments in your pull request and make it so that it takes 10x longer for you to deliver. 

Drive-by comments on reviews are common. Specially coming from the God developers that look down on the rest. God developers are a couple of developers that have been there since the beginning of the project and have gathered so much political clout that they might as well be the owners of the company. 

Everything is super hierarchical. They even have documents on confluence describing the development structure as an army; With soldiers at the bottom, lieutenants, generals, etc,

Career progression is almost non existent unless you play the political game. The usual progression is developer->functional analyst->manager.

The only opinion that matters is that of the God Developers. A lot of them are part of the Core Team. You will be just a cog in a very dumb machine.

No innovation going on at all. The work is brain-dead boring.

Leaving the project Touch, to do something else is considered some sort of promotion. That's sad."

- Excellent pension plan","- Serious problems related to 'how to do' for nearly everything. Workflows are not properly defined, lots of confusions, everyone doing things following their own understanding;
- The company doesn't care about you, if you are happy or not with your job, there is no One-2-One meetings, no catch-ups. There is a huge gap between managers and employees;
- There is little or no investment in training or certification programs, at least for high skilled positions;
- Every single change, even those from your day-to-day job is very difficult and very slow to be authorized the implementation, often requiring 5 or more different approvals, many times by people that clearly are not prepared to take such decisions;
- There is little to no bonuses or profit participation, even though this is a financial company. It's a shame having less than 2% of your annual salary in a bonus that will be cut in half by taxes"

Staff on your level are mostly nice. Sports and social always run events.","No real respect shown from top to bottom. Staff have to log everything they do in a day into a system to an absolute tee. If there is a slight discretion your manager will pull you up on it. If you go to another persons desk for more than a minute you will be told to go and sit back down like a child. Senior management treat those below them extremely poorly, as if they are not even there. 

Reviews are done frequently, but for every positive, there is always a negative. If you worked well over the month they will pull you up either on productivity or QA score. QA score is done by two higher up employees who have the final say and more times than not your manager will side with them. 

Often times progress and treatment depends on how good mates you are with your manager. Managers will often give people they are mates with an easier run of things so it is not a level playing field.

On top of this the salary is a good bit below the industry average, bonuses are very poor as result. For the amount you have to put up with, the money simply isn't worth it.

I could go on and on but there is a character limit on this."

Style of management is to 'kick', not to lead 
HR staff often told 'if you are going to act like children, then we will treat you like children'
Oppressive environment 
No development opportunities (sneered at)
Certain senior HR people plagiarise other peoples work to ensure self preservation (and to secure their bonus). 
Performance management is non-existant. Staff are constantly marked down in yearly review and NEVER rewarded. 
Policies and procedures are not adhered to internally. 
Toxic environment and culture 
HR sick leave is really high.
HR staff turnover is high. People are scared to 'speak up' and when they do, they are bullied out. Others resign.

I've  never  worked in a place that was so up its own behind. Nor have I ever  worked in a place  where both men and women  cried from stress on a daily basis. 

The hubs are a joke. You can't do anything in them apart from take the customers  request  and send it onwards  to HO. You must  also look like a model to get these roles while normal people  are employed  by HO.

KBC tries to portray itself as a company that is the future  for its staff and customers but fails by not having  the simple things like systems that work in place to enable  you to do your job.

Forget about climbing  the ladder  unless your old KBC staff.  The oldies obviously  know better than you and will shaft you  the first chance they get to get a pay rise, glory or a promotion.

They seem adamant  on hiring  people  who can't  read to work in their administration department  and this is where the biggest problem  the bank has comes from.  

This black hole affects  every area of the bank and results  in you getting torn  apart by customers as you try to explain  to them how some moron  who makes the same mistakes over and over, but still gets away with it as they are old KBC staff was only able to carry out part of their request  before  losing the page that had the rest of the instruction  on it.

The old KBC management  are ridiculous. They throw unrealistic  and unquantifiable  targets at you.  It's embarrassing  to see how these oldies  interact with the new arrivals  as they will go out  of their way to hold up progress. 

The stress levels are off the chart due to the daily  frustration you will endure due to the companies inability to implement  adequate  systems  that do the job.  

The customer  service team has it the worst. They are the front line and are the most abused as every  department  sends their mess that way.  It doesn't  help that it's managed  by a souless  machine and her self appointed lieutenants."
