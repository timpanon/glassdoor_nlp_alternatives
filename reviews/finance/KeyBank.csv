First and second line supervisors have never served in the unit they manage.
Staffing is not sufficient for the amount of fraud.

112,,"Good Job, Horrid Support",2022-01-29,2.0,Financial Wellness Consultant,"Easy to hit production goals. If you're in a branch with decent walk-in traffic, you'll get clients who are frustrated with their main banks being closed all the time and want to open an account or two with you.

Leads disposition is decent for the most part, except a few clients who will ask you not to call them again. Varies greatly depending on location and clientele.

A lot of learning opportunities in the field of financial services. Great programs to take part in if you're pursuing a higher position. Great managers and coworkers who are great at what they do.","Little to no support for retail branches and employees.

Phone customer service dumps all client inquiries and problems onto the branch, even when the problem is in their power to resolve. 

We've called property management countless times asking for our recycling bin to be picked up but they have not come for the past two years.

ELs and ARLs are so busy with meetings that they cannot provide meaningful support to branch employees. Most of them don't even have time to answer their phones unless you call 3+ times and leave many voicemails. 

If you're in a snowy area, get familiar with driving in the snow and ice as there is no support for employees that have difficult commute.

If you're in an area with a lot of service requests, don't expect ARLs to count that in when they look at your scorecard. Even if you spend your work days taking care of service requests and keeping existing clients happy, none of that matters because you haven't opened enough accounts or credit cards.

Work-life balance actually suffered when we switched to working from home, as management expected us to be online about 10 or more hours a day and we frequently had to work weekends. Calling in sick was viewed with suspicion once work-from-home was standard. Very little training was provided unless you went out of your way to expressly ask for it directly.

- Contract positions are NOT - contract to direct hire like they sold you at the interview and also wrote in the job description + emails 

- Toxic teams cultures exist so beware of where you are placed

- People do not respect work/life balance and will book meetings even if you have a prior meeting booked

212,,Gone downhill,2021-10-29,3.0,Branch Manager,The pay is very competitive compared to other banks.,"The IC plan has gotten more and more confusing which makes it harder for people to understand how they get their bonus pay. After working 100% in person through a pandemic, there was no relief when it came to sales in the tough sales environment we were in (with interest rates being terrible and people wanting to avoid risk). A lot of the upper management who have the luxury of working from home are so disconnected on what actually goes on day to day in the branches and the demands are pretty high. As a branch manager you are consistently being stretched so thin which take a toll on work life balance. As a result they would do things like ‘pizza day’ or ‘jeans Friday’ which is a little bit of a joke. When I first started 5 years ago, I thought it was a great place to work for but I have seen the decline throughout the years and many many many people who have been with the company for a long time are now leaving. Also, after trying to get out of retail for my mental health— other internal job opportunities were hard to even get an interview with. Which seems crazy because I worked there for 5 years. I would just get an automatic email saying ‘we went with another candidate’ without a person even reaching out to me. So disheartening— as I am a HARD worker who is capable or learning anything and everything. This was ultimately the last straw for me."

Technology is often a joke, and product development and/or upgrades is constantly over-looked. ALL WHITE 30/40 SOMETHING MALES IN LEADERSHIP IN ENTERPRISE PAYMENTS.

- People are locked into their positions for a long time, not much room to advance upward.
- Expect only a 'congratulations' email or annual placard after achieving a large goal, don't expect a financial reward or notable salary increase. Why? Because they sent you a 'thank you' email.
- Very low headcount for each department, even if volume increases. Team is expected to absorb extra volume without additional help.
- No training manuals or formalized training. It's all kept in random files. New systems come in with little warning and bugs/fixes on the fly. Keep your own notes."

271,,Glad I left,2021-09-10,2.0,Personal Banker,Good amount of PTO and good 401k plan,"I worked for Key for almost five years. They do little to nothing to reward their employees. In the time I worked there, I was always told how great I was performing and never given a raise in my yearly review. In 2020 during the pandemic my branch manager left the company right as I was starting my new position. I was left to learn my new role without any proper training and left in charge of a branch in a shutdown. I helped everyone who had questions for the manager and even ran in and out of the branch (handling large amounts of cash) to those waiting outside in the drive thru all summer. Key wouldn’t even bother to spend money on us to have water to drink. We had to bring our own or go buy water. If that doesn’t show how cheap they are as a multi billion dollar company I don’t know what else will.  During my last yearly review I was told how great I performed during the pandemic and all they could muster was a measly 50 cent raise. My manager told me my raise was confidential (it’s not) and that other people didn’t get raises. ( I found out the person I was training with zero banking experience was making more than 2 dollars an hour more than me) This was the breaking point for me. Other cons: The break room in the branches is a empty room without any TV or access to phone service. (And you are always on break alone, so no one to talk to) so everyone sits in their car for an hour on lunch. The branches have always been severely understaffed, it isn’t uncommon to only have 2 employees present. (You don’t get a break on those days either) It is a security risk and Key doesn’t care about it or they would staff the branches better.  While I mentioned that they give a good amount of PTO you can’t actually use it most of the year. You have to plan your pto with your coworkers in January for the full year and 2 people cannot be off at the same time. This ends up blocking out 6 months that you cannot pick from and what company makes employees plan EVERY day off at the beginning of the year? Good luck if someone invites you somewhere for a long weekend a month in advance… you’ll be lucky to get that off and if you do they make you feel guilty about it. Sales policy is horrible, it’s a 100% or nothing model, and the payout sucks. I was over 120% to my quarterly sales goal and I was lucky to get $900 before taxes.  Keep in mind they say your going to make so much money in sales in your interview… it simply is not true. Anyway, I could go on and on. I’m glad I left, after my time there I think Key is the most greedy company I’ve ever worked for and wouldn’t recommend it."

It rewards helping our clients regardless of how much money they have or can borrow. I know others disagree with me, but honestly - top performers who were doing their best by their clients before are still doing well now and those who work in lower income areas are finally getting paid for helping ALL clients versus how many dollars they bring in.","I feel strongly that I can only speak for Washington state because there seems to be significant differences between states. That said, I came to KeyBank with 7 years of experience - not only in banking, but in lending, mortgage, investments, and leadership. I was offered $19/hr and thought it was generous...It did not take me long to realize that I was severely underpaid. After 4 years with the company I brought to light that I was paid significantly less than coworkers (most of which were males) with a lower title and far less experience - they absolutley heard me and got me to $24/hr with their ""silver bullet"" and it was a special situation.....I'm coming up on 6 years with the company now and am currently training a new banker who had an internship with Key (which is apprently some kind of gold) and she is literally making more than I am....My advice - Key can really be a GREAT place to work IF you find yourself in a good team. Unfortunately, there are good teams and bad teams and it sucks to get yourself there and it sucks that I really can't tell you that we are ""One Key"" because I'd love to. My other advice - get what you're worth when you start because otherwise you're going to be fighting for ""raises"" your entire career whether or not you're paid what you're worth. I promise, I love my job - I just don't aways love my company. This isn't a scorned review, it's literally someone who has been in the business for a long time and appreciates what Key does and just wishes they expanded what they ""stand for"" to their employees."

-Potential to earn high commissions through KIS if you are willing to sell bad investment products
-6% 401k match with fidelity
-Employee pricing on lending and investment products","-Since the change of CEO, the company has gone way downhill. Prior to the change, they hired primarily from within, offered a great commission plan and were very community oriented and charitable. The first few actions the CEO has taken since the change were to change the commission plan so fewer people received good payouts, increase the licensed banker expectations to unrealistic levels so that they would have an excuse to pay for less licensed individuals and increase audits and compliance procedures so they would have an excuse to cut staff without offering severance (I know several great employees who have been fired recently due to petty things like not fitting the whole name of a trust with a ridiculously long name into their dated system that can't accommodate names beyond a certain length). All of this was after the CEO publicly announced planning to reduce staff and close branches ""to meet the challenges of forced digital adoption due to COVID"".
-Hard work is not recognized. If you are 150% to all your goals but one, you will be publicly called out on and berated for missing that single category.
-The health plan is a high deductible joke of a plan. I regularly visit the doctor to refill prescriptions and have had expensive specialist visits in the last year. Key's health insurance plan hasn't paid a dime. You might as well pay for dread disease insurance or a private plan.
-Endless meetings and trainings that serve no purpose but to gain facetime and show ""motivation and drive"" for the host of the meeting.
-Hire from within between different areas of the bank is all but dead. I've applied to multiple entry level roles outside the retail network that I was objectively qualified for (graduate degree with excellent GPA, management experience and multiple industry certs) and received the ""we've decided to pursue more qualified candidates"" email without even a phone interview
-I was hired told that this was a service focused role and that product suitability is the primary concern and that we are there to truly help the clients achieve financial wellness. Now the financial wellness review guide is a thinly veiled tool to push as many products as possible and as licensed bankers we are expected to write solo sales off of a portfolio of objectively bad investment and insurance products with outrageous expense ratios and poor performance."

Support departments like online banking, fraud, or underwriting are woefully understaffed, poorly trained, or will route you in circles even as an employee. Company instituted a culture of ""One Key"", a bank wide effort to support other employees or provide simpler assistance...except no contact center rep has even heard of the phrase. 

Unethical sales practices, in my experience, were supported and hidden in an effort to boost manager, branch, and area sales performance even leading to the dismissal of an area leader and branch manager in my tenure. Area leadership is retaliatory and frequently disregard the safety of employees. Wildfires impacted the area, my branch was in an area at a level two evacuation order and my area leader knowingly and willingly advised staff to continue to work in a building filled with smoke. When confronted about the safety impact, they feigned expertise in wildfire management saying the level two evacuation order one day versus another ""weren't the same"". 

Direction of the company shifts like a fart in the wind. Area leadership specifically created a ""with me or against me"" dynamic by labelling individuals as ""change detractors"" if any dissenting views were shared. 

Best way to sum up the sales attitude and service to clients was coined by a long term branch manager ""if there's nothing in it for you, 1-800-key-2you""."

474,,Avoid if you can. The culture is toxic.,2021-04-02,1.0,QA Engineer,Good tech stack if you wish to learn. Working there was a lesson learnt in more ways than one.,"They simply don't care about your concerns. They make everything complicated and management doesn't give a damn if you exist or not. When a new team merged with KeyBank, they made it a point to bully, intimidate, demean the existing employees into resigning and only retaining those 'Yes Boss' types. They made it hard to work from home, take sick days and micro-managed the life out of people that eventually everyone in the team left.

The culture is extremely toxic. The guy who came in to manage team was a bully who would speak disrespectfully to the office in-charge - in front of everyone in the company, humiliating her. He eventually fired her saying the role wasn't needed anymore, only to hire a young woman, weeks later. 

Once he read out 'What is the difference between Leader and a Boss' and how he is a leader, FROM A PIECE OF PAPER. 

The heads made it entirely difficult and extremely hard for pregnant women to work, as far as going to recommend an immobile pregnant woman to be put on performance review, because she asked for an accommodative work schedule, as she was not able to totally walk due to medical condition.

They demoted another effective team lead and made her resign on her own accord. She was highly accomplished and vital part of the team.

Your voice doesn't matter, your opinions aren't respected, you aren't respected."

Company makes employees test the software with customers that's designed to phase out in branch positions. Offices are small, with all the tropes that come along with that, such as gossip and gaslighting. The processing of transactions in accounts lends itself more prone to charging customer fees, then requires refunds at the branch level causing dollar outages that go against your metrics for bonus.

They go above and beyond to show that in benefits, PTO, etc.","Working as a FWC can be a bit stressful because you act as both a teller and a banker. There are weeks where you spend the entire week on the teller line and not a single second second at your desk meeting with clients. Goals are a bit lower compared to someone with the title of “personal banker” and not “financial wellness consultant”, but you still lose out on time with clients while you’re on the line."
635,,Great place to work depending on your job role,2021-01-09,3.0,Branch Manager,"Benefits, competitive pay, coworkers, contests with prizes","Rarely able to take lunch breaks due to being grossly understaffed, new initiatives to introduce technology (financial wellness and small business digital reviews, appointment scheduler, referrals to other lines of business, Zoom calls and constant WebEx conference calls) leave us working all day just to check off boxes to meet “activity” goals, leaving almost no time to do meaningful work towards sales goals or client service, not being able to take PTO if needed due to staffing issues ( most time off for the year needs to be scheduled in January so upper management can plan for staffing issues) micromanagement at such a high level that it’s impossible to run your branch effectively, between your ARL and EL branch managers essentially have two bosses micromanaging them at the same time all the time, literally IMPOSSIBLE goals that will prevent Branch Managers from making any more money than their flat rate salary, unreasonable amounts of pressure put on Branch Managers to the point where all the BM’s in my area are starting to develop mental health issues and are becoming physically ill and ultimately quitting, having to have knowledge of close to 20 different systems, all of which are outdated or built improperly and cause severe issues for clients and branch staff that are trying to use these systems to solve service issues, apathetic back office staff that have no interest in solving client service requests and just pass off the requests or reject them all together whiteout explanation or suggestions on different ways to solve them, the constant hounding about not getting more business out of clients that applied for PPP loans is borderline harassment ( these people are looking for government assistance, now is not the time to be aggressively hounding them to buy into other products and services if they don’t need them). All in other other job roles seem to have fun at work and seem to stay with the company longer. If you take a position as a BM prepare to want to leave before your first year, nervous breakdowns, having no mental energy to have a personal life outside of work, calls or texts while you’re out on vacation ( I literally got a text from my ARL as I was boarding a plane home from Miami because he was upset that my PB didn’t jump on the area conference call). The pay and benefits will sound very attractive when you’re offered the position but be warned that it is not a sustainable job role. Humans are not equipped to be handle this amount of stress."

There were branch managers that also had business taken from their book and diverted to other branches in retaliation.

I really liked the manager that hired me but she moved locations not long after I started. The new manager that was hired was new to the management role and did not know how to manage at all. As a new employee and new to banking I didn't feel like I was coached the proper way and found myself at teller row most of the time instead of at my desk in my banker role. I lasted 9 months before I moved on to another bank. Most of this is circumstantial but I do feel like upper management could have stepped in to help move me to a busier location.

Unable to move their stock price and unable to increase revenue, their only option is to cut. They are laying off, they're closing branches. There are no innovative people in the chain of management (you can tell by their bizarre advertising campaign along 480 with some guy being excited about their abysmal mobile app), so their only plan is to outsource and cut jobs to look more appealing to a buyer.

Don't work here, their only plan is to get rid of any staff that they can.

I left Key for a new job about two years ago because I saw the writing on the wall, and indeed it has come to pass much of IT has been outsourced. I felt so strongly about hearing this news I felt the need to comment to warn anyone else thinking of working for this company that only views you as something to be cut: stay away."

887,,Branches are always scrambling for help but won't hire more people,2019-10-21,1.0,Part Time Teller,"Decent pay, PTO right when you start, schedule is made 1 month at a time, you get to dress business casual which was kind of fun for me, the branch closed at 4 Monday-Thursday instead of 5 like a lot of banks","Always short staffed. Branches like to move people around and there's nothing you can do about it. Basically you work where they decide to move you or quit. Branches constantly need help from other locations but won't hire more people. Management at my branch was.. erratic and temperamental? To say the least, and everyone knew it. VERY high turnover rate. They say they'll pay for college and you can do whatever major you want, but expect open availability 100% of the time and will not accommodate for class times even if that's when you're usually off anyways, will only pay for certain majors, and it's hard to get them to pay anything at all from what I've heard. PTO isn't just vacation--it's sick time, if you have to call off for an emergency, if you have to come in an hour late or leave an hour early for a doctor's appointment, if you have to go home sick and you're still scheduled for x amount of hours, and it's vacation time. So it may seem like you have a lot starting off but you really don't. A lot of the time you'll be the only teller and it's very difficult and stressful for the entire branch. My job title was 20 hour teller and I was usually scheduled much more than that. Close to 30 hours a lot of the time and I did not want any more than 20. You HAVE to work what you're scheduled. They made me work 25+ hours every week, almost full time when anyone went on vacation (which was typically once a month during the warmer months), and 30 hours a week at least one week out of the month even though I made it very clear that I only wanted 20 hours period. My job title was ""20 Hour Teller"". Very rarely was I scheduled less than 24ish hours. They did not say anything about this during the hiring process. You have to work a lottttt of Saturdays. I was told I would work every other Saturday or 2 Saturdays per month. That was completely wrong. Most of the time I would get 3 Saturdays per month and my lead teller would get at most 2. If there was an extra Saturday I would ALWAYS get more Saturday shifts per month than my lead even though they were supposed to be split evenly between us. One of our top goals was to get people to use self service. So basically our main goal was to make people not come into the bank. They want you to use the ATM and online banking for everything. They staff us accordingly and it just stresses everyone out."

Area leaders would play favorites and walk by you without even acknowledging you are there. Very cold and two faced. Even though they brag about how important work home life balance is, they absolutely expect you to work far over the norm and truly do not care about your life. I witnessed one area leader tell a new mother that she will spend 2 days away from her children for a manager meeting, and she ""better think of something"" to be there.  The manager meeting ended up being a complete waste of time as we spent the meeting listening to how amazing they think they are."

At higher levels of the career ladder there is some sense of job security.
Depending on duties and where you are located you may be able to work remotely.
The majority of colleagues within teams are very cordial and helpful.
Benefits are average. If you are at a lower level of the career ladder the benefit costs make it very prohibitive and worry some. I would consider the ""benefits"" as a paycheck drain.","Systemic issues with communication across departments.
Lack of vision and long term planning. 
Reactive and not proactive.  More concerned about style over substance.
If you see something wrong and try to bring it to light you need to be excessively persistent. Management likes to throw good money after bad and you'll need to find multiple ways to present facts, data and costs to achieve any traction.
I believe this lack of will to change is enabled by any mistake being immediately used to deny any potential raise or recognition so the mistakes and poor processes linger longer than they should. 
Upper management will comment on maintaining work life balance but be prepared to do far more work than living if you want any attempt to be recognized. 
Management is far too focused and worried about how projects are estimated and budgeted instead of understanding what value work will add and how to complete tasks. 
Management will out source and offshore as much work as possible which leads to issues with pride in ownership by employees and increases demands upon employees and management to work more hours to manage those non company resources.
From a technology perspective it's unclear what their direction will be. They've tried acquisitions and adopting updated methods and buying  software but upper management and middle management focus on buzz words instead of understanding what they purchased and attempting to adopt.  
Based on conversations with other departments and lines of business expect process bottlenecks."

- Excellent PTO
- Great coworkers (until most of them left due to the many cons listed below)","- Engineering culture is virtually non-existent.  Keybank is still very much a waterfall company that has contractors do most of the software development work.  In house engineers have the same level of trust and responsibilities as contractors, which means you have no influence on product and software architecture decisions.  Prepare to turn off your creative brain and just develop whatever your told.
- Engineering teams are siloed from each other that there is no shared accountability for delivering great products.  As long as your team does their small part of the puzzle, your team is in the clear even though the overall software product you are working on is in shambles.
- Employee moral is abysmal, which leads to a toxic work environment.  3/4 of the HelloWallet employees who came over from the Keybank acquisition have left.  Common employee issues were raised to upper level management and HR and they just turned a blind eye.  Instead of trying to boost suffering moral, upper level management just takes away office amenities that further degrades moral.
- Upper level management has made countless questionable product decisions. A large product initiative was mandated from upper level management, but our day to day work doesn’t work towards that initiative at all.  KPIs also don’t reflect the day to day work and upper level management doesn’t seem to realize that and scolds the team for not meeting them."

1180,,Anonymous,2018-04-10,5.0,Anonymous Employee,I love the culture at Key. You really get the small town feel for being a bigger bank. Friendly and helpful work environment.,Loyal and good employees are not comepensated fairly. New employees are hired in at higher rates and do poor work.  Work life balance.
1181,,Awful place to work.  Stressful  Environment.  Poor culture.,2018-04-09,1.0,Licensed Personal Banker,Benefits are decent.  Good match to 401(k). Other than that there aren't many pros for working at Key Bank.  Especially in the branches.,"Where to begin?  First,  I don't agree with the vision and mindset of the bank. The façade of financial wellness is scrutinized by HelloWallet and commodities which make you just like any other bank on the street. Hellowallet is merely a scam for the bank to track data about where else account holders bank.

The bank, like most these days, is top heavy and senior management creates a stressful environment. The  poor work environment is a direct result of high paid, higher management which flows down into the branches. They move people across the country into a market and state they know nothing about.  Very high stress in the branches (and other areas from what I know).  High-demand of micro-managing.   Constant conference calls and sales pressure.  Poor work/life balance.  Seems like you are always in the branch and always being hammered about why you can't reach goals.  

The computers systems are extremely antiquated, slow and clunky!  The processes the bank uses are also extremely slow and clunky!  Underwriting of loans, especially home equity products, takes forever.  Simple tasks take days for completion.  Everything is another form that has to be filled out or sent someplace.  Operations are a mess at that place.

The structure of the licensed banker program is poor.  When you go to their meetings they claim fame for having the best program in the country but it's just as bad as anywhere else.  On top of that, they hire financial advisers who have compliance disclosures on Broker Check and expect the licensed banker to build trust with them to make appropriate recommendations to clients.  Why would any licensed banker refer someone to a person who was fired for mishandling client information?   

The merge from First Niagara Bank was a disaster! Still haven't gotten over that.  The amount of stress employees were put under is inexcusable.  The bank still, in my opinion, hasn't fully recovered the losses of several large account holders who pulled their money after the disaster it put customers and employees through.  

The branches are constantly short-staffed and never enough employees to fill in if someone is out sick.  They base staffing on a model that predicts how much traffic the branch will endure, yet there are constantly lines and customers waiting.  That is partly due to the slow, antiquated computers.  If an employee calls out sick there is never anyone to fill in.  The place is a mess.  As I've said, there is no work life balance. Managers are constantly being told that employees can't go overtime when the bank has plenty of money to go around to pay employees who work hard, and never enough staff to avoid from the overtime from happening.  What ends up happening is managers have tellers leave early to cut their time which leaves the bankers, licensed bankers mind you, to have to help the teller line and clean up messes, then the banker gets told they can’t have overtime so they’re feeling stressed about having to leave early and next thing you know you have a cluster. 

The morale in Connecticut is extremely low and there are a number of employees who are unhappy.  Most don't speak up in fear of losing their jobs but the reality is when speaking to co-workers around the state the culture at this bank is very gloomy and employees are not happy.  

If you haven't figured it out by now I would not recommend employment at this organization."

The CEO of the company (Beth) once came out to visit our district and allowed us to invite a handful of our clients to lunch with her. Previous to the lunch a handful of us were able to sit with her over a light breakfast and meeting for Q&A. You dont get that with some of the larger banks. Key Bank has a great progression growth plan that can help you manage where you'd like to be in the company short and long term with work and dedication. In 17 states and about 100 billion in total assets, I'd recommend Key Bank over some of the larger banks if your looking for career progression.","They need to work on their branch level model and staffing.

They will likely achieve their goal and become the largest regional bank in the U.S...maybe. If you're looking for an opportunity and you want to grow your financial service career, Key is not a bad place.  However, there are a lot of issues with the department I was brought into, and I'll summarize below.","-Possibly the most toxic work environment I've ever been a part of
-Work/life balance is not a concept Key is familiar with, nor do they really care if it's something you're trying to achieve
-If you're a salaried employee, they will work you to the bone and will not care if you're burning out. They just don't. I would NOT take a salaried position with this bank unless they're paying you six figures up front.
-HR misled me on my bonus eligibility
-The Key culture is very difficult to navigate. The individuals at the Cleveland HQ make no qualms about the fact that they look down on their Buffalo counterparts. It's ridiculous, especially when you consider that - based on my experience - those in Buffalo I worked with were miles ahead of my Cleveland counterparts in terms of performance and productivity. 
-The training for my position was non-existent and I was ""thrown to the wolves"" very early on 
-If you have questions, no one will answer them. Finding help/procedures/ANY kind of information from your department ABOUT your department is almost impossible
-Key's systems are from the stone age, and if they don't get up to speed on technology they will never be the biggest U.S. regional bank. There's so much manual processes that it's enough to make you go crazy
-Very, very stressful atmosphere
-My manager did not provide me any feedback, and actually got defensive when I asked for what his expectations were of me in my role (but he very early on talked about possible ""disciplinary action"") - very confusing
-You will probably never know how you're performing, and that's a feature of the bank's management, not a bug
-Medical is a joke
-401k vesting only takes place after 4 years. If you're at this bank for 4 years you deserve stock options, not just 401k vesting.
-Favoritism. Favoritism everywhere. 
-Just not a fit for me culturally. Like I said - I believe that other departments at Key are probably great, and I wish I could have stayed on longer to build my career there, but when it all added up the situation became untenable for me. Be very, very careful before you accept an offer there. Ask as many questions as possible during your interviews."

1204,,overall view,2018-03-01,4.0,Float Teller,great company with better benefits and 401k  than others,sometimes while processing transactions the system either crashes or goes in a loop
1205,,High pressure sales,2018-02-28,2.0,Personal Banker,"Local bank engaged within the communities they serve and as of late, they seem to be top in the market regarding offers for lending, deposits and new checking accounts.  Benefits are great, especially the PTO and paid holidays.  Most full time positions receive 4 weeks PTO from the start along with 10 or so paid holidays. Time off is very generous and that is about it for ""pros.""","The technology is very much out of date and the consolidation of some programs and other services is questionable.  The consolidation of programs certainly does not make it any easier or convenient for customers.  The online banking/mobile banking platform is still a far cry from other competitors that have much better online banking platforms.   If you're in a sales role, such as a Personal Banker, then be prepared for high levels of stress to meet goals that seem impossible to meet and having to push the HelloWallet product on every customer.  Even though some goals have been lowered in light of the Wells Fargo scandal, be prepared for high levels of stress to meet and exceed goals by the Area Retail Leader (ARL).  In addition to the stressful sales environment, Personal Bankers should expect to also run a teller window more then they should.   The staffing model is frustrating and should be a red flag when on the first day on the job you get an email from the retail branch executive explaining philosophy on the staffing models.  Tellers are typically part time hours between 20 and 30.  Lead tellers are typically full time.  Part time tellers don't last long because they often find a better career elsewhere that offers more hours and benefits, leaving branches short on staff.   Internal career opportunities are tough to come by.  Internal careers are the typical ""need to know someone"" if you plan to apply for a job outside of retail banking regardless of your qualifications.  Salary is below industry average for some sales roles; however, they recently raised the minimum wage for all positions for $15/hour.  There is also a clear communication breakdown between some departments.  If you're working loans, be prepared to fight tooth and nail to get anything through to the underwriters as trying to get a loan to the final approval status."

- Appear to be cordial for the first couple weeks","- DEAD END CAREER, if you're licensed: S7/63/LAH
- Minimal/No career advancement opportunities
- Nearly all the LRM's are miserable, but are simply forced to be in the role
- The role is essentially a Financial Advisor Assistant..simply setting up appointments via begging clients to come speak with you
- Micromanagement with lack of actual financial advice knowledge
- No financial strategy tactics taught, just scripts read over and over
- Daily, petty and completely immature office politics...similar to middle school immaturity
- Very unprofessional branch management atmosphere
- Lastly you will be forced to work on the teller line if it's busy, even if you're fully licensed"

1411,,Don't work here.,2017-05-11,2.0,Anonymous Employee,"+ Employee loans, credit cards, and bank accounts are great and offer services that are fairly expensive for no cost or with lower requirements.

+ There are a few managers who really care about their team and work hard to ensure that they are taken care of, but sad to see that they are often pitted against other teams and other branch managers.

+ Weekends off (mostly).

+ They have a great habit of re-hiring employees who have left the company.

+ Paid time off for part-time employees is great to have and rare to find.

+ The performance improvement plan (or PIP) is a great way to keep employees aware of what they need to work on when they've not performed well, and the monthly/weekly individual meetings with managers are great ways to see how to grow.

+ The company offers a real opportunity for growth and moving up in the company. Raises are based on performance after one year review and starting wages for part-time employees are fantastic.

+ Key Bank employee discounts at many online stores are phenomenal.","+ In my experience, there is a gossipy culture that breeds mistrust and hostile team environments. I spent a lot of time hoping that the adversarial high school culture would be addressed. Unfortunately, I chose to left after several years of loyalty because the culture was so toxic.

+ In my experience, management placed pressure on part-time employees to work more hours than hired for (i.e. part-time employees are clearly hired for 18, 20, 22, 25, 30, 32, 35, and 38 hours a week). At some points working 40 hours while still having part-time or no benefits. This is no fault of the managers, but instead at the gross understaffing of bank locations since most branches aren't allowed to hire full-time bank tellers.

+ Benefits (regardless of full-time or part time) were less than competitive and often saw co-workers needing to purchase their own private insurance or being on state health care system to care for themselves and their families.

+ Relatively low organization and a lack of training for employees at all branch levels.

+ Because of this lack of training, many branches will send clients to several different locations to find answers instead of researching those answers themselves or for a fear of saying 'no' to the client.

+ Bankers aren't tellers, get your bankers off the line, hire, and train actual tellers. Bankers are trained to be bankers and often are slower at the line and don't have a clear understanding of protocol or expectations. This causes clients to get angry and take it out on tellers who are not in control of what bankers know or don't know about the teller line.

+ On several occasions over several years I was told to come in while sick. Visibly sick. Once I vomited in a trash can on the teller line and  was told that they were too understaffed to let me take a sick day. Other employees came in with serious illnesses, colds, and injuries throughout the years that made it almost impossible to do their jobs, however they were told that they were not able to take a sick day."

They are not forgiving, they play favorites and overlooked good employees who give their all and put their hearts into their job, and provide good moral, yet these good employees will get crapped on and never see a raise increase in their department, no matter how well the do in their job and how much progress they've made. You can basically do a mediocre job and as long as your numbers are in a good place, you can be as snotty and rotten to clients as you like. No encouragement or uplifting compliments. You won't ever feel appreciated. Although I liked my managers, I feel they could have defended me better to help me keep my job. Maybe a strict PIP, but they are the epitome of corporate America and that won't ever change. I never got a raise in each department I worked at, and to give it your best and to be deemed unworthy and undervalued as an employee just adds to the low moral of the place. I have a learning disability too, so this makes average things bery difficult for me as it is. Their software applications are so outdated and problematic, you can't go one day without having to close out of everything amd start your computer again. They are a bank, they have money, yet it just shows how greedy they are by refusing to update the their systems to make them more intuitive.  It is a lesson learned though,  places like this will never allow you to feel appreciated and therefore, they certainly try to make it look as if they do, but it's all for show and comes down to the mighty dollar.

Most customers are regulars to one or two branches so you get to know the faces and the stories. So far everyone has been very welcoming to me (a new teller). Some customers are wary because I am a new face handling their money but my coworkers at the branch are quick to assure them that I am a safe employee lol. Everyone is very helpful in answering my silly questions, and I am glad that they do not try to steal sales from one another, everyone works as a team.","I do not feel I received enough training on what products/services Key offers. A lot of times a customer will ask about their specific type of account and I do not know we even offer it or I do not know what the guidelines are for it in order to avoid fees, etc. I had a training seminar with fake money which felt a little bit silly. 

Some managers are very stingy about getting Tellers to get referrals for loans/credit/etc. It's like they don't realize it's the same customers coming in every day, or that most people know the drill by now and just say No before we even get started into our bit about financial opportunities.

1639,,Awful!,2016-06-03,1.0,Branch Manager,They pay well and have a good incentive plan.,"A Manager's Nightmare! Where to begin? The systems are very outdated and inefficient- basically a big clustered patchwork so if you do get a client in front of you, it takes forever (yes i know many have this challenge but theirs is truly over the top). Employees don't get a lot of training and the training they do get is mostly online so there are MANY knowledge gaps in the branches and the ""support"" departments. Overall, the majority of employees seem very demotivated across many branches minus a very few notable exceptions. Thats because the Area Retail ""Leaders"" (who basically do nothing but micro-manage you to sales goals) make it more of a punishment environment. 

The ""business partners"" (mortgage, investment, business, etc)  really aren't aligned with the branch and just go where the money is- they are very much so in it for themselves and its extremely transparent (beyond them faking it on conference calls). You are expected to help them but seldom do they give back.  Given all of these deficiencies, their Books of Business are a DISASTER which makes this HIGHLY sales-focused role that much more difficult. Several of the good, high value clients called on had a variety of terrible experiences across many branches and departments. There is much you have to call other departments to do to service the client and often times they are not helpful. The branch is staffed VERY lean to begin with so just one call out causes chaos and seldom is last-minute help available. OH AND PS- their prices SUCK- not competitive with hidden fees and fees for everything else. Who charges $125 to originate an auto loan these days? 

Basically if you work for Key, EVERYTHING is an uphill battle. The systems, the products, the lack of training, the overall environment, etc. Most companies have at least one of these things going for them and Key has none."

Also be careful of what they tell you the incentive will be like.  The incentive was less than 20% of what they quoted me.

* A regular teller makes between $1-$2 less than you, even though you have 3x their workload.
* You will be pressured to sell, aka ""refer"" products, even though this position is largely compliance-related. Those jobs (sales vs compliance) are typically done by two different personality types.

Everyone in a branch (including manager) is expected to be able to cover any other branch within the ""area"". Sometimes you will get to work only to be told to get back in your car because you are needed at a branch 25 miles away. Or worse, be sent to that branch for only an hour or so because they need someone to cover lunches. Could be worse, at least you are given a lunch. But that only is because there were lawsuits saying people weren't given any sort of break. Managers and other platform people are expected to run a teller drawer, seeing that most branches only have one or two tellers.  Be expected to do the work of at least two people. And be told that that isn't even enough. They justify the low pay, saying you can make it up with the incentive plan. Which pays out once a quarter and even then you don't receive it for a couple months after the quarter ends. Need to be hired for at least 30 hours a week to get medical benefits and many tellers are hired for just under that."

You are expected to visit businesses to sell the 'key at work' program which is impossible because as a 'sales professional' you are required to be in a cash drawer which means you are also being a teller.

I had two different roles within Key, one had more freedom than the other, but both offered some control and work/life balance.","I was a consistent top performer, but the bonus program was next to nothing.
Goals were not based on Market data and analysis, but formulaic and generic. This would put some markets in positions of overall failure to plan, but still allowing the company to acquire profit.
Very conservative and Risk Averse, even when presented with solid portfolios were presented.

Employees are treated with no respect, constantly punished (having to work Saturdays if they don't hit unrealistic goals) no work/life balance. Your efforts are never good enough and you're constantly told so.  Area Retail ""Leaders"" refuse to call clients EVEN when requested by the clients, if it's not involving a sale, they won't bother.  Have actually been told that ""we are here to put people in debt.""  Unethical sales tactics JUST to try and hit sales goals.  Branch Managers do NOT get to manage their branches, we're merely sales people responsible for unrealistic goals set by the ARL.  Never look at historical sales, P/L, staffing levels, just set unrealistic goals and then punished when they aren't hit.  Yearly, the company ""allows"" branches to close 1/2 day in May to go out and work in the community, Neighbors Make The Difference Day.  This year, our management told us that NO branch will shut down and that all work in the community has to be done on our own time, either on a Saturday or after hours.

Tiedeman location very nice and has excellent food services / breakfast, lunch, snacks.","Key Bank has an extremely negative culture.  Area Retail Sales Leaders put high pressure and unrealistic sales expectations on employees.  District leadership non existent until branch is under performing.  Employees are micromanaged hourly, daily, weekly, monthly quarterly, and yearly. Tellers are increasingly responsible for contributing to branch sales goals.  Micromanagement includes constant coaching / performance improvement plans for anyone not exceeding sales goals in all 5 areas.  New system implemented in 2014-2015 for tracking goals / success is even more confounded and impractical than before.  Leadership is negative, demeaning, demoralizing and just plain rude.  No work life balance.  Annual performance review for Tellers is nearly impossible to rank highly even when significantly exceeding all goals.  Below average pay.  All branch positions  paid hourly except Branch Manager.  Punch clock rounds to nearest 15 mins.  Performance improvement plan if hours exceeded  scheduled hours even though no fault of your own. Tellers expect to work less hours than promised regularly, unless someone in your branch is on vacation.  Branch managers are salaried and abuse time off policies. Not well policed.  Branch managers have lied about being at work, abused time off, show up late, leave early, will not be in rotation to  work weekends.  Branch managers frequently avoid accountability and force other staff i.e bankers and tellers to deal with difficult customer situations despite customer asking to speak with branch manager.  No accountability.  Little room for advancement.  Bankers expected to stay late or come in early for meetings with little notice.  Performance often graded by how well management likes you / vs actual numbers.  Bankers frequently moved from branch to branch.  Same negative culture seen at many branches across several districts.  Teller lines are revolving doors because pay is poor, expectations are unreasonable, stressful customer situations and work in constantly critiqued.  Very poor leadership throughout corporate levels.  1-800-KEY2YOU customer service is incompetent.  Branch must often dealswith calls from Key2You and handle situations that take away from opportunities for sales."

Unfortunately I learned the hard way that for someone used to making money from commission that I would have little to no time to make extra money.",A lot of goals expected to meet in a short amount of time. You get thrown into a teller position as well. You seriously wear a lot of hats. You have to meet consumer and business retail as well as investment goals. Which I don't mind doing at all.  Except that there were a lot of branch closings happening all at one once. Spent most of my time having to defend KeyBank to many clients who were wondering why KeyBank was closing so many of its branches. The real money was in Investments. Unfortunately had to spend a lot of time putting out fires from clients instead of being able to grow business and make more money for myself and the KeyBank.

1882,,Traumatic experience,2015-04-18,1.0,Commercial Loan Operations,The employees were good people.  Many were even exceptional.  PTO allowances were generous.  The Brooklyn Ops Center was a nice facility.,"Fear and lies seemed to pervade the culture.  Production expectations were unreal.  To set goals so high that they can rarely be achieved seems to me an invitation for employees to cheat, steal and lie. It was hard to enjoy PTO when you knew you'd come back to work with a huge backlog to cover and your current unwieldy portfolio would need attention, too.  Management was not very helpful.  Other department managers asked me what the head of my department did all day long and I had no answer - he was just collecting a nice paycheck and looking forward to his retirement,  Pretty quickly I began to regard all corporate communications as propaganda (Orwellian double-speak).  For instance, when the core medical plan was phased-out in favor of a high deductible plan, it was promoted to employees as something good that would empower us to be able to make better choices as consumers of medical services.  Never mind how opaque the market actually is and that the employee will be paying more, we were told that the change was good for us."

If you started before when I started, you get an extra week of vacation after 5 years of work. That's nice, but isn't offered any longer.","I worked as a teller for 4 years, and started at 10.50/hr. I went multiple years without any small raise and the years I did get a raise, it was near nothing. I had to start applying for other jobs because the company was downsizing to near nothing in the branches. I got lucky when the lead teller got fired for cashing a bad check. That lead teller got the lead job before me because the ARL disliked me for a reason that I'll explain. A regular customer offered me a job making 3 dollars more than I made at the time, and then I was promised a raise by the ARL to match that offer, which he then recanted after the job wasn't an option any longer. I got that raise, but only because I called our internal ethics department on the ARL, which is the reason that the ARL turned around and offered the Lead Teller position in my branch to an idiot before he offered it to me. During my 5 year stint on the teller line, I struggled to get bathroom breaks because the staffing was so low. I went without lunches for years, and then the company acted like it was my own fault and that I need to take a lunch break... Though there was no way to... I've since gotten a promotion from another boss, in a different department, and he is a great person and I will work hard for him, but not for this company, as it hasn't shown me that it cares about me even a little."

The words on our value statement did not line up with what I saw on a daily basis.

Some people who could no longer do their job competently were not removed from positions, even after numerous complaints from co-workers & customers.  Instead of removing someone from the company who had a record of racially insensitive remarks, they moved that person to the part of town populated with the people she spoke badly about.

the commitment to a business program is milk toast.  Meaning that there is no commitment.

1930,,Personal Banker,2014-12-30,3.0,Personal Banker,Good company with good benefits. Incentive plans were good to complete. Company did well at getting employees engaged. Good vacation time for full and part time employees.,The cons that I dealt with was trying to move up in company. The headquarters were based in OH so it made it difficult to find non retail positions. Also employee raises are also hard to increase.
1931,,Working at Key Bank,2014-12-30,2.0,Branch Manager,"Benefits, Paid time off, recognized brand","I worked for Key as a branch manager for about four years. Quite frankly, it is a very disorganized, poorly run company. Although I may sound like a disgruntled employee, that’s really not the case. I worked for some good people along the way and it wasn’t always this way. I left because of excessive micromanagement and extremely poor staffing, along with several other issues I’ll outline below.

First and foremost, Key Bank is the least original bank out there. Whatever Bank of America, Chase or Citi are doing, Key will do it six months later. It literally is a race to the bottom when it comes to who can do more with less. All national and regional banks are cutting staff and trying to have the best efficiency ratios.  If you are managing a branch, this means less employees every year. That makes it much more difficult to generate sales and to provide decent customer service. Key’s solution (like their competitors) is to push people to online or mobile channels. If the customers don’t like the line at the branch, they will use the ATM, their phone or online banking. It might save some expenses but eliminates many sales opportunities. It also has a negative impact on older clients, but Key doesn’t seem to care.

Second, staffing is not a concern. It may take several months to fill a position. There is no sense of urgency from anyone. It almost seems like a policy to leave positions open to save money. Teller positions are not valued by upper management at all. They doubled teller referral goals this year and have fire many long-term tellers because of it. Most of the tellers that are hitting their goals aren’t doing so ethically, but those are the people getting all the recognition. Why someone in upper management doesn’t question how someone is doubling or tripling their production overnight is beyond me. As a company that is always cutting costs, they pay a lot out in incentives to people doing things the wrong way.

Third, if you manage a branch for Key, expect EXCESSIVE micromanagement. It wasn’t always that way but is now the culture. You will get excessive emails, have to do excessive amounts of tracking of your daily activities and have excessive conference calls. Expect that to take up a minimum of ten to fifteen hours of your week if not more. That is not an exaggeration. You can have a great month and be doing well year to date, but have a bad week or two and you will be called out on it.

Fourth, computer systems are horrible, slow and very dated. Expect them to be down a lot. Some systems don’t interface well with others. They have an old DOS based system they won’t train anyone on because they tell you it is going away. Except they’ve been saying that for ten years. There are literally so many systems and everything is so disorganized that they have to have a special employee helpdesk to help you find answers and procedures. And forget it if you want to call a department directly. You have to call the helpdesk first and if they can’t answer your question, then they MIGHT put you through to the department responsible. If you have to call for help, expect to be on the phone up to a half an hour or more.

Fifth, outsourcing is rampant. Some of the few internal departments you can call directly (like accounts payable) are now in India. Their English is broken at best and you will usually have to have them email you because you won’t understand them. This is not be insulting to them. It’s just a fact. They also outsourced a great deal of customer service and online banking support. I would get numerous complaints weekly from customers because of this. Key is a Cleveland based bank. Their outsourcing has created an environment of fear at the corporate offices and frustration for their customers. It hardly seems worth it.

Sixth, if you work in a branch and want advancement or to move to the corporate offices, forget it. Regardless of your performance or education, they will consider other corporate employees or outside candidates long before anyone that works at a branch. They also won’t ever communicate with you to tell you if you got the job or not. In most cases, you’ll never get an interview. It goes back to the staffing piece. They aren’t in a hurry to fill positions and if they can figure out a way to outsource it, they will.

Last, training is horrible. If you don’t heed my previous warnings and get a job with Key, expect to have to figure out your job yourself. It is pretty much trial by fire. For some people that is okay. I obviously made it through but I watched a lot of people get frustrated and quit. That is because you are expected to start producing after the first couple months and if you don’t know procedures, where to find information or have to constantly call a helpdesk, you will likely start out underperforming. As a manager, it is very frustrating to lose people because of something like training when it takes so long to hire someone in the first place. If you have to start over, it may take another couple months to find someone else. There really needs to be better organization and communication for new employees. With constant reductions in branch staffing, that needs to come from a centralized training coordinator or someone responsible for it in each region."

Force-rank performance reviews with extreme bias toward those that quietly take the blame and give their managers credit.

Great Co-workers - I have been in 3 different departments over the years and all of them have had terrific employees. Genuine people, hard working (for the most part), employees who really help each other out. Many departments are female dominated (80%+), and very diverse.

Decent Tuition Reimbursement - They will cover tuition up to $6k per year, but they will fight you on every penny. Eventually they will hold up to their end of the bargain, but its disappointing that they dispute every fee.
401k match - currently still matching dollar for dollar on your 401k up to 6% of your paycheck, which is a rarity these days.

Strong emphasis on internal applicants - It is not uncommon to hire from the outside, but there is a large advantage to internal applicants (I expect this is the case everywhere though).","Low pay - I'm sure everyone thinks they are underpaid, but KeyBank routinely offers you significantly less than what they even admit is the ""market rate"". If there is a pay range listed on a posting, expect to make 10-15% less than the so called ""market rate""

Little linear mobility - In most areas of the bank, you must leave departments if you are looking to move up. Managerial positions rarely open up in any one department, you will have to zig zag through to company to progress. Also, they take advantage of internal applicants, moving them up 2-3 ""pay grades"" but only paying 2-4% more than their old position.

Poor Insurance - For such a large corporation, the health insurance is not very good. I am fortunate to have a husband who has great health coverage so I no longer use Key. Its has only gotten worse in the last couple years. Since 2011, premiums are up over 40%, deductible and out of pocket max have almost doubled, and coverage has gotten poorer. The most popular plan option for those with children is no longer even offered.

Financial Market instability - After the last financial crash, the bank downsized staff significantly (as is to be expected). Will the very strong potential for another downturn in the coming years, this may be a concern for new employees. Also, with instability, comes the risk of takeovers. Key is based in regional-bank-dominated Ohio, which may be appealing for WF, BOA, Chase, etc."

I often worked over 40 hours per week (which I expected and don't mind), but when I casually mentioned it to my manager I was told not to bring it up again.  Ironically, there was a class-action lawsuit for just such practices and I did receive some extra pay.  Investment Advisers chose mutual funds and annuities based on payout, not client needs.  The final straw came when I attended a training led by the regional manager.  His advice was to ""twist the knife in our customer's weaknesses to convinced them our solutions are best"".

What started out as relationship banking has become product pushing for mindless employees.  They have dishonest sales practices, and incompetent training programs.  To be successful at Key, you must push debt on people and pretend to be a trusted advisor.  The sales goals are unreasonable, but you are held to them regardless.

They promote within the branches if you want to move to a different position.,They eliminated the customer service manager position which was the only position that knew how to do all jobs in the branch.  The company would have been better off eliminating the branch manager position since that position was only responsible for their employees which on average was about five people.  That position was also the highest paying position so eliminating that position would have saved the company more money that eliminating the CSM position.

There are lots of opportunities to get exposure to other lines of business and continuous improvement / job training has been a major focus for the last several years.","As much as I love my managers, I sometimes feel as though I'm living the movie ""Office Space"" reporting to several different people.  Word from the top of the house doesn't move as quickly down the chain as one would anticipate.  It seems as though there is not a lot of room to move within the company unless one relocates to Cleveland.

That's a great way to show how much employees who displayed loyalty and hard work for 25+ years are appreciated.  And if you opt to choose another healthcare plan, you will lose your monthly stipend at age 65 that would have been applied towards supplemental plans.  And best of all, Key did not effectively communicate these increases when individuals were choosing early retirement.  Gotcha.  So much for Key Values and Integrity."

Management at a local level was great and supportive.","Slowly but surely the benefits went away, no more pension, 401k matching only after 1 year of employment, healthcare premiums more than doubled, vacation cut by 1 week for current employees. KeyBank was and maybe still is floundering. They had a major branch level restructuring in early 2013 as a response to a lawsuit that they lost. Never a good move to be reactive, a company should always be proactive. Cooperate management constantly implemented new sale goals, when I started the branch had 4 goals to meet, when I left, 12.

There are a lot of opportunities to volunteer in your community, if that's your thing.","Positions both open and filled get cancelled and terminated with no notice due to ""efficiency and optimization."" Basically, no one is safe. And that's the corporate culture at Key these days. The Health Benefits are complicated and costly. All of the fringe benefits budgets and energy were cancelled and used to augment health care programs, they would be free. Key seems to have no sense of direction other than struggling to catch up to the industry. There is a severe disconnect today with upper management.

2054,,Extreme lack of communication and unhealthy work environment.,2013-12-28,1.0,Administrative Assistant,Pay was decent at the time.,"The administrative team does not work as a team. There is a lack of accountability for what goes on. Trying to learn what is necessary to do your job is like pulling teeth. The assistants lack professionalism, and are not mature enough to help one another. The department desperately needs a supervisor who is competent, detailed, and has experience in managing people.

It truly depends on what team you assist, but the analysts and associates do not tell you what they need from you upfront, even if you frequently follow up with them. They depend heavily on the supervisor for the administrative team to guide and help the assistants. This is impossible being that the supervisor works in Cleveland, and simply does not know how to help, advise, and reinforce discipline.

Arranging travel between the analysts and the sales department is difficult, being that the sales department does not provide an official schedule until a couple days before the actual trip. The analysts pressure the assistants to continually provide information from sales, that they simply do not have the authority to do.

Management continually fails to get their hands dirty and clearly explain what they need from the administrative team. The administrative team has a lot of inexperienced employees, which will require sometime for them to really gain the necessary skills to work as at team.

Its either you hire inexperienced employees with the intention of training them, or you hire employees who already have the experience. The company squeezes as much work out of the assistants as possible, in which they will pressure them into perform duties that are outside of their normal job description."

They don't scour your email inbox, they don't harass you about internet time, most managers don't count the minutes you are on the clock.  They provide periodic work-from-home options, and flex time if they won't interfere with your work.  Additionally they are extremely generous with paid time off, starting with 4 weeks.","The pay is below market value, but in a rotten economy it's harder to find better options, even if you have high credentials.  That is probably how they get away with soft pay.  A good deal of the jobs at KeyBank Real Estate Capital are contract based, so no job is 'permanent.'

It was made clear to me that I was expected to work 60-70 hours as an exempt employee, so I had to quit all of my personal activities. It became a bank where products were sold, not solutions.

No work life balance and incompetent Senior Management.  The Director of this Department needs to listen to the front line staff to figure out how to curtail the turnover of good talent.

There are some fantastic leaders, and there are also some incompetent ones; in the latter situation, it can be extremely frustrating.  I imagine this is not a unique characteristic.
Senior executives seem to lack the ability to plan effectively for the future. There are many corporate-wide initiatives that either die quickly, or last a short while only to be reversed completely down the road.  An example is the branch network: a few years ago there was a large push to open branches and increase density within Key's footprint...in 2013, many branches are closing (some that were opened in the last 12 months) and I'm guessing a lot of money was wasted in the process.

Average points per account is about 100 and the goal is nearly 6,000 (could be higher now). Thus, the harder it is for you to get sales, the harder they make it for you. You DO NOT get the big points from loan referrals unless the loan goes thru 100% which means that it could be six months before you get anything and your job performance depends on customers' credit (something that you cannot control). You can close sales of products and pull applications all day long but if they don't qualify you get no recognition.

Unless you meet KeyBanks unrealistically high sales goals, there is zero chance of getting a raise.  If you live by yourself, it is virtually impossible to make a living off of the hours KeyBank provides to tellers.

Vacation and benefits above average.,"Advancement opportunities typically not based on merit, but HR-related policy. As company is not lean and has had high expense ratios for an extended period, there is a constant outsourcing/layoff threat that is a distraction for many good workers and a productivity killer. Rather than soberly address certain challenges or poor performing staff that are social acquaintances, they typically reorganize business units between 1 and 4 times every year, so you constantly are assigned new/different managers who know this time is not permanent which leads to inattentiveness in the performance review process as they have new senior managers they need to do the self-preservation dance for. Most managers are not as transparent as in healthy organizations: after all, why share a strategy so your staff can productively think about it in advance and make timely contributions? Maybe it is all intentional as they attempt to construct New Chennai, Ohio."
