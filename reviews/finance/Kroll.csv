Bad team culture with managing directors constantly making analysts, SAs and VPs feel unappreciated. As a result, junior people have zero motivation to work for their bosses and are constantly looking to leave. There is almost not a single legacy person below MD who works in the group anymore, they have all gone across the street where pay is much better, or took pay cuts to get away from this team. Toxic Culture! Upper management does not care at all about investing in their employees. Pay your lower level employees who are the ones keeping the ship afloat! CEO is a phony.

They also have a lot of foreign language busy work and will hire a lot of non-Americans, allowing foreign exchange students to stay after graduation.","Where to start... this is simply the most toxic I've ever worked and I'm reminded of some specific signs. For one, the Glassdoor page was a common topic of conversation with my coworker's manager. And it seems like the Reston location has combined its Glassdoor page with other locations to help pad their stats. I remember there was an empty desk filled nametags of former employees which had left or had been fired, which was affectionately called the ""graveyard."" Nearly everyone that was Senior Associate and under was waiting for a conditional hire with the government to get out. And many others who have stuck around, just weren't able to get into the government for whatever reason or other. 

The environment, I remember, was very stressful. The entire floor is so quiet because the workload for low-level, uninteresting reports is non-stop. And you won't really receive much in terms of mentorship, other than referrals to templates. Conversely, you will get reported to higher-ups for fixable mistakes. I remember having some good colleagues that were waiting everyday on their next opportunity--I hope that they are doing okay."

37,,Dog Crap,2022-02-05,1.0,Portfolio Valuation Analyst,"Overall a fun culture in the Nashville office. Everyone generally gets along well.

In general, having valuation on your resume will open doors to more opportunistic finance jobs like investment banking. Duff & Phelps isn’t the worst name in the world either. The portfolio valuation group does modeling that is not relevant to other areas of finance, but most other companies don’t realize this which is an advantage.","-Laughably bad management. Not sure how some of the managers in PV keep their job. No timing expectations, no meaningful feedback, no effort to develop analysts. There are a handful of good managers, but they are the exception.

-The work couldn’t be more mundane. If you want a cool finance job, I promise this isn’t it. On the surface it sounds fascinating/fancy to consult hedge funds and private equity funds on the value of their portfolio investments. It’s really not that glamorous. You are an accountant in disguise who helps support the fund manager’s auditors in assessing the reasonableness of your clients’ balance sheet marks. There’s no critical thinking involved. It’s almost purely mechanical and the clients don’t care about your work whatsoever. It has no tangible affect on anything.

-Nashville’s MD isn’t what he seems on the surface. At first, he seems to genuinely care about his team/analysts. Not the case. He puts on a front so that he can try to keep morale from constantly dropping. Analysts have often brought up manager-related concerns to the MD and he ignores them. Then when someone quits, he acts like he never knew there was a problem. His redeeming trait is that he pays for food and drink at happy hours."

You will learn a lot and the work itself is not bad. Many friendships and good collaboration. But beware... its like high school with the gossip!,"The management in Nashville is bad. The managing director does not seem to be a people person, which is ironic. The management in the office does not believe in work life balance. 90% of the office is under 25, they are giving young people 60+ hour weeks because the employees accept what they're given. They are burning through employees by giving too much work and little support. Don't believe that you will actually be able to use your PTO without jumping through hoops or getting push back. The managing director LOVES to have everyone in the office, even though we are crammed in there like sardines and the rest of the company works from home. Nashville is the only office to remain open through COVID, even when all of our work can be done from home. The kicker is that you will pay for expensive parking out of your salary. In 2022, there is no reason Kroll can't reimburse parking expenses if they're requiring the unnecessary use of office space. NO DIVERSITY HERE."

118,,Avoid Kroll's Compliance Risk and Diligence Division at all costs,2021-09-09,1.0,Associate,"Colleagues are nice and most of them, very talented, but they all want to leave the firm.","Kroll CRD is, to put it bluntly, a horrible place to work. It’s the textbook definition of a toxic workplace. There’s a normalized culture of exploiting researchers until they burn out. There’s zero empathy and understanding from management. You have 10 days a year of PTO, but even during those few days, they will assign work. If you complain or push back, they’ll simply tell you there’s nothing they can do about it. Researchers are disposable. Collateral damage. 

They’ll say the hours are “standard” for the industry, but as someone who has worked in the industry for years, I can tell you, that’s not the case. Everyone works weekends and evenings at Kroll CRD. Yes, everyone. And don’t be surprised if you get work calls to your personal phone number on a holiday. That’s just normal at Kroll. These are some of the reasons why turnover has skyrocketed in the past few years. People at Kroll live to work. 

Associates are underpaid, overworked, and per their own Kroll survey data, 80% of them are actively looking for jobs elsewhere. Stay away from Kroll. If you’re interested in working in the investigations industry, there are *so many* better companies out there."
119,,Exactly what you'd expect,2021-09-09,4.0,Senior Associate,"great international network of professionals, consistent work, plenty of opportunity for advancement","due to the nature of billing clients for advisory work, there was sometimes conflict between billing actual hours worked, thus burdening the client or underbilling hours worked to allow room for billable hours for others on the team, and facing pressure for being under-utilized from management. Unfortunately, that's just the name of the game in advisory."
120,,AVOID AT ALL COSTS,2021-09-08,1.0,Senior Associate,Not many pros at all to work at Kroll.,"*******************RED FLAG - DO NOT WORK AT KROLL*********************

I want to make it clear that I am reviewing Kroll - which is by and far the worst company I have ever worked for. Duff & Phelps is a totally different world and I can't honestly say I know about it.

Where do I start?

Kroll has absolutely no work-life balance. Relative to the pay, the hours are absolutely brutal. You can set boundaries as much as you want, the work will keep coming. Their goal is to churn and crush as many associates as possible. If I wanted that, I would work in investment banking and make 3x the money. Kroll also has barely 10 days of PTO (which management discourages you from using). If you want any semblance of peace in your life, avoid at all costs.

Kroll does not want you to have career growth. Plain and simple. They would prefer to stunt your growth and just have you complete report after report. They are not incentivized to see you grow and gain skills (or else you would just leave). 

Kroll is a toxic environment. The staff, management, and employees are always at odds. Everyone is overworked, most people are unhappy. I noticed that 90% of my co-workers looked older or gained weight within 6 months of joining. If you value your mental & physical health you'll avoid at all costs.

If you're an H1B worker, Kroll might seem like a good option because they sponsor. This is true. However, they'll convince you that you're beholden to them and work you to the bone. They literally use a strategy of burning out immigrants just because they can.

All in all, I'm ecstatic to leave this place and hope many of my co-workers can as well."

There's not a single legacy person below Managing Director who works in my group anymore, they have all left for Lincoln International where pay is much better, or they took demotions to work for other companies where they work 30-40% less and make 75% all-in more.

You are simply never given enough time to do your job excellently. Focus is put on speed, which can be demoralizing.

You're given a ton of responsibility early on out of necessity, which can be a positive or negative depending on how driven you are to grind out the corporate ladder.","There was no onboarding process whatsoever, you spend 99.9% of your time learning on the fly, which leads to very long hours. You're transitioned from one busy deal to another due to low headcount. Teams are generally made up of an analyst/senior, VP (manager), and MD. Most VPs I worked with were useless and refused to do any of the actual work, and provided very limited value. Promotions from analyst to senior were common, promotions above senior was pretty much non-existent. Resources were also extremely limited, the firm employs a team in India for overnight support but the team was essentially enslaved to the Chicago office which brings in ~50% of the groups revenue, all other offices that needed support were pretty much out of luck. The firm really struggles to instill any sort of culture, you feel very disconnected from your local team members as the firm staffs deals at a national level. You end up getting tossed around with zero regard for the hours you were putting in to your last deal. Your performance is driven very strongly by your utilization rate, which can be skewed downward when there is pressure to finish a project within budget. You're generally staffed on multiple deals simultaneously which requires you to work most weekends. Booking PTO was a fools errand as work always took precedent over PTO and corporate holidays. MDs are extremely revenue focused.

TLDR; Very limited resources, long hours, average comp, no culture, limited upward mobility unless very dedicated and loyal, no onboarding process, old/cheap technology"

Learn a lot and make good connections with clients in the PE space. Work with some of the top PE firms in the world and you get great exposure. Duff is trying to create a culture that is guided towards the younger generation. Open floor plans with minimal offices. Phone reimbursement is a plus.,Turnover is a big problem. Typical stay is 18-24 months when analyst/associates leave for higher paying jobs in the PE space (mostly D&P's clients). They do not replace the staff leaving when it happens and it is always next person up with no increase in pay or bonus. The bonus structure is outside of your control. Top performers are rewarded but in the analyst and associate role it is fully based on chargeable hours which is controlled by your manager. I would say bonus has ranged from 10%-30% in any given year. The open floor plan in numerous offices is very annoying as some people are loud and on the phone all day so it is a culture of headphones at your desk and taking private calls in breakout rooms.

They give into all unreasonable deadline demands from their clients. As a result their product isn't as good as other firms I have worked for.

352,,Real Estate Advisory Group aka Appraisal Firm,2020-04-20,2.0,Senior Associate (Real Estate),"Great corporate benefits, good salary","The Real Estate Advisory Group (REAG) is essentially an appraisal firm that works with a wide variety of property owners (REITs, PE Firms, Developers, etc). So, if you aspire to be a commercial appraiser, this is a great place to be. However, if you want to get into PE or Development, I think you might have a hard time switching after 2 years at DP. Yes the pay is decent and I think people are worth what they get paid to DP, but the skills you gain as an appraisal analyst aren't quite at the level a PE firm will want if they want to hire someone with 2-years of acquisitions and/or asset management experience. You'll most likely have to take a cut in pay to leave if you leave after getting promoted to Senior. You will do two things at the DP REAG, Appraisals and Purchase Price Allocations(ASC 805/PPA) which is essentially an appraisal for a RE transaction. There is very little/no ""consulting"" that goes on (1 project in over 3 years).

At the Analyst and Senior Associate level, you are expected to put in crazy hours sometimes to get projects done on time (work until midnight or later for a handful of weeks and weekends a year and until 7PM most of the other time. There are a few weeks that are a bit slower). Although there are a few managers who help with the grunt work when things get busy, most sit back and act like they are above the grunt work and are essentially just there to sign reports and review analysis. 

Bonuses are very low for the amount of extra work people put in. Some analysts after working almost a full year will get $1,200, while others might get $5,000 (on a good year you may get $10k)... this all depends on how much is in the bonus pool (how profitable the REAG was at the end of the year). Bonuses are paid March 1st-ish every year.  This past year, management said if you billed a certain number of hours to a client in November/December, that you would get a better bonus. Bonuses came around and they were way worse than they ever have been all across the board. 

The billable hour's system is broken here. They demand you bill at least 40 hours a week to a client, but at the same time the budgets for the projects are so small you can never do it under budget, and they ask you to back off hours from projects if you go over budget on them, which reduces your utilization (billed hours/40 hours).

I can't count how many events/dinners/activities I had to cancel with family and friends due to last-minute revisions/updates to appraisals.

There are some great people at DP and I am grateful for the experiences I gained, but ultimately, I wasn't happy there.

361,,Management lines their pockets as employees get pennies on the dollar,2020-02-28,2.0,Vice President,"-D&P tends to attract a good client base so projects and client work are good resume builders
-Work with bright individuals","-Work Life Balance can vary from group to group. Some groups consistently leave at 5 while others stay late into the night
-An unclear compensation structure. How people are compensated both in salary and bonus is formulated in a black box, where it seems year after year management finds new ways to restrict what’s paid back to employees
-An hourly billable system is used for fixed fee projects and business units. This doesn’t make sense. Time is wasted on truing up time entered in the system and reconciling back to the flat fees we invoice clients. 
-No system is currently in place which weighs different business units with consideration to what they typically receive on a per job basis. Different business units can work equally hard for a $20,000 job versus a $10,000 job, yet no consideration is given to the amount of effort put forth to achieve the revenue, even if the hours spent are the same. Different business units can only charge what the market allows, yet management cares only to the fee invoiced at the end of the day.
-Utilization is used as a measuring stick for compensation. Often times, utilization does not translate to actual work put in or efforts to get job done. Quality or timeliness of completed jobs isn’t always included in a utilization number. High utilization as compared to others is often the result of higher fees, which in turn enables employees to look as though they’ve worked harder when it’s far from reality. If you work for a managing director who attracts certain clients who will pay less for similar jobs, the staff and VPs are punished as their billable time looks poor as compared to other offices. In turn, this just means staff and VPs have to work twice as hard as other offices in order to achieve the same amount of revenue. What’s realistic for one office in terms of revenue might not be for others in the same service line, yet no consideration is given to that. 
-Unrealistic service line budgets are established, which only means bonus pools get cut year. Have we ever stopped to understand why budgets are missed year after year? I believe this to be a result of unrealistic expectations which provide management with an excuse to cut bonuses. Just because the service line had their best year in 2015, doesn’t necessarily mean 5% compounded service line revenue growth actually makes sense."

390,,"Great Opportunities, Long Hours, Tough Location",2019-09-09,4.0,Associate Manager,"•	Kroll is a company that rewards innovation – no question about that. I was awarded numerous opportunities that have shaped my career due to the welcoming attitude of management and team members towards new ideas and processes and, because the division is relatively small, change can move more quickly than at a large, less agile firm. 
•	It is hard work and can take over your life at times, but there are significant opportunities if you spend the time, cultivate relationships, and do quality work. You will get exposure to a ton of different types of firms and countries as you gain more proficiencies in research and it is a great job for improving your writing and analytical skills. 
•	It is a great first job as it provides a robust training program, will let you practice your foreign language skills, and provides a path for recent grads (especially International Relations grads) to move their skills from the theoretical to the concrete.
•	The firm offers a good amount of vacation days and, if you plan ahead, the company has no problem with you using the full allotment (unlike some other firms that have limits or a culture that discourages taking vacation). Also, they let you work remotely twice a week (which is just generally fantastic) and have very generous telecommuting policies during holidays.
•	The people are generally great to work with when you are able to take time away from day-to-day work.
•	I recommend Kroll to work for – I left because of the commute more than anything else; that and the long hours is why I deducted a star.","•	The main office is in Reston. I cannot overstate how much worse the experience is working in Reston vs DC. It’s easier to get to now than it was in the past, but it’s still in the middle of nowhere which hurts employee camaraderie (limited happy hour opportunities) and creates ridiculous commutes. The company recognizes this and tries to ameliorate it with telecommuting days, but it is still a significant issue.
•	Generally, most people will be working 45 - 50 hours a week on average, but it can get busier during a crunch or if you get behind on your work. 
•	Some of the cases can get monotonous, but as you build skills and a good reputation, you will be given more interesting work.
•	Support services are understaffed, which causes backups in hiring, HR matters, and IT support. If these positions aren’t filled, then it’s much more difficult to find and retain quality candidates to increase researcher headcount."

The smartest, hardest working people get paid and promoted the same as the worst employees, but are assigned 3x the amount of work and responsibility.
-No work/life balance. Expect your manager to call and email you at 11pm with an incoherent list of tasks to do before morning...for a project you gave him a week ago that he just never got to. Directors will tell you to cancel vacations for projects that haven't even started yet, even when other staff has availability.
-Manager apathy. Good managers will listen when you tell them that there are problems. They will agree. But they won't do anything. Ever.  Even for problems that they could solve in 2 minutes.
-Managers will treat you as sub-human and if you ever dare to grow a backbone they will nuke your performance reviews.
-  0 transparency around bonuses. You're expected to work 70+ hours week. Bonuses for staff are based entirely on hours worked, and even if you work 70+ hours a week your bonus could still end up being the same as someone who worked significantly less due to non-transparent bonus tiering. And directors don't care. Managing directors, when approached about pay issues, will yell at employees, ""Just Quit Then!""
-Incompetent Managers. Expect old ""boys club"" managers who don't even know how to use excel. And if there's ever a mistake, staff takes all the blame. If you're reviewing something for management and there's a mistake, it's your fault it goes through. If management reviews your work and there's a mistake, it's also 100% your fault.

-Pay is fine if we actually work 40 hour weeks (which does not happen often)","-Do not let analysts/associates speak directly to clients until you are a VP level. That is 5+ years of not having any client interaction and makes you feel like an excel MONKEY rather than feeling important and talking through issues with clients
-bonuses were SMALL
-LOTS of turnover due to heavy workload, small bonus, and constant emails from upper management pushing to work 60+ hours a week with no additional compensation
-real estate group stays later than the IB group and this does not sit well with analysts when they see the IB group getting ASTRONOMICALLY higher pay and bonuses
-Culture gone downhill since acquisition. Lay offs, small bonuses, upper management pushing analysts to work until midnight or 2am every single night with no additional compensation
-Small and UNREALISTIC budgets. For all of you that are reading this, D&P utilizes the billable hour system. This means you only have a certain time allotment to complete a project and if you go over budget (which happens on 99% of projects) then you can not bill these hours to your time card and have to bill as ""Available"" time. Upper management sees this as you having free time and want to push more work on you, even though you have been in the office until 2am, 4 nights in a row. CHANGE THIS.
-Trick people interviewing that this is a ""valuation"" role and not an appraiser role. If you want to be an appraiser, this is where you want to be. You will not be helping firms with their acquisitions or consulting on new markets. You will be APPRAISING properties after they have already transacted. If the appraisal comes in low, then the client will call the director and ask to tweak cap rates and other assumptions. Not a lot of critical thinking involved. Just mindless work to pay the bills."

If you think you are going to ""get great experience"" prepare yourself to take sub-par client projection models and link them to a D&P themed exhibit.  Working capital will be projected as a % of sales.

Spend your days hating what you do.... having terrible managers will surely make that better!  I will admit that the MD's are smart, but have absolutely no regard for their staff.  Literally they cannot retain anyone with a bit of talent and the middle management that results is as bad as you would assume the byproduct of this would be."

459,,Portfolio Valuation,2018-11-03,3.0,Vice President,"I work in Portfolio Valuation (PV), but rub shoulders with the VAS group (general valuation), so I will share some thoughts on that group as well. In short, working here will be excellent training, and a great stepping stone for your future career. However, you will be underpaid for the number of hours you work. Many new analysts come in and work very hard for a year or two and then leave to do Investment banking when they realize they will only be working slightly more hours (and more weekends), but get paid literally double. Analysts start somewhere around $67,500 in SF and NY I believe, or something close to that. Morale is low in many places, as Permira, the current PE firm owner has implemented quite a few layoffs that seemed unnecessary. Some were underperformers, but many were solid employees that had been with the company for a long time – it seemed short-sighted in the grand scheme of things. The Managing Directors at D&P are mostly all very intelligent and expert in their specific industry focus. It is relatively easy to become promoted to Senior Associate from Analyst within 2.5 years (pay increases to $85k), but the jump to VP is quite a bit more difficult, especially in VAS. PV is growing so it is better able to support talented staff making the jump to VP.

-PV – The PV group is doing very well from a growth perspective. Business is booming, revenues are growing and more and more PE firms are using D&P to do their valuation work. The MDs in PV are excellent for the most part. NJ does mainly debt valuations. New York has the bulk of the PV MDs and there are also two in SF, for a total of around 14 give or take. The MDs are smart, you will learn a lot working in this group that will lend itself well to many different exit opps on the finance/valuation team of a PE firm or elsewhere and could be a great exit to business school. The projects are fast-paced with quick turnaround, but the work itself is very interesting and engaging. 

-VAS – This part of the business is struggling. In 2018, revenues have been down so much that quite a few people were laid off. The work that VAS does is still top notch though but given how commoditized purchase price allocations and 409A’s have become, it will be interesting to see if this part of the business recovers. In its best years it was at 2-4% growth, and now it’s down double digits this year.","PV has to use the VAS staff (Analysts and Senior Associates), as they aren’t allowed to hire their own (every once in a while they will be allowed to hire one or two). This part of the business model makes no sense at all, and can only be explained as poor senior management. If PV had its own dedicated staff, this would be a great place to have a career (with the possible exception of being underpaid, but more on that below). Often times, PV managers and staff get burnt out from not having enough help to do the high work load, and will then leave to take jobs elsewhere. Also, everyone in PV is doing very complex work, but unless you’re a director that’s been there a very long time, or you were hired from outside, you will most likely be underpaid. If you’ve risen up through the ranks you will certainly be underpaid, and management will only maybe give you a significant raise up to market value if you have another offer in hand and you’re threatening to leave. PV continues to grow every year, but somehow they aren’t given their own staff, and bonuses still leave much to be desired. The poor performance of the VAS group means that PV ends up getting slighted – the bonuses are not good, which makes no sense at all. If PV was its own separate group completely bonuses and pay would most assuredly be much better as the group has a record year each year. Who’s going to be happy working very hard and then getting a 15% bonus (in the highest performer bucket), when you could be elsewhere receiving a bonus that’s double or triple that? A lot of people want to stay hoping the pay will improve, but somehow the bonuses are the same every year.

The new owners, Permira, paid too much to acquire D&P, and as they now realize that they have been trying to do whatever they can to cut costs. Layoffs in VAS sunk morale, and given the hot job market it is now (in 2018), junior staff are running for the exits and taking jobs offering over 25% higher pay. If PV wants to stay competitive, they need to pay their very talented and extremely hard working team market rate, or else Houlihan, or any number of other valuation or PE firms will continue to poach the best talent."

I've learned many skills and have become good at analyzing different data sets and financial modeling.","My biggest complaint, which you can see in many of the reviews, is that the company is paying below market rate.  Also, if you are a top performer here and good at the job, your reward is more work until you are absolutely swamped. The delegation of work is with managers asking you to be on their projects, where you are expected to say yes. This leaves a few people in the office swamped with work, while others get to waltz out at 5 (those people will make the same or more than you). There are way to many bosses per analyst and everyone wants their project to be the #1 priority. Most of the issues have been exasperated since being acquired by Permira who is cutting any cost they can, without any regard to employee morale or view to the company. Which has caused a lot more turnover than usual as people do not seem too pleased with the company. Additionally, there seems to be a lack of transparency between pay/promotion across similar offices, and there is no flexibility in negotiating your salary."

484,,Where Morale Goes to Die,2018-08-17,1.0,Vice President,"Decent middle-market clients
I had a good boss but that was rare
Some decent people (but they will leave)","I joined Duff, as many do, as a result of an acquisition and lasted about 2 years. By the time I left, the majority of the people I came over with (from Analysts to Managing Directors) had already left or left shortly after me. This happens frequently throughout the company, whose growth strategy is more reliant on speedy acquisitions than organic growth. As a result, the overarching mentality is that people are disposable and what's left is a hodgepodge organization with no core values, culture or direction.

Some reasons Duff can't retain top or even mediocre talent (i.e., why you, too, will want to leave):
-Incredibly demoralizing incentive structures. Salaries are a ridiculously large range at each level and below market. Bonuses are laughable, even (especially) for top performers. If you even get a bonus, HR will withhold some of it to incentivize retention. I don't know why they think Directors (for example) are incentivized to stay for 2 years to collect on $2,000 for work already performed (no exaggeration), but they try. 
-Despite high turnover (literally all the time), no solid process for recruiting and hiring. Positions are left open for months and even years. What happens then? You and your team are doing the work of 2+ people each. Clients notice downgraded quality. They leave. You leave. And HR gets to keep that $2,000 they withheld from last year's bonus.
-Bush league performance reviews; people fill out on online matrix and you're given your reviews after bonuses have already been allocated. Performance is not meaningful and there is absolutely zero interest in professional development. See above (""people are disposable""). If you're lucky (as I was), you'll have a solid manager who actually cares about you as a human but if they are good they will leave. Believe me, they will leave.
-Mediocre and oftentimes damaging middle management who have no idea how to run a group; classic situation whereby people are inexplicably promoted well past their abilities (look up the Peter principle).
-Utter lack of leadership and integrity from upper management. I know firsthand that violations that get reported to HR (over and over and over again) are swept under the rug. When I say ""violations"", think about things that ended up on newspaper headlines this year. Again, the company has no core values and that firmly comes from the top."

They will give you time to ""improve"" after which they give you an ultimatum either leave under certain terms that they define or you can stay and take your chances at being terminated later which is sure to happen.

534,,I Do Not recommend this Company!,2017-08-03,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"There are some great people working here, very bright people.","The pay is below market and the bonuses and raises are poor. There is minimal work life balance as it is frowned upon if you do not supersede the firms utilization targets. The Company does not take the time to invest in their employees in reference to training and mentor-ship to prepare them for the next level of promotion. The Company would rather continue to hire from the outside than promote their own people internally. The culture or rather lack there of is very fragmented. Each group does their own thing and even within a single group their is no uniformity or comradery. The ""power of the ampersand"" is merely a slogan that is in no way the reality of how the groups within the firm work and conduct business.  All of the MD's ""do their own thing"" and judge employees differently based on their own personal working styles and opinions of an individual. There is no consistent performance process to determine promotions FAIRLY and UNIFORMLY but rather you must be favored or well liked by an MD with ""pull"" in order to get promoted. If you are not an ""MD Favorite"" you will not be promoted. Plain and simple. Even management is selective on who they interact with and who they don't and do not make an effort to get to know and develop all of the employees under them. The Company also lacks diversity across many many levels and although the Company states they are investing in such efforts, no such results of such efforts can be seen. As with any Company there is red tape and politics. Duff & Phelps is FULL of it. The human resources department appeases you to at least meet with you to hear your concerns and thereafter does nothing with them. There is only change once you repeatedly voice a matter. Lastly, a lot of the MDs here do not know how to encourage and motivate the lower level staff. They are also not well trained or skilled in ho to give constructive criticism. They have their opinion and if you do not line up with how they think you are deemed a poor performing employee. a true leader encourages an employees strengths and works with the employee to develop them in their area of weakness. The MDs here are not leaders, they are simply people whose job is to bring in money to the firm. They are also untouchable meaning they can do no wrong. I have witnessed MDs speak to the employees here in a way that is demeaning , disrespectful and certainly not professional and yet senior leadership has taken little to no action."

Given the talent around you and the level of drive everyone has to succeed, you should be prepared to push your limits to avoid getting left behind.  As a project-based business, the high-value assignments are typically staffed with the star employees, and over time, if you don't manage your career appropriately, you can get left behind very quickly if you don't make it a priority to prove yourself on those projects.  If you find yourself being left off the high-value projects with regularity, it is a pretty good benchmark to assess how successful you will be, and it might make sense to move on."

674,,Never again.,2014-04-25,1.0,Investment Banking Analyst,The admins were cool. All very down to earth.,"- The culture was in my opinion, very pretentious (which is surprising because well... its D&P).
- Expect a bonus that is only 10-20% of what your peers would be getting at top MM firms and bulges... if they screw you more beyond that, it may be close to 5% of what others are receiving.
- No structure. The training in the boonies of Illinois was a JOKE. I learned nothing sitting with my peers in the Tax, Valuation, Dispute Consulting, Transfer Pricing... etc. How do they expect to properly train employees in the IB practice when we have 2 weeks to learn about D&P's laundry list of other practices...
- You have to study for the series on your own WHILE WORKING 100+ hour weeks. That's right. D&P offers ZERO training or separate time for you to prep for your series exam so expect to be cramming/extremely tired your first 3 months on the job studying and working simultaneously. You have to take both the series 79 and 63 and after a few more months... the series 7 as well.
- If you want to work on M&A, this is not the right firm. If you want to scrub comps, work on Salesforce (looking up contact information and data entry) and pitch all day and all night, this will be the right firm for you.
- Aside from training being unstructured, the analyst program itself is unstructured, as well as, the firm. Because the firm is trying to compete with bigger banks, a lot of investment is going into building an FSG practice. What does that mean for analysts? SALESFORCE ALL DAY, ALL NIGHT. Expect to become an expert at looking up addresses, phone numbers, websites, port cos, etc. It will make you question why you went to a university in the first place.
- Have you ever heard about a bank that offers $25 of dinner meal reimbursements but yells at you for eating $20-25 meals? I didn't until I worked at D&P. I can't count how many times MDs have pulled me into their office because my meals were ""too expensive."" Maybe they should reconsider working me to the ground before complaining to me about my dinner expenses.
- If you want to work yourself to the ground, while not getting paid appropriately for the hours and having to be cognizant about your dinner expenses at chipotle AND have no exit opps when you try to leave, by all means-- this may be the place for you!"

The work is also very interesting and helps lay a great foundation of technical skills.","The organization is a little siloed and when chasing new deals, there seems to be a lot of angst about helping peers.

682,,"Great company for the industry, but long-term potential in industry limited",2014-01-16,3.0,Senior Associate,"Project based work -- always get to move onto something new.  Also you generally have a lot of flexibility about how you go about your work.  Exception might be for work being reviewed by an auditor, in which case you have to play by their rules.

Amount of variety is outstanding.  You end up being exposed to a vast array of industries involving every conceivable product or service.  There are some businesses that are so nich and would never be on your spectrum if you are just analyzing public companies.

You meet a lot of interesting people at the client companies.

You develop a deeper understanding of business and realize that the textbook view of business is not so cut and dry as a pure maximization of profits that necessarily occurs for a company with a wide ownership base (i.e.- a public company).","A lot of mediocre people.  You get a lot of finance guys who couldn't quite get into banking, asset management, etc.  Or you get the bean counters who move up into business valuation, especially since all the accounting firms now have valuation practices.

As an extension, the field is becoming more and more dominated by the accounting firms and thus it's becoming very formulaic in their valuations, and generally not much insight.  Worse, they have increasing clout and are influencing the way the profession is evolving.  If you've ever dealt with auditors, then you know why this is not a great outlook.

Pay can be crappy relative to other finance jobs.  

A lot of the same old ideas are rehashed over and over.  People do attempt to innovate on the theoretical front, but I haven't seen too much that was truly original.  Even then, it wouldn't make its way out of the valuation community.

Fees are definitely coming down or at least stagnant.  Again, too many bean counters getting into the game."

Slightly better work-life balance than other companies in financial services.","Long hours and below-market-rate pay, both pre- and post-recession. Several rounds of layoffs during the recession decreased employee morale. Management was sometimes overly demanding but is expected at most companies. Limited exit opportunities compared with other firms."

Also, a large portion of the firm is valuation, which is more of a commodity than some other value-added services."
715,,Great experience for a first timer in Financial Services,2012-06-13,3.0,Vice President,Small boutique-minded bank that attracts good clients,Public company puts it under unnecessary strain.

Easy to work with and friendly.",Managers in non-banking areas are questionable. Some make horrible bosses seem perfect. Younger bankers have a sense of entitlement and treat non-bankers poorly.

- Transaction opinion group is ok and the restructuring group is very reputable.
- Generally pleasant and palatable colleagues across the levels.
- Good health benefits.","- Lack of mentoring and accountability make it difficult for one to advance in their career; however, one will likely advance at Duff & Phelps due to tenure.
- Environment of ""get it done"" instead of ""get it done properly.""  
- Management is not forthright (or is uncomfortable) providing constructive feedback, which is self-perpetuating and ultimately causes ""bush league"" work to be produced.
- Recent acquisitions lack cohesive vision, other than they will ""grow the practice and expand our presence.""
- Below market bonus.
- If you are a true investment banker, don't forget that Duff & Phelps is a valuation firm."
721,,"Long hours, low pay, motivation issues",2012-01-21,3.0,,"Great learning experience for newcomers
A lot can be learnt from coworkers","Very long hours that are not paid. You are expected to work day-night if needed and you are not rewarded for it. The pay is too low, which explains the high company turnover. 
Limited promotion possibilities. Tenure is more important than knowledge, skills and what one can actually do when it comes to promotion."

If you are a associate you will have tremendous responsibility because the folks hire up won't be there for input.","Company culture changed when it went public from valuation firm to accounting firm.
MD's who were not smart enough to carry their own weight or bring in decent business.
MD's looked out only for themselves when company went public
Company suffered when they change income generation from Associates with MBA's from top schools to Associates barely out of college with no experience.
No diversity."
725,,"Great team, fast paced work environment",2011-12-07,5.0,Senior Associate,"Duff & Phelps offers a great work environment for anyone who thrives on challenging projects and enjoys working among the best in the industry.  The firm consistently brings in new projects and works with great clients.  The Internal Firm Services teams work hard to support the service lines, and most of the MDs have a very welcoming open door policy.","Working in this industry, for Duff & Phelps or for ANY of our competitors, comes with the expectation that there will be a lot of work, which sometimes translates into a lot of hours.  If you aren't comfortable rolling up your sleeves and getting the work done, this isn't the place for you."

- Highly professional atmosphere
- Seem to hit a homerun with every acquisition
- MDs are some of the best in their industries. Highly accomplished and regarded by clients.
- No ""time-clock cops"". Easy come-and-go policy. People are trusted to manage their work load accordingly even at the intern level.
- Sky's the limit for advancement. You decide the pace.","- Too much overhead in the form of non-revenue employees
- Can lose sight of the big picture as they cut corners on trivial things like computer supplies, yet have admin staff sitting around with nothing to do
- The sky-high rates and long hours equal HUGE revenues, but don't seem to flow down Jr. Mgmt and staff. Someone's getting paid (MDs?EC? Shareholders?).
- Staffing can seem like organized chaos as no one is sure what is two weeks down the pipeline and what they will be working on.
- Hiring cannot keep up with work coming in because they rely on internal referrals or dumb luck of people finding the listing on the website."
728,,Okay Place to work.  Not much opportunity for advancement,2011-08-26,3.0,,Good Benefits.  Nice working environment active management.   Employees given responsibilitie and tools to succeed but no guidence on how to obtain next level.,Promotions given out popularity contest.  Too many managers and not enough workers.   Understaffed and under appreciated.   Hours and work life would be better if the staff was beefed up.
729,,only someone desperate for a job should work here,2011-07-18,2.0,Vice President,"most people below the MD level are very nice and good to work with. If  you need a job badly and don't care about worklife balance or compensation, they will love you.",Many MD's treat you like you are easily replaceable and that you should work at their beckon call. You will work a lot of weekends and be paid like someone who doesn't. The stock price is down for a reason. They can not hire good talent.
