6. Working 24/7, well when you dont have friends or family, or require sleep at night, this is the best place to work. Conference calls at 12 at night, and if you fall asleep then you are given a earful.
7. Amazing promotions as it has been seen many sales executives/ receptionists are working as top bosses at branch level ( thank God they haven’t infiltrated top management) but you can expect same working style and policy/ strategy implementations as your subordinate.
8. Perfect example of how dictatorships work.
9. Ethnic tolerance and diversity is amazing, rooting out all the different diversity and ethnic groups through shouting and disturbing mental peace has been seen.
10. Perfect place when you can share a drink with imbeciles who wont consider you a part of their pack unless you drink cheap booze and drink cheap food, work as a hired help, listen to them watching shows in loudspeakers during office hours.
11. Lastly, no ex employee has ever worked, only boss is the key to successful market position ( which no boss has ever visited ever)","1. No support from other departments.
2. Unless you are placed at head office, no heed will be given to any ideas you give.
3. You can only grow if your boss like you, i have seen people who have the best performance in all products, being consistent but not promoted because the dont drink with rsm, or do their chores."

HR in this company has no role to play other than lining up candidates for hiring and firing. Any type of misbehaving done by your superior will always be overlooked. The attrition at managerial level is very high due to its culture. This is the reason this company hires 50 Management trainees in a year to compensate for its attrition.

Recently some young employees have also died due to Covid but still they forcefully ask staff to go to field. Even the Customers have become irritated by the callous attitude of the Company wherein they are only communicated for EMI payments rather than to communicate their well being and safety. They even don't pay the full Conveyance Reimbursement for the petrol expenses incurred by the Field Officers. As per the Company norms, they have insured the Covid Medical expenses to Rs. 27000 only, over and above which the employee has to bear. Their appraisal structure is also extremely pathetic as they have not increased salaries last year and appraisals are generally done on whims and fancies of supervisors rather than based on performance. Senior Management is only asked to be Best in exploiting the ground level employees. One can think of working in such workplace as the last option since there is no opportunity for Growth and Personal Development."

Complete ur task and you are free to wander anywhere. No need to comes office regularly.
You will get lots of respect especially from ladies group to whom you are providing loans.","Managers are not efficient. I don't think they are qualified well or quality training are provided by management. Personality development is must at every level.

They are arrogant and abusive in nature as they think they have touch the moon and stars.

Pathetic work environment. No quality of standards amongs worker. Worst salary structure with such a low incentives which is probably impossible to achieve.

Company think field officer group of employee as slave. I think daily wages construction worker earn double than us. 

Senior and bosses treat u abusively at every level. No sense of class. 

Feel awful that I am part of highly reputed Indian's brand. 
No work-life balance during the time of collection and sourcing which can probably make you seek if you continue to work in such manner. During collection process you have to work without meal from morning till late night. 

Company products and customers service are worst in the market with high rate of intrest.
Customer feels tiresome to pay installment for 24 months which seems very long for such a small amount in which they are force to pay at exact date and time. Otherwise both field officer and customers are threaten and abused by manager. If installment does not come in time. You are force to pay customer's installment from ur hard earn salary and you have to chase the same customer to recover ur salary. This will only rate performance of team manager who reduce debtors of branch and made most of regular collection. 

Don't dream of promotion even after your best of ability and efforts. You just have to wait till hair turn grey. Again if you are lucky to get promoted. Get ready to go down to hell once again. 

I am leaving this company after completing my 1 year tenure.
I have even experience loss of money during collection due to negligence of cash handling by manager. Nobody seems trustworthy in your work place even though all of them pretend to be cooperative and helpful. Task become bit risky during collection process."

429,L&T Financial Services,Pathetic workplace,2018-06-07,1.0,Senior Manager,"Salary
Very dynamic decision making (not sure if its a pro)","1. Work time 9.30 to 6.30. Under no scenario, employee welfare counts. I have seen floods, bandh, almost any risky scenario. But, L&T finance doesn't care. They want you to come to office at any cost. No travel advisory comes from HR or Admin for safety and security
2. HR intimidates you in the induction day that leaving at 6.30 means you don't work. And top management ensures that all sit in desk till 8pm or even late. I know I didn't say work till 8pm, you are required to sit till 8pm even if no work is there. If you leave, you will be abused. Most Saturdays are working by top management, they don't request your presence, they order. Heard of pink slips when employee refused to work on Saturdays. 
3. Abusive. I have seen the top management abusing business heads in front of huge audience for smallest of errors.
4. If you commit any error, you would be shouted at, abused, might even risk losing job. 
5. Almost every project, big or small, deadline is EOD. Projects which we did in a month in other companies are done in a day. You would be abused with cuss words in case you try to reason. 
6. Cafeteria time is limited. Morning till 9.45 before work time starts, and evening post work time ends at 6.30. My school was far better. If you had a meeting and missed lunch, you have to go out to lunch( fun fact: there is no good eating place near Mumbai office). 
7. Most people have no clue why they are doing a certain project, the answer almost is I have been asked by so and so to do it. 
8. No brainstorming. Junior level employees are never asked for suggestions. The culture is seniors order and juniors abide. 
9. Offsite. Only certain teams and top personnel gets invite to offsite, parties or anything closely related to fun. The motivation they use is, if you work hard and become a Head, then you get to party; no thanks. 

Avoid it at any cost. This place will corrode you."
