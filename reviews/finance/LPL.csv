Teach us systems we dont even have access too right off the bat. Then immediately put us on calls pair us up for a couple of days then leave us hanging. Literally no one knows what they are doing. There is so much information and so many forms and rules that you have to follow for specific type of accounts. At least 6/21 training hires quit after a month. For my mental health, I couldnt handle this job. They micromanage calls right off the bat ask you what you are doing when you arent on the phone at that moment. They asked for our feedback so many times and never once took it instead they held it against us. Financial Advisors are so rude and mostly treat you like trash. Some are god sent especially after the rude calls but most act like you are the dirt on the ground. 

If you are feeling pushed to take a job and weary about this one, id say dont. The pay is nice but they dont care about you and they dont teach you anything."

The people are nice and there is not a lot of closed doors when reaching out for information across departmental lines. Basically, not a lot of snobbery.","Tends to be a lot of micromanagement in their culture. Have found they add layers and layers of mgmt they sometimes fundamentally do not need in some areas. Every other person you come in contact with there is an Assistant Vice-President. So some of these managers with direct reports have little to do but hover over you. They need busy work for themselves to prove something so you find yourself conducting work that is irrelevant to anything. Appears to me they could streamline a lot of this. Also since they hire 4 people to change one light bulb sometimes you may find yourself stuck doing some tedious and uninteresting work. Also some classic cases of the left hand not knowing what the right hand is doing...and all in one department! Again, possibly a result of the lightbulb scenario."

The sky is the limit regarding growth opportunity throughout the organization. Lots of internal promotions and ability to learn other areas of the business.
The recent benefits bench-marking study pegged LPL's generous benefits offerings far above the average Fortune 500, financial services, and also tech industry company. Aside from insurance, 401(k) matching, and discounted LPL stock purchasing, there's also a nice gym, workout classes, onsite nurse, pharmacy, cafeteria with healthy food options, coffee shop, etc.
Very nice people that are all customer-oriented. There's also a renewed focus on diversity and inclusion that is being cascaded throughout the company.
Agile and pioneering culture.","Those that don't like change will struggle, as the company's growth and acquisition of big clients and other competitors causes somewhat frequent restructuring to accommodate business needs.
With so much growth opportunity and frequent promotions, some of the managers are first-time managers with a lot to learn, but there are many resources for development available. I'm not yet sure if there is a structured plan laid out to force development of management skills.
Pay compensation is pretty good but not industry-leading, as total rewards and value of other financial benefits are the focus. Not everyone sees the value in them or needs them."

Besides the flexibility of having the opportunity to work from home. This company is not for you if you are not a in a certain demographic. The diversity and inclusion system is not catered to all.

If you were hired before 2016, you were more than likely hired at a certain hourly rate that was significantly lower than than the current hourly rate new employees are starting at who were brought onto LPL within the last 8-10 months. The handling of the fallout from executive leadership, once became known as a real hiring compensation level, to put it mildly, was insulting. STO employees had meetings with executives to explain that the reasons new hires were being paid more than current employees with more than 5+ years on the books was because we are recruiting better talent and raising our standards, as if the people they were saying this in front of apparently were not the standard. Current tenured employees were informed, as long as they met their goals and performed at a standard that was in accordance with the new hires pay structures, would also be promoted to the new hires pay structure. These promotions, as to when they would happen, the frequency of them, and if a wage increase would also be guaranteed at a certain thresh-hold, those answered changed and were inconsistent, at best, until the pressure from service personnel did not subside and this past July, the first batch of promotions were made, albeit spontaneously and with no rhyme or reason as to who or how the valuations were made. To date, employees are told every quarter, employees will be selected for promotion but don't hold any truth this. It is interesting to wonder if this would have been done if pay structures were found to be different."

The annual merit increase is a joke ( literally like 20 cents)even when you performance at a high level and earn the 7% increase (they tell you the department was only given x amount of dollars for merit increase). If you want to get licensed, good luck trying to get them to sponsor you. Promotions are based on favoritism. Company claims to be ""client centric mindset"" but it‚Äôs just all about numbers.

I had high hopes and fully intended to make a career within this company by becoming an expert in my field and thriving within the legal department.  I thought I had an opportunity to do so and did meet a number of professionals along the way that were a pleasure to work with and would have helped any of their colleagues achieve their desired goals.  Morale was great and the team that I worked with was friendly and effective.  A number of us, past and current colleagues, still keep in touch.  This was a family.  

Once the leadership of the company began to change all of the aspirations I had and the culture of the company were suddenly no more.","Leadership of all levels are oblivious as to how to treat their employees or run said departments.  A company that once looked to their employees for feedback no longer cares for their opinions or the value they add to the company.  

Senior management has taken a position to harass and bully employees forcing many to seek new employment.  The toxicity and hostility of the environment has forced other former colleagues to quit without securing employment elsewhere when the environment has become unbearable.  You are honestly left with the decision of choosing between a paycheck or your mental and emotional health - I took the first position I was offered outside of the company as well as a pay cut because I could not handle the hostility of the department I was working in or the ineptitude of Senior and Executive Management.     

Senior management has tormented colleagues both publicly and privately among immediate colleagues and colleagues outside of the department.

You‚Äôre expected to speak to financial advisors 97% of your day and if you need time off the phone to research issues you must apply for it. Call volumes are excessive (taking upwards of 50 calls a day). Being on the specialized line, you get call transfers from the other service teams, and they do not try to help the advisor or solve the problem and they have miserable attitudes, they transfer to get advisors off the line. Not all of your teammates are trained equally, and then the others don‚Äôt care if they give bad information, leaving you to handle an angry advisor calling in for the third time. But you can‚Äôt correct anyone because they cry to your manager that you‚Äôre mean. Your team mates will team up against you and bully you. Management doesn‚Äôt hear  both side of the argument and make rash decisions. Management will ride you like a work horse. Unfair advantages are given to the wrong team members.

More micromanagement from the higher ups that have no knowledge of the job I've done since the beginning of my employment here. No management asking for input from senior employees, just changes made on assumptions.
Even when asked for input, you are shrugged off and changes that you have told won't work, are implemented and ultimately fail. 
Advisors are frustrated with the service center, guess what, the rest of the back office are frustrated with the service center. They have turned into blind transferring machines. If they don't know the answer they seem to play phone extension roulette. I don't talk to advisors but I'll get pissed off advisors transfered to me and I can't help them. I love dealing with angry people...... It's obvious new employees in service center are just hired to fill a seat so the company can make production numbers. 
They constantly talk about breaking down silos. There were little to no ""silos"" ten years ago. Now it's every department for themselves. No one takes responsibility for anything and hold grudges against other departments. The more upper management talks about breaking down silos, the worse it gets. 
Pay is low, bonuses are low. The only thing I am impressed with is our 401k matching.
Don't believe what the head of HR denies. People always leave LPL and come back so they can get paid more. 
They have gutted our health insurance and I'm afraid of needing surgery or getting sick. When we complained we got ""this is how our competitors are"" not a good response.
They magically stopped calling themselves an ""employer of choice"" 
In the years I've worked there I have never seen such an employee turn over. Managers lie about the job people are applying for and then, oops you need to do this thing that, if you knew it was part of the job, you wouldn't have taken it. People have quit within days of starting because of this. 
No support from management. I'm sick of being told I'm doing an awesome job and getting nothing in return except a pat on the head. There are only so many pats on the head one can take. 
They have no support for employees to take securities exams. They used to, once in a while, but seem to have forgotten that a lot of positions require you to get a license and have since stopped. They just buy you a book and hope you pass (and for some exams you can be fired if you fail). 
I would not recommend anyone work for this company. I apologize to the advisors who need to deal with their horrible customer service but until the morale is fixed, the ""silos"" are broken down, and employees are properly trained, it's going to get worse. 
Also, they seriously need to update the systems that we use to maintain accounts. It's like working in the early 90s. In fact I worked for companies in the 90s that had better technology than LPL. Tell me why I can't fax from my computer?"

On site clinic.","Extremely Low Pay with never any adequate merit increases aka below 2% annual raise if any.  There were no raises for 3 out of the 4 years of my tenure.  During my 4 year employment at LPL Financial,  I discovered that the company has the Mcdonalds and Walmart leadership philosophy, which is, lets take advantage of the labor market by capitalizing on low pay and high turnover and not consider the cost savings of higher paid and happier employees (low turnover).  Employees are considered expenses not assets.  Also, this company wishes to outsource and resource as much as possible.  I saw an entire department almost vanish overnight, putting heavy strain on the few employees that remained in that department.  Overall, the leadership at the highest level disgusts me.

However, that started to quickly fade about a month into the job when I started to realize the role I interviewed for didn't match up with the work that was given.  I was also never ""onboarded"" or given any type of training.  I brought this up to my manager who KNEW I had no experience in the tasks that was given to me and admitted that the role was different from what I interviewed for but I had to ""figure it out it quickly""!  I was thrown random tasks that my manager probably didn't even know how to do.  When I did ask questions, I was criticized on how I even asked questions!  I finally came to my senses and realized that my manager's ONLY concern was how she would benefit from me.  Since I was a brand new employee who needed a little more guidance she was willing to give and not having an LPL network, she knew I had nothing to offer her and treated me like I was garbage up until my last minute there."

The building is very nice. However, it has been pointed out many times to me that is was designed specifically with the ability to share the building with another tenant, just keep that in mind.

Not a bad gig if you are on the sales side.","-Lay offs are common in SD within Operations as it is getting moved aggressively to South Carolina; with most of the promotions and positions going with it. (If you are internal just look at the most recent round of promotions.  Individuals who couldn't pass the S7 or S24 are being promoted to leadership positions in FM).
-Senior Leadership is spineless and has no idea how to manage with other business units.  It doesn't help that the largest business unit has a handful of SVPs/EVPs while the other units give the titles out like they are candy.  
-Inconsistent messaging around layoffs.  100+ people in SD were given notice then ""just kidding"" 2 weeks before their term date and they magically had a job again despite what plans the employee made. 
-Long term the industry is in some trouble as fee compression is real and LPL's cut continues to get smaller.  Look at the number of ""Robo advisers"" that can do the work of 80% of the advisers out there for less than half the fee to the client.

There are opportunities to move up, though, like most places,  there is a bit of the ""who you know"" when it comes to  your chances of landing a job.  

Additionally, there is a wide range when it comes to management styles.  Some departments are content to do your job and as long as the results are there, they'll leave you alone.","Some areas, (unfortunately my situation) will micromanage you in ways you never imagined.  I'm talking about inputting a code in your phone to indicate that you are on break, when you're just going to the bathroom.  And they'll subtract that from your break time.

WHAT NOT TO DO as CEO. You cant win without people. You just lost your people.","There has been too much restructuring, it never ends. Living everyday in fear of a job loss from restructuring is no way to live. The final straw was the most recent announcement of a MASSIVE cut to our benefits. The CEO and whomever else involved in this decision REEMED every employee who works here with cost cutting, starting with Health Insurance. LPL has lost all faith and has underestimated their associates. I took my daughter in to the doctor on the new insurance plan, my copay was $450! That is ONLY the copay! It used to be $50! And this is not even a high dedictible plan people! PLUS the monthly costs of our insurance went through the roof. This was a SLAP in the face from what should be a responsible company. Not a way to treat associates. No one with talent will stay here.

Every minute is accounted for. Most jobs have been running in the ""red line"" of speed and work load for years and this is the new normal so it has become expected. Hired for one department needs and duties turns into six to save on overhead. It's hard to change jobs inside the company unless you take a lessor position with a pay cut. They tend to fill positions at entry level. Moving up in the company is especially difficult. Experienced and hard working no longer means what it used to.

I guess it's a pro if you come from outside of LPL because they will pay you more.,"Don't stay here long. You'll be overworked, underpaid, under-appreciated and then you'll watch someone come in with the same title, with little experience, no drive, ""clock-puncher"" and find out they make $7-10k more than you.

LPL is a corporation who has stockholders, their mission is for the betterment of their stockholders, which is understandable. Over the years, I've seen completely incapable people in major decision making roles with no obvious repercussion when they put the firm at risk for (or actual) regulatory fines. Then at the same time LPL makes a decision to offshore a large chunk of operations including parts of departments I feel should never belong belong outside of the US. I also don't understand how they made the individual decision to lay certain people off, it screams of agism. I wish those people the best but I would imagine that it's quite difficult to find a new position when you're in your early 60's and you work in an operation role. At the time I thought that maybe it was just a fluke but as we transition thru another layoff (3rd that I've seen in less than 6 years although there have been more in additional departments) while they move more of operations to the SC office, I've seen the oldest people on the impacted list. Plus, again I don't know how they made their decisions to cut certain people. Many of whom have incredible knowledge of this industry and of the positions that they were in. It won't be a smooth transition especially since they are letting go the ""best and the brightest"" while leaving the incompetent leadership to lead departments they don't understand. And to add salt in the wound, it was pretty obvious that while they were laying off people some lower leveled management were promoted so that they wouldn't be impacted by the layoffs. LPL has no heart for their employees but at least we have free soda and a new building. Cheers, great job LPL!"

Can't even cancel a mutual fund order on the system before closing bell.  Very frustrating.  Had a security breach and service issues affected clients, so I didn't want to repaper clients and leave, but am very happy with new B/D.  I got so I would call 3 times and take best two of three responses.  (Even service center supervisors didn't call back.)"

If you have a good manager he will allow additional training, licensing, industry events attendance, and variety of duties","If your AVP or manager changes and you are not a personal friend or professional rear kisser, TRANSFER as quickly as possible or you will be isolated and then harassed until you resign or stressed to the point of illness."
758,,AVP,2016-05-22,4.0,Assistant Vice President,SHare some good reason as to why you should work at LPL Financial. I think it should be a good idea to make it a place to call your home.

759,,Contractor Analyst,2016-05-19,1.0,Contractor,"The analyst there were mostly contractors, and they helped new contractors.  Nothing is written down; so this extra help was very much appreciated.","I had this manager that would say inappropriate things.  Also, I could answer his questions, and he would ask the same question to other analyst -- and other analyst gives him the same response.  The manager would say he has no idea what I'm talking about; but when the other analyst said the same response, he seemed to understand.   There is such a big turn-over there."

Clearly, the lawsuits plus continual turnover by the SVP plus is a red herring for lack of clear strategy, direction, stock price diving and lack of integrity at the top of the house.

I felt that I was able to polish my young professional career here.,This is a great place to start but not to end up. Sure you can move up within the company but the compensation is not worth it. You'll find that most of the people working here are very incompetent . When I first started I had to train my manager how to do something (kinda told me right away I wasn't going to stay long).
769,,Overall,2016-04-26,4.0,Anonymous Employee,"Schedule flexibility can be good, but that varies by dept.  Volunteer opportunities are limitless and LPL give 16 hrs/year to volunteer.",Salaries are not top of industry.  Future location in Ft Mill is going to cause additional travel time and money for a good chunk of employees and company isn't willing to make any kind of concessions for those employees that it will cause a hardship for.   Employees were blindsided at the end of 2015 that no merit increases would be given in Feb 2016 (which was normal practice for the past several years).  Supposedly a new schedule was implemented for merit increases and those will be re-evaluated in Sept 2016.

772,,Customer Service Associate,2016-04-16,2.0,Customer Service Associate,Nice newer building in San Diego.  Some good folks work at LPL.,"Management is almost non-existent although there is a plethora of people that hold the title.  If you love to be micro managed the service center is the place for you.  Inefficient operations and structure in service center.  Management was able to outsource their own job and use the feedback from a third party to make ""improvements"" that never materialized when they were clearly being stated by the employees.  LPL has difficulty in  identifying and nurturing talent.  Company has stagnant growth because they are catering to the old way of doing business, watch LPL leave San Diego in a few years when the lease is up."
773,,The Beatings Will Continue Until Morale Improves,2016-04-12,3.0,Assistant Vice President,"Great benefits, awesome San Diego facilities, good people to work with and fantastic work culture.","Rough times ahead.  Fiscal decisions seem questionable.  Too many projects, too little resources. Project resources at the business level conflict with resource needs for the 365 day-per-year audit cycles.

During my short employment/contract with LPL Financial back in 2015 I was offered an interview with the Service Center department. I was able to sit with two supervisors and neither one of them knew how to conduct an interview. The interview felt very rushed and they booted me out so quickly. It literally made me feel as if I were a waste of their time. 

Be extremely aware!! The leadership team has no regard for good workers/potential candidates. Based on the fact that they may feel threatened by new comers who have an advantage over them."

The comp is fine, and when the company isn't in a hiring freeze or budget crunch,  there is a decent opportunity for internal mobility....BUT you need to know the right people.",The company suffers from poor communication because of tech silos and management doesn't seem to find it worth their time to respond to emails even when problems need resolution. We don't have adequate tools to meet the demands of the job.  Management is constantly changing which comes across like senior management doesn't know what it's doing.
782,,Vice President,2016-03-01,1.0,Vice President,The ammenities in the new building were very nice.,"LPL's big thing was to be ""an employer of choice"".  Sr managment talks the talk but they do not do what is needed.  I had an EVP who told eveyone he was a great people manager.  What a joke.

795,,Not what I thought at all!,2015-12-31,3.0,Service Center Representative,The pay maybe ok if you're permanent. Somewhat of a laid back atmosphere.,"LPL treats it's contract or contingent employees like they are not an asset to the company. They don't receive any type of recognition and they are not included in the company events. Management doesn't do much to even acknowledge the temporary employees and they go out of their way to make sure that you know that you cannot do certain things because you're a temp! I have never felt so unappreciated by an employer. The holidays have come and gone and no one from management has stopped by or even sent an email to say ""Happy Holidays, enjoy your New Year,"" or something along those lines. I'll just say that it is very unfriendly workplace to say the least."
796,,LPL is a decent place to start your career,2015-12-29,3.0,,Comp is relatively good and the firm encourages lateral movement,Benefits keep getting cut; management isn't truthful with employees; bonuses rarely paid at target

802,,Mixed Feelings,2015-12-09,3.0,Anonymous Employee,"LPL has great benefits for employees and in my case, flexible work schedules.  I am not sure if that was available across the firm as it appears to be a case by case management decision.",LPL struggles to close the gender pay gap. Additionally managing up has become an art at LPL.
803,,Its's a job...definitely not a career,2015-12-09,1.0,Operations Specialist,Great health benefits; getting time off is pretty easy; schedule is flexible for before/after work activities; new building amenities are great (guess our low salary pays for a great building),"Salary is extremely low ($1.50 total increase after working here five+ years); only way to get promoted is by who you know, not what you know; hard work is not recognized; all the jobs are moving to Charlotte (where the cost of living is a lot cheaper) or to India"
804,,Slave to the Shareholder Already,2015-12-06,1.0,Manager,"I've learned a lot at this company and we continue to navigate the waters in an environment of constant change. There's an effort to become an employer of choice, which is a noble cause - but many are wary that it's merely lip service and slight of hand for what lies beneath the surface.","These days it's just a matter of what shareholders will want next. Of course it's higher profitability - at any cost.

Over the last few years, we've been forced to trim down budgets in just about every nook and cranny. Yes - it's wise to operate on a lean philosophy to a degree, but how much more can this budget be reduced.

There is an underlying fear that one can be laid off at any time. One can say it's just trimming the fat, but it seems like the higher one moves in rank, the closer they are to being out the door. 

Politics has always been a problem at LPL, especially in the GRC area. If one leader doesn't like you, they're on a mission to get rid of you. One wrong move and it's career suicide. I thought bringing in Michelle O would change things, but she is still surrounded by old mentalities that continue to foster the wrong culture that LPL is trying to improve. Perhaps it will take more time.

My advice to other employees: Get your licenses. Get familiar with as many systems as you can. Build your resume. You never know when the job will quit on you."

Employer of choice and client-centricity commitments are lip service when considering actual actions and decision making. It's mainly a self-preservation, short term, profit motivated organization with decision making dominated by the c-suite, little to no distributed empowerment, and a work environment that is very busy but not productive. It's also very political, increasingly so in the past few years."

The reason employees in the finance and accounting groups turn over so much is because no one can ever get comfortable with their job. Very few people are subject matter experts. Once there is a comfort level, all processes will change. There is very little work/life balance. Late nights and weekend work is very common."

Nice building in San Diego.,"Victor Fetter (CTO) was hired and he immediately outsourced 75% of the IT services.  I understand business is business, but LPL made us train our replacements!  Not cool.  They gave us the option: ""You train them, or you're fired"".  Oh, thanks.  The pay increases were a joke.  Health benefits were expensive.  They don't offer eating utensils, cups, etc.. All in all, things were MUCH better before LPL went public and when Chris Feeney was the CTO.  Victor Fetter was smiling and laughing as he announced to 200+ people that they were losing their jobs."

Standing desks are awesome, and health benefits are good.  But all those shiny things are starting to become very dull.","Love the open office concept but it doesnt help with collaboration at all. As each month passes I think our group gets more and more silo-ed. When going through the hiring process they try to lure you in with all the *perks* instead of giving you the salary you deserve, and these things aren't worth making less money. Especially since the raises they give are absolutely PATHETIC. It is almost a slap in the face. And don't even think about getting promoted. 

Long story short, LPL has the potential to be great. They strive to be an employer of choice, but the only choice they are helping me make is the choice I recently made to start looking for a new job - its the only way I will continue to further my career and make more money."

850,,Steping stone,2015-08-06,2.0,Operations Analyst,"-""New"" Building: the building and work environment is great. The building is new and has all the amenities you need. It's like a work campus. Cafeteria, gym, nurse's office, arcade room, lounge, basketball, outdoor games, etc. Cafeteria is overpriced for bad food though.
-Benefits: GREAT benefits, very competitive. Lots of vacation hours, after 3 years you get like 21/23 days of vacation, health plans are great low priced, matching is awesome-good 401k, VTO, birthday day off. Benefits are far better than any other financial company in SD. Stock options, stock options rewards to employees (most employees that get it are lifers (8+yrs) 
-Few good people: I had the luck of working for a really good manager. She helped me achieve my goals and motivated me and took me to the next level. She was a rare case. But her manager wasn‚Äôt that great or other managers in different departments. The newer faces are a breath of fresh air. I made some really good friends here. 
-Events: they have cool events such as health fair, Halloween celebration, and departmental events such as Holiday Party. 
-Bonuses: Everybody gets a bonus no matter what position you‚Äôre at and it starts at 5.5%. If you are a good hardworking employee and your manager likes you, you can potentially receive a good bonus! They also have yearly inflation raises. Even with this the pay is still low compared to industry standards. But if you are in management level, your paycheck is fat and your bonus is starts at 9%. 
-Good stepping stone. If you have no experience in the financial industry LPL will be a good stepping stone. Use it and leave it. Once you get your experience it‚Äôs not worth it to stay there.","-Management: Management are arrogant and a big joke and think they rule the world and think they are so important that they do not talk to their ""lower staff"" but really they do not know how to manage their employees. They are horrible managers; many are inexperience and only got to where they are because they know someone. Not the brightest batch. Many are hired with NO experience, it's ALL politics. They do not know how to value their most hardworking and brightest employees. The brightest and best leaves to other companies bc LPL management doesn't know employee retention. Promotions are given to people who don't deserve it (like I said, it's all politics and you have to know somebody). 
-Advancement: It's extremely hard to move into management roles (unless you know somebody) No matter how much knowledge, hardworking, work ethics, licenses you have it's all about kissing up. You do that well you'll do well here. Also the compliance/GRC group is a big joke. They do not supervise or properly
-Employees: you have the lifers who think they are entitled to everything. They've been working here for ""10 + years"" and ""did their time"" so they think you should respect them and/or they don't respect you, especially new younger Millennials generation. It's a changing industry get your head out of your behind and get with the times! Things are changing for the good and deal with the innovation and new thinking. Also you have SOOO many lifers that are lazy and they've been doing the same thing for the last 10 years. No motivation, 9-5 job, only there to get a paycheck. No dreams, no motivation, no goals, you come here to die if you stay that long. Your life is drained out of you like those people. Also intercommunication- no other departments like taking the accountability of anything. They never respond or follow up. Always a roadblock in communication. 
-Pay: If you started as a temp and made your way to permanent you will get pay lower than industry average. They take advantage of you that way saying that because they bought out your temp contract they'll pay you $2-4 dollars per hour LESS. Pay is ONLY good if you are in management level AND/OR you leave the company then come back. Other than that I left LPL and got paid more than the same position there. They reward the higher ups and give financial advisors lavish vacations or what they call ‚Äúconference‚Äù with masters and summit and gifts and everything and take no investment in their employees. They also pay a lot of fees to FINRA due to their lack of compliance/supervision. That money can help increase pay for employees since they really under pay you here. 
-Licenses: they do not sponsor you nor/or let you sign a promissory note for repayment if you fail or leave once you pass. They do not encourage employees to seek knowledge. They stop you at your licenses. They have a program that allows 30-40 people from the whole firm to opportunity to take your licenses but it's not for everyone and HARD to get in. 
-Environment: LPL is basically ""LPLMATCH.COM"" everyone sleeps with each other here. It's like a big pool of polygamous dating. Everyone dates each other, all the males and females are on the lookout for a mate. I get it, it's work and you spend most of your days here, but the guys can be dogs. You hear about that one guy that got around or that girl that got around. 
-Professionalism: LPL is very unprofessional. The dress code is casual (which is good) but some people take advantage of it and dress like frat bros or street walkers with 5 inch heels. Image of the people in operations are horrible. They are the worst offenders of the dress codes. I've seen PJ pants, yoga pants, crocs, slippers, double collar shirts, low cut shirts to fully expose breast, miniskirts, see-through shirts, etc. Very unprofessional work environment.
-Ever since they went public, they've been going down hill
-Offshoring: they are horrible. Tons of mistakes, ended up creating a dept to QC their work. They do not understand the industry and they do it for pay. They don't care and don't understand the process. Advisors blame you for their mistakes, management blames you. There's no way around bad work that they provide."

868,,Stock Brokers Should Avoid ~ Chaos in Compliance and Executive Management Is a Joke,2015-07-01,1.0,Series 24/Series 7 Stock Broker,The CEO has not gone to jail for misleading customers ~ yet.,"1.   Outdated computer systems and they cannot calculate accurate cost basis on portfolio reports so they have removed that and have no plans for several years to include it again.  You read that right, brokers are supposed to trade and sell to customers using reports with no cost basis on them.  And we pay extra for these reports.
2.  Compliance lies, they tell you that you can have a certain office and do things and then a month later you cannot.  Even having Compliance directors on a call to sort out a solution does not mean they will honor that solution six months later.  Compllance also requires many forms and procedures where there are no regulations requiring them and there's zero legal liability value to having them as well.  Compliance has also given me grossly inaccurate advice ~ ""Of course a 529 Account is a college account, it has an IRS code number on it.""  Really you can't make that up.  
3.  Their portfolio reports make up return numbers and give bad data because they've outsourced their IT to 1099s in India.  I find major illegal errors at least 3X per year in their overall calculation matrices ~ not on just one report, where their IT department has coded calculations incorrectly and even giving illegal data on reports ~ because no one in Compliance is overseeing what goes on client-releasable portfolio reports.  This is true for more than 10 years now.
4.  They forgot to pay their entire sales force in January 2015, paychecks went out late.
5.  The internal computer systems are so badly designed you cannot find anything, not even basic forms to do business.  
6.  There's no accountability in back office operations and people there are so poorly paid, with such high turnover, that no one cares about the clients.  Customers leave out of frustration with the back office not with the broker."

But with good things come sacrifices.  Management as well as a lot of the Internal Audit staff are ex-Big 4.  Even though most of us left to get a work/life balance, to get more exposure to different business areas, less happy hours, it seems thats where management wants to take this department.  

Work/life seems to be a joke.  If you're not working 45+ hours, you're not working.  Working remotely has become next to impossible b/c of how management ""perceives"" working from home.  

Most of the department are single late 20's, early 30's who want to work 50+ hour weeks.  If you have a family and value a work/life balance, you have two options: 1.) don't work in Internal Audit or 2.) understand that when you leave at 4-5pm,  it'll be either frowned upon or conversations will happen behind your back.  

Due to cost savings, a ton of LPLs IT department has been transitioned off-shore and most positions are being recruited for in Charlotte, NC (where the wages and cost of living is a lot lower than San Diego).  

There is constant turnover of staff, not only in Internal Audit, but also throughout the organization.  Many times upper management leaves without even providing two-week notice (e.g., ex president of LPL)."

I have been in the Service Center for over 9 years and the new hires make nearly as much as I do under the new, improved compensation guidelines...LPL will not adjust the salaries of the long-term, loyal employee.

""Bottom-line"" mentality also manifests in rampant outsourcing which creates endless operational errors.  Hugely inefficient processes.

889,,HELLPL,2015-05-05,1.0,Client Service Associate,"Is it better to be unemployed or to have a job that makes you want to hang yourself? You‚Äôll be asking that question every day.
Do not take a job with a financial advisor affiliated with this broker/dealer under any circumstances. There‚Äôs no consistent culture outside the corporate offices, so your experience will vary wildly. I‚Äôd LPL give zero stars if that were possible.","I worked with an independent financial advisor rather than LPL directly, so I‚Äôll try to confine my comments to working with the LPL back office, however I should mention that 90% of advisors/brokers have zero administrative or people management skills, and if you get stuck with one that is totally chaotic and disorganized, then they‚Äôll ruin your personal life as well as your career. I couldn‚Äôt even enjoy my weekends as I was so sick with anxiety and dread due to thinking about what landmine I was doomed to step on when I returned to the office.
As for LPL, they treat their brokers and clients like total criminals, which tells you everything that you need to know about working there. The level of security protocols that are in place‚Äîespecially around money movement‚Äîhave become so extreme that day-to-day business is almost unworkable. A spouse can‚Äôt make a contribution from their joint account to an IRA without written authorization from the other spouse, for example. Regarding business processing, there are dozens of forms just to move money, and each one has a built-in gotcha in order to ensure that it‚Äôs gonna get bounced NIGO. There is little formal training, so you‚Äôre basically condemned to learning their counter-intuitive processes through trial and error. There is some training online, but it‚Äôs very basic and not especially helpful.
The technology, BranchNet, is appallingly outdated, as most other reviewers have noted. They‚Äôre about 7 to 10 years behind competitors. Forms and processes change frequently and without announcement, thus guaranteeing that you‚Äôre set up for failure. There‚Äôs not one combined screen to view all the clients arrangements/systematic money movements, so you‚Äôre forced to scroll through each account in order to figure out where money is coming in and/or going out. You can‚Äôt even access the combined statement that the client receives. BranchNet‚Äôs greatest weakness is that it‚Äôs terrible with householding and storing client account data, which is incredible since that‚Äôs its primary function. Functions which should be automated, such as householding client accounts, adding them to a combined statement and the client-facing website, or reimbursing fees, all have to be done manually, which are frustrating wastes of time. I don‚Äôt know where LPL spends all of its money, but it sure isn‚Äôt on technology or internal resources. If you‚Äôre coming here from another broker/dealer (first of all: DON‚ÄôT), you‚Äôre in for a huge shock.
Calls to internal service partners frequently yield incomplete or inaccurate information, likely because they seem to have very high turnover as noted in other reviews. I can‚Äôt believe that I lasted as long as I have in this position. Oh, and there‚Äôs zero opportunity for career growth, along with the most insane micro-management that I‚Äôve ever encountered, so there‚Äôs that to look forward to. Traumatic, no-win nightmare overall. Reading the positive company reviews makes me question reality. I‚Äôve never been more relieved to quit a job."

Work life balance is very manageable.  Yes there are bad days where you need to put in 10+ hours but there are also the days where you leave early because it is slow.  Moving up isn't that hard if you are smart and work hard.

Some areas are loaded with AVPs and VPs who all get 100K plus for doing nothing while there are others who are actually running the ship get peanuts.

Pay was pretty competitive for my position, and the bonus structure was 'fair'.  Benefits are AWESOME.  I hated leaving the COMPANY - seemed they really cared about taking care of their employees and making them happy.","Where do i start?  My department was reorganized 3 times while I was there (a little over 3 years) with 3 different top managers.  Sooooo many AVPs - and what, exactly is their purpose??  Some of the managers were quite vindictive too and would throw you under the bus in a heartbeat to save their own neck.  Or, they would take credit for something you did.  When we were shorthanded I would often pull 12 hour shifts even though I wasn't asked.  I was salaried so OT didn't matter.  I never even got a Thank You or offered help.  I was frequently called a liar (not in so many words though) and made to feel about 3 inches tall.  The politics are so freaking bad and you can't trust anyone.  They talk about getting rid of the silos, but nothing gets done about it.  At one point I was in 6 hours of meetings a day, 1 hour for lunch, and that left 1 hour to get 8 hours of work done.

Decent technology, getting better. 25 cent sodas, good location.","Very political and cut-throat, the textbook definition of a good ol' boys club. Rampant outsourcing throughout the company to increase the bottom line, beholden to their shareholders and not the employees. Very poor communication throughout the company (lots of silos). The company is very reactionary, and seems to always be in fire-fighting mode. Pay was good at first, but meager merit increases (usually .40 to .60 per year), meant you fell behind market-rate relatively quickly. The company is insanely top-heavy; there are tons of AVPs and VPs doing the job of a manager or a business analyst, and yet are not managing people (nor do they have management skills.) People are considered expendable; half of the software engineers and PMs were contractors that were kept for a year or longer, then suddenly let go at a moments notice when management decided they weren't needed anymore (lots of churn and burn.)

They generally have no vision that a bear market is even possible.

I will say that every year a great attempt is made to really understand the employee and to create a better environment, but it never seems organic and employees have a hard time buying into it.  

Feedback can be very one directional here.  In past years on my team the leadership team is responsible for providing feedback about my work and how I've partnered with them, but I've never been asked the same... even though I've brought this up multiple times.

One glaring fact is that no employee is allowed to mention the word ‚ÄòIndia‚Äô in any type of communication with LPL‚Äôs 13,000 independent advisors as if the company is either ashamed or is trying to keep tabs on the fact that many American-based jobs at LPL‚Äôs three main locations in Boston, Charlotte and San Diego have already been eliminated by LPL‚Äôs management and replaced by much cheaper and much lower caliber non-American staff in Bangalore, India. The trend of eliminating American-based jobs will continue at LPL throughout 2014 and beyond. LPL officially refers to that as ‚Äòoffshoring‚Äô with absolutely no mention of any third world country. Mentioning the word ‚ÄòIndia‚Äô is a big no-no throughout the company! How silly and childish!

How patriotic of LPL! Shame on LPL‚Äôs board of director and senior management for being so shortsighted, greedy and callus. At a time where many American companies realized their long-term losses for shipping so many jobs to China, India and the Philippines over the last 10-plus years and have been reversing the trend by hiring again in America, LPL Financial seems to be so behind on this failed trend and insists on creating chaos and ill will and taking very high risks in identity and data theft of hundreds of thousands of US-based financial accounts for mom-and-pop investors of Main Street small towns America and practically handing that over to Bangalore, India.

1025,,Not Happy,2013-06-13,1.0,Financial Advisor,LPL is a broker/dealer and therefore clears its own trades and can hold securities in street name.,"I came from another brokerage firm and the difference couldn't be more dramatic. The call center is poorly trained and unresponsive. At times, I am told to ""Google the answer"", ""read the compliance manual"" or get passed onto another department. When I want professional, responsive service (and the correct answer), I will call my old brokerage firm, which treats me with more respect and kindness than LPL.

The technology is terrible. There are so many flaws and nuances to the software that it makes it nearly impossible to train my assistant. Glitches and errors, which seem to be easy to fix, go un-addressed. Navigation through Branchnet (brokerage computer interface) is terrible. For example, I have been at LPL for years and still don't know how to look up trading activity. Here is a suggestion, all functions related to trading should be...uh...under trading, maybe? In opening account, it would be nice if all the dropdown boxes worked, the nomenclature was consistent, the background for required fields was the same, and when you saved the info, it would actually be saved.

Forms. There are 1200 different forms at LPL. At my last broker/dealer, I saw maybe 8 or 9 but am guessing they had as many as 50 or 60. There are 18 forms for distributing or contributing money to an account. How about combining them into one? Another example, FINRA does not require a client to sign an application. So why do we have applications that get longer every year. A 7-page application. Really?

I had one client that called the Home Office with a simple request and was told if he didn't like the way things were done at LPL, he could take his investments elsewhere. Clients have also complained about the statements and access to their accounts online. 

When I have made calls to tech support, compliance marketing, and compliance, a recording indicated my call would be returned in 24 hours and prompted me to leave a message. After 24 hours and no callback, I called again, only to receive the same message. This can go on for days.

The compensation is not good. There are so many fees and charges the real payout is not good. The most meaningless report I get each month is the payout rate, which says 90%. You might as well tell me that I made $2million last year and forget to mention you took out $1,990,000 in fees.

Lastly, the OSJ system is a joke and a racket. Coming from a firm where we took pride in helping others succeed, LPL has a culture of stick-it-to and profit off of the hard work of others. I have met more OSJs than I can count who make it a business to profit off of others and don't offer anything substantive in return. I would much rather pay the Home Office 10% than have to pay some local lazy guy who wants me to push junk investments to increase profits for him.

At the heart of it all, I have left dozens of suggestions on little things that could make a big difference but they go un-addressed. Like the other postings, decisions are made my a management that is out of touch with what is important. The primary customer for LPL executives is not the employees or the advisors, it is the shareholders."

This is not done through innovation or technology advantages, it's done through cutting regulatory corners, outsourcing critical business functions and paying low wages to everyone from executives to front line staff.

Although they may have the technical knowledge, too many have almost no understanding of what it takes to be a great manager of people. At the same time, this may be because being a manager of people is an acquired skill, which takes not only time, but a desire to learn. And if there is no incentive to try to get the best out of your employees, eventually they become disengaged. Also, almost everyone seems to be paid below average for the industry, and raises for the majority are 2% per year. It takes an act of God to get more than this.

The tactical asset allocation CMT they have on staff in Boston is decent, I like his work for the most part.  The fundamental research group produces a lot of material to use in marketing and client retention.  But their asset allocation model performance UNDER-PERFORMS consistently.  SO like most bd's they produce nice pretty presentations that look good but end up hurting their clients with under-performance.","Nearly Everything is Pathetic at LPL

After 10 years of personal experience,my humble opinion is...The nations #1 independent broker deal is a joke

 1. technology A. Trading Platform is a joke, was outdated 10 years ago, now its maddening  B. Branchnet - their intranet is a frail platform run ONLY on windows internet explorer.  It crashes frequently and after 10 years of working with it, it is still difficult to navigate and operate in an efficient manner, its coded so poorly that it makes working on it as the sole back office platform extremely frustrating and time consuming.   2. Service/Support  they consistently loose client docs, they change forms so often you very rarely send in the ""correct revised"" version of the form, which worked last month but won't work this month.  And when you actually use the correct form, they consistently fail to receive and image it, so you repeat operations over and over.  
The newer Charlotte office is incompetent for the most part, I end up hanging up and calling back, after waiting on hold for 10 min each time, as a way to eventually, randomly, be dealt with by someone who knows what they are doing.  

LPL was excellent in 2002-2003 when I joined, but going public has destroyed this company's culture, driven out nearly all of the quality staff, and is now just another pathetic excuse for an investment broker dealer.

Employees studied for over 2 months and when it came time to sign up for the test management pulled the program and said there was no money but maybe next year.  

Promotions are based on how long you have been at the company, not skill or experience.  Intellegence is not valued.  This has lead to some very bad management (not all management but a large portion).  

The overall mentality in the service center is like high school.  There is little professionalism even among amangement.  

LPL will suck the life out of you.  It is a blackhole that is hard to get out of in this economy.  Everyone in my department is trying desparetly to get out.  

I would never reccomend working here."
1046,,Turnover high... Moral low,2012-09-22,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"Free food (fruit, cereal, peanut butter, jelly). New offices and young group.","Too many bosses, structure is confusing in company. Moved to a new floor to become ""one company"" only to be separation between operations/tech/executives. Pay for parking (company is too cheap to pay the $30 per month/per employee and only $30 commuting benefits when metro costs $2.85 each way during rush hour. Autonomy since company purchase is low (Fortigent to now LPL Financial), feels like LPL is Big Brother. Reviews are a joke, perception is everything and actual work is nothing. Flexibility is gone, punch in/punch out is like being in 5th grade, no upward mobility, do the same thing year after year with little changes."
1047,,Get what you want up front,2012-09-14,2.0,Software Engineer,Good technical personnel. There are a few very good managers. Some culture problems are getting addressed.,"Bad morale, dysfunctional software engineering processes, high turnover, weak management overall; especially senior executives."
1048,,Stretched Thin,2012-09-14,2.0,,Number one independent broker dealer. Decent benefits,"Staffing levels inadequate to handle onslaught of new advisors. LPL upper management unwilling to hire needed bodies to compensate for this and are taxing current resources to the point of forced/volunteered exodus. Service Center new hire training reduced to bring new hires online sooner, thus creating a crop of uninformed, useless personel. Middle , management more concerned with calls answered in a timely manner than quality.  LPL recruiters consistently oversell the product (LPL). Advisors come onboard with misguided expectations, requesting Service perform research they are other wise expected to perform and various other tasks suited for an assistant. The founding principals of this company are to provide advisors with the bare minimum as to comply with regulatory requirements and in return for basic services, the advisors are expected to perform the remaining duties themselves for greater commission retention. This being said, many advisors are sold on the idea that their Service Center representative will provide service above and beyond what they're paying for.  The fault lies with recruiting, a corporate culture that undervalues their employees, and advisors willing to abuse the system without repercussion."
1049,,Supervisor,2012-09-02,2.0,Anonymous Employee,"Convenient location,  good medical benefits, and had the privilage of working with an exceptional group of people that brouugh positive energy","Too many know nothing managers better suited for retail than a brokerage firm.  Promotional opportunities are far and few between; awarded to the best connected rather than the most competent. Compensation is for the most part based on seniority and not ability. Someone  having spent a decade in the same job, performing the same menial tasks will make more than an individual performing the duties of two people and engaging in more challenging activities because they're one of the few people competent enough to do it. Staffing levels are slim resulting in overworked, stressed, and employees eager to leave the company should the opportunity arise.  Outsourcing to india compounded many of these issues. Upper management badly miscalculated what they were capable of and the advisors are paying for it with delays, reduced quality, and irritated clients.The indian partners dropped the ball right out of the starting gate and cant seem to hold on to it long enough to justify their role outside of the gains being made in reduced payroll costs which have been cancelled out by liabilities/losses incurred by them. The qualititve costs are far worse"
1050,,A good experience if you want to work for a broker/dealer,2012-09-01,3.0,Financial Advisor,LPL's Branchnet is an excellent platform to manage the operational aspects of your practice.  The customer service by the broker/dealer for reps. is excellent.

Tons of online training materials to learn about other departments in the firm.  Growth potential if you have what it takes and are able to meet people outside of your unit bubble.  Advancement opportunities given to employees that were impacted by offshoring initiative (versus being kicked to the curb).","Idle employee moral crushed once offshoring was announced, even in departments that were not impacted.  Oversaturated management structure.  Cancel the meetings and put them to work.  While they do appear to be ""trying"", employee engagement is lacking.  You're encouraged to attend offsite events but then pressured to attend when it's clear nobody has an interest in going.  Advisors fairly abusive toward employees due to their own mistakes and lack of attention to detail.  Although unspoken, the ""you wouldn't have a paycheck if we didn't have advisors"" is not a mantra that should not be preached."

They're making incredible strides at building beautiful new facilities employees can feel proud of and enjoy working in. Coworkers are largely very competent and accountable ‚Äì LPL hires strong talent. Compensation and benefits are fair to good.","Because of the break-neck speed and crushing workload, this is not the place to be if you're a salaried employee and are looking for work/life balance. You won't find that at LPL.
 
The culture isn't fully formed yet (though they're working on it) and feels different depending on your department and area's leadership. In my area, it's both stiff and stifling. They try to make us into Stepford Wife copies of themselves rather than allow people to be individuals.
 
This is possibly the hardest, most demanding, most perfection-seeking place you'll ever work."
1055,,Benefits,2012-07-15,2.0,Compliance Analyst,Some of best health and dental benefits out there with a low cost.,Salary is lower than comparable companies.

Advisors are pawns to be tossed aside and taken advantage of. Employees don't care about anything except not being held responsible. The mission statement  at LPL seems to be ""Pass the Buck."""

1059,,Unlimited Possibility,2012-06-12,4.0,,"I've been in high tech for a couple decades and I've worked for and with many of the most well known tech companies in the USA. LPL has the most mature technology process I have experienced and, while this could be a bad thing if it is ponderous the LPL implementation is well balanced between value vs effort. 

And the very best thing is that the company is expanding at such a pace that growth opportunities are endless. It is my observation that applying yourself at LPL will lead to a lucrative and interesting career.",While not exclusive to LPL rapid growth comes with growing pains. These manifest in political rivalries and long hours and I see that at the VP+ level at LPL. I have seen the same thing at other fast growing companies.

Management have no clue of what you are doing. Don't ask, don't tell policy. Meetings are useless.  Raises are ridiculous.

Some of the leaders (AVP+) are worthless and everyone knows it.  Working or projects is a giant cluster f**k.

They pay a little better than the market- Great place for PM's with upto 3-5 yrs experience. Sr PM's or PgM's -strictly avoid!!,"From a PM perspective:
1. Lot of churn in the middle management roles.They rotate or Fire PM's like changing shirts.
2. Higher management sucks-- too many cooks and lots of chaos and confusion filters to the next level.
3. No clear vision or strategy from higher management on projects- they start projects , then realize it doesnt make sense and put them on hold leading to churn in the projects.
4.Frankly speaking, its a back office shop for advisors- so not much new advancement in technology
5. Their IT budget is comparitvely small compared to other competitors
6. PM role is more of a glorified co-ordinator- PM's dont have much authority nor do they get to handle project budgets.
7.Lots of favoritism given to ass-lickers and work efforts  frankly doesnt matter but i guess that must be there in other companies too
8. No Growth Potential !! You ll be stuck in the same position for years but if you like that then certainly a good place.
9. Worst place for Contractors- they are treated far worse than other companies in my experience."

They could not last a week doing the work of whom they manage.  It is upsetting to see them chat in circles while our phones and incidents are increasing.  There is no sense of humor or relief to be found.  Expect heart burn and high blood pressure as a result of being a LPL employee."
