* year-end review poorly handled and no reward for hard-work - just telling you what you did wrong (which is usually a one-off and not critical but perception)
* Current area has no strategy - random, fire-fighting mode that will continue to exist which is difficult to get things done because of the one-off haphazard approach in the current environment
* Extreme micro-management
* Constantly providing  management with details so they can sound ""knowledgeable"" when meeting with senior level colleagues in the industry
* Opinion doesn't matter
* hours are extremely long and consistently so - expected (and told this) that at our level we are required to work weekends and late into the evening.

Management has a serious issue. They do not know what they are doing at all, I was surprised  that those people can become managers. So irresponsible, if they have some issues/ projects, they ask us to work on it suddenly with very small amount of information about it, then blame us if we make a mistake. How the work is done here at this bank is incredibly inefficient and not smart at all. Customers will never get what they want at one call, it will take at least 1-2 weeks to receive response and 50% of the answers are to re-send documents because something ridiculous is missing that can be verified over the phone or via email. 

Moreover, it depends on the department, but in my department, management wants to know every single details about what you do / how much time were spent (in minutes) when you work on something not using a computer. This was the MOST STRESSFUL thing i've ever experienced at this bank, and the individual efficiency record will affect my bonus in the end of the year! Management think you worked hard ONLY when you processed lots of cases fast. They don't care what kind of cases you worked on or the difficulty of them.

It’s unfortunate that the recruitment team is unable to find the best suited candidate and the HR management team is unable to retain the talent.  The HR management team is ineffective, particularly the management in Employee Relations.  Although situated in the HR department and leading the Employee Relations  team there is a significant skill gap to be working with “humans”.

-Easy to commute by subway or GO.","I was with B2B Bank for almost 4 years. When I started the journey at B2B Bank, I truly believed that I will be part of the management team at B2B Bank. I am a hard worker, 3 out of the 4 years, I was given superior performance rating. I believed that going beyond what is required will lead me to personal career growth and development. My goal was to start my journey with the Banking and Deposits and eventually move to Finance team. I have been to several interviews with the same managers for multiple different roles. I strongly believed that I did well in the interviews. Also, I have the education background in Accounting and was pursuing my Accounting designation. Unfortunately I wasn’t given the opportunity to join the Finance team. I waited patiently and was hopeful that one day I will get that opportunity. Each year went by my hope to join the Finance team faded away. That’s when I started to look for opportunity for personal growth and development outside of B2B Bank. This has lead me to leave B2B Bank.
 
 
Currently I have successfully completed all my examination for my Chartered Accountant designation. As I leave B2B Bank, I am starting my journey to obtain my full Chartered Accountant designation. As my career develops and progress, I will always pause and consider the opportunity that I wasn’t given to join the B2B Bank Finance team. Every step that I will move up, I will prove to the Finance team managers at B2B Bank that they made a mistake of not giving me an opportunity. I am very determined to succeed in my career goals.
 
 
I really hope that when an individual is trying to move to a different department, hiring managers will take into consideration of the individual’s performance rating in the previous department. Hiring managers should take into consideration of the performance rating, contact the previous manager’s for reference and education background before making the final decision for candidates. Decision should not be made based on the hiring manager’s preference for candidates. I really hope that talented individuals will stay with the B2B Bank and given the opportunities to grow, prevent individuals from leaving to the competitors."

However, in my 10+ years career, I’ve never witnessed or experienced workplace bullying like I see here. Those who deign to challenge the status quo are whipped into line quickly and if they resist they are swiftly shown the door. The prevailing attitude of the senior leadership team is if you don’t like it then leave. And many have.

I have had the “pleasure” of going in front of the executive team MANY times and walking into that room I could see the division in the group, so it’s no wonder they take their frustrations, with their peers, out on the employees below them. 

The middle managers -  a talented group of people, actually get the job done, but are constantly held down by self-serving AVPs and VPs above them. 

No matter where you go in the organization, there are lots of whispered conversations from groups of people who are so unhappy that are plotting their escape routes. Whether Client Service, Operations, Underwriting, Compliance, Sales, Marketing and HR. Everyone wants to get out and it’s no wonder when bullying, micromanagement and public humiliation are dealt in spades, with faint praise given to a select few. 

If B2B Bank calls, no matter how desperate don’t take this job. The grass is not greener over here and there are many snakes in the grass."

301,Laurentian Bank,STAY AWAY!!!!,2016-05-25,1.0,,The location is centrally located in the financial district core.,"Too many to list!

1)  Very poor senior management.  Favourism is extremely heavy.  They pick and choose who they promote based on who they like, management filters and senior management has no clue what is going on even if a specific individual is not good at the job.  They promote people not because of their skills, but because of politics.

2)  Low pay.  The pay at B2B is on the lower end compared to a lot of similar size companies.  I know many companies who offer over $50K higher for the same position.  The base salary sucks, the bonus is minimal, there is no incentive to go the extra mile when you know others are making more than you.   The pay for lower level employees are higher than higher levels, the work load taken on does not equivalent to the pay you get. Many employees have left due to incompetitive pay structure.

3)  Horrible work life balance.  There IS no work life balance.  Many companies now a days offer work-from-home options, or flex hours (ie coming in 1 hr earlier and leaving 1 hr earlier).  Unfortunately this company does not have any of these options.  So if your schedule is 8:30am-5:00pm, you cannot leave even 10 minutes earlier - even if you came in 30 minutes earlier and worked through your lunch.  They do not value the effort and the time employees put in, but if they see you leave even just 5-10 minutes earlier, they want you to make up for it.  Other companies in the industry offer work from home to allow flexibility, not saying everyday, but at least 1 day a week, nope, no option.

4)  No career growth.  Employees in the company usually end up leaving the company because they have no where to grow within.  The managers basically want you to stay at your position because you can do it, they do not want you to grow because their mentality is if you can do it, stay there.  For example, in customer service, many CSRs stay there for over 5 years because there is no where to grow within the company.  A lot of companies I know promote within and help people move up the ladder.  This company would love you to stay where you are - forever.

5)  Poor HR hiring practise and poor employee ethics.  Most employees in this company do not care about customer service.  As a lot of back end administrative tasks effect the end customer, every single employee should be customer service oriented.  Unfortunately, because this company hires a lot of contract workers who have no experience, or just came from another country, and then give them insufficient training (ie. 1-2 days in class training, then job shadowing and expect you to do the job yourself), there is clearly a knowledge gap.  They then promote the wrong people - again not for their capability but for favourism.  These people do not care about the impact to end clients.  Their performance is not measured based on being customer service oriented or helpful either.  Performance is simply based on statistics which do not reflect the truth. And, most people who have been here a long time, are just here just because they are comfortable, not because anything is good about this company.  I talked to many people who have been here for a long time, everyone is bitter."

There are some good employees but I'm sure they are looking to jump this sinking ship as well.","I wish I knew about this site Otherwise I would not have started.

Managers are too distracted with proving their job has value than focusing on improving company overall. They would easily throw their staff under a bus to save their own behind. There is a lot of tension between departments heads - to the point where managers are gossiping about other managers with their staff.  It's pretty much like high school.

It's the corporate culture - It says a lot when the former President (Francois) starts telling people a corporate dinner that he has made a list of  everyone who has ""wronged him"" in the past and when he takes over Laurentian Bank,  he will fire them.

They have hired new people for a fresh start  but there are still some from the old regime.  Like it said in another review, Any suggestion that may hurt the Francois' ego is immediately shut down. Everyone has to suck up to him, otherwise they are fired.

The company is poorly run and has very outdated policies and practices (i.e., no flexibility to work flex hours, absolutely no work from home, many manual processes, etc).  Not very many happy employees there.  Culture of mistrust toward employees and a manage-by-fear mentality instilled in all managers.  Even in a professional level role you will be treated as if a student in highschool (not allowed to have brief personal conversations in the workplace, i.e., will be asked to ""get back to work"", regardless of whether there is any valid concern regarding your time management).  

The HR department is the most troubled I have seen in my career- is hell bent on practicing out dated people management practices with little understanding towards employees' circumstances and absolutely zero flexibility.  Even when there is no business reason, rules that don't make sense in 2015 are applied for ""consistency"".  The entire company is ruled by a punch-clock mentality (if you have to miss any company time for personal reasons, i.e., to pick up a sick child from daycare, you will be asked to make up the time).  However, they do not pay their employees for overtime worked and when employees claim overtime they will deny to pay saying that the overtime was not approved in advance).  Most good people there are looking for their way out.  Running joke among staff is that B2B is like working in a salt mine.  Next to no career development, you will be lucky if you get objectives from your manager.  B2B needs to make a lot of changes in order to improve as an employer.

325,Laurentian Bank,Toxic Environment,2015-10-07,1.0,Sales Manager,There are no Pros associated with this company,"Where can I start? Everything is micro managed. The company tells you that the work hours are 8:30 am-5:00 pm. However, if you actually leave at 5:00 pm, upper management uses this against you. The management committee will send people around as snoops each day to see who is leaving at 5 and who is still there after 5. Then when it comes time to meet and decide on budgetary cuts, they will use this as an excuse to bad mouth other departments because their staff actually leaves on time.   The company uses bullying tactics in forcing people to do overtime and forces all the managers to rate a few people as ""Needs Improvement"" even if they are good workers who are meeting job requirements just so they could force staff to leave the company and avoid paying out a bonus. 

Management does not care if staff are not happy, in their minds, if you are not happy, get out and we can always find someone else.  The  Dinosaurs who head up management do not believe that anyone should be able to have a life outside of work nor should they be permitted to have a family.  People stay late not because they are really that busy,  it is done purely for show.    On top of that, they charge clients excessive fees to transfer out their accounts and charge them annual management fees regardless of how much money they may have with the company. 

When there is a potential big snowstorm or transit strike, HR sends out an e-mail telling staff that they must make every effort to get to the office no matter how bad the situation is. This does not make staff feel like they are important.  That's why in the last 20 months there has been a mass exodus in the HR department, with the amount of people who have left the HR department these last 20 months, you could field an entire football team!! 

However, they don't care how staff is treated. These individuals who do not permit a work life balance are probably not very successful when it comes to relationships in real life, so they feel the need to punish others. Many investment dealers are also upset with all the fees and all mistakes being made with regards to service delays, mistakes made with customer mortgages, investment loans. I would not be surprised if more and more dealers move their business to another service provider. Managers of various departments will stoop to childish levels to complain that someone from another team has was hanging around in the halls or leaving on time and use that as justification for another department to cut staff instead of his/her own department."

The problem with this place unequivocally is senior management, the antiquated policies they mandate, and the culture of fear that they instil down to their teams. They micro manage absolutely everything because they don't trust that anyone below them can do the job right. Their philosophy is, take a simple task and over complicate it. Make a decision about something, and then change it at the last minute. Waste effort and then don't communicate reasons why. You wonder why motivation and engagement is low? This is why people. Partly. The other reason is because the company's policies are brutal. Your kid is sick? Take a vacation day. Have a doctor's appointment? Take a vacation day. Blizzard outside? Make sure you get to work on time (safely, of course). Family Day off? Even though ""we"" don't HAVE to give it, we guess you can have it off. Leave early on Christmas Eve? How about 4:00?

Your opinion not only does not matter but could get you included in the next round. Keep your head down, bite your lip and know your role. However, this is no guarantee of safety as good people are let go all the time.

Executive decisions never address real problems and instead tend to create new ones, which forces staff into the most uncomfortable of positions apologizing for their mistakes and/or inaction, or staff working beyond measure trying to play catch-up within a flawed system that is filled with so many redundancies that makes doing so almost impossible. 

Do not expect a promotion from within. You will be a lifer in the position you get hired into. This organization prefers external candidates rather than dipping into their own. If you are on contract, begin looking for work about a month before it expires. 

In terms of upper management, do not not expect change or empathy for an acid environment. Throw others under the bus and you will be fine.

373,Laurentian Bank,"Poor leadership, schoolyard bullying and intimidation and arbitrary decision making.",2014-01-27,1.0,Administration,Close to TTC. Some great people work here (non managers),"The president tells his management team how to think and what to say. They in turn regurgitate this message to their staff. The managers are all the same, you can tell they have been brainwashed. You are bullied into doing overtime and going for these company meetings where all the president does is boast about how great his bank is (yes, its HIS bank and he makes sure you remember that). You dont get paid to go for these meetings btw. A lot of decisions are made without seeking consensus - and then when mistakes are made people are fired. I hate going into work - having to watch what I do and say as it seems your every move is being watched."
374,Laurentian Bank,not the best but not the worst,2013-12-02,2.0,Financial Administration Officer,good people to work with. good parties. good benefits. good location.,"very, very poor management. short sighted policies. poor hiring practices. extremely low morale. bullying and intimidating practices. totally untransparent. unrealistic work expectations. average salaries for most of the bank. extremely high salaries for undeserving managers. divide and rule mentality- setting up one employee against another- managers are very good at this. overloaded top management. gotten rid of some of the best managers from the original b2b trust cadre (people who actually helped shape and build b2b trust) and replaced them with a lot of ninnies."
375,Laurentian Bank,In the dark ages...,2013-10-01,1.0,Manager,"the people I work with and department manager are fabulous, committed and conscientious individuals.","No work from home policy, STRICTLY enforced. Micro-managed by the President (it's called ""Frank's Bank"" internally), middle and senior management have to be yes men in order to keep their jobs. There's no acknowledgement or trust in an individual's expertise. Management doesn't communicate its strategy and what we're working towards, we're supposed to read the President's mind."
376,Laurentian Bank,Overall it is a great company,2013-05-29,4.0,Client Services Representative,"The company size is just right - not too big, not too small, but is a growing company (we have acquired 2 companies within 2 years).  Location is great, you can walk to work from Union Station within 5-10 minutes (we are located at York/Adelaide, but are moving to Commerce Court West at Bay/King next year).  Culture is great too - multicultural, casual environment.","Because the company is going through changes now, there are a lot of contract workers (their contract gets extended every 2 months, with low wages).  There is a lot of laying off.  But I'm sure this will improve after all the conversion settles down with AGF."
377,Laurentian Bank,Obedience before competence.,2013-04-24,1.0,Manager,"Nice people to work with but misery loves company.
Good Work/Life Balance.
Job security","Way too political. Don't value competence.
Nonexistent career opportunities.
Management motto : cover my own ass and put my freinds in the right spot despite their incompetence. . 
Extraordinary number of  VP's with no legitimacy or value added..
No growth,
Low wages compared to the average of the industry."
378,Laurentian Bank,Sinking ship,2012-09-26,1.0,Account Manager,Unionized and trailer fee commissions for advisers,"Ancient computer system, many (if not majority) of advisers know little if anything at all about finance and economics. Ridiculous amount of turnover in the branches. Constantly short staffed. Union protects many employees from being accountable for their actions."
379,Laurentian Bank,very good,2011-11-24,4.0,Investment Advisor,respectful environment and liberty in work development,it is a small firm lack of inside ressources
