But you will have to equally share it with your team regardless of how good your performance is.,"L&G is a very corporate place and it is hard to be heard or make any changes without going through years of approvals. If they ask you to join with the view to promote you later the chances are it will not happen.

Redundancies are very common. They do not do them well. They try and get rid of people quickly often offering minimal pay-offs.

I was forced to reinterview for my job which, as I have found out, I was unable to perform, contrary to my higher than average figures and positive reviews. I have been told that the figures I have acquired so far meant nothing in the review process.

I have tried arguing the decision and was shut down by HR with a number of excuses that were never communicated to us in the first place. The amount of stress left me traumatised and in need of medical help.

Later I found out that my role was given to a long-term connection brought on board by the recently joined director. My entire team of over 10 people were forced to take redundancy to make space for the new team she wanted in our place.

I know of a pregnant colleague who was bullied out of her role by her new manager. He simply did not like her. Before he even started the disciplinary action based on knit-picking through her role he asked her if she wanted to resign there and then.

I have seen some shocking ways in which the company treats people and would not recommend it to anyone unless you are good mates with the person who will be managing you."

Even the very smallest investments in Legal & General Capital need to be escalated all the way to the Group CEO etc. Whilst very smart and successful, these senior leaders are generally from an actuarial/finance rather than investment background with no specialist expertise in the sectors they are making investment decisions over.

My previous perceptions of Legal and General as a boring large insurance company were completely wrong. I've worked for other large well known corporates, but I have never worked anywhere so purposeful before and I would actually use the word entrepreneurial to describe L&G which I never thought I would associate with a large corporate organisation. I always wanted a job where I felt like I could make a difference to society and that is exactly what I've got. Insurance is just a tiny tiny part of the business. Before being approached for the role, I had no idea that Affordable housing, Modular homes, Care propositions and investments into clean energy were part of what L&G has to offer. 

Everyone is super friendly and I really feel like my opinion is valued and respected. Senior management also take time out to say thank you - which is extremely refreshing.",Its definitely not perfect - the tech and digital is not necessarily what you would expect at such a large organisation but they know that it needs to improve and are on that journey. They are certainly investing in the blockers so that we can be the best we want to be.
141,Legal & General,Making so many customers lives better every day,2021-06-02,5.0,Digital Product Manager,"You'd be incredibly surprised about the breadth of L&G - we touch the financial products that all of us need throughout all of our lives: from Life Insurance to later life living, from Pensions, through to ISAs, Lifetime Mortgages & our Care propositions. And we focus on making it easier, better & more accessible to our customers in every way that we can. Everyone really cares here.

Plus L&G also invests in really entrepreneurial & ethical new areas like Affordable Homes & our underpinning Inclusive Capitalism overarching purpose that allows us to invest in the evolution of our cities and our environmentally friendly future.

It's a big company that can do incredible amounts of good, but it also feels small, authentic & manageable. It has a wide variety of roles, from customer facing, regulator facing, through to digital, engineering, actuarial roles, customer service & financial services SMEs. Our Digital Teams here have grown exponentially over the years and will only continue to get bigger and better.

Women and men excel alike. There are many women in top roles & it's never felt unbalanced here at L&G. Indeed annual reviews of pay scales take place unprompted to ensure equality continues to be a top priority. Location-wise we're dotted across many lovely places across the UK too, so it provides variety in where you can base yourself.","We are a company on a big journey with a strong mission but it can, like in all large organisations, take a while to get there. We're not as nimble as the start-ups and do have the expected amount of legacy tech behind us, but that's because we're a company that's been doing business for a long time. That said, there are many plans in place to allow us to both catch up & move ahead - we all play our role in creating that future."

As a company, it is invested in so many diverse areas that the options for projects to get involved in and opportunities to make a difference are endless if you are willing to apply yourself and search for them.

The business genuinely puts their money where their mouth is when it comes to its investments and business priorities. They are consistently making good on their promises to help redress climate change, provide affordable housing, regenerate cities and contribute to science and innovation. Not sure many, if any, other financial services businesses can claim this.","Technology is behind although this is not unlike many other competitors but there is a tangible investment being made in redressing this. 

There can be red tape to get through to get things done but when the business commits to an initiative, there is a true entrepreneurial attitude to pushing this forward. The business is aware of the red tape and actively aiming to resolve this but as is often the case, these things can take time."

182,Legal & General,Great culture but will take you 20 years to break out of middle management,2021-03-19,4.0,Financial Planning & Analysis Manager,"Legal and general is like an old Bentley. comfy with a powerful engine, but a lot of weight to shift. It’ll be nice to be in, but 0-60 will take 20 years.

Big org, diverse environments to work in. Wonderful people and changeable pace, lots of best practice to learn from. It’s highly regulated, so you see what good looks like every day.

I enjoyed all the teams I worked with. Loved the different divisions and completely different operating models. I worked in many locations. Kingswood, Cardiff, Brighton, London and even regional partners.

I started as a Senior Finance Analyst and progressed to management fairly fast in 2 years. Being a business partner to multiple divisions across a few entities has given me some great insights into operating models, having some challenging projects to work on commercially and financially.

It’s hard to make a difference there; to have a voice and face. I managed to, but had to slog and really push change to sell it more widely. Shouldn’t be so hard to make things better.","In finance it’s hard to get up the chain into senior leadership there and regardless of skills, shining reviews, outstanding performance etc, restructures set people back year in year out, which is pretty awful; there’s a lot of competition from Group finance who are markedly more visible to leadership, so opportunities there is fairly static and staid. You just have to see how long people stay “finance managers” before becoming heads. Some 10 years, (reshuffled, relearn, reestablish, outperform, only to be displaced due to restructure to start all over again). When that happens to the superstars, you know there are issues. 

It’s poorly paid as well. For a FTSE it’s shocking. It’s not until you leave that you realise how bad the pay grades are. Pigeonholed in Finance, in middle management, during the most important time of your career to diversify and grow.

I left, took a seniority cut in different sector, (a charity at that) earning £10,000k more + 20% bonus, was promoted in new role within 6 months. Within a year promoted again as a head in FP&A and Business Improvements. So after pouring heart and soul into that company, to earn peanuts for 7 years at L&G as a high performing Finance Manager, within 4 years of leaving, 2 companies later, I’m now an Operations Director, with loads more experience and on track for a fulfilling career doing what I do best.

I interviewed at legal and general a couple years back in Hove. Unsurprisingly it seemed the world had stopped going back there. Even the tech and ways of working were the same. (Which filled me with dread given how much the world had advanced with MS Teams/interview techniques/tablets etc) I realised it’s a leviathan and will take tens of years to change process and senior leadership. It’s stifling. Systems are still same, ways of working are backward and unsurprisingly, I found myself questioning why I’d want to work there again after tasting what “excellent” looks and feels like.

Quite stark. That industry really grabs a person and pins them in place.

Training opportunities and courses are archaic too."

Staff are very well looked after. Current CEO has some terrific ideas and has kept the company at the head of the game.","There are a handful of very senior female directors at the company that bully and abuse their staff, and, despite this being well known, it is allowed and a lot of good people leave because of this. Very disappointing and makes would could be a great company to work for a potential nightmare. However there are one or two fantastic female directors and perhaps the reason they do not get appointed to the board is because the 'bad apples' have tarnished the reputation of women in this company."

The offices in Kingswood are fantastic with great facilities including a pool, gym and loads of pitches for all sports.  Good canteen and coffee bar and very clean and well maintained, car park can be interesting at times but overall 5* for a working environment. 

Benefits package is always good, especially and unsurprisingly the pension is fantastic.","There has been a lot of change in recent years which has a negative impact on staff moral but as an outsider I can still see what a great place to work L&G is. 

Communication from managers to staff has always been an issue and I belive this is still the case."

Senior management talk constantly about trying to engage with employees and fix problems, yet only ever show real interest in performance against targets, not the fundamentals that underpin and ultimately affect them. Shortsighted business planning, and decison making processes that frankly beggar belief. The list goes on."

I started 3 1/2 years ago and, although there were massive gaps in the introduction to the company, I enjoyed my time there to begin with and my peers were welcoming and helpful.
For those who wish to there is the opportunity to take courses to progress your career whether that be outside L&G or not.","There is very little chance to progress. 
Training lasted a long time but I still felt unprepared when joining the floor and it turned out that there were massive gaps. 
Challenging processes is a very hard and feels like a losing battle from the start.
For the last year or so there has been a real atmosphere of having to fight for recognition and even for your job. So many people started to be put on different performance reviews and perfomance measures which didn't allow for people getting used to the changes in role, department, management, sampling and staff levels. This lead to people becoming over protective of their own job and real culture of backstabbing and blame. 
Recognition felt more of a guesture and was inconsistent.
I don't say this as a rant or even from just personal experience but really as something useful to those I'm leaving behind as I know this is a shared feeling with many others on the floor."

Average salary for new starters compared to similar local companies.,"Poor leadership, constant change, continuous redundancies over last 5 years.  No internal progression.  No training for management.  Poor rates of bonus / pay rise verse success of company.  Unclear expectations of staff.

Good work-life balance. Work was not too demanding and there were plenty of nice people. Pretty much everyone in the company wanted to do the right thing by the customer.","My whole L&G experience, which lasted four years, was just too slow for me. The company was very unexciting, very risk averse, very process driven and generally quite a lumbering beast. Decision-making was slow and done by endless committees and working groups. Many people there were good at their job, but an equal or greater amount were very, very average and unwilling to step outside a very tight remit or think outside the box. A lot of people at L&G have been at the company a very long time. The person I replaced had never worked anywhere else, which I don't think is healthy. 
My mind just had too much spare capacity and in the end I could stand the mediocrity no longer and had to leave before I went stark raving mad. It's probably a good place for many people, to be fair, just not me. If you are a 9 to 5 person with low ambition, then this is the perfect place for you."
