1,,Getting worse,2022-04-05,2.0,Project Manager,Nice people and for most areas good work life balance.,High turnover makes this a no go. IT support and technical help almost non existent.

- Impressive perks and benefits - the SF office is INCREDIBLE. On-site gym and locker room (with towels!), cafe with barista, catered lunches on days we're in-office, cold brew/kombucha on tap, fully-stocked pantries, ice cream freezer... I think I eat better at work than I do at home.
- Unlimited PTO has given me real work/life balance for the first time in my career
- Generous parental leave and very supportive People Success team
- Tons of opportunities to learn and grow - certainly helps if you're willing to push and take initiative

- Good career development if you're in Engineering and good launching pad for growing career in Fintech","- Lots of turnover
- Caliber of engineers are meh
- Not exactly the best brand to put on your resume
- In a competitive market and hard to differentiate itself from the rest of companies doing the same thing"
62,,Company with a Bright Future tripped up by an HR nightmare,2021-08-26,2.0,Director,"Compensation is competitive, as are benefits. Company mission and vision are valuable, and the company outlook is great.","Culture. The aspirations of the company, especially as it relates to its people are rarely actioned. I am consistently disappointed by the lack of strategy shown at this company from an HR perspective in the last couple of years - especially in 2020 and throughout a recent Bank acquisition. We see no leadership from our HR business partners, rooted in a massively under-qualified team which starts at the top of the HR vertical. Lots of words around what we will do and want to do for our people, with no action, feels performative - especially when it comes to DEI initiatives. Attrition is the ""norm"" and shrugged off by the CEO in company wide town halls"
63,,STAY AWAY FROM THIS PLACE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,2021-08-25,1.0,Member Support,The training staff is amazing.,"You could have the most amazing call and they find ways to dock 20 points from your QA score, that is if you don't autofail first. Even if you went above to help the customer and they leave satisfied, you will get hammered by QA. You can leave the call feeling your happiest you helped the customer and they liked you and you will risk losing your job. 
They are not flexible at all neither with the workers nor the customers. You're over your AHT by 15 seconds? Too bad, you didn't make the cut. Heard some noise or a dog barking but continued the call? Too bad, autofail. A customer accidentally entered their email incorrectly but applied before? Too bad, you need a new email now. A customer can't login? Have fun on that 20 minute call that will spike up your AHT. You got along amazing with a customer? Don't take the extra minutes building rapport with them because it will spike your AHT as well. No refinancing options for customers who improved their credit and no hardship plans if something in life happened. It's all just metrics metrics metrics without caring about what is happening behind the person and without caring how far they came. They don't care about the customer experience as long as you get their money in less than 6 minutes. If you have a heart and a personality, stay away from this company!!!!!!"
64,,They don’t care about their employees,2021-08-24,1.0,Manager,I can’t think of anything,Everything. They overwork people and when you push back because your plate is too full you’ll lose all opportunities of moving up. Pay is extremely below industry.

-Generous PTO and benefits.","-Cutthroat Attendence polices. They are firing good and productive employees for being late by 1 minute due to factors employees can’t control, such as weather/ traffic. 
-Managers aren’t people who have worked for the company and know how things work, they are often managers that have no experience with the company."
67,,Management is VAGUE about everything and treat you as inferior.,2021-08-17,1.0,Customer Development Representative,"$19 an hour to start! AND THAT'S IT! Management is vague about everything. Job duties, QA auto fails, metrics.... 1 manager wants 120 calls a day the next wants 225 a day. What is going on here?",2 months+ of way too much training. Only 1 week of actual computer and app training (That you really need) then a bunch of useless knowledge for months that will not help you with your clients at all.

72,,Poorly managed,2021-07-23,1.0,Live Chat Agent,"Snacks
Not much else is a pro","Poor communication 
No real help after training"
73,,Of Course It's Because of Management,2021-07-20,2.0,Analyst,A jacket or backpack may be given from time to time.,"You get to hear where the CEO stands as far as the timeline to get his hair and beard trimmed. It leaves me on the the edge of my seat every All Hands Meeting.

LC leased a brand new building in Lehi and spent a fortune in this pseudo-sanctuary for itself and now to save face and despite everybody WFH at 1/3 or less the workforce capacity pre-covid, is forcing everybody back to work because of ""need of collaboration"" between teams.

The raises I've gotten don't qualify as COLA because they are less than the yearly rate of inflation.

They've laid off about 1/3 of the workforce after covid hit, and my department went from about 34 to 17 people. We kept up the workload for over a year despite this reduction. Now because of the Radius Bank acquisition, they are only onboarding contingent workers as they are pushing to automate its treasury/finance department and lay off the rest of the department. Managers have experience w/ data manipulation and analytics, but there are no people managers. There is no one acting on behalf of and for the benefit of the employees. They employ the stick method of management visibility and good luck if you ever need to be out sick or go on vacation.

LC pushes this culture of everyone being part of this ""Club,"" but like all other company cultures, LC is firstly and lastly a job. There is no additional benefit to this ""Club Culture"" they push. A word of advice to those who are not customer service phone jockeys: LC Lehi is a call center, therefore the vibe is a call center. If you're not into wearing pajamas or sport attire at work, your department may still participate in its ""fun, culture-promoting"" activities.

LC was the first company where I felt lovebombed when I first onboarded. But as with all cults, the thin veneer of pure joy eventually wears off. And you realize they're no different than many other companies, and for a company that touts a lot of innovation, they seem reticent in explaining why they follow trends instead of creating their own path when it comes to treating employees better. I've witnessed a steady exodus of employees since October of 2019, and I never understood why until I've seen how things are really done on the inside. I am not a bitter employee writing a trolling review, I am just disappointed."

This paves the way for better profitability and growth. Having been here for almost 3 years, I've never felt more positive about LC's future. Exec leadership is top notch, and are very transparent about where the company is in its path. The combination of marketplace lender + bank really opens up all kinds of possibilities that didn't exist before. Workplace is pretty laid back, but most folks are pretty smart, hard working. I rarely work more than 40-50 hours in a week, and the comp is really competititve -- especially with the stock price on the rise.","Company is in the process of becoming a grown-up bank, and is learning hard lessons about the importance of documented and followed processes, a culture of compliance.

Compensation is competitive for the area.

Work is extremely fulfilling if you're into problem solving and troubleshooting. There are new challenges daily that feel rewarding when they've been tackled. When a tough issue is fixed, your coworkers will celebrate with you.

Management does seem to care about employee wellbeing. Employee safety is a huge priority.

There is a diverse company culture that is supported and celebrated.","Management will play favorites. 

Little to no upward movement.

Company activities/ events/ meetings are not geared toward operations teams.

Information can be difficult to locate. Although there has been great progress in accessibility of company policies, there is still a heavy dependency on tribal knowledge. With the current work from home environment, this can make obtaining and retaining updated information difficult. 

Sometimes changes happen to a process and you have to hunt for information on how to proceed."

125,,Great People. Some great teams left. Little Innovation.,2021-02-22,3.0,Lead Engineer,"I'm rating this from the perspective of an engineer that left LC back in 2020.

Great people, you'll love everyone. They really are great. 
Decent Pay, def not top of market but decent for Sr, Lead, Principal, Architect + levels.
Company perks were nice pre covid.
Managers were, maybe still are spectacular. I liked almost every engineering manager I've met. They are, were, really great.","Unfortunately, most of the talented engineers & leaders have already left the company. Seriously, not exaggerating, my tenure was peppered with monthly goodbyes from great people. Since I started, I counted 73 of my working piers leaving the company since starting. Not because of dire situations but because they could be doing more elsewhere... And that leads me to my next point:

If you join as an engineer, you'll most likely join a team with little documentation with no seniority on the project. Be prepared if you do you'll be managing the plumbing more than writing new features.

Vertically, engineering leadership is now lacking (although there are still great managers). At the C & VP level, engineering leadership in building a great engineering culture does not exist anymore. It's really in maintenance mode since covid started and I hope that now as a bank, LC sees the inevitable and either does what other banks do and hires all engineering offshore to do the core lifting (super unlikelyy)... or 2... actually innovate. 

Innovation at LC was becoming a bank when I was there because honestly, peer to peer lending failed. What will the next evolution at LC bring? I think unless leadership is serious about innovation, of which all evidence suggests otherwise, I wouldn't recommend joining the company anytime soon."

165,,This Place is a Mess,2020-11-09,1.0,Payment Specialist,"-they have a very nice building in Lehi (that you will not be working in until summer of 2021, if ever)","Initial Training
-Trainers are from the sales department and not the collections department
-Training focussed on a loose negotiation style call model with limited focus on QA best practices
-Trainers were more interested in making sure that every single minute of our day was filled with talking points than on IF their talking points applied to our job duties.
-Did not provide adequate training on how to use their crude hodgepodge of outsourced systems to troubleshoot and provide solutions to customers.
-Provided less than an hour of training (out of two full weeks) on their COVID-19 hardship plans, which were easily 30% of total call volume for the Payment Solutions Department.

On The Job Training/Coaching
-Huge impact of failing QA based on things that were either not covered in training, or mentioned briefly and glossed over
-Coaches regularly encouraged me to collect payments on unissued funds and residually accrued interest after payoffs rather than investigating obvious Lending Club errors.
-when attempting to handle customer issues we would mark calls as 'No Pay' ""due to internal policy,"" which insured we would continue to call and request payment. This is a higher priority than accurately describing and tracking issues, including which issues are re-occurring and which ones agents are wasting the most time solving over and over.
-Group coaching meetings were one hour once a week and usually completely based on one simple error one person had made one time
-They use some metric called CEV, its not in their glossary of acronyms and when I asked fellow trainees they had no idea. 

Management
-Only asked for feedback and input prior to putting us on the phones to find out what a disaster their call management system is.
-Don't seem to know or care what their inbound calls are for or how to get them to the right teams.
-Prioritizes dressing up in silly costumes for zoom meetings and printing gigantic motivational posters to show employees on a webcam.
-Have implemented 3rd party systems and procedures that are clearly chosen and/or designed by people who do not have to use them on a day to day basis.

Overview / Systems
-I had between 5-10 calls every day from people just checking on the status of payments because they were receiving automated emails. This is a prime example of how they don't have a cohesive efficient system that is literally the backbone of a technology company. Not only is this a consistent daily issue for customers, it is a waste of time for their agents taking calls.
-Don't be fooled into thinking this is an exciting career at an innovative technology company. They are all about appearance with no substance.
-It might be possible that the investor side is actually innovative and not just a new way to stack up massive piles of unsecured debt and repackage it for consumers to try and retire on. But their entire back end for borrower services is a house of outdated cards that causes as many issues as it solves.
-This is a call center grind with a fancy lobby and a barista, which you will see once when you go pick up your equipment and again when you drop it off.
-One of the main reasons I wanted this job was to get some healthcare coverage in a kinda crazy time, just in case, and health is important and all that. they never told me when I became eligible, they mentioned once in the first weed of training all the plan details, but never bothered with telling us when or how to enroll."

This ship is headed one way and rocking the boat is seldom rewarded.

The PTO policies were wonderful for a healthier work-life balance.","The San Francisco leadership was obviously cliquey, in a very unwelcoming way. The position was, unfortunately, not resilient to any sort of economic downturn."
189,,Micromanagement,2020-08-04,2.0,Customer Development Representative/Sales,"Loved the office we worked in and worked with some amazing people! I worked in CD prior to COVID-19, and loved the sales atmosphere; it is more encouraging rather than a typical cut-throat sales job like I had previously in Lehi. Prior to COVID-19, I did think there was potential to move up and help from my supervisor to do so.","While at LC, I felt there was little respect paid to the employee. Agents are often told they are replaceable. There is no remediation if a borrower is extremely abusive to an agent, only suggestion is to apologize to the borrower, ""not take it personally,"" and how we were ""lucky to even have jobs."" 
The PS role included borrowers using profanity towards agents every day, and borrowers were able to do so every with no repercussions. Of course, with the current state of the world it is understandable that everyone is frustrated, but I do not like the idea that little is done to protect agents from this behavior. 
Additionally, agents are micromanaged, leading to this ""us versus them"" mentality. As an example, I did not have a scheduled break for 4 hours (break @8 AM, lunch @ 12:30 PM) which led to me taking a bathroom break for 3 mins. For reference, time away from your station without it being a designated break goes against you and if extremely frequent could lead to no commission. I came back to my desk with messages from my supervisor saying ""Why aren't you on the phones? Why aren't you in ""ready""? What are you doing?"" This sense of distrust towards employees exemplifies that mentality and creates a work environment where distrust is expected. 
There is also a gap with communication towards employees. There are constant changes, especially with COVID-19, and updates take a long time to trickle down to agents, which leaves us catching up while on the phone with borrowers. 
The Work From Home Kit is very complicated and agents are blamed for tech issues and if there are many tech issues, you have to use PTO to cover it. For reference, LC uses Windows 2012 and a 40 part set up, so of course there are many issues. 
With the absence of sick days, agents have to accumulate PTO. I had an immediate family member have a life or death emergency unexpectedly and because this happened and I had not accumulated PTO; in turn, I could not visit family for holidays after although I had bought plane tickets for myself and others and paid for housing. There should be more understanding versus choosing between keeping a job and loosing money from planned travel time. I would have happily taken away future PTO. 
With COVID-19, borrowers usually call in for assistance. Management encouraged we avoid being completely truthful to them and to instead only help the company’s bottom line, against LC's own mission statement."
190,,Great until it's not,2020-07-28,3.0,Anonymous Employee,"You get the feeling that management cares about employees. Perks weren't insane by SF standards, but well thought out.

Company perks was awesome with free snacks, free healthcare (taken away), free gym","Sucky management, very top-heavy to the point where some directors, managers and supervisors are just sitting and not doing anything.

Rank and files are treated like garbage. 

Recent promotions are based on favoritism and still is. 

Operations was brought to Utah to save money. However, the people hired are just whole part of the scheme where they try and still do, change their “job title” to promote themselves and make themselves look good. No substance, no work experience no whatsoever. If you are a favorite, you will definitely get promoted.

Lots of layoffs. Like, A LOT. Especially if they do not like you. BEWARE. 

Can you imagine an operations supervisor being suddenly promoted to a corporate senior director for a short-time? Well, it happens here. Not because of their ability for the work but it’s because they know who to buddy up to. Only track record they have is that someone reported them to have some involvement in what should get people fired immediately (but she got away with it) and terrorizing her subordinates... and how many people hate her and quit because of her. 

Many managers and directors get the goals from above and pass the work to their team and get credit for it."
193,,Beware of Commission,2020-07-15,2.0,Payment Solutions Specialist,18 Days PTO on year one. Health insurance. Co-workers.,"If you work as a Payment Solutions agent and quit they will not pay you commission for the month prior to your departure. I gave notice with this company and was informed because I would no longer be an employee on the date in which commission was going to be paid out I wouldn't receive a commission for the month prior.

If you are going to leave this company wait till you receive commission before giving notice. Really disappointing you work hard for a company, find a better opportunity, and give notice professionally. What you get in return is nothing.

They basically did not want you to use any after-call work to fill out notes, and if you used after-call work then it ate away at your availability. They also were terrible with communicating when issues were fixed, you would find out several days after they fixed an issue that it was all good when I could have been telling lenders the issue was fixed instead of checking back in a few days. My team lead rarely communicated with me when I was told by them when assigned to the team that they would always be available if I have any questions or issues."

202,,Terrible company in final tailspin,2020-06-25,1.0,Product Manager,"there once were many
now there are none","Here is the story that many at LC now are piecing together - the way LC went down: it started with the firing of Renaud Laplanche by the board. Total overreaction designed to appease regulators. He was a visionary CEO with amazing sense for storytelling and the media loves him (he just raised Series D round for his LC copycat Upgrade at $1B valuation while meanwhile LC's valuation has plummeted to less than $350M). Scott Sanborn - a nice guy, who had never run anything bigger than a small lending operation before is promoted to CEO by the board and hires the former CFO of WaMu's mortgage operation which was seized by regulators in 2008 under his watch . Scott then makes precarious hire #2 by bringing in as a President one of the worst imposters in the industry - Steve Allocca who was pushed out of PayPal and before that out of Well Fargo. Steve clashes with Tom as well as with the COO Sameer Gulati - a talented and charismatic strategists almost immediately. The COO leaves and Steve starts plotting how to take over the CEO job from Scott by positioning himself as a visionary who's hands are shackled by lack of authority to re-orient the company. Steve creates utter chaos around a fairy-tale story about LC as the financial messiah spreading wellness to the masses despite the fact that the company knows too well that the credit scores of 75% of its customers deteriorate and debt levels rise precariously after customers take a LC loan. For a few years Steve manages to string the board along with this fairytale but fails to produce a substantive plan of how exactly that plan of his work. Then Scott makes mistake #3 and hires an absolute nightmare of a CTO - Bahman Koohestani - a fixer with zero product or technology skills but with profound absence of charisma and penchant for intimidation. An exodus of talented product and engineering leaders and credit professionals ensues. Scott, Tom, Bahman and Steve proceed to cut costs and weaken what's left of LC's core competency in service of the fairy-tale that Steve created to turn LC into a financial-wellness provider. After almost 3 years of pain and ""destroying what is working"" the board finally loses patience and fires Steve Allocca in the middle of the COVID epidemic which practically shuts down LC's only revenue producing business - personal loans. With the company now left with a skeleton staff and a pale shadow of its former self, Scott and the board hunker down to try and survive COVID until the bank acquisition deal materializes after which there will be no more LC left."

236,,Attrition faster than back-fill at HQ,2020-01-29,1.0,Human Resources Related,Benefits are competitive and flexibility with work is a huge plus. Company goals of promoting financial health is a big plus.,"Company is working to streamline their bottom line costs to show profitability. People are cut off before amenities. Employees are overworked due to poor hires who don't stay long (avg 1-2 year tenure). Gaps are filled with contractors but even the contractors don't stay for their full term as they'll get better offers elsewhere, or their managers are not very good.

 At-will terminations are used sparingly if you don't agree, speak out, all while ""Doing the Right Thing"". Company values are plastered everywhere but management fails to follow it. They'll only use them when it's convenient.  
Diversity and Inclusion hurts  due to 1. Lowering business upkeep, 2. Employees being overworked that no one wants to participate in any extracurricular activities, 3. There are some closeted bigots in management which makes it almost impossible to get any support.

If you're looking for professional growth, you're out of luck. While the company promotes gender pay equality, and have a pretty comprehensive leadership program for female employees only, if you're a male, you'll get nothing. Leadership development opportunities are only for those who are already aspiring leaders and not for those who truly need it.

Promotions are gnarly. Senior leadership will try to get by with not changing your title and pay.  You have to fend for yourself to get properly compensated! - From a different current employee.

Your information is vulnerable when you apply. Resumes and offer letters left around in the office and desktops. Hiring managers not held accountable for your personal information.

RSUs are worthless. 

tldr; if you're excited to be overworked, under-supported, chewed up and spat out, this is the place."

When I signed my offer letter, they told me that my offer wasn't set in stone and that they had to reach out to my references and also pass the background check first. I wasn't worried about any of that, however, generally speaking when you offer someone a position at your company, they've already done those types of things. It's all contingent. After that happened, I was kind of leery about starting. I wasn't excited about the position. I had to fill out multiple documents before my first day. It was extremely overwhelming. My first day was full of HR related things, benefits, meeting multiple leadership teams, and a tour. LC says that they pride themselves on culture and I had just come from a culture that truly makes you feel proud to come into work daily. I didn't get a sense of that at all. The worst part of being ""apart of the club"" (as they say) is the abysmal attendance policy. Let me lay this out for you guys who are debating on applying. 1) If you're late (1-30min) you receive a point. If you're later than 30 minutes, you receive 2 points. 6 points results in documented coaching, 7 points results in a PIP (performance improvement plan), and 8 points results in termination. ALL WITHIN A 90 DAY PERIOD. So guess what, emergencies, traffic, snow, whatever... it doesn't matter. You're getting points. Do you know how easy it is to get points being just 1 minute late? 2) Unplanned absences- for example, imagine coming into work and staying for more than half your shift, but you unexpectedly became ill. You don't want to spread the germs, so you ask to leave. You are now docked for unplanned absence. You might as well have not even come into your shift for the day. And guess what? If you have 3 unplanned absences in a 90 day window, you get documented coaching, 4 equals out to another PIP, and who knows what happens at 5. 3) If you want to take any time off, and I mean any time off at all, you must use your PTO. This is a pretty standard practice, but this is what threw me off... Let's just say you have requested a trip 3 months in advance for a few days. However, some things have come up and you've had to take time off for dentist appointments, a wreck, doctors appointments, children are sick, etc and you've had to use some PTO here and there because of those things, if you do not have enough PTO to cover those days you've requested off very far in advance, it doesn't matter. They will NOT approve your request any longer. If you're out of PTO, you're screwed. They said even if you have plane tickets, hotels reserved, whatever, it doesn't matter to them because you have no PTO. You'll have to stay at work or you risk losing your job. 4) your lunch breaks are never continuously the same. So you work 8-5, one week your lunch break is going to be from 1-2, another week it'll change to 2-3, another week it'll change to 11-12, another week it'll change from 10-11. Who wants to not have any ability to change or have control over your own lunch break and when you deem it appropriate to feed yourself? No one, I mean absolutely no one wants to take a lunch break at 10am when you've arrived for work at 8am. That makes for a miserably long shift. As I was told, ""One week it might suck because you'll be assigned a lunch break at 10am and you've just gotten to work at 8am, but hey everyone has to go through it. It's not a big deal."" Yes it is. In my opinion and experience, these methods are considered fear based micromanaging. It's unhealthy, archaic, and suffocating to adults who've been working a steady job for years. We do not need constant restrictions to make sure we're working. The people you hire on should know how to work hard and stay professional without a point system."

Favors are done by leaders to each other and people below leadership line are just playing waiting games for promotions inspite of their hardwork, dedication and great attitude. HR also favors leaders than really paying importance to feedback from employees which truly shows HR doesn't really care about employees but is just there to take care of HR work. Sexual harassment is also pretty common in certain departments."

298,,Company trying to find itself after 2016 challenges,2019-07-02,4.0,Principal Product Manager,"Generally friendly company culture, management tries (very) hard to be a nice/cool employer considering the significant challenges experienced in 2016 with founder and CEO scandals, so you get the usual perks of being located central SF, nice office, new designs, occasional feel-good company events, etc. 
Product team has been through a lot of reshuffle in 2016 as well but generally seems to be heading in the right direction from 2017 onwards with a new inspiring leader (lean approach, KPI oriented, experimentation culture, designers embedded into teams).","Although it is a fairly young and innovative company with their lending model in FinTech, it is also a very hierarchical company under scrutiny of the market (since IPO). The overall structure pushes levels down and prevents innovative thinking, too much group think, still too much HIPPO decision making, bureaucratic organisation despite their hard efforts to make it less so. Seniority or closeness to execs still seems to be what allows people to be promoted. Lots of the brightest and more innovative people have left progressively to more novel/younger companies in FinTech."

The culture is gone, motivation of employees non-existent, and the vision is a continual misdirection of flashy half-baked ideas and corner cutting. No innovation at all, the talented people have left."
301,,It's a great company with a great product- but the transition to being more corporate could have been better,2019-06-22,4.0,Fraud Specialist,"When first started at the company: 

Great growth opportunities
-less corporate at that time
-hard work is seen and recognized
-excellent ""fresh grad from college"" opportunities
-easy to reach out to people to learn more

Nice company culture
-hired excellent talent
-hard working, fun, minimum ego, and  approachable peers
-open and welcoming
-minimal ""politics""
- see the CEO in the elevators and say hi
- people actually take time to know each other

Benefits:
-Free snacks
-Cools perks - free massages
-401K match to 4%
-fully paid health, dental and vision
-pre-tax commuter program
-happy hour - tues-thurs @ 5- 7pm
-barista and pour overs
-game rooms
-doctor on site

I woke up wanting to work each day -- I had fun doing my job and love interacting with my coworkers. I love the product and I really want the company to succeed and I, to grow along with it.","As the company transitioned to being more corporate, it went through some ""growing pains""(understandably) in order to sustain, maintain and scale such quick growth. 

*Disclaimer - it's difficult to be entirely not biased. Please keep that in mind.

Some cost cutting: 
-no holiday party anymore (dunno how long though)
-good bye dried mangos, pistachios, cup noodles, granola, coconut chips, etc. There are still free snacks but depending on what floor you work on, it's not stocked adequately --which leads to people ""hunting"" on other floors -- which is  frowned upon. At what lengths should one go to find yogurt or even bottled water?!
-changed the health care plan and it's not fully covered anymore - so employees need to pay.
-took away the free massages -- company said that it was of minimal interest to employees --- but strangely enough, most could not even get a slot due to limited slots to begin with.

Change in company culture:
-promises were not kept -- then entirely abandoned and eventually feigned as if it never happened. 
-it became heavily political and somewhat shady -- i noticed that some employee promotion/movement deals were being made under the table. those positions would be filled with management's intended candidate even before the position opens sometimes.
-seen instances of micromanagement
-seen instances of oppression, persecution, and blatant favoritism 
-seen that the management's perception of you will determine how comfortable your work life will be -- if they don't like you even though you are an excellent employee (hard working, no call outs, got along with people) -- good luck.
 
Compensation:
-low-balled in pay - compensation seems to be around 40% or so less than industry standard. 
-rejects negotiations 
-if you get promoted just a few months before the annual performance review, you will not get a pay raise even if you performed well. their justification is that your new position's new salary (if they do not term it as a ""lateral move"") is considered your annual ""raise"" for your performance. If they call your change in position a lateral move -- no raise at all.
-im losing money -- stocks are still dropping and i should not have spent so much on ESPP. (T.T)
-no cost of living adjustments. SF is expensive. Mere lunch is about 1 - 2 hours NET salary. and then, there is the ever increasing rental prices...

Well, despite the changes, I do not regret working at LC. I am grateful for the opportunities that were offered to me and to be able to work alongside some of the most hard working, brilliant minds I have ever met! I think for a first real job, it's one of the best jobs out there to start with!"

On the surface it looks and sounds great, but it will eventually disappoint you. My experience inside my department was a series of broken promises and petty power plays by management. In my time there, management displayed a lack of morals and very little intelligence.

If you do pursue employment with LendingClub, please be warned that it is a prime example of a company that will do their best to follow legal constraints, but not necessarily do the right thing. I would recommend caution to anyone who is not a protected class and is qualified for the job. They are a company that will promote and reward those who don’t work hard and aren’t qualified."

They are removing the operation department out of SF and are currently in the process of setting up call centers in Utah, Jamaica, etc (the level of customer service will be terrible).

392,,"Great, smart people who want to do the right thing",2018-12-02,5.0,Director,"The people are phenomenal. Fintech can have a lot of jerks. Finance bros + tech bros can mean a lot of testosterone and a culture of bad behavior. That is not the case here. There are very few people who are jerks. Even when people disagree, it's civil and people are thoughtful about separating the person from the situation. I have had recent conversations (one today, in fact), where someone was disagreeing with me and they said, ""I know you are coming at this with the right intent, but we aren't 100% aligned."" By acknowledging that someone is a good person and that it's the incentives that aren't aligned, we focus on the real problem. 

The company itself is also extremely successful. Although we are in the news a lot for being sued, it's because we are at the forefront of this industry. We are the largest personal loan company in America and that puts a target on our backs. You don't get to #1 by being bad at your job or through blind luck. The leaders here know what they're doing and how to run a business.

There are also almost unlimited opportunities to improve things. Not because things are horribly broken, but because there is so much that we can be doing. Literally everything is upside. If it's creating a new feature, changing a process, or upgrading a tool, everyone can make a significant difference.","The company has survived several devastating shocks, including our CEO committing fraud and being ousted by the Board in 2016. That, in turn, created more shocks. Taken together, it's meant the past few years have seen a huge amount of change and turnover in personnel. As the company shifts its business priorities, it causes disruption for the people working there. If your boss leaves and you don't like your new one quite as much, you might leave. That causes your friends and colleagues to reconsider things, etc. Change is hard and it's not over yet.

As the business and personnel change, even at the top, it means the executive team isn't always in agreement. It can cause even more disruption as initiatives are created or killed, especially if the communication around it isn't perfect.

For all the facts that it's publicly traded, 1800 people, and 11 years old, this is still a large startup. If you want something more stable, Visa, Wells Fargo, and Blackrock are all nearby."

- Free Health/Dental/Vision 
- Location (Montgomery Bart and Muni right in front)","DO NOT work in Member Support unless you are desperate for a job  or changing careers.  LendingClub's operation team (Customer Development, Credit, Payment Solutions, and Member Support) have a crazy high turnover rate.  I was working in Member Support for almost a year and I was one of the longest term employees in the department.  They hire in large groups (10-15) monthly.  Of the 10 people are started with, only 8 made it out of the 1 month training and only 3 people were remaining after 3 months. 

You are expected to be on the phone 93% of the day and your productivity is tracked down to the minute.  If you need to use the restroom or if your call goes into your break, it will negatively affect your score.  You are also graded on QA (they listen and grade two of your calls per week), Customer Surveys, and Average Handle time.  You are nothing more than a number working here.  The managers and supervisors don't care how burned out we get taking back to back calls for 7.5 hours a day.  T

 Although the supervisors here were nice enough, they were pretty much useless.  They pretty much sit at their desk all day, and no one actually knows what they're doing all day.  If you need help with a customer or have a general question, you just get redirected to a member of the Assist team.  It got to a point where I wouldn't even bother the supervisors and go straight to the Assist team anytime I needed help. 

During the hiring process, they mentioned that after 6 months you are able to transfer to a different department.  What they didn't mention is that the departments you can transfer into are just lateral moves within operations.  In my 1 year working here, I did not see anyone actually get promoted to a higher role.  

SIDE NOTE : The Member Support team is currently expanding to a branch in Las Vegas, Syracuse and Jamaica.  The cost of running a call center is much cheaper at those locations, so if you're looking for job security, this is not it."

Lending Club has changed. It’s not the same as it used to be with supervisors encouraging you to be better Ans wanting you to succeed which for me wasn’t the case. I was stuck with a pretty monotone spoken supervisor who would not even look interested in wanting to help me. Sounded like he would read a script off his laptop and wait for a proper response. LC is now filled with a bunch of “Yes” folk who only look after themselves. You’ll still find a few people that actually give a crap about the job they do even though LC’s loans and worth ethics are a bit deceiving to someone who may not know what they’re signing up for. You can never find anyone to help you and when they do they have this attitude as if they don’t wanna help you nor the customer and looking for a supervisor? HA forget about it, they’re always in meetings about God knows what for nearly an entire day. Only time you’ll find a supervisor is when you have your 1:1 which you’ll be happy to be off the phones for half an hour. Some of the supervisors don’t know what the hell they’re doing or saying and I don’t think they even buy into the BS they try to feed the representatives either. LC is a shell of its former self, and everyone who actually gave a crap was smart and left."

407,,Member Support Representative,2018-09-27,1.0,Member Support Representative,Good camaraderie amongst team members because you are all dealing with the same mentally exhausting and demanding work,"-DO NOT allow recruiters, or even your lack of employment, to sway you into applying for the member support position. The company (recruiters, trainers, managers, supervisors) will lie to you by saying that you will have many opportunities to ""advance"" your career at LC. However, nothing can be farther from the truth. The only opportunities are other meager-paying positions within the Operations Department, all not living and sustainable in the expensive Bay Area. They say that you can apply anywhere in the company if you perform well in your role, but that is bogus. Think about it: if you're a top performer, why would the Operations Dept management want to lose you to another department, even though it may provide you with better career advancement. And that is questionable in of itself due to the fact that the Federal Trade Commission is suing the company, the stock price is way low, and the entire company is basically coasting on autopilot since they fired their founding CEO in 2016. (The firing was deserved however regarding a governance scandal over falsified loan data, but that's a different story.)

-MS agents are measured on customer satisfaction (CSAT) surveys, average handle time (AHT), and availability; they also rank you amongst all the other agents. CSAT surveys are very subjective and unfair because the agents may be providing superb service but because the company's misleading policies and tactics are making the customers mad, these emotion-driven individuals will give BOTH the agent and company poor survey responses. Also, you are set up to fail: work at providing great customer service and your AHT goes over. Rush through a call so you can meet AHT metrics, but then the customer gives you poor survey responses. The availability metric means you are practically chained to your desk. You have to take your breaks at scheduled times; any time you are unavailable outside of them, even for using the bathroom, will count against you. If a call goes into your break or lunch, you can still take the full 15-min break or 1-hr lunch, but the time that goes into your scheduled availability afterwards counts against you. Because it's against the law to tell you not to take your full 15-min or 1-hr, they won't do so. But by taking a full break/lunch, it will count against you. And they do measure the time down to the second.

-Calls are back to back to back to back, with only 30 secs allotted for you to case and write down call notations, which will increase your AHT. Any time over 30 secs will hurt your availability."

Sterile environment - lendingClub is first, and foremost, a call center. So our spaces are catered to fit the needs of the call center which often means maximizing floor space with cubicles and having lots of walls to absorb sound.

Metrics are the most important stat, not the quality of the employee 
If you’re in MS, you better hope that you plan a trip fully 3-4 months prior to going (and that’s if you get lucky enough to get a spot), otherwise you will need to call out sick to be able to go on vacation
Breaks are scheduled terribly which hurt people’s metrics
If you miss your break and take it late, it will hurt your metrics. Lots of people skip out on these breaks because of this.

They teach us that we should care and build relationships with our customers, but only give us 5 minutes to do this.

434,,Lacks Lending Care for Employees,2018-04-19,2.0,Payment Solution Specialist,Benefits are awesome. Can't beat what they have to offer compared to most companies and this is mainly why I am still here.,"As much training and tools the company has to offer to employees, there is a lack of consistency and not much empathy for employees and their well being as we work for the company. I say this because those in Operations go through alot by taking some challenging calls.  For the amount of time I have been in the company so many have been terminated left and right for many various minor and major reasons. I feel there is a lack of protocol when the company does this. It causes major anxiety and stress to those in the certain department and makes one feel disturbed. I feel that upper management are very pretentious and have lack of of being genuine to those they lead. They are their mainly just for their job and themselves.  Everything is based off metrics which is understandable to understand the success and performance of an agent but it can lead to hidden pressure that no one talks about and can make an agent feel degraded, especially if they are trying their best. For anyone taking the Payment Solution Specialist role, beware and proceed with extra caution."

I guess it's a stable entry level job if you have the patience for it and you'll have plenty of others to suffer with you.","You'll see that I have many more Cons than Pros for this position. You have only minimal opportunities to move up (there are many people in ""higher"" levels than this one that are incompetent). You will be on the phone for seven hours a day on an outdated and convoluted system. You will be talking to people that have never used the internet before, some will be allowed to scream obscenities at you but you cannot even hang up. You will have to report to management and development higher ups that lack accountability and proper testing before rolling out new features and ideas. You are working for the Member Support team in Operations at LendingClub...but this means you must do the bidding of any other Operations department if that other agent tells you what to do. Basically you're treated as an essential employee on the outside but then are expected to shut up and be on the phone all day or get warnings and/or disciplinary action. Also you ONLY get MAJOR US holidays off (New Year's, Memorial, Independence, Labor, Thanksgiving, Christmas) and WILL WORK other ""minor"" holidays (also the PTO system is ridiculous...with limited slots for each day and if you cannot get one of these slots you probably cannot take that day off unless you call in sick). Lastly, the company will continually push how much revenue we're making and how positively we're impacting America but this doesn't mean you're guaranteed a raise or any bonuses for the year. TLDR: THIS IS AN ENTRY LEVEL JOB THAT REQUIRES PATIENCE AND CAN BE EXTREMELY FRUSTRATING. BE CAUTIOUS BEFORE SIGNING ON THE DOTTED LINE AND REMEMBER THAT REGARDLESS OF THE GREAT BENEFITS AND AMENITIES THE RECRUITER WILL THROW AT YOU, YOU WILL BE ON THE PHONE FOR SEVEN HOURS A DAY NON STOP.

448,,"Great Benefits/Location, and in return you just need to sacrifice your soul",2018-02-24,1.0,Member Support Representative,"The benefits were great, location is nice, and the interview was easy.","When you get a tour of the building, it seems amazing. It's located in the heart of the financial district (making it super easy to commute via BART), free snacks/coffee, and there are so many restaurants/bars around so you can drink to forget the 8 hours you spent answering phone calls from people who are self-proclaimed ""computer illiterate"" who decided to use an online lending platform to finance their vacations at 22% APR. 

Don't expect to get to know your coworkers very well. Most conversations are cut after about 20 seconds because the next phone call is coming in. You can talk to them during breaks, but everyone is usually pretty down and depressed, which leads to venting about how much they hate the job, making you feel worse when you get back to your station after break to take more calls.

One of the metrics they use to rank you against other employees makes going to the bathroom outside of your breaks count against you. No joke. 

You really get the feeling that your just a small cog in a giant corporate machine. You get all these emails about fun company events happening in the lobby, or a reminder to try out the free massage parlor on site, etc., but then you remember you can't participate in any of these things because they expect you to be on the phones all the time.

If you survive long enough, you will end up working a Saturday shift. 

If your average phone call length is too long, it counts against you. It makes sense, but it also causes you to get upset when customers need more help, even though your first priority is to actually help them. Be too helpful and your performance metrics are lowered."

You deal with financially illiterate people who do not understand the product they signed up for. This is exhausting and the call volume is high. Performance metrics constantly change. Management will not make you privy to any changes in your job title, performance metrics, schedule or your direct report until the last minute. We never know what is happening in the trenches which makes communicating with borrowers very difficult."
452,,"Not the worst company to work for, but the most disappointing",2018-02-17,2.0,Investor Group,"- Benefits: Generally solid benefits; 401(k) match up to 4% for FT employees, fully covered healthcare for FT employees, and unlimited PTO (which given the high level of attrition and poor stock performance is the single benefit that everyone is juicing)  
- Central location near FiDi's Montgomery Station
- Did I mention PTO? This is worth mentioning again. Engineers regularly taking 3-4 weeks off at a time and some business folks are taking 8-9 weeks of PTO / year. This is unheard of in the Valley, but it's happening here at LC. Management clearly isn't happy with this trend, but with such high attrition and poor external recruiting prospects, it's cheaper to retain lazy employees with institutional knowledge than to recruit low-quality and expensive external employees with no working knowledge of the business.","- Executives: This team is pretty much at a loss for any viable long-term strategy. FinTech is a growing industry with plenty of white space growth opportunities, yet rather than invest in growth areas, this team has doubled down on the core product (Personal Loans) which is becoming commoditized by the day. There isn't enough cost-cutting in the Personal Loans business to justify a meaningful bump in stock price; LC is a penny stock, if not on the road to bankruptcy, for the foreseeable future. 
- Pay: When I joined LC, it was a high flying technology company with robust pay. At this point, it's only a shell of itself with a skeleton pay structure. This is not a place where pay will get you excited, but work/life balance and PTO may do enough to keep you satisfied. At least that's what co-workers with families tell me. 
- Attrition: Attrition here is scary high. I felt key resources were leaving by the boatload each month and I felt the walls were caving in on me. Needless to say, I was relieved when I finally left that sinking ship."

The fact that the Board allows this floundering exec team to continue is a testament to the effectiveness of the b.s. the execs feed them so the fat paychecks and RSUs continue to flow.

Nobody is happy working here specifically in operations. Zero growth opportunity and no communication between upper management and the floor. 

Turnover rate is insanely high that gives people no hope and overall moral is just low to the point where you can see people taking interview calls everywhere across the entire company. Promotion here considered as ladder move that gives no pay raise and way below the market. Giving false hopes and constant operational change make employees can’t trust a single word from the upper management anymore. All of your workflow and performance is heavily based on metrics and they hired all supervisors from retail and consumer service background that has zero knowledge and experience in financial service. All they do is scheduling one on one with you to talk about numbers and how to improve yourself Lending Club wisely and giving you “career advice” how to move to a “better” department, which I believe is just ironic and pathetic. 

HR is just another joke in this company. Aside from making fake comments and giving good reviews here. They have done nothing for the employees. Trying to make this company that cares and values your opinion in any forms and capacity they can possibly do. During your existing interview, when employees actually bringing up the issues and what can be done better, HR plays dumb and acts never acknowledged of anything that has brought to their attention many times. 

Favoritism and politics are full of every corner on the floor. Making interior move or they call “promotion” extremely difficult and management would literally pull you aside and ask you to join the newly launched product team repeatedly even after you told them you are not interested in. 

Issues listed above are just small portion of what’s going on within the company. If you want to challenge yourself mentally everyday, be my guest."

- Company moves like an old credit union rather than a tech startup
- Bureaucracy of processes and there is a lack of innovation or exciting projects that attracts tech talent

I've worked at the company for 3+ years and every day is new, unique, challenging and interesting.  I'm able to be creative on a daily basis.  Great ideas can come from anywhere -- not just from the top.  To me, LendingClub is a hybrid between a startup and a more established company, which means there is some structure but also lots of ability to think outside the box. 
- The company is full of talented people who are willing to pull together to get work done, no matter their title or job description.  Employees are dedicated to changing the way that people borrow and invest.
- It's also family friendly -- I had my first child 2 years ago while working at the company, and am expecting my second now.  The company has consistently and actively asked for my (and others moms') feedback on how to make LendingClub a great place for working moms.  Just in the last few months, they've increased their maternity leave policy, added new nursing rooms, and added a phased return to work program to help moms transition back after their leave.  Pretty awesome.","- You need to be adaptable at LendingClub.  The company is great for creative, flexible thinkers; it's much harder if you can't handle ambiguity."

I have found that the company is very transparent about current standing, initiatives, as well as the journey that they have gone to get to this point. They have shown real dedication in understanding how the current employees feel and what is important to them, and putting resources towards making improvements.

Since the departure of our  founding CEO due to scandals the morale has really lowered. The starting pay in Member Support(MS) has declined and so has the overall department. Management bases its disciplinary decisions and promotions on favoritism however there haven't been promotions due to a hiring freeze. They boast perks but the only real perks are if you work overtime, which no one is willing to due because they are so burnt out by the end of their shifts. Adherence is perhaps the worst, since our layoffs the department has been short and our call volume has been high. Adherence is a metric that measures how much time you are in production however that metric is so strict it barely allows you to take a sufficient bathroom break without being penalized. Now imagine a company where employees are chained to their desk afraid to use the bathrooms because they may loose their jobs, welcome to Lending Club. All calls are recorded and graded which is understandable due to the customer service nature, however your performance is also based on random calls that are pulled and graded. Get one bad call and its 60days before you see that score rolled out, not to mention it depends on who grades your calls and how much they like you. Your breaks are pre scheduled so if you start at 6am your lunch may be 3 hours later. If you get hungry during rest of the day you can't even enjoy all the lovely snacks that are provided because your adherence metric may suffer if you leave your desk. You Can't enjoy the massages due to adherence, you can't enjoy the nap pods due to adherence, we can't enjoy anything the company really has to offer due to being chained to our desk like slaves! if call volume is high, personal development is slowed because guess who has to cover the phones....so development isn't a prime priority here, although they advertise it to be. The positions that are open and promoted throughout the department are great, however everyone in the department is dying to leave that's 100+ qualified people fighting for limited positions.

+Building is kept clean. They are lenient on calling in sick and performance for this position.
+The personality of most of the coworkers is great
+Close to bart and many things in downtown SF","-The metrics are broken into 4 categories.  QA, Adherence,  Customer Satisfaction,  and Average Handle time. 

-QA is basically how your call is graded. The QA department picks a random call and grades it based on tone, helping the customer,  going above and beyond, etc. The fact that it's random means you can have 100 good calls and if they pick the one bad one, there goes your score. You get dinged for the smallest things, like not asking for their name instead of loan number. QAs do not seem to correlate with other metrics.

-Adherence. Basically you get to work and have a set schedule.  You don't get to choose your breaks or lunch. Have fun eating your lunch at 9:30 and not having your next break until 3 hours later. It also goes down when you depart from your schedule. It's on a 100% system. You get 93% or above and you get full points. Anything below and you start losing them. You get 30 mins for the entire day to use the bathroom, enter in notes that you didn't get in during the call, etc. The biggest problem with this metric is its not fair or efficient.  I know people with high adherence that barely take any calls in a day. Others can take double the calls they take in less amont of time, but because they did it outside their schedule, they get penalized for it. Getting rid of or reducing the metric would greatly enhance agent morale.

-Customer Satisfaction. You think in a call center where you speak directly to your customers, customer satisfaction would matter. Nope! You can be the most helpful person and have customers giving raving reviews but not have it matter because you messed up on one thing and you lost all those points you just gained on your QA! You think QA and Customer satisfaction would correlate but they dont. I have a friend who has super high QA scores but customers apparently hate him. Others get great reviews from customers but their QAs lack and that gets penalized.

-Average Handle time. A call center is mostly about volume. You have thousands of calls coming in and you need your agents to take as many as possible to avoid long hold times. You have 4:30 average to verify the borrower, find out their problem,  look through their account and documents, relay what we need to the borrower, and notate on their account. It's not as bad as it sounds but those they expect people to take fast calls and when they don't their QAs suffer. When they have longer than 4:30 they lose points for not finishing quick enough. It doesn't make much sense.

Overall the metric system is out of wack. If you want to do good according to LC, you have to never move from your desk, take quick calls but also somehow solve all the customers problems and do it in a manner that gets you high QAs. It's not realistic. Morale is at an all time low. Several good friends were laid off with no notice due to the scandal of a few top executives. The new COO even stated it's an investor driven company and borrowers are second in line."

new CEO Scott Sanborn much better than old one!  He is very engaged with the business, as he used to be COO, is incredibly knowledgable, approachable, and is much more communicative and transparent with the company at large vs his predecessor.  

Lending Club was impacted by a one-two punch of slowdown of funding capital for loans (which affected all companies in this space), followed by the scandal that you can read about in the news. this clearly set the company back from its aggressive growth goals, and sadly spurred some layoffs of underutilized people.  However the industry is still ripe for this kind of innovation, the demand from customers is there, the business model is sound, and Lending Club has nearly a $Billion in the war chest to weather any storm.  The company is regaining its footing, and i believe that it will come back a healthier, more resilient, and more balanced company than it previously was.","-recent bad events / bad press hurt the business, spurred some layoffs, and has hurt morale in some places.

597,,Stay away from this company,2016-07-12,1.0,Director,"These pros were valid few years ago.

Attractive equity, decent salary and good benefits. Work was decent and politics was minimum.

Unfortunately right now and for any foreseeable future,  I don't see any pro for this company.","Everyone knows about the scandal and it's fallout. I won't go into details of that, however I will say this, Renaud left a big void in the company and current management is not capable of filling that void. Renaud was very popular CEO, very approachable and very generous with equity distribution amongst employees. Where as current CEO and upper management managed to demoralize already down company even further within month ! They  gave themselves promotion, bonuses and additional equity after the scandal and laid off 12% of the company for cost cutting ! 

By conservative estimate, more than 90% of the current employee base is under water (as far as RSU / Option price is concerned), the management is not doing anything about it - no retention bonus / additional grants etc  for worker bees. The queen bees on the other hand are helping themselves with more cash / options. 

I worked in Technology organisation for close to 4 years and for last 2 years or so, this organisation is becoming more and more political.  There are more than 400 engineers right now and conservatively, you need only half of them (if that). I worked on financial systems which were orders of magnitude larger ( transactions / dollar amount) with teams fraction of the size of LC. There is a strong lobby of Salesforce people in the company and all they are doing is creating complexity just for the sake of growing their team, beefing up their resume. 
One SVP left soon after the scandal hit and the stock tanked and I think more will follow his lead and go back to the mothership :-) 

I am sad to say it looks highly unlikely that this company will turn around anytime soon ( if at all).  Investing is business of trust, if you lose trust, you lose business - as simple as that. 

This company wanted to be google of finance.. it has become yahoo of finance instead. Best case scenario right now is some company buys LC for its cash and the borrower base.

They are trying to borrow the tech culture from the big boys in the Bay Area (Facebook, Google, etc.) but it feels desperate and no one there buys it.  

Everyone is constantly watching the bottom line, desperate to make margins for the quarter.  They are obsessed with meeting analyst expectations each earnings.  This causes some foolish behavior like delaying necessary training b/c it costs to much.

Some of the C-suite are *terrible* managers, non-inspirational, and very into micro-management.  HR seems to turn a blind eye to this.

There is also some behavior that skirts very close to the law (see recent news on the founder/CEO's departure).

Very little dialog on diversity.  Great place if you are a white male.  Not so much if you are anything but that."

These things change lives and improve the economy. 
-Good mission: ""Transforming the financial system to make credit more affordable and investing more rewarding.""
-Fast-growing company, at the edge of an area of big change in finance. It's exciting.
-Good career opportunity. I've moved up through 4 roles in about 3 years.
-Leadership is solid. I trust the CEO. He's even-keel, listens to people, and makes smart decisions.
-Pleasant space. Lots of natural light, food. Good location in downtown SF. Some perks like massages.","-The company is growing fast, so its often encountering issues it hasn't before. It focuses a lot of building systems to support growth--vendor management, more and more compliance systems. This isn't a ""move fast and break things"" start up. Rather it's a ""execute consitently, reliably, and well"", which makes sense for a company handling people's money.

Expectations in terms how much you should work were super high. Constant overtimes, and absolutely no work-life balance. Management wants to squeeze as much juice from you as possible selling you ""the dream"" of changing world (in real life it's one of many of these companies in San Francisco which if it disappears overnight nobody even notices). It's not something you talk about loud, but everybody is aware. It's not easy for people to stay motivated receiving only very little of appreciation for working hard and watching stock going down. Speaking of lower-middle-management in technology department who works with developers directly. I've heard it's hard to hire decent talent these days in San Francisco. But is it that bad?
There were almost no any company/team events and no any budget for it. Office is open-space, supposed to be collaborative environment, really noisy all the time, a lot of people constantly ""collaborating"" by your desk. I strongly recommend to buy noise-cancellation headphones right away. There is not any work from home policy and not coming any time soon. People were trying to come up with excuses all the time explaining why they would have to work from home today like ""My wife/dog/cat is not feeling well today."" There is huge believe in new hires and hiring top talent. I think in overall my coworkers were good, but not sure about ""top talent"".

The snacks and perks are a big plus, too.","The company before and after the IPO are 2 very different companies.

Those who have displayed the right skillsets tended to be pigeon-holed unless they, too, hobnobbed the right (sometimes underqualified) cliques. There's really a rift between leadership camps within the same floor, and it has been counter-productive because agents start pleasing these ""leaders"" instead of just focusing on the work. There has been constant mistrust among the employees, and it does get pretty ""every-man-for-himself""at times.

Not to mention the fact that the product we offer is groundbreaking! 

From an employee standpoint, the company values are implemented at all stages of the operation from the newest rank and file hire, all the way up to the Executive Team.  Our leadership team is committed to the career development of it's employees and ensures they are provided opportunity to grow, whether it be within their current role/department or another  Employee feedback on day to day operational issues is heard and implemented at the senior most levels, which allows for an inclusive type employment environment that breeds for collaboration and teamwork and is fun and exciting to be a part of.  Hard work is not only recognized but rewarded and all it takes to be successful here is belief in the company we work for and the customers we serve.  The benefits are awesome and the workplace perks are second to none!

If you did you'd likely be stressed out about your manager finding out or co-workers thinking you're slacking off.","- Why do all of the positive reviews just mention free snacks and video games (that no one has time to use)  hmmmm?
- Adding human capital to address core business issues rather than leveraging best of breed technology and scaleable processes
- Iterates on product at a glacial pace
- ""No raise policy"" unless you get a new title 
- Compensation in the 50th percentile among comparable companies
- Too much middle management

Here's the deal:  Lending Club bills itself as the innovator and pioneer within the burgeoning online lending sector.  Working here you will quickly realize that it feels more like a traditional financial services company than it does an innovative and iterative fin-tech company.  I question whether or not the company is able to attract top tier engineering talent because of the nature of the product itself.  

The core product hasn't changed much in the last 12 months while headcount has grown more than 100%.  The company seems to have chosen a path of throwing more people at the problem as opposed to intelligently focusing on product development. Just look at the UI/UX for any of the loan products - I mean vector images on the website, seriously?  Charles Schwab did that in the early 90's I think.  Customer facing reps are constantly asked to get feedback regarding product improvements and then it takes the product team 6-9 months to add a single field on a web page.  

The company's client facing and internal technology strategy is completely in question.  Meaningful product changes take forever, leaving borrowers, investors and partners feeling very frustrated.  You'll constantly be told it will take a long time to replace the applications that were developed to build the business 7 years ago.  In the interim you'll take on manual processes  to support your customers, partners etc that are driven by spreadsheets and email.  It's just hard to believe...

Internally the Google app suite was replaced with MSFT and Cisco products that employees find incredibly frustrating - you're forced to work harder rather than smarter.  If you haven't experienced Office 365 before I hope you don't ever have to.  

If you're in a customer facing role you're treated like cattle - just a number.  Member Services, Loan sales, investor services, Small Business advisors.  It's always just about more calls per day, reporting back to management on everything you do and at the end of the day you're in a dead end role where you're essentially incentivized to look internally for an exit or that rare chance to move up by title and get a negligible  comp increase.  

Some of these things are well beyond growing pains.  Sr. Management needs to recognize that people have options in a strong job market (especially software engineers in the bay area)- offering mediocre compensation and RSU's isn't going to cut it.  While it's normal to expect an outflow of talent that's fully vested after 4 years, it's concerning that so many smart, accomplished people that started in the last 12-14 months are hitting the exit. 

It's just kind of funny because I think the external perspective on Lending Club is that it's one of the most amazing places to work in the city.  Again, look at the brevity of the recent positive reviews here - no substance.  When I run into colleagues in the elevators, hallways etc the consistent theme is stressed, overloaded, underpaid relative to experience, tenure etc.  

It could be so much better.   Lots of issues to solve for currently...mainly around employees feeling valued and fairly compensated for the effort."

The culture is incredibly impressive.   It starts at the top and the leadership team here exemplifies the low ego/high collaboration that fuels the company culture.

The business model is sound, and there is a huge untapped market in this space.  High growth seems inevitable given the smart and focused people here.","It's a tough niche to be in and I'm not sure the PR is happening in the right way externally.  The model is strong, the culture is unbelievably positive and the people are innovative and smart, so I'm not sure the street really appreciates the long term potential of this company in the way that becomes so apparent when you are on the inside."

From my time here, I've learned to love the company, it's culture, and the people that I'm working with. What sets Lending Club apart from other companies is that they genuinely care about my success. I have weekly one-on-one meetings with my manager and we discuss my performance on the job, if I have any questions that I would like to be answered, and we also talk about any growth opportunities. There are so many options at Lending Club when it comes to moving to a different department, but my manager really helps me break everything down and discuss any possibilities. Everyone I work with is so kind and helpful, which is something that I appreciate because I am actually excited to go into work everyday. Working at Lending Club was probably one of the best decisions I have ever made and I would recommend anyone to apply if interested,","I can't think of any cons to point out.

Everyday I am amazed by the company culture - people are constantly smiling, super welcoming, and willing to help! It's amazing that the CEO, Renaud, is putting a lot of effort into keeping this strong company culture. For example, LC just installed a Happy Hours every Tuesday - Thursday with beer and wine on tap. Every month we have a ""Hello my name is__"" so we can get to know the rest of the company. LC is growing so rapidly. it's nice seeing the other teams! 

During the orientation, they really try to drill in the mission of the company so that everyone understands that we have one common goal - it's great!

We also have a free onsite barista, free massages, spa room, manicures, sleep pods, amazing benefits, and a free gym membership!","We are growing so rapidly that it is difficult to know everyone in the company, but it's nice that there are company HHs to help us get to know the new people."

You get weekly meetings with your supervisor in which you're able to plan out career paths as well as discuss how you're doing in your position with the company. I feel so much support from all the supervisors within my department. 

The management team here truly does their best to be advocates for employees under their care. I have seen a great number of improvements since I have started my position with LendingClub. Many of these changes/improvements started out as suggestions from employees. Yes, the big people around here actually listen!

680,,Don't work here,2015-06-26,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"free snacks, barista, happy hour","There are many things wrong with this company, but I will only address the department that I have first hand experience in.
Reading the previous glowing reviews, I was also fooled into thinking that this is an amazing place to work. Don't believe the recruiters that Member Support is their picking pool for the rest of the company - moving out of this department is very difficult now. They will hire someone with no experience for the position you want before they think twice about promoting you.

I know that LC used to be great (thats where all the 5 start reviews came from), but that was before all the changes and the IPO. It is now just a machine and you're nothing but a number. 
Any 5 start reviews you're seeing now are from employees that were hired right out of College - so this is their first ""real"" job making more than minimum wage. They don't realize that this is NOT how a work environment should be.
Member Support is nothing but a call center, where you're chained to your desk all day taking call after call after call after call. 100+ calls a day is not uncommon and you only get 15 seconds between calls to wrap up - if you don't do it in enough time and go into extended wrap - that will count against your schedule adherence score - which is only 1 of the metrics they police you on. Basically going to the bathroom during a non scheduled break will also hurt your score. All your calls are recorded and you're QA'd weekly during the week, everything is very scripted and fake - you're basically expected to be a robot. They even watch your chats - say 1 wrong thing over chat to another coworker and you will be canned for it. 
Your schedule? -Subject to change, you'll either get a 6-3 shift or a 8-5. You're going to get the Saturday schedule when you start out and if you want to take the day off? Gooood luck, not going to happen - you have to find someone to switch with you - can't take Saturdays off unless its requested months in advance. Schedules change every 3 months - so making plans ahead of time is really difficult
Your cell phone? Might as well leave it at home - you're not allowed to have it even OUT during your shift, you can only use it during your 2 10 min breaks and lunch and not anywhere near your desk. 
I've never felt so terrible about a workplace before - lots of people in Ops are unhappy and they don't care - you're easily replaced by the next graduating class."

684,,Hard to recommend,2015-05-29,2.0,Account Executive,On site barista. Free snacks. Close to BART. Massage area.,"If you are rule driven and enjoy being micro managed, this is a perfect place to work.
If you like being totally scripted, down to the e-mails (only company approved templates allowed), again Lending Club is for you.
In light of the current egregious behavior by the banking industry (money laundering, fraud, etc.), the fixation with the most minor infractions - i.e. saying APR prior to saying Annual Percentage Rate- is preposterous. You will be threatened with dismissal if you make an error and say APR first.
You will also have to punch a time clock, every time you come in, leave and return for lunch, and leave for the day. 

The benefits are marginal for a tech company in SF.

690,,Credit Specialist,2015-05-06,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"1. good benefits
2. 401k
3. stock options are ok- you have to purchase them yourself. Many aren't getting paid enough to buy their options given to them.","1. Some people have more power than others, either through hierarchy or some other basis of influence.
For many people, gaining promotion is important, and this can create competition between individuals, or misalignment between the team's objectives and those of individuals within it.
Most people care passionately about decisions at work and this encourages political behavior as they seek to get their way.
Decisions at work are impacted by both work-related goals and personal factors, so there is further scope for goal conflict.
People and teams within organizations often have to compete for limited resources; this can lead to a kind of ""tribal conflict"" where teams compete to satisfy their needs and objectives, even when this is against the greater good.
2. LC call their employees “associates” or “team members.” This is a cheap way of making them feel valued without paying them.
3.LC offers free pizza parties and push company games like baseball. Forced fun is not only an insult–you’re there to work and probably have enough friends–it is a cheap way companies try to look generous.
4. There will be supervisors patrolling the lanes to monitor your progress, they’ll let you know if one hasn’t passed quality control in output by pulling you into a glass bowl. 
5. Audits are insane to meet expectations, if you MAKE 3 ERRORs on any of your loan review your FIRED! Unbelievable. 
6. Overworked and underpaid at 45k in the city of San Francisco-- with a medium income of 156k--- how can they expect anyone to support themselves. Rent alone is $2000 monthly in the city unless you decide to commute outside the city expect to dedicate your whole life to work and commuting.  Who wants to live like that??? Honestly!!"
691,,Get over yourselves,2015-05-02,2.0,Operations,"snacks, convenient to bart station.","Look.The reason why its growing fast is because all start-ups are like that after getting infused with venture capital money.  But this won't be sustainable within 3 years because it's already saturated with other P2P lending companies like ONDECK Prosper SOFI Funding Circle and more coming in.  The stock price is down 40% since it's high of 29.  This will continue to go down further when employees exercise their right to sell after 6 months restriction.  It will likely hover around $5-8 in the long run.  That's when employees will start leaving because they are there for the stock options hoping for a wealth gain, which is delusional. Good luck anyway with that dream."

Aside from loving my role and the projects I get to work on, my second favorite thing about Lending Club is the culture. The company happy hours, our summer regatta, team lunches, etc. etc. are all things I look forward to. I want to hang out with my coworkers and we do all the time!

Location is awesome. We're surrounded by great restaurants in the downtown financial district area. I take BART to work everyday and its super easy.","Like any fast moving/growing company, things change fast. Gotta keep up!"
725,,Great Place to Work and Grow Your Career,2014-10-01,5.0,Sales Associate,"Growth and opportunities: I started in member support 3 years ago when there were only 4 reps and today there are more than 60+. Today I work in sales and feel lucky that I was able to help launch the initial team of 4 and today we are around 20. Working across two groups and the opportunity to lead and grow these teams has been fun and exciting. Managers here let you take the lead and really go for it, so I've been able to grow my career and take on tasks that I didn't imagine I'd be doing at this point, while enjoying it along the way.

Learning and training: I manage the training program for my team, and new candidates frequently tell me that they are impressed with the amount of investment we have in trainings. 

Culture and Benefits: in door mini golf course, in-house cafe, multiple game rooms, unlimited snacks, pizza lunches, etc. etc. As the company continues to grow, I really like that they started doing monthly ""Hello My Name Is..."" happy hours so I can still keep a pulse on new employees in other departments and hear about what others are working on.

One of the most amazing things I've really appreciated, especially over the past months as we've seen our team grow immensely, is that top executives still know everyone's name -- tough job!","Had to think hard about this one...honestly, I can't think of anything..."
726,,"Start-up Mentality, Solid Infrastructure",2014-09-30,5.0,Client Advisor,"- flat company architecture (everyone is approachable)
- get to feel like ""the dumbest person in the room"" on a regular basis (a positive thing!)
- collaborative atmosphere with openness to new ideas
- Small Business Department is like a start-up within a fast-growing company.  We have the benefits of infrastructure with the excitement of building out a new area of Lending Club.
- rapid growth leads to developing corporate culture - it's neat to be a part of that formation
- transparency/being able to believe in what you're doing","- company is growing so fast that it's hard to get to know all of the new faces
- as a product of growth as well, training is not as consistent as it could be

It would be great to have brown bag sessions with member of the Executive Team.  Connection with senior leadership was really the only piece missing from my initial experience with Lending Club."
727,,Amazing place to work!!,2014-09-19,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Working at Lending Club is like joining a smart family. Everyone is very nice, helpful, cooperative and impressive.",The kitchen can never be stocked with enough hardboiled eggs... but can't really complain since there are so many other food options.
728,,Amazing culture and lots of growth!,2014-09-11,5.0,Member Support Representative,"In depth training, supportive teammates, fully stocked kitchen and mini golf in the office.",None that I can think of!
729,,Tremendous growth with a superstar executive team who really care about their employees.,2014-09-09,5.0,Technical Recruiter,"Professional Development:
Working at Lending Club means that I have great line-of-sight with the executive team, autonomy, and a career path tailored to my strengths, interests and goals. With the growth and senior management teams at Lending Club, I would only bored if I allowed myself. 

Growth:
It's a great time to join, and really be part of something great. If you want to be in on the ground floor of the ""next big thing,"" this is the place to be. You'll be challenged, stretched, and rewarded greatly.

Fun:
The first Thursday of every month we have an event called ""Hello, my name is ___________."" It allows time for us to mingle across the organization and talk with people we may not otherwise see. In addition to the extracurriculars, we have a piano and game room on our 2nd floor, cafe on our 11th, and on our 12th floor we have another game room plus a mini-golf course wrapping the entire floor. 

Work-Life Balance:
Weekends and evenings are mine again! I couldn't be happier with my current pace and amount of work.","Scaling:
It's hard to rate this as a con since it's the result of tremendous growth. When I joined Lending Club last year, we had less than half the current number of employees, and were still-to-acquire Springstone. Things have changed drastically since then, for the better. With all the growth, there are bound to be gaps. Some immediately apparent, and others not. Fortunately, thanks to team efforts across the board, we've scaled quickly and well. Some changes smoother than others."
730,,Best job I've ever had!,2014-08-26,5.0,Member Support Representative,"Benefits are awesome: 100% paid medical/dental, free snacks and beverages, paid gym membership, on-site barista, legit game rooms, on-site mini-golf course, and located right by BART/MUNI.

Member Support is a tremendously fun and hardworking team. We work hard and play hard. Management recognizes and rewards dedication. You come in, do well in your role, and management will work with you to develop your career path within the company. 

We're growing at an incredible pace and it's been extremely exciting to be apart of that growth.",None that I can think of
731,,Passionate team,2014-08-20,5.0,Director of Architecture,"Technology management nurtures a very passionate and engaged team. Very competitive compensation in SF Bay. Great health benefits, free health club, matching 401, and the best part is unlimited vacation policy. The vacation policy speaks volume on the trust management has on their employees in getting the job done. Performance reviews have been positive and promotions well deserved. Quality work is highly sought after and openly recognized. Some of the best people I have worked with; both management and developers.",Not all teams share the same drive for technical excellence.
732,,High School All Over Again,2014-08-20,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"They do a lot for their employees and the perks are excellent. Benefits are excellent as well, and it is located in the heart of the Financial District, so no shortage of great places to walk to on your lunch break.","The environment reminds me of high school - it seems as though they only hire a ""certain type"" of person. The working environment is way too stressful and they do not know how to delegate work loads. When I started, it was great, but the chaos sneaks up on you. I was first working 10 hour days, then 12 hour days, then 14 hours plus evenings and weekends and so on - there was no life outside of Lending Club and you are expected to work even when you are on ""vacation"". The perks and the benefits are not worth it, at all!"
733,,Living the Silicon Valley Dream,2014-08-13,5.0,Sales and Marketing,"Creating one of the most innovative and fastest growing companies in financial services is an incredible journey!  We word hard on solving interesting, challenging problems and are building up an incredible track record of success.  Lending Club's unrelenting growth puts us in very rare air, and it is very satisfying to see how your efforts and ideas can impact the company and our hundreds of thousands of customers.  

Compensation is at or above market, with a fantastic set of benefits and perks, and of course every employee is also a shareholder, which may lead to some very out-sized rewards!  Work/life balance is excellent.","To thrive here, you need to be able thrive in a fast-paced environment where change is the only constant.  Our business more than doubles each year, which means a constant flow of new problems to solve, new opportunities to conquer, and new team members everywhere you look.   Your goals and requirements can ramp up very quickly, which can be a bit of shock to those who aren't ready for it."
734,,Living the dream!,2014-08-10,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"The company is moving at lightening speed, but with a team of the most passionate and committed individuals I have ever worked with.  The CEO is grounded, real and has built a culture where employees are excited to go the extra mile.",Create career opportunities for employees.  Provide consistent communication between departments.
735,,Dreadful upper management,2014-06-11,2.0,Software Engineer,"- most of coworkers are friendly and helpful
- unlimited vacation days(but you've zero accrued if you were let go or leave)
- centrally located with good public transportation
- decent work-life balance
- competitive compensation","- so-so benefits (unless you're single)
- the engineering management team is a joke at best.  The root problems are the VP's who care only for themselves.  You need to watch your back.  Every day.  Your job is to please them or read their minds, and not the tasks at hand
- some amount of nepotism
- if you have a lousy manager and/or scrum master, you're toasted as the blame will land on you somehow
- very poor communication among teams and certainly no clear directives from management until it's too late and then some poor soul would be the scapegoat."
736,,Rocket ship,2014-06-08,5.0,,"-business doubling and tripling every year
-truly terrific management (and I am hard to convince)
-good, informal culture","Can be chaotic.  We are doing a lot of things at the same time, which takes getting used to"
737,,Exciting opportunities and so much to learn,2014-04-22,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"I recently joined Lending Club (less than 3 months ago) and have been amazed at how many different opportunities there are within the company. Coming from a larger company in my previous job, the growth is extremely energizing and that energy permeates each of the 4 floors. There are so many different types of expertise, everyone I meet has something I can learn from them and they are very open to teaching.","There are so many new people joining all the time which is great but I wish there was a more standardized way to get introduced to new people who join, especially in other parts of the company."
738,,Worst place I've worked at,2014-04-10,1.0,,Free snacks. Cafe with a barista on site.,"Was  laid off (over the telephone) after a few weeks for a very vague reason: ""No cultural fit"". Somehow, though, I had made it through the on-site interview with six individuals, including a C-level exec. There was a bright red flag on my first day: People were wondering where a certain individual was, and someone's answer was that the individual no longer worked there because of ""no cultural fit"". 

Note: A few days before I was laid off, I had a 1-1 with my manager, and there was no mention whatsoever of any issue. 

Oddly, HR indicated that they would not contest an unemployment claim. Yet, when the State of California called them to verify, incredibly there was no record of my employment. Even if this is an innocent mistake, this reflects very badly on the company. You'd think that a financial company which will probably go IPO at some point would do better in handling records."
739,,Best job I've ever had in terms of satisfaction!,2014-04-05,5.0,Credit Specialist,"Company is very modest about the achievements already earned, and everyone there is thankful to be a part of it.  It seems as if all the workers are on the same page in terms of our purpose, and each worker is working hard to accomplish even more.  The work environment consists of very smart and creative people.  Due to the nature of the company still being considered in the start-up phase (I think its in its growth stage), even though it is operating in its seventh year, it encourages new ideas, and requires workers to rely on each other to navigate the sometimes new and difficult obstacles that are encountered in daily tasks.

The compensation is competitive, and no one has yet openly complained about the wages or benefits.  Free Club One membership, 401k plan, full health benefits, paid time off.

Amenities mimic that of a start-up with on-site ping pong table, foosball, shuffleboard, 9-hole putting course,  and cornhole available for employees to use anytime during work hours, and even after work hours.  On-site Barista who makes complimentary drinks.  Complimentary snacks including beef jerky, chips of all sorts, red bull, sodas, bagels, fruits, hummus, etc.","After three months, nothing yet....."
740,,Riding on the Rocket Ship,2013-12-11,5.0,Sales,"Pre-IPO company, incredible innovation, hip and constantly improving culture, insanely smart and motivated people, unbelievable product that ACTUALLY helps other people, growing like crazy and hiring good, good people, very strong management team that is very transparent with employees.","If you don't like working hard, this isn't the place for you. Crazy growth obviously has difficult gaps in communication and makes getting stuff down harder sometimes. Overall, it's great."
741,,Amazing place to be a part of,2013-10-11,5.0,Technical,"-Company is growing like CRAZY
-Sr. Management just gets it.  Smart, focused professional team

Management is amazing and they are extremely competent and open to hear what you have to say as well as support you. Working in downtown SF is a great perk, along with the stocked kitchen. There is no ""stuffiness"" here, just hard working people who are working together to help LC succeed.","I can't really think of any cons. Not really a con, but it would be great to have an all company meeting, maybe every quarter or so."
744,,Amazing opportunity to be a part of the next wave of startup successes,2013-06-25,4.0,Business Manager,"- Overall company is very transparent
- Seems like every week there's some new company development; as an employee you feel proud of the company and vested
- Renaud is an awesome CEO and a visionary
- The business is on the up and up","- Some ""old guard"" employees can be hard to work with
- Some groups are clique-ish
- Sink or swim: not much employee development or outreach; all depends on your immediate manager"
745,,Very positive environment,2013-04-27,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Very decent people work there. 
Very little negativity, there is practically no such thing as telling on somebody to get in a better position yourself.
Lots of possibility for growth.","They have 401K plan, but don't match it"
746,,Chance to be a part of something special,2013-04-19,5.0,Marketing,"Many companies talk about reshaping an industry, but Lending Club is one of the select few that is actually achieving this lofty goal.  Growth comes in monthly leaps that just seem to keep accelerating, leading to ever-larger opportunities.  While every company talks about scale, we really (have to) mean it, which leads to an intriguing focus on how do we keep more efficient and do bigger things.  Working here is definitely a chance to be a part of something special.

Overall, company is stocked with really great people working towards a common goal.  Surprisingly good work/life balance and plenty of opportunities to make friends.","With rapid growth can come rapid change, which can be turbulent.  Your role and expectations can be radically different every six months - the bar keeps getting higher - but that generally leads to bigger and better opportunities for those who are willing to step up and do more.  If you're looking for a job where you punch in, make your widgets and then punch out, this is not the place for you you."
747,,Interesting Workplace,2013-04-09,5.0,Specialist,"It's a tad different than a ""bank"". There aren't impossible expectations here. Even better, it's easy to make friends here. The happy hours are fun and people are willing to hang out after work. It's not the same  'cold professionalism' you'd see at other places. You can confide in people. 

Management is good for the most part. They seem to avoid, at all costs, pushing the tenseness of growth/sturcturation on their employees. This is not a bad thing. They are functionally your advocates.  

It's a good working environment for people with cool demeanors.  Regardless, if you work hard you will see growth. The company affords many opportunities, you just need to be patient.","Sometimes things aren't too clear, but that comes with any start-up. There are growing pains and formal processes are being established. Changes can be a bit mystic for many."
748,,Awesome Place to try ideas,2013-02-11,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Visionary leadership, really smart executive team, and a willingness to try new ideas makes this an awesome place to work. The culture is fun and energetic, they pay 100% of medical, have free gym membership, pay well, and plenty of opportunity to make contribution and be visible. The business model is disrupting an old existing business with technology, which provides a worthwhile calling as well.","This is a great place to work, having a hard time coming up with anything negative to say. Ideally we would have free lunch and dinner, but the snacks are high quality."
749,,Game changer,2013-01-22,4.0,Product Manager,"Well managed company, excellent board of directors, rapid growth, fast paced environment, great people, interesting problem space, happy hour culture,  rewarded for your effort, always being talked about in the news, close to home","There aren't many Con's, just the natural 'growing pains' that come from working at a well-managed company hitting hockey-stick growth: Long hours, always running out of space, not enough time to do everything we need to"
