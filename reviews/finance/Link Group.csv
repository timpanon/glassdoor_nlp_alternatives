Worked in more gossipy workplaces but never one where it stems so much from upper management. Too often confidential and sensitive information being leaked for no professional reason.

Gaslighty environment where management routinely guilt and blame staff for unachievable targets, unsustainable portfolio sizes and work allocation practices that lack transparency.

Team leaders on 140k a year to do no work or provide any tangible benefits to the project. Just former workcover headkickers with dated mentalities.

Wage theft routinely occurs. Always a changing reason for why you're doing 60 hrs a week and not being compensated appropriately."

134,Link Group,One of the worst out there,2021-09-23,1.0,Analyst,Really nothing much worth mentioning,"Micromanagement in TA from Senior mgmt and throughout AML team supervisors and assistant mgmt & managers worst in the industry. No consideration for worker wellbeing, they ask you to declare you're fully healthy before commencing work as they know the job is high stress low reward type that leads to burnout. Work done is never enough, and managers will do their best to give you all talk and zero support.

Salary is secretive and senior TA mgmt has made it clear that discussing pay is unprofessional (?) which really goes to say that they lowball wherever they can and that Ozzie owners like to keep expences as tight as humanly possible.

A lot of talk of progress and development but this is really non-existent.

IT support is truly one of the worst, on the level of bottom feeders (which Link basically is). IT professionals are extremely unprofessional, more like ""bouncers on steroids"" type of attitude and will rarely acknowledge their errors for PC that are outdated by 10 years at least.

Coffee break are frowned upon, just like work socialising and clicky obnoxius mgmts/sups will really errode any professionalism that a person might bring.

In short Link culture is toxic throughout and there is no way around it - best advice is run asap - plenty of great and even amazing companies out there that have culture and much more than lip service."

Staff took pay cuts during COVID with promise it would stop redundancies from happening, then Link announced they were offshoring majority of Leeds office to Mumbai.
Delayed offering redundancy pay whilst they dragged out the “consultation” period which resulted in most of workforce finding better jobs and leaving anyway.
Poorly managed projects being rushed over the finish line and pointless retrospectives as same issues arise time and time again.
People getting roles with no skills or experience, then no training or progression plans to get them up to speed.
No progression! Company goes on about “investing heavily in employees globally by providing great career progression and training opportunities, working environment and employee benefits”, but the company don’t care at all about their employees as evident with offshoring to Mumbai.

Nobody can do their job properly as no proper training is provided to anybody. 

You are bombarded with work as soon as you start the job, not given any chance to learn the ropes. 

I read all the bad reviews before accepting the job and put it down to people only writing a review if they’ve had a bad experience. Now I know the reviews were a true reflection of what it’s like here. I’ve spoken to people who have worked here a long time and nobody has a good word to say.

They also promise they’re going to put you through the IOC course and give you a pay rise when you complete it. It’s a scam, nobody has this qualification here. I think they just put it in the adverts to make you think the job might have prospects.

There is a culture of incompetence at the company. Other colleagues when asked for help, either ignore you or are unhelpful. I honestly think it’s because nobody is very good at the job due to lack of training.

Workloads are crazy as every department appears to be understaffed. Instead of getting more people in, they’ll just keep allocating you work that they know you won’t even be able to do for a month because your workload is so high."

Dreadful training not actually including the majority of information you will need, as someone said below trainers have no idea on what the actual job entails. When you ask for help on something you haven’t been trained on, you will just be told to refer to your training (?) 

Utterly toxic environment. Micromanagement is extreme, every single task is timed and monitored all day every day including toilet breaks. Management display blatant favouritism. Be prepared for backstabbing and bullying from colleagues who will complain how busy it is but find time to report you for the smallest of mistakes. 

No regards for the welfare of staff and your mental health will nosedive - but don’t worry, you’ll be given a PowerPoint on mental health whilst Link continue to increase workload and do nothing about it.

-Local location.
(It says 'you must enter at least 5 words for pros' to submit a review so just ignore this line.)","I'm not sure where to start with Link in Beckenham but I'm going to try to keep it short, I'm a positive person & always make the best of any job opportunity but some of what I have witnessed at this company should honestly be on an episode of Dispatches or something of that sort - where a thorough investigation into the inhumane and mistreatment of employees should take place. I can safely say every single person who has worked or works here has had their mental health and well-being affected in some way, most signed off as a result. 

There is so much I can say but I'm just going to write a few main pointers, at the start of the pandemic, we were told we had to take 10 days enforced annual leave 'to preserve employment' and avoid redundancies, and then a few weeks after this was taken, Tim Gillman made us all redundant anyway. 

There have been multiple examples of employee negligence including working conditions being in the cold and dark where everybody was sitting in their coats due to no heating, no lights and too many times to count where there has been no hot water etc. 

On another note, if you work here for 10 years, they give you a £25 M&S voucher, I think that speaks for itself. 

Anyhow, the fake hierarchy here is wild, I genuinely can't grasp the concept of how these managers - all straight, white, middle-aged men with no emotional intelligence, understanding or compassion sleep at night. 

I think one of the saddest parts is seeing the life sucked out of genuinely good people as a result of working at Link.

While one may join LinkGroup hoping for experience in an enterprise environment that talks about building it's people, you will find it runs like a series of small businesses loosely held together by management without a strategic vision. There is no real management of business or customer expectations at a senior level, so you can expect to be constantly having to meet contradictory standards without support from senior management.

Free toilet paper","No car parking space unless you’re a senior manager. No bonus unless you’re a senior. Offices for seniors only. Laptops, flexible working and home working just for seniors. Healthcare for seniors only. Even nights out that are just for seniors. The hierarchy is sickening. 

Mostly you have to develop yourself as your line manager will either be too incompetent or selfish to develop you, or if it’s one of the better ones they’ll be too bogged down with trying to keep the ship afloat and the fires out 

The pay is appalling. Staff at the low level are on close to minimum wage. Despicable when you consider what’s expected - we’d be better off working in a supermarket. Pay increases for internal promotions are unfairly capped, so an internal person with good experience who’s shown loyalty and has put the effort in to work their way up can never earn the externally advertised salary for the job they will do. External recruits who lack relevant experience and are often of a poor caliber earn the most. This results in resentment and staff feeling devalued, so most of the talented people have been leaving in droves. All the money seems to be spent on the new system which has been coming forever but doesn’t seem to actually work. God knows how much money must have been wasted on that. 

The bonus structure is also limited to more senior staff, and even then I’ve heard that those who get bonuses and or commission have them unfairly slashed because whilst they may have met their targets, somewhere else in the group hasn’t and it’s all about meeting those numbers for the big wigs. 

They say there’s progression but what they’ve actually done is taken what little there was away.  No more senior administrator role and no more team leader, so how are you supposed to progress? If you apply for the supervisor role you’re told you don’t have the right experience. It’s all designed to try to keep the workers plodding along and knowing their place. We were told in a big announcement that there would be bands or levels we could progress through and earn more money but that was ages ago and all that’s happened since is that levels were taken away. What do they expect you to do but leave? Nobody can afford to live on the administrator salaries unless they live with their parents, so you end up with a workforce of naive 18 year olds (mostly just earning a bit of money for drinking  until they work out what they actually want to do with their lives, or saving up to go travelling) with anyone a bit older and wiser having to find other work so that they can make rent. Some people were working an extra bar job on the side just to cover it. 

Senior level management have some appallingly out-dated views and ways of behaving. They’re self serving bullies who care about nothing more than meeting targets set by group to get their big fat bonuses. There’s definitely an old boys’ club at the top, although hopefully the new CEO may be a step in the right direction towards addressing this. Possibly the people in Australia are waking up about what’s going on and that’s prompted them to hoof out the sleazy salesman cowboy that’s been running the show for far too long. Even his teeth were fake. However, he’s not the only one who needs to go, and the new CEO won’t be able to make changes with the current stuffy old (white male) board in place. A tip for you Suzan - don’t trust any of them, replace them all. 

There are also some incredibly lazy and useless senior individuals coasting along and doing nothing to improve business, staff wellbeing etc. It’s time for a clean out at those higher levels and to assess what each of these people is actually bringing to the table. There are some senior people who I believe do care and really work hard, but sadly they’re in the minority amongst the lazy, egotistical majority of “ManCo”. Some people have a caring line manager who wants to make a change and is bothered about their staff, but all too often their efforts are demeaned by those above, or the pay rise they’ve requested for you is denied by the FD. Managers are really just puppets for the seniors, so even the good ones can’t make a difference even when they want to, so usually they wise up quickly and jump before they’re pushed. 

HR is incredibly biased towards the senior management. Grievances are not dealt with fairly and many staff are too afraid to speak up because of the backlash. Recently more and more people are taking the brave step to raise a grievance but these are never heard independently, so another biased senior manager will just find a way to resolve in the  company’s favour. The only real recourse for staff is to take things to a tribunal. 

The business only pays lip service to mental health - the number of staff going sick with stress is shocking, and nothing is done about it. Even when multiple people from the same team were being signed off with stress, the employees were blamed, rather that the business looking at the root cause. It was so sad to see friends go through it. I think it will take multiple tribunal cases before any changes are actually made. 

Staff at most levels are so demotivated. They’re not paid well, there’s not a clear and fair progression structure in place for them and they’re not properly valued, motivated or developed. This has led to a really terrible negative culture with high levels of absenteeism, confirmed stealing, fouling of toilets and other nefarious activities best not mentioned here.

Capita was an awful company to work for, and when Link took over I think a lot of people held out hope that things would change and improve. Essentially it’s all the same, mostly because the senior management are still the same old white men with backwards attitudes to women, ethnic minorities, mental health, LGBT issues etc. I genuinely feel sorry for the staff who still work here. Leaving is the best career move I’ve ever made. I’m so much happier, more motivated and less stressed. Without exaggeration, escaping this place has changed my life for the better. 

I also just want to add, that many would take reviews on this site with a grain of salt and would say that there’ll always be disgruntled employees in any work place. Generally I think that’s fair, but having read through a lot of the reviews here for the Beckenham and Huddersfield offices, I can confirm that they’re a true reflection of what’s going on.  

The latest in the sorry saga for the people still working there is the response to COVID-19. Classing themselves an essential business and still forcing staff to turn up for work and risk infection. Oh and another slap in the face? Everyone has to give up 10 days of holiday by June so the group can make its numbers. Already taken 10 days off? That’s okay, they’ll take 10 from what you have left, or if you don’t have 10 remaining, they’ll knock it off next year. Criminal."

Pay is below market value and pension is statutory minimum.
Annual pay increases are 2% (below inflation)
Pay rises higher than 2% not given to staff unless you are considered a 'flight risk' so loyal staff lose out.

If you do get a promotion the increases will be to below market rate (but if they have to hire externally they will pay more...) so generally speaking if you complete a qualification its almost always financially better to just leave after your training recovery period ends."

My senior management were good and would listen to my input but their hands were tied by the bureaucracy of higher up. Therefore the changes we suggest were not implemented.","What you are expected to do and your work load is ridiculous. An example of the impact this is having is the number of members of management being signed off due to stress which it does not appear that much is being done to manage this issue. Mental health should not be taken lightly and needs to be addressed. 
What you do compared to what you are paid is ridiculous. After I was promoted I never reached the full pay rise I was promised. Then a year and a half later when I handed in my notice they said they would try and match what my new employer would be paying me. To which I pointed out I never reached the first amount what made them think I would agree to stay on that basis. 

Unsustainable brain drain all of the best people are leaving because nothing is done to encourage them to stay. The company has a reactive mentality they just react to people handing in their notice and promising the world to get them to stay; rather than being proactive and identifying who they want to keep and providing them with incentives to stay.

Good thing the food court is close by for all that comfort food you’ll need.,"Abhorrent management. Double standards, favouritism nasty surprises, nasty looks and public berating will usually greet you before 10am. 

If management like you, you can and will get away with anything even at the expense of other members of the team. In all likelihood, you’ll be promoted and you won’t even need to apply. Transparency is non existent. The goal posts narrow regularly and salary is rubbish. You’ll make more money working in almost any other job and will have at least 5x the motivation. 

Don’t ever call in sick for any reason short of loosing a limb. Don’t ever tell them why you’re sick- they’ll use that against you. 

Humiliation tactics are frequently used and are also used publicly. Nothing like belittling an employee in front of the team to build morale, stroke the management ego and motivate the rest of the team to keep in line. So don’t ever make a spelling mistake.

The recent change of ownership has reinvigorated the business; it has the benefits of an established business but the ambition of a start up. There is a real desire for growth and for staff to contribute to and share in this growth.

I love the variety in my job on a day to day basis. I enjoy working in a collaborative environment with intelligent, motivated people.","Link Asset Services is going through a period of rapid change following its recent sale. If you are excited by being in a business that is transforming itself to be more customer centric, agile and scalable, it is a great place to be, but change does come with a level of uncertainty. There is a robust people agenda alongside the transformation programme but if you don't like change, LAS is probably not for you."

Made laughable by being forced to wear mission statement titles of qualities of behaviour that if used by management would make a better working environment 

Obsessed with numbers and stats. No true focus on customer experience. All about keeping up appearances as company does admin for other super entities. Often they lose business due to poor management.

Promoting people who are lacking experience compared to others with more purely because of their ability to never rock the boat and challenge ridiculous goals that set up definite failure to staff. You can go a long way by always saying yes in the current culture.

Pay for what you do is insulting. Management will micromanage everything you do and never say hello in the morning or goodnight in the afternoon. Some management think it'd beneath them to interact with staff as they ""think"" they are better."

- They used to have monthly awards in the contact centre but they scrapped that so now there is no recognition.
- Rewards mostly those who have no problem solving /decision making abilities, unfortunately these people become leaders; not all leaders/coaches/seniors were terrible, some were exemplary.

711,Link Group,3 years -> put my heart and soul to my job but was driven out by the TL for raising a valid question.,2017-07-25,1.0,Customer Service Officer,One of the best system I have ever worked with.,"There are just so many but let's go with the 5 cores value of Link Group.

Teamwork: There's no teamwork when the team leader only favour the suck up and promote the people they like. It just split the team in half (the do as you told VS the do your job right). I am sure you can see who the winner is right?

Integrity: Honesty is the best policy!! (WRONG not here) raise an honest question at the CEO meeting in this place and you'll get pull out and get put down to your place with their intimidation tactic (let's find something (just whatever) and put them on a performance improvement).

Commitment: Well you can be committed to your role and your job but at the end of the day I can tell you, Link Group will treat you as just another number. The moment the CEO has decided to let workplace bully becomes a norm that's when you know all of the time you spent learning, progressing to be better with this company is going nowhere.

Professionalism: They expect everyone to be professional but they themselves do not. The practice - if you promise to call someone back or get back to them about something - DO IT - whether it's good or bad news (be professional. This practice here does not apply to HR or people closer to the top. This place promise alot but doesn't deliever.

Respect:  Respect works both way: For someone to respect you, you will need to respect them as well ( treat people how you would like to be treated). I've lost all respect for this place the moment the CEO decided to look up when there's workplace bully down below."

KPI's are set yearly yet everybody knows they cannot be measured due to non existent or incorrect reporting. Still, employees have to complete mid year and end of year reviews and ""measure"" their performance (as well as be measured) on said ""KPI's"".
So called team leaders are bullies who run the contact centres like sweatshops. They don't understand basic call centre metrics and are promoted on the basis of their subject matter expertise (superannuation). 
Bullying, harassment and self-promotion are prevalent and HR does not act.
I feel sorry for the company's clients who pay a lot of money to Link yet their members are treated very badly.
No bonuses for frontline staff yet CEO pays herself three quarters of a million $ in bonus.
