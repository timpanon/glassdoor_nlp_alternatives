0,,Product Owner in Wealth Tech Group,2022-04-14,4.0,Vice President,Managers sincerely care about comfort and job growth,The tech side is very immature in new SDLS processes
1,,Traditional Bank,2022-04-14,3.0,Anonymous Employee,"Great team work, lots of help","The pay is substantially low. They are based in Buffalo and do not fully understand the cost of living in other cities that are significantly larger. Also, lack of diversity even though they say it is important to them. It was discouraging not seeing people who look like me in true positions of power."
2,,Good place to work,2022-04-14,5.0,Branch Manager,A lot of opportunities to grow your career.,"Low pay, and the new compensation plan is group graded not individual."
3,,My experience,2022-04-14,2.0,Lock Box Operator,Co-workers were nice but older crowd,Work flow was heavy and uninvited
4,,Great,2022-04-13,5.0,Vice President,Great culture and atmosphere. Management cares.,Could use more pay but not bad.
5,,Great company,2022-04-12,5.0,Loan Officer Assistant,Great communication between management and amazing benefits,the pay could be better
6,,Great company to work for,2022-04-11,5.0,Analyst,"Benefits, time off, relaxed career growth","Pay, lack of industry standard for compensation"
7,,Good Job,2022-04-10,5.0,Credit Analyst,Great work life balance and awesome people,Slower upward mobility compared to other places
8,,It is a great bank to work for,2022-04-09,5.0,Senior Relationship Banker,"I don’t know how M&T hires great people but definitely most of the employees are kind and great to work with. I love the culture and the volunteer options, with 40hours volunteer pto.",M&T is expanding at the moment (PUB) and there are some system/ technical issues every day that makes it harder to complete my job but hopefully it will be solved soon.
9,,Do NOT work here,2022-04-08,1.0,Management Associate,None at all this place was horrible,"Not only is there a blatant disregard for people of color but the pay is horrible and the way the company treats you is even worse. They over work you and constantly add more and more for you to do at the same pay. They do not want to see any progress in terms of climbing up the latter for branch employees. They are also careless about employee health, I got Covid from working with an employee who clearly had Covid but they refused to let him stay home until his positive results came back. Oh and they don’t pay you for being out bc of Covid you need to use your pto or not get paid."
10,,Everyone experience is different,2022-04-08,3.0,Anonymous Employee,The only good thing was the Stock purchase program I participated in and cashed out when I left and 401k.,"The branch level is tremendously daunting and the managers don’t care if you’re overworked, that goes beyond just the branch mgr district as well. The turnaround rate is ridiculous because they pay pennies in raises."
11,,Low pay,2022-04-08,3.0,Vice President,Decent work life balance. Good PTO.,Managers have no control over compensation. You will be underpaid.
12,,Great company culture; low salaries,2022-04-06,3.0,Group Leader,Generous vacation days & bank holidays off. Great culture to work in. Nice flexible work accomodations (i.e. 4 day work weeks). 401k match up to 5%.,Low salary as compared to competitors. Often an employee would have to get an offer from another company before M&T considers adequate compensation. Health insurance is average at best. Only option is a high deductible plan; one bright spot is M&T does contribute to an HSA plan.
13,,Horrible,2022-04-06,1.0,Legal Document Analyst,Absolutely none at all. There is a minimum of five words.,I was micromanaged doing the most mindless simple tasks imaginable. My job honestly shouldn't have even existed.
14,,Unsatisfactory,2022-04-05,1.0,Assistant Vice President,"401k match exists, health insurance is good.","Neither location nor facilities are desirable enough to force talent to succumb to working in office 3x per week. Not all floors are renovated, which should have been a higher priority when people were working remotely. Safety in the downtown Buffalo area is a glaring issue, myself and other women in my department have had issues just arriving to work, getting coffee or lunch. Diversity is a flop. Expect the top achievers and speakers at events to be white and male. At my most recent departmental meeting and my coworkers and I all laughed. There were 9 men and 1 woman. This is the case at every departmental meeting, I would not exaggerate this. Meager 401k match at 5%. I am a woman working as an AVP and I earn 40,000.00 per year and a $900 average bonus per year. You can compare the stats on that. They also are not hiring quickly enough to deal with the great resignation and you can expect to pick up the slack. Stop asking for so much feedback if you aren’t interested in actionable responses. Need to improve upon benefits and salaries. Gender pay gap is a massive issue."

29,,Not immune to the great resignation,2022-03-28,4.0,Anonymous Employee,Investing a lot in Buffalo. Good hybrid flexibility and salary.,Results vary by team and manager. Eliminating or making it impossible to work fully remote has lead to a great brain train of talent.
30,,overall good,2022-03-27,5.0,TDP Software Engineer,most people are friendly and helpful,"will have in-person work, no mask required"
31,,Identity Crisis,2022-03-27,3.0,Cybersecurity Analyst,Decent work-life balance depending on team/department. Some flexibility with hybrid work.,"M&T is trying to act like an early-2000s Silicon Valley company since the hiring of their current CTO. This both does not fit their business model (most of the Bank are not software developers…) and is leading to decisions about staffing and workplace environments that have been proven to be ineffective over the past two decades. In my opinion, these changes have come at the expense of the bank’s previous focus on family/life balance and has reversed what used to be some of the best retention in the industry."
32,,Disappointed,2022-03-25,3.0,Senior Software Engineer II,Fellow employees were good to work with.,"Moved to Agile methodology to manage our work load. Too many rules and restrictions placed on us by IT management on how to implement. We were told the we could make adjustments as a team to make it work for us. However, 
any suggestion we made was shot down. Made it increasingly difficult to do our job."
33,,Love it,2022-03-25,5.0,Accountant,"Best management I’ve ever had in a workplace with an amazing and supportive team. Good benefits, great PTO and flexible work environment.",Upper management views on return to office policies aren’t the greatest and don’t always seem to make sense. The complaints and worries about the Return policies from many people seem to get swept under the rug.
34,,Avoid like the plague.,2022-03-24,1.0,Anonymous Employee,I see none. I’ve had two really bad experiences with this company. Really bad vibe overall with too many red flags to ignore.,At the end of the day it’s a regional bank with a provincial reach. It’s not really a place to grow a career.
35,,Great place to work,2022-03-22,5.0,Senior Vice President,One of the best places I’ve ever worked.,Less flexible on remote work than most companies.
36,,Community Branch Management Program- not worth it unless you want to be stuck in retail banking for 1+ years,2022-03-22,2.0,Branch Trainee,Exposure to senior management; learn skills right after finishing college,"Program is disorganized; you’re essentially a glorified retail banker and they use emotionally manipulative tactics to make you stay as a retail banker and then a branch manager as long as possible. Dealing with mean and rude customers is awful for your mental health. . Other parts of the bank do not care about the retail bank. You work many hours a day, doing cold calls and seeing customers. I believe this program was created to fill in the gaps created by a mass-exodus of relationship bankers at the beginning of the pandemic. The bank did not take care about their retail bankers then (or even now really), taking away hazard pay and extra sick leave days only a few months after the pandemic began. We were told if we apply to other parts of the bank, we will be “terminated” if we do not get an offer from them within 90 days. The bank pushes aggressive sales goals under the cover of “relationship building” and “prioritizing customer relationships” while encouraging you to “meet customer needs” (aka sell a customer a big loan they don’t need)."
37,,Portfolio Manager,2022-03-21,3.0,Vice President,Nice people and some flexibility,No leadership or guidance in the position. Blocked when tried to move to other parts of the bank.

44,,Great For Personal Growth,2022-03-15,5.0,Senior Business Analyst,"There has never been a moment where I have been turned down trying to reach my fullest potential at M&T. It's a welcoming environment where everyone has some time to answer questions over coffee or lunch. As far as personal growth, M&T seeks to help its employees become the best version of themselves.","Newer employees don't get compensated very well. Usually, it takes a career commitment (>7 years) to the bank before a competitive salary arrives.

While the company is still making strides in this department, offering up a new innovation or way of doing things can still get met with heavy pushback in favor of the more traditional way. Not to say nothing changes, but it does feel slower than you would like."

46,,Tech hub tunnel vision,2022-03-12,3.0,Analyst,"Generous PTO. In a short time with paid holidays, you'll be receiving 35 paid days of time annually. Growing through acquisitions. Solid diversity program that makes people of all backgrounds feel welcome and included. Good 401(k) program. Great co-workers and some very good team leadership. Solid business model and generally just good people.","If you are in technology and want to work remotely, look elsewhere. M&T is all in on a new tech hub in downtown Buffalo, saying it will attract technologists from all around the country. Given our weather and high taxes along with increasing remote work opportunities, good luck with that! However, if you like commuting to a downtown high-rise open office, this could be a good choice."

53,,Fantastic Company,2022-03-07,5.0,Relationship Banker,"There is plenty of growth potential for promotions within your role as well as countless opportunities to go to different roles in other parts of the bank.

Branch staff is really good and supportive, team atmosphere. Upper management is supportive and there are numerous times when they recognize staff.

I feel I make a difference every day while also growing my own skills and expertise and advancing to the goals that I have for myself.

Incentive plan allows you to get anywhere from $300-$2000 per quarter as long as you hit required minimums to be eligible, usually you can get at least $300 a quarter.

CEO and board of directors run the bank very well and always let people know what is going on.

PTO is extremely generous and benefits are good, also 401k match is dollar for dollar up to 5% which is great. Once you get your foot in the door and work for a year or two or get a promotion, the pay raises start to add up quickly and you can job in your pay fast assuming you put in the work and grow your skills.

Depends on the branch how many Saturdays you work but generally it is 1 a month and you get a half day during the week to compensate.","The pay you start at might be a bit lower than you were hoping for but once you work for a year or two and become successful and get yearly raises or promotions, you very quickly get a salary you feel comfortable and confident in.

If you aren't good at customer service, getting complaints, being open to suggestions and ways to improve and learn, you will struggle."

75,,A very disorganized enviorment,2022-02-23,2.0,Loss Mitigation Underwriter,"Work from home.
Flexible work schedule.",From the beginning of my employment the process was very disorganized. I was asked to take apart of a temp project due to low volumes in the role I was hired for. I was lied to and told that it was going to be temporary and it ended up being a majority of my tenure at M&T. I was assigned with a manager that was not equipped to lead a team and did not have a deep understanding of the roles we were doing. The blind leading the blind is the best way to describe it. They do not hesitate to hand out PIP (action plans) and pretend that it's not a big deal when they are just setting you up to fail. If I knew that's this temporary project was going to be apart of my job duties I would've passed on the job. Also for a bank they have some of the worst health insurance out there. Very high deductibles and copays and to me that says a lot about how much they care for their employees.
76,,Good company,2022-02-22,4.0,Portfolio Manager,Good company. Good benefits. High cost though. High deductible plan and high premium which is the biggest negative. Overall good company and I have had a meaningful career here.,Executive management is old fashioned and refuse to adapt to the changing times. Leadership and communication lack at times.

Bank is really stuck in its ways"
83,,Engineering Nightmare,2022-02-17,1.0,Self Employed,federal holidays and 401k match,"This place is awful for engineers. Software engineering, database, networking, anything tech, it is as bad as one could imagine. The collective mindset of management at all levels hates technology despite what they advertise. MTB regularly goes to length to either sabotage and stop any and all progress or just do nothing to pass the time. The amount of employees in management who collect pay that do literally nothing is baffling. All the ""great"" reviews on here are from people not in the technology trenches, the ones who do nothing so of course it's great. Those are the people who do not understand therefore inherently hate technology and hold strong the toxic culture of warding off newcomers with new ideas because it stirs up attention. Dig for the engineering reviews here because this place is truly horrible and every single engineer I have met here has either already left or is planning to leave and yes they all share this exact sentiment. If you want to ""manage"" and do nothing and lie up the chain about what you are planning to do, great! If you are a talented engineer, run!"

- Other departments in the bank seem to be much more fun and healthy. Unfortunately, some of the leadership in this department and in CAM were not good at managing people.","- Management was aweful. They would regularly make up their own policies that did not align with the banks policies. For instance, being 1 minute late was penalized. No leeway for bad weather or accidents (was told I need to use PTO for 10 minutes late after a massive snowstorm). 

- Management would regularly bad mouth people on the floor who were not present within earshot of other employees. 

- Extremely reluctant to allow anyone to work remotely especially during the height of the pandemic. I was told in the beginning I would be able to work remotely and was not allowed to. 

- Coworkers in the department regularly tried to throw others under the bus to get ahead or tattled on each other for minor mistakes.

- Reviews and promotions didn't seem to be merit based but more based upon personal relationships between management and their employees."

105,,Stay far away,2022-02-07,1.0,Senior Technical Engineer,"Leaving really provides inner peace after being in such a dysfunctional environment. But you can skip that step completely by following what so many others have already reiterated. Sometimes the best thing about a job is when you leave. Feel free to look at other recent reviews from technology too they are very revealing.

But if you are looking for a cult like environment that is out of touch with reality you will feel right at home. If you enjoy paying for parking or commuting to a fancy office tower to feel good about yourself, They provide gimmicks of all kinds(free food) to attract employees to the office that a small minority is interested in working at. But why even listen to surveys and what the employees want if it goes against your cults mission. Management can and will manipulate you when it's in their best interest. Warning: This is especially prevalent when you are revealing blatant truths about others incompetency in their job. They will bully you and belittle you to put you down it's definitely standard practice. As they need something to make up for their lack of competence and feel better about themselves at the expense of others.","Toxic environment 
Out of touch leadership
Incompetence tolerated and promoted to the highest degree
Old boys club alive and thriving
Bullying, undermining, manipulation all common practice
Technical debt from years of poor leadership that continues to build
Incompetency is promoted and celebrated, as long you are a professional bootlicker.

128,,Know what you're getting into,2022-01-23,2.0,Senior Applications Developer,Good community facing benefits such as paid volunteer time and a solid package of extra benefits like generous bereavement leave. Many of your peers will be kind and supportive even if that stops at the team level.,"Middle management often does not seem to care about their employees, instead playing lip service to their teams about improving work in the long term. It's incredibly difficult to advance, the work can feel meaningless, and team level concerns are often not addressed for months at a time if at all. If you speak up about these issues or raise concern with management you will be brushed aside.

Many senior level develops are overworked and under compensated to the point that they left the company as a group leaving the remaining developers to pick up the slack without any new experienced developers being hired or the promotion of current employees. Teams were left without leadership and middle management did nothing to adjust expectations or correct the issues.

Finally, unless you are a favorite of one of management do not expect to be treated fairly or given the opportunity to move to a new area that you could better perform within. That opportunity will not be given. Especially within the developmental programs at the bank young college graduates are often mislead or outright lied to in order to get them to sign up with penalty of having to paid back signing benefits if they do not stay at least two years. Performance evaluations are also a farce, M&T management often seems to issue performance marks arbitrarily and on many occasions employees with no negative record or concerns having been raised by their own teams will have performance strikes placed against them that ruin any chance of receiving a promotion.

It's well known within corporate culture at M&T that the only reasonable way to advance or move is to leave the company and then come back at a later time. Since M&T values the acquisition of new talent so much higher than retention of current employees. If you take a job with M&T make sure you are happy with exactly what you signed up for, not what they promise you as a future state. That will not come to pass."

-M&T is great for diversity and I highly applaud them for that.
-The trainers are good and work hard to make sure you have a good understanding of the systems that are used.","-Underpaid for the amount of stress and anxiety this job causes.
-You are treated as if you're a robot not a person. It's all about the numbers.
-Managers don't seem to have a clue how to manage people, they just want their daily numbers so they can impress their manager. Their idea of managing a team is posting rah-rah ""we got this team"" messages in MS Teams.
-One-on-one meetings with managers feels like they go through a checklist of what they have to ask, with no enthusiasm at all. Feels like they want to get the meeting over and done with as fast as possible.
-Does not feel like a team, everyone is trying to work quickly to get their daily numbers, which you can't blame them, but there's no sense of a team, just a bunch of people working hard to provide numbers for the managers.
-There was even a town hall conference with the head of Banking Services where he went over the yearly employee survey, he said that compensation comes up every year as the lowest, then said he would go to corporate about it and left it at that. I don't expect any change.
-The internal systems are outdated, they look like websites from 2005.
-There's so many design and tech issues with the funding system used. There's many little things you have to remember and workarounds to fix errors or issues that pop up when trying to fund a loan.
-The AI system that they use to auto-fill fields to fund a loan is so bad that it causes more work for you, then managers get upset that your numbers are low because you're spending your time fixing all the mistakes the AI did."

All of management are your traditional corporate suits and stuck in very old ways of doing things. The vast majority of management do not understand the complexities of technology in general. It felt like going to work with my tech illiterate parents. The stacks here are old rubbish and the codebases are hodge podges of band aid fixes since engineers leave here all the time so it's an ever revolving problem of dealing with someones abandoned mess. I've also participated in many interviews and the tactics to trick tech talent to come aboard are unethical and predatory. There is little to no innovation here, and I realized immediately I was tricked into joining this company. I despised my time spent with M&T entirely and will forever resent them for tricking me into thinking they could be a decent place for technologists. If you have talent don't be fooled into wasting it here. Trust your gut in the phony interviews because what is portrayed is too good to be true."

It's a total front. There is no innovation, and new ideas are oppressed by old guard management whom remain an overwhelming presence. This bank has gone on tireless campaigns to lure in young tech talent only to assign them to old fashioned, intimidated management, who want nothing to do with change. They have scared off the majority if not all of local tech talent and are ramping up recruiting to unknowingly non-local talent, who surely have even less tolerance for old school stiffs. This bank does a great job presenting a facade of progression in tech, but behind the curtains it is exactly what you'd expect from a dinosaur company who has gone nowhere in decades. I was astounded, witnessing the rate of which talented engineers ran for the door within 1 year of tenure there. It's insane they are even trying to ""transform"" without first addressing the most obvious barrier, correcting the middle management regime whom are forcing engineers to jump ship and quite literally stifling progress. If you are a talented engineer, tread lightly, it's a trap. There is just something in the air there... a looming disdain and resentment for the younger generation. Oh and don't even think about career progression. They are using stack ranking to force attrition and this has compounded 10x the before mentioned problems because now the arena of employment is that of the hunger games."

378,,The company is in decline,2021-04-29,2.0,Vice President,"Good pay. Generous time off benefits, PTO for volunteering, good people.","Work-life balance sucks. We are in meetings all day every day, we all joke that M&T stands for Meet and Talk. Agile project management hasn't helped that. Managers average 55 - 65 hours per week, and are now being asked to start earlier in the day and work weekend hours to support the People's United acquisition. 

Frequent performance management and nine box meetings on employee performance at all levels of technology. If you work on a struggling project, work in an operations position, or aren't known by other managers, then you are at risk of job elimination. This has a serious negative impact on culture. Funny thing is that some of our management tells employees they have to relocate, even from other cities, but they won't do it themselves and still work in places where M&T doesn't even have a footprint. 

All employees are required to relocate to the new Technology Hub, our CIO's pet project. Senior management won't listen to concerns about quality of life, family issues, transportation, and other issues that come up. Team management will defer to senior management, who defer to the Admin VPs, who defer to the GVPs, who defer to the CIO and say 'if they don't like it then they can find another job'. He wants to hire college graduates, but that dream hasn't worked out yet either. The developer tech hub isn't delayed by Covid, it is delayed by reputation and mismanagement. 

We have lost hundreds of great employees over the past two years. We have eliminated many critical positions, eliminated some of the best leaders, and are now scrambling to get things done. We all need the same resources for multiple projects and when that one person leaves we are dead in the water. The culture is to only report good news on projects so we hide the bodies until it is too late. The only thing we hope for is the project will be reassigned before anyone finds out what the hold-up is. 

I have seen so many people change over the past few years. They are not happy or excited. We were (quietly) asked to create positive reviews for the company to offset negative ones. I will probably get put in the 8 or 9 box if tie this back to me but I really don't care anymore. I see how much happier my coworkers are in other companies and think that might be the best thing for me and my family. 

It was so much better a few years ago. I am currently looking for a new job, but am paid well enough that it is tough to find a management job at that level of pay in the Buffalo area. The last one I interviewed for went to a friend of mine at M&T, they had 4 candidates from M&T besides me too. 

I wish I had someone at M&T to share this with, but my manager doesn't care and either does her manager. They are upwardly focused even though they talk about Servant Leadership and how focused they are on employees. They aren't."

M&T Bank is a great place to work. In the Cybersecurity organization, the leadership gets it. They understand the role is to support the business and enable them to make risk based decisions. They are very supportive of their employees and employee growth. Other organizations that I've worked with, such as commercial, also understand they are supporting the business. As a result, everyone tends to row in the same direction. They also get that the business is about relationships with the customer.

The exception that I've seen is Technology organization. It is political, morale is low, leadership does not listen to their staff, and there is a lot of fear due to constant reorganizations and firing of staff based on politics - not performance. So if you avoid this part of M&T, you should be good.",salary raises are typically around the rate of inflation

529,,"TDPs beware. Don't be fooled by the ""tech hub transformation""",2020-12-26,2.0,Full Stack Engineer,Generous PTO if you are at a higher officer title. Cushy job to ride out to retirement if process and paperwork and little action doesn't bother you.,"All companies take time to adjust to new practices, save for VC-backed startups. There is no arguing this. However, M&T claims to be a new leader in the ""tech transformation"" both internally, and as a beacon in Buffalo, NY. The only beacon this represents is one that is lit 24/7 when something is on fire.

Expect to find overworked and stressed mid-level developers and practically no competent senior developers left. In the summer of 2020, nearly 16 mid and senior developers walked out after months of frustration and process, paperwork and absolutely no progress on a new flagship product after 3 months in development. The response? Outsource the project to a vendor and start all over again. But if you ask leadership those ""tough"" questions, they response will always be the same: ""These aren't the droids you're looking for.""

Two years ago, a new ""TDP"" program was started. This was essentially a program to hire fresh grads from their 4-year degrees (community college and bootcampers need not apply). While the idea behind grooming new developers to the workforce is admirable, and appealing at career fairs (after all, you'll get a free mug, t-shirt and ""M&T Tech"" in a cool startupy font), most of these TDPs find themselves being mentored by the same incompetent senior developers who believe .NET WebForms is still the future, and that ""agile"" should be said with a sense of magic and mystery. This program of some 100-150 TDPs rotating through is filling in the gaps of the missing mid-level developers. You have the occasional unicorn TDP, and the majority of the rest truly have significant potential. But, without solid tech leads and senior developers to guide them in non-M&T best practices in software development, I fear many will find themselves with few new skills, and 2-3 years at M&T on a resume, thinking they can hop to a mid-level position elsewhere, but still having the skillset of entry-level.

If you want opportunity in development in modern frameworks (Angular, React) and modern concepts (CI/CD, microservices, containerization), look elsewhere. We can't even get the corporate proxy to work with NPM.

In fairness, there is *one* team at the bank building an Angular-based product, with a .NET Core backend. They seem to be immune to some of the issues of the bank. But even they struggle often, and don't have the need or capacity to bring on 50 new devs. Most hires will be under other branches of development. (not to be confused with git branches - we don't know what that means here)

M(eet) & T(alk) prides itself on its abilities to schedule developers in meetings for 7 hours nearly every day, leaving you to either get very little done, or work into the late evening to get your expected workload completed. Everything moves as glacial speed, with committees of 12 or more meeting for 6-8 weeks to make simple product discussions. Due to the high churn rate in technology (development), most knowledge meetings for new features, vendor onboarding etc. require all developers on a time to go, instead of a representative. This protects the knowledge from being lost should one or more devs walk. Which they do.

At the end of the day, its difficult to find support in leadership when senior-level still refers to ""The cloud"" in the same tone of voice as the alien toys from Toy Story say ""The claw"", middle management is the same management as pre-tech-hub - finding it difficult to accept new trends (you know, like Git source control instead of TFS), making it even slower to truly transform, and most competent tech leads and developers having already jumped ship, despite hanging on as long as they could, hoping it would get better.

Check out other recent developer-job reviews for this organization, you'll see the pattern.

Don't let the new ""Tech Hub"" fool you. The same incompetent leadership is still steering the ship into the iceberg."

I was recruited out of state from a real tech hub and sold fool's gold. I am a highly qualified senior software engineer and am accustomed to working in shops that run a tight ship and value technology. M&T is a circus rife with staunch business folk who have been stuck in the same antiquated ways of working for decades. There exists not a single piece of decent engineering here but rather old, archaic, and embarrassing failed attempts to create things other organizations have done years ago. You'll be introduced to vendor-based projects running on life support that were slapped together by long gone contractors and be expected to maintain them with a smile. Engineering excellence will not matter here, nor your modern skillset or credentials. All that will matter is how well you can play the corporate game and the ability to appear busy and important. In other words, how much you can be a politician. Look forward to meetings all day where people do nothing but talk about doing cool new things but never actually attempt to do them. I’ve been subjected to “conversations” for months on end to start making software but it never happens. On the occasions where I’ve built something on my own to solve a problem in a modern way, those solutions were grossly misunderstood and met with resistance and skepticism from every angle. Microservices? Not understood. Containers? Not understood. Source control? A novel concept. The kicker of actually creating something that solves a problem here? You’ll be identified as a threat from the folks who would never attempt such a thing and ostracized from the herd. In over a year here, I have seen not a single honest tangible act to fulfill the “tech transformation” that is touted so regularly here - all talk - all pretend. I’ve felt like a sucker for accepting a position here with reasonable expectations. M&T is also playing copycat to other organizations, desperately stealing practices that worked in their competitors past travels. Look up “stack ranking” and “rank and yank” coined by GE and still used in some places and the toxic hunger games culture it brings. It’s here now and used in, no surprise, ways that are misunderstood and without regard to the cultural damage it causes. M&T is burning through senior engineering talent at an astronomical rate and betting the farm on hiring interns and “TDPs” to save the place, a technique also stolen by a huge competitor of theirs. Again, a practice that is misunderstood here and one which leadership expects a sudden teleportation into nirvana while skipping over all the hard work and commitment needed to meaningfully and sustainably get there. Soon M&T will be a daycare full of interns and leadership who misunderstands technology, and they’ll revert back to the starting line again and again because it failed like many of things here. You’ll be handed your Windows laptop and spend months trying to get past corporate proxies, password lockouts, feats of installing dev tooling that is near impossible, and a wealth of bureaucratic nonsense, only to sit on the sidelines watching your team participate in rituals of “working” on haphazard codebases to release a monthly change on a weekend that is laughable in relative progress. M&T spent decades disregarding technology and it shows in every facet of working there. I’ve never seen a place where technologists are regularly undermined by old guards and treated so poorly. I absolutely hate working here and cannot emphasize enough how truly disappointed I am."

The company continues to improve its technology, optimize productivity, and improve efficiency. Good ideas are welcome, and you do have enough autonomy to find a process that works for you as a manager, and training & education is constantly growing. Plenty of investment is being made (successfully) into the marketing and resources available for the business banking arm.","Politics as usual. If you don't follow the path, you will be blacklisted. I personally have watched several employees from different walks of life and backgrounds have their career progression halted due to hearsay or bias. Gossip is very common among the leadership, and I have realized in the last couple years just how crippling that can be for an employee who may have been dealt a ""bad hand"" with a poor performing branch or team. If you can play the politics. you will fit in just fine.


I have seen internal candidates who applied for new roles/promotions, but the hiring managers verbatim stated to me that ""they will not get the job"" even before the interviews occur (and yes, they still scheduled the interviews). 

I was told by my immediate manager (along with three of my peers) that I made ""too close of a salary"" to her, and that she will not allow anyone to make more than them. This is not illegal, however it is extremely inappropriate and unprofessional.

I was offered to interview for a role in another department, and the hiring manager told me I was the preferred candidate for the position after the interviews came down to myself and one other candidate. I was then surprisingly turned down without any outreach or explanation from the department, but was told by a senior manager that non-minorities will not progress into these new strategy roles. Illegal? Sure. But to be fair, there is no way to prove this was what happened. 

I will conclude that I am very disappointed; this is not the company culture I remember from years ago. During my years of being on many advisory counsels and projects, I would never have imagined I would be writing this type of review. I was glad to have the good years, but I am glad to have finally moved on to better things!"

Now, I wouldn't recommend a tech job to my worst enemy. Staff has been cut with slow to no backfills. Leadership is under the illusion that people will move to Buffalo in droves to work here. Impossible deadlines are set, and culture is cutthroat and toxic, causing good engineers to jump ship. The stress isn't worth the money. Leadership is completely misfiring on a shift to Agile, haphazardly throwing groups together and combining essential, individual Agile roles. Management is selling a tightly packed open office concept as somehow better during a global pandemic."

They lack in training their employees properly, there is no formal orientation to learn the companies culture, and there is no baseline to what is expected of what is expected of you. The expectations are very high, which it should be, but there was rarely any feedback unless it was negative feedback. For the first 2 weeks of the job, I was given my laptop, documentation, compliance videos, and benefit information but was left alone to learn it on my own. I wasn't paired with anyone but if I had questions was told to reach out to a fellow teammate and get the answers or to refer to the documentation. This may just be departmental, but I made do with the information that was presented to me. They tend to spread you really thin when it comes to projects.

No uniformed managerial expectations and you will find “policies” change from region to region within the same Greater Baltimore Market even though we are supposed to be “one connected bank”. 
Created more turn over at branch level, including managers, than anytime in last 16 years I’ve been with bank.  Middle management no longer seems to be concerned with retaining talent and does not take ownership of their inconsistencies.

High deductible health plan with no options for others.

Non competitive pay in relation to other banks.
Incentive plan “restructured”  3-4 years ago (again no longer competitive comparatively- and actually quite laughable)

Reduced FT hours from 40 to 35-37.5 

Expecting managers to keep doing more with less (reducing staffing model from 6-7 FTE to 3.5 FTE with no transparency for operating and sales model.

Was the last bank in region to make moves when COVID-19 occurred keeping doors unlocked, open, no glass on teller line, no masks, protective screens etc, keeping hours same (after every other bank in region had acted immediately and thoughtfully - creating game plans on staggering employee schedules, locking doors, deep cleaning 1+ time per week, reducing in office appt days, premium hazard pay, etc)

653,,Not the worst place to work,2020-04-01,2.0,Relationship Banker,"Retail bankers are paid hourly, so you only work 37.5 hours a week and you get paid overtime if you go over 40 hours. Three weeks paid vacation and 11 paid holidays. For a sales position, it's not a huge amount of stress. You still have to make your numbers but they aren't breathing down your neck.","Career progression is essentially impossible unless you are in business banking. In three years I only saw 3 people in the entire region get promoted. Most retail bankers were there 5+ years, same with most managers. Short staffing and branches being spread out makes learning new skills or shadowing someone in another department  impossible."

655,,Branch Manager,2020-03-11,3.0,Branch Manager,"Sales goals are reasonable, company does not aggressively push unwanted products on customers, conservative underwriting contributes to stability in down markets, management does genuinely seem to care about employees.","Pay is mediocre compared to rest of industry, new incentive structure has caused substantial income reduction for long tenured employees. Systems are very outdated, information and tasks are spread out over multiple different platforms that don't communicate well with each other. A lot of customer service tasks in the branch require outsourcing requests to back office, and staff in non-customer facing roles can be very slow or indifferent in responding. Simple tasks take multiple phone calls with transfers to multiple departments to find the one person who can help, and internal support line is always understaffed. A lot is still done on paper, processes are very slow - especially business underwriting. Be prepared to lose customers because M&T takes 5-10 days to approve a loan that competitors will turn around in 24 hours with a fraction of the paperwork. Work life balance is terrible. You will work 6 days a week most weeks (until 6pm on Fridays), federal holidays are only 2 day weekends instead of 3, you have a lot of vacation time, but only one person per branch can be off per day, so PTO is actually really hard to use in reality.  As a manager, you will be expected to go to lots of after hours networking and charity functions evenings and weekends, and that is in addition to your normal time, which can easily be 48 hours a week on its own."
656,,Boring job,2020-03-07,2.0,,"Monday holidays,  PTO,  Hours,  some employees",Only can work 37.5 hours! Low paying job got a nickel raise in 2 years. Bored to death at this job. Many old  antiquated systems to learn.  Want you to do more with less people. Micro managed . Back stabbing employees.  So short staffed customers have to wait and then end up leaving.  Many employees leaving even tenured ones. If you go to HR with something it takes them 2 months to get back to you.

I get about 4 weeks paid time off only working here for a little over a year. And honestly I enjoy coming to work each day.","- M&T should stand for meet and talk. There is a meeting for everything, and we talk about everything at the branch level. Many times I feel like the meetings are very repetitive and could be an email. 
- Moving up seems difficult. It seems as though they often want you to move up each little level until you get into a role that you want to. This could take eons. They love a story here about how people often start as tellers, and work their way up to a regional manager, etc. 
- Systems are a little dated. However they are really trying to improve their technology going forward and are investing so much into this area."

To start, agile processes are good but our particular process was put in a position where management would funnel all directives and capacity through the scrum master. The problem is this person did not have the faculties to understand or accept what we were actually able to do. This person also would frequently talk over everyone and side-step any actual progress by directing the meeting into a different direction as soon as we began to get on a clarity on any given subject or the next day make up a whole new process where we needed to start all over again. Additionally, developers where treated in a demoralizing and demeaning manor, both in being condescendingly talked over or totally misunderstood.

-most colleagues are nice 
-very stable bank 
-work life balance is excellent","-MICROMANAGEMENT- if you get a job within operations, expect to be micromanaged. Management expects you to update them on what you are doing every hour of the day. They will literally walk around and ask you what you are doing again and again. And at the end of the day expect you to write down a timesheet that breaks down everything you’ve done for the day. And the next day will question every small thing you did.   
-horrible work environment and paternalistic work culture. While colleagues are generally nice people, the unrealistic expectations as well as the micromanagement fosters a very hostile atmosphere that colleagues cannot even talk or get to know each other. The moment you try to even have a brief chat with a colleague about anything, managers will give you a side eye and will make some snarky comment about whether you have enough work on your plate. Absolutely awful. 
-compensation is some of the lowest in the industry 
-technology is EXTREMELY backdated. 
-you cannot work from home (even though most of your responsibilities can be done remotely). 
-zero room for advancement. If you’re hired for another role internally, you will get about a 2-3% raise. Only specific people are picked for promotions and higher raises and everyone else is ignored no matter how hard you work. 
-the health insurance was a joke 
-unrealistic expectations. Managers expect every single employee to do several jobs at once but refuse to pay people higher salaries. Managers also are not thankful of employees efforts. 
-communication is horrible. Upper management disseminates information in a very inefficient manner. I was under the impression that upper management hoarded information from others.  
-very high turnover. This place is a revolving door. People come in, and eventually realize that there is a very toxic culture and leave. There have been periods where entire teams would be vacant for months at a time.

-PTO benefits were great

- Free parking (soon to be cancelled).  The company is moving all IT personnel to downtown Buffalo, where parking will no longer be free or reimbursed.  Beware of this!

-1 week (annually) volunteer PTO allowance

-Onsite cafe (at Amherst HQ location)","-Healthcare insurance is very expensive, no pet insurance offered.

-Information Technology is severely understaffed and has a high turnover rate, which is not surprising.  The expectations set by the various levels of IT management are completely out of touch with the staffing levels - much like a child in a toy store who wants everything they see, but has a budget set by their parents, only the child doesn't want to hear anything about a budget, they just want want want and expect employees to work overtime to pay for their new ideas/toys.

-I was flat out lied to by my supervisor when offered a Full Time position, by agreeing to allow me to work from home 3 days a week in lieu of accepting a lower salary.  I was not able to begin working from home until 1 month after my start date and instead of being allowed to WFH 3 days a week as agreed to, it was reduced to 1 day a week - my request to renegotiate my salary was rejected.  This underhanded tactic unfairly took away my ability to negotiate for a market rate salary with 1 day a week WFH.  The lying & underhanded tactics I was personally subjected to completely destroyed my trust in IT management.  (FWIW, I would have been completely okay with 1 day a week WFH, minus the lying and a more competitive salary)  My supervisor failed me and failed to build a trusting relationship.

-Unrealistic expectations by IT management and supervisors that do not have the necessary background/experience to be effective leaders. 

-When I needed to take off 2 hours for a doctors appointment on a Monday, and worked an additional 12 hours overtime that same week, my supervisor would not allow me to deduct the 2 hours from the overtime hours worked - I was forced to deduct the 2 hours from my annual PTO.  When I expressed discontent with this, my supervisor stated that I was expected to work overtime and any time out of the office will incur PTO deduction.  My supervisor expected me to work overtime without being accommodating/compromising of the need to take off time for doctor's appointments.

-My supervisor was very much against written communications and only wanted to communicate over the phone or face-to-face, which goes towards his observed underhanded tactics of hiding the proof that he lies & manipulates the people that report to him.  Without written communications, you have zero proof of his misdeeds.  Any supervisor worth his salt would not be afraid of written communications, and would stand by his word - not try to cover his tracks by conveniently ""forgetting"" what was discussed just a few weeks ago, let alone a few days ago.  If memory fails this person within a matter of days/weeks, then surely a good supervisor would embrace written communications, not run from it.   My supervisor actively tried to cover their tracks by changing details of past verbal discussions or conveniently forgot what he agreed to, in order to make themselves look better.

-Constant meetings (5-6 hours a day), which makes focusing on getting work done & meeting project deadlines quite difficult.  Without being directed to do so, you're expected to be available and work evenings & weekends in order to get the work done, assist other teams & meet project deadlines, that you would otherwise get done during normal business hours without constantly being in meetings, often times irrelevant meetings.

-Meetings are unnecessarily redundant, where I've been in 3 ""team meetings"" a day and also required to participate in meetings that do not involve my expertise or team - the same information conveyed in that 2 hour meeting, could easily be shared in an email as an FYI.  When I brought this up to my supervisor, specifically with respect to our team's time being unnecessarily/inappropriately utilized and when we could be spending time on issues/projects that do require our attention, they blew it off like I was wasting their time.  My supervisor failed the team in not calling out other managers/teams for the misuse of our time, and expected us to work overtime in the evenings/weekends in order to make up for their failures.

-Operations staff do not properly triage support issues before engaging Engineering staff, which results in the proverbial ""tossing grenades over the fence"" work mentality.  All too often, my team would receive ""escalated"" incidents from Operations staff that did very little, if any, troubleshooting work on the issue they were initially assigned - this resulted in Engineering staff functioning as day-to-day Operations staff, while still being held accountable to the issues/project deadlines on the Engineering side of the fence.  This is a training/accountability issue, I get it - it happens.  But when I brought this issue up to my supervisor, they directed me to talk directly with the supervisor of the Operations Staff and was not interested in resolving the issue at hand.  My supervisor failed to lead our team and meet/speak with other supervisors in curbing bad habits of other teams not doing their jobs properly before engaging our team.

-I personally witnessed two of my teammates get negative performance reviews due to IT management's unrealistic expectations and my teammates being punished for it.  IT management was unyielding when realistic expectations were conveyed, based on industry standard.  To be completely transparent, I was never given a negative performance review and was highly praised for my expertise & work ethic, but I personally witnessed & was told by team members of the negative performance reviews they received due to completely unrealistic expectations set upon them.  In other words, my team members were being punished via their performance reviews for not working evenings/weekends to make the impossible happen.

-24/7/365 availability is expected (implicitly) - Operations staff are 'explicitly' required to be available 24/7/365, Engineering staff are 'implicitly' expected to be available 24/7/365, in particular when working on projects that affect production systems (i.e. new solutions being deployed/supported) - this is regardless of whether you are on PTO.  I've witnessed that it's normal for people who go on PTO to overtly state that they will not have access to email/phone/text - which of course is not truthful, but is commonly stated as a way to CYA so you can ignore calls from work when on PTO.  This is completely unnecessary and it's a shame that employees have to resort to this behavior, but IT Management has unrealistic expectations of understaffed teams and has created this toxic environment.

-M&T is adopting the ""Agile"" work method, as opposed to the ""Waterfall"" method - for the DevOps folks, this may be a good thing, but not all of M&T is DevOps.  For the Operations/Engineering departments, this is several steps in the wrong direction.  The Agile methodology was created for software development, not for daily Operations & Engineering teams, which ultimately requires sufficient staffing levels - Agile requires faster clock cycles than Waterfall, and with understaffed Departments/Teams, M&T Bank is expecting their current understaffed teams to work faster & longer hours to accomplish the same goals.  The claim is that Agile is a more efficient work style, when the opposite is true in a Operations/Engineering environment.  In simplistic terms, Waterfall = ready, aim, fire.  Agile = ready, fire, aim.  There is a big difference between the two; this information is plastered all over the internet and there's an overwhelming amount of tested scenarios/industry experts who clearly state that the Agile work method does not work in production environments, please look this up for yourself before drinking the M&T koolaid.  Beware of this, if your job function is not DevOps!

-Massively open floor plans, literally a chest-high cube farm/city with zero privacy.  This makes focusing on work/meeting deadlines quite difficult, as you're frequently visited by other people for favors, questions & personal banter - it quickly became overwhelming.  Of course, the issues that are brought to your attention are ""emergencies"" that require immediate attention, which forces you to either stop doing your own work/miss project deadlines and get yelled at by IT Management or don't assist with the emergency at your desk and possibly get yelled at by IT Management.  This is not a healthy way to operate an IT Department and this behavior goes on and on, completely unchecked.

-After submitting my 2 week notice to resign from my position, I was not asked by a single person, IT management or by the HR department as to ""why"" I was leaving.  This completely contradicts M&T Bank's message that they care for their employees and hold communications to the highest possible standard.   This goes to clarifying M&T Bank's main priority, which is not the welfare of their top performers, rather top profits for their investors at the expense of their employees working around the clock on understaffed teams."

Forget whatever days you put on your application you are unavailable, they don't give a crap they will work you whenever. Expect to have little pay if you are a new hire.

Pay is low in terms of the market and other geographies outside of Buffalo, NY. Similar positions at other banks would be at least $70k. Western NY placements blatantly favor WNY natives and those with family in the area, which has been confirmed through personal discussions with hiring managers. Most direct managers don't know how to delegate work to Management Trainees, who are often driven, bright recent graduates who have worked in corporate settings before. Easy to be burnt out as a millennial that is looking for room for learning, advancement and company growth; ""top talent"" and graduates of top schools often leave within 6-12 months."
1171,,Not the best place to work,2016-07-19,1.0,Compliance Specialist,There are very few pros to working at M&T.  The commute wasn't horrible but other than that - this is not the best place to work or do business.,"There is a horrible work environment, the company doesn't care about it's employees, the company is self serving and will do what it can to do as little for it's employees as possible.  I would NEVER recommend anyone work at M&T Bank - EVER!"
1172,,Ask about the Management Development Program's Retention Rate! Not a place for young leaders or innovators.,2016-07-16,1.0,Management Development Program Trainee,"MDPs receive a lot of recognition in the company, but it's just so they can lock you in early and pay you low wages for the rest of your career","Lots of smart, enthusiastic college grads leave the Management Development Program within one or two years of joining M&T. The bank will tell you it's because young people are dumb and choose first jobs that aren't a good fit, but that's a shameful lie. People leave because they aren't valued and their work is meaningless. 

M&T doesn't value young talent. The Management Development Program is supposed to develop leaders but you spend the whole year being fed propaganda about how M&T is a community bank that's the best place you'll ever work. That couldn't be further from the truth. The bank is all about reaping profits for shareholders and keeping employee expenses as low as possible. The recruiters lie to you and say you'll be in an analytical role but in reality you'll either be dealing with angry customers all day or smashing your head against your Windows XP PC that freezes every 5 minutes. 

Wages are low at M&T, health insurance is terrible and many employees are lifers who have never worked anywhere but M&T. M&T brags about this but they really shouldn't. Most long term M&T employees know nothing about how modern companies operate. Many modern companies are diverse and dynamic, but M&T has a gross lack of diversity and is unaware of the needs of its workforce and the communities it serves. 

M&T is stagnant and afraid of change. If you're a recent college grad from a big, reputable school, don't join the MDP. The bank is scared of technology and innovation, and its empty promises about valuing its employees get old fast. Go start your career at any other major company and they'll give you better pay, benefits, perks, advancement options and most importantly, work that's impactful from day one."
1173,,Compliance Analyst,2016-07-14,3.0,Anonymous Employee,"Vacation, Sick days, Work life balance, Friendly Culture",Being internal and moving to a higher position gets you no where wage wise. The lowest payer in the market for internal candidates. Internal employees are unfairly paid.

The Assistant Manager is left in the branch daily to run everything while the Branch Manager is out cultivating new business, either alone or with the Business Banker assigned to that branch.","The Assistant Manager is left in the branch daily to run everything while the Branch Manager is out cultivating new business, either alone or with the Business Banker assigned to that branch.  The Branch Manager has to be the business banker as well as oversee the other remaining relationships in the branch.  You are also expected to create other opporunities outside of branch hours like networking events so that you can develop more centers of influence for your  branch.  The problem with that is that the hours are pretty much around the clock because of all of the expectations placed on you.  The work/life balance is non existent.  The stress is deafening and there is no concern with the level of stress that is placed on you as a person.  It's handled as if its par for the course and the more you have going on the better.  Regardless of your other commitments outside of M&T Bank.  They want your life to be M&T.  And if you can do that then you'll be successful.  If you decide to commit to other areas of importance that are very real factors in your life, like your family or your church, forget it.  You're a sinking ship.   This company needs a constant HR rep present in all branches.  But they have HR reps that aren't even in the same city and aren't committed to getting one."

1179,,Decent starter/entry-level job,2016-07-07,3.0,Secretary II,"Depending on the department you get into, they can have great perks like Christmas parties, picnics in the summer, giveaways etc. Dental and Vision Insurance/Benefits. Some departments have great atmosphere's!","Salary, If you work downtown you have to pay for parking, gas or public transportation (which is just as much as parking sometimes), Health Insurance & sporadic ""sick days"". You only receive 8 days on a rolling calendar basis. So if you use one on March 3rd, 2015, you don't get it back until March 3rd, 2016. And if you use all 8 days you are placed on verbal warning, and if you continue to need to use sporadic time it is then unpaid and you will then be placed on written, final etc. Tuition Reimbursement is offered but it's up to the manager's discretion so while you may have co-workers around you that are able to partake, your manager could deny you for it (citing there isn't a ""bank need"".) Alternative work arrangements like work from home, etc. also aren't available to everyone. It feels very pick and choose who is allowed to do what based on whims. 

My biggest problem is that it's a very mercurial company, some lines of business are oppressive and horrible to work in (like Customer Asset Management) and others like Banking Services and Commercial Banking can be great to work in. Unfortunately it depends on the department and from there the manager you get. (it can be like that with every job, however there are vast culture differences across the company) It may be all one company, however everyone likes to do things their own way which creates huge differences in environments, some good, some not so good.

1209,,They appreciate hard work and regularly acknowledge accomplishments that benefit the company.,2016-05-07,5.0,AML Compliance Analyst,"They promote from within and do so based on merit, not an old boys system or because someone has more time. 

Their benefits are great. 401k matching up to 4.5% for a 6% individual contribution. The Employee Stock Purchase Plan allows you to purchase their steady, reliable stock at a 10% discount. They also have a retirement account and make contributions once a year after your first year with the company. The contribution is a percentage of your salary and you get to control which accounts the money goes into. I currently make 50k a year and if I never get a raise and it doesn't accrue a dollar in interest, roughly 75k will be in it when I retire. Simple math on raises and normal return rates in the market show that account will have much more than 75k waiting on me when I retire. 

The health plan through Independent Health is great. It covers regular checkups and they set you up with an easy to use HSA, as well as contribute up to $1,000 at the beginning of the year. The contribution depends on how much you make as an individual.","Lots of meetings. The joke around there is M&T stands for ""meet and talk.""

The Bank offers many products that you can refer to your customers that will help them. All from credit cards, to investments, insurance on almost everything, loans, name it....they have it!

Vacation time was great! You are offered 2 weeks vacation time as soon as you start regardless of if you are full/part time. 
Two full training weeks(one week at a computer)(one week at a different branch with a coach behind the line with you)

Bank hours are awesome! You have off every night and Sunday's guaranteed.","I work for an extremely busy branch. With a lot of customers. It gets pretty hectic and management does not give you time to get done what you need to get done. When these tasks aren't complete, you are hounded by the branch manager. This is not a good feeling. Employees do not stay long at this branch. No one works as a team in my location and it's frustrating knowing that I am a team player regardless of any situation. Rules are not followed here until the day that your branch it audited. 

Full time
Employees are required to have 48 referrals per quarter. If you do not meet this requirement, you are written up. This is very doable....however.....there is absolutely NO training in referrals. Tellers learn the products (as we go) and it's very easy to tell customers the wrong information about a product when you do not know anything about it.

Most of the reports that crossed my desk had gross spelling and mathmatical errors, something that M&T is not concerned about. Coworkers of mine regularly sold derrivative products to customers with no idea what they were. I don't think the attitude was that they were immoral, but rather, clueless.
There are zero (ZERO) perks below VP. We had to pay to go to our own christmas party which was held in the mail room- I strongly suspect the bank profited from it.

1293,,worst work experience ever,2015-12-09,1.0,Relationship Banker I,The only two members of the staff that I worked with.,"where do i begin....

I worked in the Downtown White Plains Branch in New York. I came to the company with prior teller experience. I was very confused on what my role was suppose to be because although I was hired as a Relationship Banker I, my role was actually Teller Supervisor. The only training I received was a week of basic teller training, not on the supervisor role.

My first day in the branch, the only people opening were myself (the only teller I might add) and the branch manager. Being that it was my first day, I knew basic things, but not enough to be holding down the teller line by myself. The other banker/teller (who was also VERY NEW), was out for the week receiving training. The only other staff member was the assistant manager and she was not scheduled to be in until lunch time. This branch had no staff at all. Then at the end of my first week, the manager announced that Friday was her last day as she received a promotion to go work in Manhattan. So, then it became a branch staff of just the assistant manager, and us two ""bankers."" The district office rarely sent us float tellers or help, and you could imagine being in a branch thats located in the middle of a city, it would get quite busy. So you leave a assistant manager with two new people who don't know what they are doing... it makes perfect sense.

As teller supervisor, I became in charge of the whole teller line, which was really me being in charge of myself, cash ordering and ATM. The ATM constantly broke down and then the only time i could balance it was after hours, causing me to stay late regularly. I never got out of work on time because i had to do everything. Often times i would not receive a lunch break and it was nearly impossible to even go to the bathroom. 

I could go on and on, but it is merely too exhausting. This is by far the worst company I have ever worked for. This was a worse experience for me than when I worked for Wells Fargo. I don't recommend this company to anyone."

1430,,"Good Bank, Frustrating Employer",2015-02-05,3.0,Commercial Banking,"Some genuinely good people working here. The bank operates upon solid principles, and they are a far cry from the over-leveraged risk factories that submarined the economy in 2007-8. There are many managers within the company that genuinely care about the well-being of their employees, and overall the company is very loyal to their employees. It feels like a throwback company, to a time when employees worked at a single company their whole life. That’s a good thing and a bad thing.","The bank is conservative to a fault. It’s fine to be conservative in lending and in the type of risk you’re willing to take, but overall, everything at M&T just moves very slowly. Decisions are made slowly. Technology changes slowly. Everything is just slow. 

They pay a lot of lip service to “thought leadership” and generating new ideas, but more often than not new ideas simply die on the vine, cut off by layer upon layer of executive approval and compliance review and committee nonsense. I’ve seen so many good ideas brought up again and again in meetings—often, managers and executives roundly agree that it’s a great idea and would help the bank—and then see it slowly disappear, because there aren’t any mechanisms in place to actually make it happen.

As many other reviewers have said, they also don’t pay terribly well. Raises and bonuses are tiny, unless you’re in a sales position and you’re exceeding your targets… this, combined with the bureaucratic mess I just described, makes it really easy to get discouraged—it’s hard to find motivation to go the extra mile when you know a) you efforts probably won’t amount to anything, because the company won’t change, and b) you probably won’t be rewarded for your efforts. (And if you are rewarded, it will more often be in the form of a promotion—bringing far more additional responsibilities than additional money.) 

Not surprisingly, given all of the above, I watched many, many talented colleagues leave for competitors or leave banking altogether before I finally left. While there are many, many very good people still working at the bank, the loss of talent does leave the bank a little hollow—there’s a lot of mediocrity in the middle. (Lots of people who aren’t talented or motivated to realize they could be making more money elsewhere, along with the people who simply know they don’t have to do a great deal of work to remain employed at M&T, because they never fire anyone).

There’s also the technology issue. Anyone who’s ever been a customer of M&T can tell you they’re about a decade behind the curve in terms of technology, and it’s no better on the inside. Ancient machines, laughably outdated software, clunky proprietary systems…"

1441,,Great company!!,2015-01-08,5.0,Relationship Banker,M&T is a very conservative financial institution.  They care deeply about employee engagement and believe that their employees are their most valuable asset.  The opportunities for advancement within M&T are excellent because they have positioned themselves well to acquire other banks in the coming years.  The upper management is very involved in the branch network and you will often see an executive level vice president conducting a town hall meeting with tellers to gain their insight on solving new problems as the banking industry evolves.,"Nothing major really.  Starting salaries for some positions may be a bit low, in line with the banks conservative culture.

I have only been with the company a short period of time and the resources they have spent to help me advance in my career has been truly amazing. This bank believes in slow steady growth and acquisition and really focuses on the relationship between its employees and its customers.",Sometimes there is a disconnect between the expectations of the corporate office and the regional branch network.

While that is not a bad thing, it is one of the few companies where all the employees recognize that the bank is conservative and the culture is built around that. Everyone is extremely friendly and willing to lend a hand or mentor. The work-life balance is also perfect. That, however, does not work for everyone and can drive particularly ambitious people away.","People are always asking for feedback before things are pushed through.

There are plenty of people willing to jump in and help where they can.","Management staff should spend more time helping grow young, talented,  and ambitious individuals instead of programs like mdp that are almost all reserved for external candidates.

Pay a more competitive wage. There is a wide variance in pay practices in different areas. You should not promote people into the lowest $ in the range for that job grade. It is a slap in the face."
1481,,The worst employment decision ever made!!!,2014-08-04,1.0,Manager,The time off was nice but that's about it.,"Beware to anyone considering working here...especially if you're outside the organization and have never been in a ""Bank"" environment. The culture is horrible...especially in the building I was in. The majority of people were non-social and made you feel uncomfortable by their unfriendliness and they distanced themselves from you. There's no fraternization, no camaraderie with other coworkers....just a constant ""CYA"" atmosphere where everyone is afraid to offend the next person and if you do, beware! If you don't fit in or conform...watch out!

The work environment's most common statement is, ""The Bank"" says do this or ""The Bank"" says do that and it's very similar to the Wizard of Oz whereby everyone has to listen without any voice or opinion!! You'll never have your ideas or suggestions heard as ""The Bank"" has their own way of doing things and if you don't like it, either keep your mouth shut or find another job.

The management I was subjected to was awful and never provided any guidance as a new employee to get acclimated to ""The Bank"" ways and the unwritten rules of how to work with the numerous departments that we had to deal with. Speaking of....it's insane how many people are involved with the simplest things all because of the CYA environment that exists there. The waste of time, energy and effort is unbelievable all because of ""The Bank's"" culture.

The management (which are all VP's) only cares to ""look"" good in their supervisors eyes and could care less about anything else...especially the people that work under them. They will fabricate and exaggerate reports all to satisfy the folks in Buffalo. During a week long stay in the hospital, my supervisor never called or visited to see how I was doing and never asked how I was once I returned. She only had one thing on her mind...get projects done so SHE could look good. That spoke volumes about her character and that is when I knew I made a mistake going to M&T.

I will say that at the Branch level the people there were more friendly and outgoing and perhaps it's because they have more ""people skills"" unlike the ""institutionalized zombies"" in the corporate offices.

To anyone considering employment at M&T....just be careful for what ""think"" what you're getting into. It's NOT AT ALL what they tell you it will be. – less"

Most good employees are trying to leave the division or the company for more stable and rewarding jobs.  Constant push to make up fake appointment activity to prove you're busy, but at end of the year it's all about results.

Those college folks are given the best opportunities in regards to training where they are flown and trained at HQ, given a monthly stipend in addition to a salary, and also given a corporate credit card. It's too bad half of them have Arts degrees and eventually leave the company but the logic that the best training offered is exclusive to this group as opposed to existing employees or experienced new to M&T people is head scratching. The technology here is also very outdated, and the banking products offered are not the greatest. The company has a very minimal presence in the DC / VA area which again makes no sense, why they are focused on buying a bank in in NY /NJ as opposed to growing in DC / VA where there is a lot of assets and still tremendous growth taking place is beyond me, the lack of locations is really hurting the company's business in this market because they cannot compete with the big boys. There is also a heavy lack of talent in the DMV and Baltimore area which probably has something to do with the fact that they pay less than competitors.

It's an old fashioned bank with great integrity and a commitment to their communities. They didn't get in trouble during the financial meltdown because they didn't get sucked into all the extravagant, risky stuff that other banks were doing.

1597,,Get ready for a short career with a high amount of stress and a low salary,2013-02-21,1.0,Anonymous Employee,The company makes a ton of money and will be around for a long time.,There is a good chance you will be told you are an unsatisfactory employee (part of their motivation technique).
1598,,"Great People to Work, Sales/Credit structure impossible",2013-02-13,4.0,Relationship Manager,"Great people, good benefits, good culture, strong bank",Impossible to be a sales person and a credit underwriter.  There isn't enough credit support for the front line.
1599,,Traditional Banking at its best.,2013-02-02,4.0,Group Manager,"Related to the commercial bank - smart colleagues,  challenging work, shareholder and customer focused, good benefits.  You can be very successful and have the room to run if you understand the Bank's culture.  Understand and embrace the fundamentals of its success and replicate it in your own portfolio and you will be rewarded with lots of opportunity.  Exposure to executive management, bank has flat management structure.  Many long tenured employees which makes working together on behalf of clients is fairly easy.",More diversity needed in executive and senior management.
1600,,If you want a stable job in the middle of nowhere then M&T is for you.,2013-01-17,2.0,Anonymous Employee,"The company is very stable (read: boring) and it's hard to get fired. You can move to other parts of the company pretty easily as long as you're qualified and you have a good reason, as they really do want you to be providing as much value to the organization as possible. As long as you have a manager who doesn't micromanage you and you don't dislike the work you're doing, it's not too bad. If your goal is a stable job that will pay the bills, M&T will definitely cut it. They give you a very generous amount of time off, so work/life balance is almost never an issue (except finance where typical work hours are 10-15 hours a day+weekends). People here are friendly and family-oriented. You can pretty much work here for the rest of your life without worrying about losing your job.","Senior management is full of judgmental dinosaurs and is still a boy's club. Managers are managers because they've been at the bank for so long or know the right people but are not always great leaders. There is no room to promote. There are way too few positions for higher level managers so there is no motivation to do great work for the company. Raises just match inflation, if even. The difference between ok work, good work, and great work is pretty much nothing in terms of compensation and bonuses. It will usually take you at least 8-10 years to get into a managing role. Employee engagement is a joke and compensation is severely below industry average. You're going to hit a brick wall if you're the creative/ambitious type and your goal is upward mobility. The attitude is ""we've been doing it for x years and it has worked for that long; why bother with change."" 

Yes it's a bank - and banks are highly regulated. Unfortunately, since no one moves to Buffalo unless they have family there, people tend to cling to the same old outdated ideas and technology. The company will continue to get trampled by regulators asking them to improve process efficiency. If M&T does not adapt to the changing environment, it will continue to lose talent."

1612,,problem with management.....TOO BAD!!,2012-11-09,1.0,Customer Representative I,"Good vacation time based on tenure, but 6 months in you get 2 weeks.","Where do i start....

1)They're cheap- I started out making about $11. Now I make $13 Not for a job well done, but because we merged with another bank who paid better.(they had to even out the salaries across the footprint) This has happened twice since 'Ive been there. The last time a raise was given in our office was a laughable quarter of a percent; which turned out to be about penny. There is always a reason your not getting a raise! So sad

2)Management- If you have a problem with your manager, you can call human resources. But they wont show, instead you have a meeting with your boss and a higher up who basically suggests that you either deal with it or find another job(Also happened twice)

3)Only concerned with their bottom line. Not concerned enough with employee morale. It affects the environment and the quality of the work

Bottom Line- You CAN do better!"

1614,,A typical big bank looking for opportunities to get more money,2012-10-29,3.0,Early Stage Credit Counselor,"My department has a very flexible schedule, we can make our own schedules month to month as long as we get our 40 hours in per week and work 1 night.  Night shifts are usually 12-9pm.  About half the employees in my department work nights which is valuable if you enjoy sleeping in.  I work day shifts due to my schedule, so I work 1 night shift per week.  Also management is great if something comes up and you have to switch your schedule around.  We play month end games, and have incentives to try and hit goal.  We can earn up to $1000 extra a month on just bonuses.","Unfortunately I think I have more cons than pros.  One big one is the whole training process is horrible.  M & T Bank does not train employees significantly enough to insert them into their hiring roles.  From the moment I was hired I was trained for only about a week, which consisted of boring classroom experiences just going over material we already had in our employee binders.  There are several systems and internet web sites that our department uses; unfortunately M&T Bank doesn't go over the different systems enough and show what employees should avoid in accounts they are looking at.  

The next part is fellow employees and etiquette in the workplace.  There seems to be no standard whatsoever.  Our department kind of becomes a free for all to let employees do whatever they want.  If you don't want to answer your phone, you don't.  If you want to browse the internet all day, you can.  If you want to get up and walk around all day, take long unnecessary breaks, and go smoke 12 times a day, you can.  Unfortunately the more productive employees get stuck with their work while they take all these breaks and waste time.  Also even though we work as a team, and we have team goals, the workplace is geared more towards individual goals.  

The clientele we work with.  We are making calls to very disgruntled people for the most part and conversations can go south quickly, also a lot of the calls that come in to collections are blind transfers from customer service or another collections department with little or no heads up to what is happening on the account.  This equals massive confusion between the collector and the customer, not to mention about 50% of the calls that come in don't even belong in the right area of the bank."
1615,,Fairly Good Company in unstable banking times,2012-10-26,3.0,Accountant,Company has had over 135 quarters of straight profits.  Stable-does not look to merge with larger banks.,Certain employees with many years and experience are not promoted to Officers of the bank (extra perks such as bonuses) when other people with purely generous managers are promote (title/pay) with a yr or 2 tenure.

-It honestly wasn't a very difficult job at all.","Almost everything was wrong with this position.
-Environment
This job is in a very undesirable location.  I was required to come in at 6am, I would often arrive when it was still dark out and there were very dubious people standing around.
-Employees
I'm used to a more professional setting.  Therefore, I was thoroughly surprised when I found myself surrounded by so many angry and ill-mannered people.  I'm not exaggerating when I say, I heard threats exchanged almost every time I worked.  A lot of the employees were very vulgar (obscene profanity) towards one another and I can honestly say I was afraid of working there for fear of becoming a target.  
-Management
The management during the weekends would not allow us to speak.  We were literally told not to talk which I found to be odd.  I also wasn't trained at all, and was just thrown into the position.  
-Position
I found the position to be very boring.  It was quiet all of the time due to not being able to talk during specific tasks.

To the benefit of the company, I honestly believe my personal experience was due to the location.  I can say without a doubt that the actual banking centers and customer service roles are more professional.  However, this specific setting (which had nothing to do with customer service) lacked decorum."
