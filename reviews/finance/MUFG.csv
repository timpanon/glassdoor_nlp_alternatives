The company's response to the COVID-19 pandemic isn't really special but much better than their counterparts. Immediately they allowed the workforce to work from home and are constantly adapting to the circumstances of the pandemic, including variants, and various waves.","This company pays so low that it's almost laughable. Their offering salary has turned away genuine and talented people with a vested interest to help them. They don't even pay fair market value. But they expect their employees to go above and beyond, including working late into the night, weekends, and even taking on additional skills outside your job description because they won't invest in hiring people who can adequately do the additional tasks. If you cannot save them from their mistakes, they will guilt trip you and mention how it will affect your mid-year and end-year reviews.

MUFG Investor Services has a toxic management problem. Upper management is filled with finance bros with all the stereotypes that go with it. Some feel that effective leadership is screaming at you, even if it's not warranted. What's particularly insulting is the company has an ""anti-jerk"" mantra but feels that's it is ok to belittle and humiliate you in front of your coworkers. The company seems to have above-average office politics, backstabbing, and an overall fakeness, especially with mid-level managers. Instead of helping you succeed, they seem more interested in humiliating you to make themselves look better to upper management. They try to show off sincerity and compassion and try to convince you they are great people in their townhalls but don't fall for it. As a result, the culture suffers as there is a level of mistrust rampant in the company."

261,,Mother Ultimate Freaking God,2021-10-08,1.0,Associate,You learn what not to do because there will always be real life examples,"I worked at MUFG across 2 branches on both the JCB and GCIB side. 

1) After a year or so, I negotiated my promotion salary based on two points 1) my current actual earnings (as I had already been doing the work of the new title, and was being paid a lot of overtime) and 2) the market rate for the position, which is higher than my pay with OT. HR tells me they can't pay market rate because the profits are not comparable to other financial institutions. Yet when I was first hired and had the conversation with the exact same HR person, they named those exact same FIs as their market competitors.

2) I was fed a lot of guilt-trip about how they were promoting me after I only worked their for 1.5 years (even though I was doing the work of the new title for over six months) and they were promoting me over another person on the team at my previous level. A month later they also promoted them. Promotion cycles take at minimum 6 months. They already knew they were promoting them. 

3) I interview for another position at GCIB, thinking it would be better. The position was for Associate, but they said they could not promote me from Analyst so soon as I was just promoted, but if I could prove myself a promotion next cycle was highly likely. 

4) I was doing the exact same work as the previous associate, with even more additional duties due to restructure within the team. I was being paid 70k less total compensation (base + bonus). 

5) I later found out someone else on the team who joined the team as analyst made 15k more in base than me.

6) When I was finally promoted to associate after fighting tooth and nail for 7 months, I was still being paid 40-50k less TC than the previous associate, and 30k less than the other person on my team. At this point I had another offer so I didn't bother negotiating.

Do not work here if you expect fair market compensation for your efforts, want to advance in your career/learn new things, and/or if you are a nice, decent person. You either 1) become a hardened corporate drone, or 2) you are fully taken advantage of. Either way, you will become utterly miserable, and you won't realize how miserable you were until you finally leave the environment."

Management seems very disconnected as to what happens 'on the ground'. They ask for transparency, but when they get it they don't remediate.

They rely on their employees to surf through a 198 page document every time you need an answer. Our direct reports don't have clear answers or solutions for their analyst. Not to mention their response during the peak of the pandemic was nothing and embarrassing. We received a mask and a mug through the mail. Way to show your employees support through COVID.

If Management says something you need to listen - no choice

Management's sense of entitlement that they can get away with anything and treat staff with little respect and professionalism

Management has access to all info even if they are supposedly confidential

Management gets BCC'd in emails automatically without staff knowledge

Lot of false information about equality professionalism shared publicly while blatant favoritism and bias exists openly

No Career progress options. Promotions are practically non-existent unless you are among the group of folks who go drinking/socializing with management. Also, Expats from Japan get promoted just by being part of the company while staff hired in Singapore stay in their role for decades   

Technology is outdated, Management will review everything even a very small few hundred dollar purchase for a week before it is approved, and lecture the low-level team members about being agile

Many despicable practices here by the Singaporeans: Your incoming or outgoing emails, even when concerns HR matters, will be bcc-ed to your line manager. HR will track all your work from home, office tap in activity and send daily report to your line manager. 

Singaporeans here are also terribly ill mannered, misplaced sense of entitlement, lacking in measurable substance and unable to communicate clearly. Friendships among staff and staff, or staff and management. Middle management with access to highly confidential information enjoys sharing through the grapevine with other local staff. Actively engage in toxic gossip and information exchange… Local analysts complaining about their foreign MD (who promote them) to middle management from different departments, while putting on façade of professionalism, respect and politeness when around the foreign MDs they complained about.

What is perhaps most baffling is how the locals here get accepted into banking professions to begin with. And even more worrisome is the fact that they work in departments that look after the risks and controls of the bank. In other developed nations or institutions, hiring people of such calibre is a definite no go. I don’t think this place is what you would expect a civilised, educated environment to be. It’s definitely not a Japanese culture, and the Japanese must be suffering under this vile environment set by the locals."

Employees are worked to the bone and some are not able to meet the expectations thrust upon them which results in backlogs, remediation exercises and costly expenses to fix the issue that could have been solved initially if more people were just hired.

Long hours and overtime is expected and necessary, which is not beneficial if you have a family or other responsibilities. DO NOT APPLY if you cant meet this expectation, you will struggle with the workload and this unfortunately will have a negative effect on your career development. This is not the job if you want an easy 9-5 life!!!

There are good career opportunities but it can be a game of cat and mouse whereby promises are made and not kept or promotions are delayed due to cost cutting measure. Great people generally but office politics does also plague this company which only adds to inefficiencies."

722,,MUTI Fixed Income Institutional Sales -  Horrendous backward culture by local Singapore team & London head office!,2020-12-28,1.0,Fixed Income Institution Sales,"If i could give this company Zero Stars i would, avoid at all cost!","This is perhaps th\e worst company i've ever joined, left asap in months as i couldn't tolerate the culture of bullying and snobbish treatment from majority of the Singaporean sales team, including the CEO who fires people for the silliest reason, at a drop of a hat. 
All the sales folks were previously from backroom or middle office roles before joining this brokerage firm, they must think this is how working in front line sales is. 
Take note that as a newcomer, despite your age or rank in previous roles, you're expected to be a coffee boy / lady for the existing sales team for as long as they please. Buy coffee and breakfast at 9am, sometimes lunch (best you know their preferences before they get upset at any mistake in their food orders!), tea break at 3pm. 

You will be subject to humiliating bond presentations infront of the sales team where they will throw you ridiculous questions and scenarios, making you confused. This will go on for as many times as they please, sometimes over 20 times till they are satisfied at breaking you down. You will also attend daily morning and evening trainings and even mundane pointless CALL TRAININGS run by the seniors that are extremely bias in their assessment of your recorded calls with clients. 

Long story short, you're employed to hunt for clients and you will NEVER make any commission as all the big clients are currently held with the existing staff who won't leave (over 10-15 years vintage). Commission structure is good but will only benefit the seniors. you are very unlikely to earn any comm if you are there for 1-2 years, or unless someone quits and you take over the accounts.
Turnover for staff: People leave in 1-2 months, sometimes in less than a month. Speaks volumes about their work culture. 

The seniors will always ask you to ask questions, but when you do ask? They reply you in the most sarcastic way.. And you wonder why you never wanted to ask them questions to begin with."

725,,MUTI Fixed Income Institutional Sales - Absolute Nightmare!!,2020-12-22,1.0,Institutional Fixed Income Sales,"MUFG is a decent brand name that might open some doors

Handful of good salespersons to learn from","MUTI is a brokerage that conveniently uses the MUFG brand name. They are very secretive about their business and would rather not be distinguished from Mitsubishi Securities, to hide the fact that they are brokers and do not have a book.

The business model predicates on crossing client axes (banks/street, RM, FM) and as such, MUTI is constantly looking to hire more salespersons to expand client coverage. Unfortunately, no new joiners will ever reach the heights of the top salespersons there. 

The only accounts available for new joiners are either stale accounts or clients that do not want to trade with MUTI. To make things worse, the culture is absolutely toxic. The place is run by the CEO in London, who micro-manages from day-to-day. New joiners will be put through presentations, cold calls and call trainings that do not stop at pure humiliation. Unprofessional, political, and a stifling culture of fear that only tolerates absolute obedience.  

It is no surprise that MUTI prefers to hire people from MO, BO or non-finance related lines, as no professionals with Markets experience will think that the treatment and culture is normal (REMINDER: THIS IS NOT MUFG). Even so, many people still take up the offer (such as myself), only to quit in a few months. The turnover rate is sky high, and I sincerely advise anyone who is considering taking up the offer to speak to someone who has worked there before. You probably already felt something amiss during the interviews, trust your hunch, this is only the preview of what is to come. 

In all fairness, the business model is profitable and works well for the top salespeople with big accounts. The real mainstay is the profit-sharing/bonus structure, at the expense of sanity, integrity, self-respect and kindness. But you’re not getting any of that bonus with your client coverage, so why bother?"

790,,"Decent pay, but a surprisingly toxic culture",2020-10-11,2.0,Project Analyst,"Their salaries are comparable to the big for retail banks, which is great. Additionally, they have generous parental leave and vacations.","“There is a lot of opportunity to improve operations” and “we strive for work/life harmony rather than balance” is code for toxic culture and ineffective systems and workflows. Outdated methodology in banking should be no surprise to most people who have worked in the industry, but what was more concerning was the toxicity. In my last meeting at the company, I witnessed a senior leader yell over a woman repeatedly, interrupting her, and using unprofessional language. Routinely, it appears, women are in this position and when I inquired about the not-infrequent browbeating from Sr VPs, I was told the same thing repeatedly: pressure is high and deadlines are approaching, so the offenders were just letting off steam. 

I am certain of their response: we take this very seriously and we have mechanisms internally to protect against this. Do they? I utilized a confidential HR service and was told the same thing about yelling and bullying: it’s unprofessional but not a flagrant violation of rules.

It’s tempting to go into deeper detail about the antagonistic culture and bad-work-life balance, but the short answer is that long hours are actively encouraged (yet the official line is to take time off, etc this is not it in practice), hierarchy is observed religiously (don’t be too casual with them! They’re a Sr VP!) and there seems to be a strange tattletale culture in the company: people regularly will communicate with managers in a non-transparent way about something they see as an issue in someone else. Feedback is valuable, but it loses its value if there is no transparency.

Lastly... oh those meetings. How much do you like meetings? 20+ hours weekly in which you’re NOT expected to contribute but simply to be seen? If you can tolerate this, then your patience could be a great fit. For others, this is a major detractor."

Generally, leaders were engaged and focused on doing right by their customer, whereas in other organizations, the focus was VERY much on sales and profit regardless of customer or employee abuse. In my 20 year career, MUFG/UB was by far the best company I worked for because of the types of leaders they promote.",Complex infrastructure that can be difficult to navigate. They restructured frequently which was frustrating but also probably necessary due to too much bureaucracy.

The working environment is very poor, unmotivated atmosphere, lots of gossiping around and there is no learning curve, just a complete waste of time over there. They use a lot of paper and management is very old school, they can't keep up with the change in technology and they don't recognized hard work."
848,,Absolutely Horrible,2020-07-05,1.0,Vice President Compliance,"Unfortunately, there aren't much. I have yet to experience anything positive about this bank since I joined.","I honestly don't even know where to begin. Management is absolutely atrocious. If you haven't been anointed into their group as someone who they like, then you might as well just cut your losses and leave. For example, management abides by the ""do as I say, and not as I do"" rule. You will be tasked with an assignment and if you don't do the assignment the way it ""always has been done"", then prepare to pay a hefty price. Your thoughts, creativity, and opinions don't matter so please don't think you can come into this bank and ""improve"" on any current process. The culture is extremely toxic, even for a Japanese bank. There are other Japanese banks out there that will treat you better, so it would be best to look into them. If you finish tasked assignments early, THEY will be ripped apart and asked to be redone. That is only because these inept managers are afraid to be outdone by their employees. If you finish an assignment late, YOU will be ripped apart as being incompetent. There is literally a no win situation when it comes to the work. The managers here are managers, not leaders. They will never ever benefit you in any way so that your career can grow. They are looking for robots who can process the work they need the way it has always been done in the time they think it takes to be done, regardless of how big or difficult the assignment is. Unfortunately, I have heard this in two other departments besides the one I work in. All I can say is CYB (cover your behind), because the snakes that run the groups will give you conflicting information every chance they get. It is truly unfortunate."

You are paid regularly.,"There is no opportunity for growth unless you are one of the preferred ones.  These preferred employees are not even performing.  Workers are bullied by these ones and/or are asked to complete the work to pick up the slack.  Even if you manage to do this successfully, this organization does not value your contribution.  You are automatically deemed average each year for your performance regardless of what you delivered.  If you ever get a reduced annual bonus one year, you will NEVER see a decent one again even if you receive the highest performance evaluation because the program is incorrectly designed.  

Management is only concerned about their own careers and not the organization’s success.  So many politics here vs real work place challenges to work on.  You will spend most of your day in “meetings to nowhere” just so that someone can show their manager they had a meeting.

This organization is driven and managed by white males.  Don’t believe the “we embrace diversity” message they put out there.  The CEO immediately published a message showing his sensitivity to what the nation is protesting regarding treatment of people of color because it’s the politically correct thing to do right now.  But until this organization clearly displays fair treatment of women (there are a few token women they seem to honor for PR purposes), qualified non-whites (there are many qualified employees) in positions of senior leadership, equal pay for the job done(there is a huge disparity of pay for same positions), these type of messages are mere lip service and conveys lack of sincerity.

Do your best to avoid coming here if you can.  Or if you opt to work here, do it for the short term."

While it is wonderful the other reviewer talked about the $150 for setting up their home office, contractors did not receive that along with all of the other benefits.

Every time I would approach my manager with a question, she would ignore me under the pretext that she is busy. All my questions went unanswered and she would only review my work when she is done with hers and that's when everybody has left for the day. There is no work/life balance. The competent pays the price for the incompetent there. That mean if you perform well, you will be given more work taken from the incompetent ones.

More obvious lately that it's 'who you know' vs. 'what you know' that keeps job security. Also makes it difficult to accomplish anything progressive. They wave the Process Excellence flag in our faces constantly; believing that's enough to prove change is being made. Relunctancy to invest in existing or new technology contradicts vocalized  'commitment to Process Excellence'; many find themselves managing work- arounds and ancient manual processes to keep the business alive. Forced to layoff highly- skilled, forward-thinking, value-added newer staff in lieu of the stale legacy staff (mainly due to their dinosaur knowledge of dinosaur systems) to save a fast buck. The bank will be around for a very long time and it will continue to run like this, which always puzzled me because their benefactor is a large Japanese corporation and usually they are at technology forward."

I worked here 8 months and told myself I couldn't take it anymore even after 3 months.  By far, this is the most dull, mundane,  and robotic company I've worked for.  The company underpays what the market commands for Senior Analysts.  They tell you overtime can make up for that shortfall.  Well, that's great, but I'd rather work for a company that pays higher and doesn't require overtime.  The bonus structure is very low, so low I didn't bother staying another few months to receive it.  Favoritism and cliques rule the company.  People at high levels also take advantage of their positions and leave early, leaving the rest to work.  My manager used to go to the gym for 1-2 hours every day and it seems like his only job was to micromanage and delegate.  This is the type of culture where you get to work, don't talk to anybody, eat at your desk, and go home.  You are basically just another worker bee and they treat you as such.  Also, they have mandatory valet if you choose to use their garage, which adds on 15-30 minutes of your time after work before you can even head home because you are waiting on your car.

1091,,London Audit and Credit Exam Department,2019-03-29,2.0,Anonymous Employee,"I am a bit disappointed that the Credit Exam team has been tarnished with the negative reputation of the Audit side of the department.  We are a separate function, and although it's not perfect, we don't seem to experience the same issues that the other auditors are facing.  Our team has had its challenges but works well overall and has good morale.  We have a lot of opportunities for travel and exposure to a wide range of topics.  And from conversations with other staff the pay is very competitive in the market which is a plus.  We have our own desks in the office and the views of the City are amazing, especially from the open roof canteen.  The company offers a lot of activities and training events which  I appreciate as some smaller companies don't offer such an array.","Unfortunately with the high staff turn-over on the audit side of the operations we do get pulled onto audits quite regularly.  As this isn't something we normally do it can be quite stressful and a bit overwhelming.  We are also let down by the technology side of things, with laptops that are very old and don't always work which makes working from home very difficult.  The overall mood of the office has been quite negative since last year and in order to get by you really do have to keep your head down, try not to socialise too much and just treat it as a job.  This is not somewhere I would stay long-term and although I'm glad of the knowledge I have gained, the atmosphere is not great and it's sad to see good people not treated so well.   It seems to be quite hard to get promoted in the department with the reshuffle now placing more responsibility on staff without changing job titles or increasing pay.  I would also point out that management are often the root of the many problems.  An example would be one review of the function that everyone knows was written by an MD but who has stated that they are VP in the review, but forgot to change their job title listed with the review.  Bit of an oversight!  I feel bad that management feel they have to do these things in order to get new staff to join the department.  Perhaps Glassdoor should do a better job of vetting reviews before letting them get published on the website."

3. Complicated office politics... People skills make 80% of your destiny. Even if someone doesn’t do anything, as long as she fools around with managers, she will survive. Performance doesn’t really matter.

4. Disgraceful managers... My manager is a racist. He’s a white guy, and he only hires white and Asian girls. He always make inappropriate comments on people’s appearance. I wouldn’t be surprised if he has some secret relationship with one of the girls he hired.

I felt I should offer another opinion as I have had nothing but positive experiences since I joined. There are definitely things which could improve but the team are all really nice to work with and the audits we do are really varied. I’ve only worked in two other companies so maybe I don’t have a lot to compare to but management here are open and seem very committed to the department. I also have got to know lots of people in compliance and it seems very similar to audit. There’s been lots of change and new joiners, but that’s leading to opportunities and people are very open about why there’s been turnover. I like MUFG and I do recognise it’s not perfect but I would have no problem saying it’s a good place to work. It’s defintely better than another global bank I worked at, where nobody cared about anything except delivery. Here people do care!","There is some uncertainty about Brexit and some talk of moving jobs to Europe if it goes ahead. Also, the integration of the bank and securities hasn’t yet got to one culture so that definitely needs to hurry up.

Lots of places to eat nearby.  
The very small staff canteen has a roof terrace.
You are likely to have your own desk assigned to you.
Option to buy additional holidays and good benefits for healthcare.","So many cons.  I wish I had read this site before joining MUFG.  
MUFG (formally BTMU) is going through some major 'global' restructuring:  Banking and Securities have merged; financial crime is reporting now to New York; and there is a new European legal entity that the majority of EU branches feed into through Amsterdam (all public knowledge).  The result however is no one knows who is responsible for what, leading to lack of ownership, making day-to-day activities very hard.  And although Compliance is growing there are many redundancies being made across Europe and lots of cost cutting elsewhere like with travel and technology.  So many long standing staff in Compliance have resigned.  The majority of staff across all three lines of defence therefore are very new, and it is rare for an employee in Compliance or Audit to have been in London for more than 2 years.  It is common to hear from permanent employees in the business, Compliance and Audit that they are doing roles that they were not hired for and therefore leaving within a year or just after bonuses.  London Audit team has the highest rate of attrition compared to any other department globally at MUFG.  There were around 60 staff at the beginning of 2018 and AT LEAST 3 staff have been leaving every month and emergency contractors have had to be brought in.   Also promotions are not often given in the department.  Salaries are not competitive compared to the wider market.

Technology is outdated.  Laptops are huge, old and must be checked out for at-home working or to use on business travel but often need LAN cables to connect to the internet.  Laptops also often crash or can't be switched on but are not replaced due to budgets.  The Citrix operation platform is very slow.  There is NO air conditioning on the Compliance floor of the London office, nor in the European offices.   Over the summer period this led to one staff member passing out, and staff are often asleep during training events due to the heat.  Staff must request desk top fans which don't really help.

Development feedback is based on exceptions only in London Audit - you can only provide negative comments about working with colleagues which get added up and used to prevent promotions and cap bonuses which many found out at last bonus period. This really affected the mood of the office.  You can nominate staff for recognition but this has no bearing on promotions or monitory contribution.   Tone from the top is lacking and management in the department are not supportive or hold things confidential.    From personal experience and observation, the mood in the Audit office is unpleasant for permanent staff and the pressures placed on senior staff ripples down to the junior staff through questionable  behaviour which is overlooked, hence why so many staff have been leaving.   Work life balance is poor due to lack of staff and lack of suitably trained staff, so additional tasks must be picked up leading to large workloads.

I would not recommend joining MUFG London  Compliance or Audit at this time."

Having a  high work ethic that includes working during evenings and  weekends and checking emails on vacations will get you praise and is expected once you get in the Analyst, AVP, VP and Director levels.

1259,,Career Killer,2018-04-28,1.0,Management,Salary is over what most pay to compensate for other undesirable characteristics,"I will try to remain as objective as I can, considering good people I care for still work there, but I do feel it important to warn professionals making mid career moves to avoid this company to preserve the integrity of your resume.

Incompetence reigns supreme across departments with management seemingly incapable of performing basic tasks like planning and strategy which is exacerbated by the posturing and animosity between the business and IT. 

To clarify, I lay the blame on business side management that is unequipped to lead a program that requires several projects to be executed. A normal glide path for work like this would require numerous sessions to plan the effort out and intelligently hire to meet the need, starting with experienced FINTECH transformation personnel. 

Incomprehensibly, the effort was staffed before any tools were identified for an unplanned effort with millions of dollars at risk. Not only that, the staff brought in were not skilled in strategic planning, project management, data management or business process mapping to inform the strategic decisions. Consistent refusal to properly staff a sufficient management hierarchy for each track led to a mixed up hierarchy that caused confusion and inter group battles. 

Lower level staff were left to strategize the program and lay out data architecture beyond their authority level with no guidance while being forced to participate in ""onsites"" aimed at misdirecting senior management from the real issues not being dealt with, by presenting silly sharepoint site demos. 

There were numerous bungled HR issues tied to one highly disruptive sociopath that has seen half a dozen direct and indirect firings and resignations due to not protecting whistleblowers or managing the bad egg out. A culture of fear has replaced hope for staff brought to this company desperately trying to contribute in some meaningful way. 

While IT was not the party at fault in the animosity in project meetings, I have to say that the entire technological infrastructure of this company is about 15 years behind any standard modern company trying to use data intelligently. Attempts to bring in new technology are highly contentious and politically driven and take over a year to get through stage one initiation with new hire project staff, leaving business staff with no work while they wait for promised technology and process that should have been in place before they were hired.

If you are looking at this company as a career move, I urge you to look at the thousands of other companies out there and consider what a move to this company will do to your career. I speak from experience when I say that every other company in the valley knows about the exodus from MUFG from every department including HR and the desperation in candidates trying to leave after a year. It is orders of magnitude more difficult to be taken seriously by a recruiter who knows you will take any position to escape the rolling dumpster fire that is MUFG. 

Technical professionals: Do not be fooled by job ads that seem to infer positions for data experts. There is nothing there for you, but disappointment and frustration as you are forced to work with excel and access 2010 to do analytical work. 

On the benefits side all is pretty decent with the exception of educational funding that requires you ask permission to participate prior to the current year to get access to the funds. Even if you start after the first of the year: Too bad. Wait till next year. 

The 401k funding model is broken. Employees contribute all year long but the company does not contribute unless you stay until the 31st of December then they fund you around February. It is incomprehensible to me how 140,000 financial professionals are ok with losing out on profit returns for investments for a full calendar year, but no one seems to care. Its a major competitive disadvantage."

- Lots of good staff hired from other banks
- Japanese culture is at least respectful of staff at all seniority levels
- Somehow still turns a profit, but the accuracy of the financial reporting in my experience is highly dubious","- MUFG has absolutely no clue how to run a global bank, and honestly is not taken very seriously by other major banks in the market. It is a stain on your CV, and if you are coming from a Tier 1 bank you may struggle to get interviews if you decide to leave.
- No coherent strategy whatsoever (just look at the share price performance over the last 5 years compared with any other major bank)
- 2 tier quasi-racist system. If you are not Japanese, you will literally be called a ""Non-Japanese"" staff member in official communication. All Japanese ex-pat staff (anywhere from 10-100% of any given department) are on completely different employment contracts to local hires (despite doing the same job), and only Japanese managers have any control over them. I once saw an email showing the results of an internal survey, split between Japanese and Non-Japanese staff outcomes - can you imagine if RBS reported outputs of English and Non-English or White and Non-White staff? Somehow this is considered acceptable.
- Complete and utterly institutionalised resistance to change. The intranet right now sums it up, the main article says ""now is the time for change"" with an image of the 4 top MUFG executives, all Japanese, all men, all the same age, all wearing the same suit and tie. I could not understand a word of what was written in that article. Change is actively resisted on a daily basis by Japanese staff from graduate to CEO level.
- Extremely inefficient. Face-time culture. Junior Japanese staff work until midnight every night but are producing nothing of substance.
- Extreme box-ticking compliance culture. Everyone must always comply with all policies & procedures at all times. Nobody ever questions or improves the policies, they just must be complied with. 
- The local staff who have been in the bank over 10 years are either corrupted manipulators of the system (for seniority/financial gain), or have had their will broken and just drag themselves into work each day."

There is an expectation that things will work 100% of the time, and will quickly dispense blame. Hard work and dedication to your craft are not really appreciated here it seems. It all really depends on the manager you work for and whether you belong to the network of plugged in managers. Finally, the east-west political battles are destroying morale.

As with any bank, the older generation (80s and 90s style bankers) have some issues, particularly the ones who didn't grow up in the bank. 

2. Improving product suite/risk appetite. We are making a strong push down the credit spectrum into non-IG loans and Capital Markets underwritings. Historically the bank's been a IG loan shop. That's pretty boring. But with the push into Sponsor's, Mid-Corporate, and Leveraged Capital Markets, there's a lot of new energy and business prospects for hungry young bankers. 

3. US Management is amazing. The US Head of CIB (including many of the group heads reporting to him) is the best leader I've come across in banking. He is accessible to Juniors, and treats everyone from Analysts to MDs like they matter to the firm. Additionally, he understands exactly what the bank needs to do to be competitive (see Pro #2). 

Two years ago, I hated the bank. Now, I can honestly say it's the best bank I've worked for. As a former Bulge Bracket investment banker, I thought I would just force myself to stay in the industry just for compensation. Now I can say I honestly love what I do, largely due to MUFG.","1) Progress is very slow

2) Diversity is poor. Women, Black, and Brown people are non existent starting at VP and above. There are basically no black MDs, and there doesn't seem to be any push to change that, as the focus is becoming women. 

3) Change is very slow. MUFG is basically Goldman Sachs in Japan, so Japanese management seems to think we have more weight globally than what we do. That causes some slowness in reacting to the market. That is changing. The Global Head of CIB (an American) recognizes what needs to be done, and is working hard to improve the next generation of senior bankers with strong training programs, as well as empowering US Management to push for necessary changes to be more competitive. However, it's not happening fast. 

However, unlike some bulge bracket banks the lack of diversity is not malicious, but rather the way they've recruited in the past. Additionally, despite no diversity, the institution is a true meritocracy, not an old Boys club where you feel marginalized by MDs for being a minority. MUFG actually cares about its people."

The good news is that both global and regional management are constantly connected with the global business as a whole and as such are able to respond very quickly to the changing needs of the market, their customers, and their employees.  Morale is very good and in constant focus.  Unlike a lot of companies, MUFG actually do operate by their tag line.

With over 25 years in the industry, I can say fairly confidently that financial institutions do not do well with change (no pun intended).

Weird and possibly shady activity behind very senior management that has led them to resign suddenly (quite a repetitive history of this).

Mid year and end year performance review process is extremely tedious and unnecessary. 

Some coworkers do nothing but complain about other people all day, instead of focusing on getting tasks done, they are focused on criticizing people and trying to get them fired.

Other individuals do nothing but go and socialize at group meetings and ""innovative teams"", and maybe take 2 hour lunches, and also come into work late and leave much earlier.

A good amount of people work hard and never get the promotions they've deserved for years on end.

HR does not do anything about staff that has been reported to for inappropriate behavior and reluctance to get along with others.

Some staff know each other from outside and end up getting positions at a higher title than they are truly qualified for (possible nepotism)?

Also some staff that love to walk around huffing and puffing and talking about their previous positions at other companies and practically giving those companies free advertising.  If you liked it there so much then why didn't you just stay? Some staff with previous external positions feel so entitled coming into this bank, an example is if you worked for any federally known governing body. Honestly, if you were doing such a big job there and came to some other position more menial, it's hard to believe and rather discerning to wonder how much of an impact you could have made there too.

That's the other thing-making an impact; people with huge salaries come to their day jobs to do absolutely nothing while getting paid ridiculously large salaries just prancing around or maybe sleeping at the desk, or in meetings.

You gotta ask for everything, the CCO of Compliance is extremely rude and insensitive to the people that work in the department. Most upper management does not care to know who you are. Just do work and be disrespected.

Terrible merger with Union Bank, a lot of good things from MUFG went away for employees."

All decisions are made collaboratively, so that even decisions at should be made at the lower levels of the organization are subject to significant oversight. Changes are glacial, at best, and agreement of multiple levels are required before moving forward. Little (if any) change is made in the organization without some other organization having made it first.
