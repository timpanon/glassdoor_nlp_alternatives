534,Maybank,"Good benefit, bad management",2020-02-02,1.0,Analyst,"Benefits, the bonus, the company brand","Based on Group Compliance management and also the Hiring team:

1. They don't care about your work/life balance. Yes it's banking, and yes we are actually human being. Don't compare us (latest by 2 years tenure) with the seniors where they have to work till 12am because you guys don't have enough people back then! 
2. High expectations with a very, very low internal customer appreciations and no welfare whatsoever. Perfect examples are the ones located at Akademi Etiqa. The elevator, the toilets, the office itself, sometimes you have to deal with toilet smells in the morning, sometimes you'll get stuck in the lift for 30 mins or so, sometimes you have to stayback with no aircond on, no place for you to dine, no proper pantry, the microwave is placed next to the printer and shredding machine, etc. 
3. The higher management for team Mantas and eSTR is the worst nightmare. Mantas Head (no name mention), he's a dummy who just sits and listens but nothing is happening. He will repost what people sent to him via email but he doesn't really understand what's the content. Also the oldest TL in Mantas, is the worst of a person behind the scarf she wears. She's demotivating and heartless. Be very careful. While the Estr team, they basically just aim one group of people and talk bad about that group of people openly. One indian lady TL, she's the worst. She'd ask stupid questions about everything on a self explanatory matter. She creates hate.
4. HR is all over the place, one time you speak with this one, the next day is another. You have to explain again and again, and is it obvious they trying to avoid to do more work. No dedication, and no integrity. Out of 100, only 10 is reliable. I hope.
5. The system.
6. They just started with QA system hence their Checkers are with their own styles and if you're not in luck, you'll get the worst.
7. Ask you to do 10 alerts per day, but the system is out of date, not giving you to apply for OT when you stayback, they have done their so called motion study that maker can achieved 6 alerts per day in average. BUT that's it, they've gone back to 10 and no OT is provided for you to finish up the rest 4."

1. If you are planning to retire here
2. Still a very traditional balance sheet based bank - all other products, please stay clear

5. Depending on which department you are with, you can have a lot of work life balance  - IF you are in the right team -","Poor:
1. Strategy, where they are not benchmarking themselves correctly or just fail to recognize issues. 
2. Which leads to poor communication of goals and perhaps this is also due to..
3. Poor management that can't manage but yet are compensated well with the exception of the junior...
4. Compensation (typically 10 to 15% below market) and the bonus tries desperately to keep you in the company. After these years, its really not worth it at all. Its very difficult to leave the bank after being associated with it.
5. This leads to a poorer hiring pool and human capital
6. At the back of this is an ancient infrastructure as the group fears to invest
7. Perhaps too many cheerleaders and too little doers. Work life balance is celebrated but not practice - makes you wonder why are we being paid lesser than market.
8. Their risk and credit policies are a joke when you compare to regional players and doesn't reflect in their strategy
9. Negative environment, everyone hangs around just for the bonus but tries to do minimal
