VPs and Senior Analysts are well-prepared with deep and insightful knowledge on their expertise field.

Quite acute and intelligent people you can stumble upon. 

There are some strong bounds towards teamwork among numerous working groups.

Good company to deep into credit and risk fields; exits towards Banks, IBs, Credit-oriented companies are attainable due to Moody's experience.","Old-fashioned and rigid corporate structure with no clear path for progression at any level.

Direct managers are typically biased on their promotions and work-allocation decisions.

Managers tend to lean towards non-relevant analytic issues to justify their paychecks. Deep analytical discussions are put aside in many stances to favor manager's interests as well as commercial relationships.

Innovation is not well accepted in many cases.

Sadly, during the last years the company tended to hire people with no real skills or knowledge to perform their jobs, resulting thus in low-quality services for Moody's clients."

They don’t offer you less than the work you are doing. So it is fair for the most part.,In my own experience I feel that no one was honest about the role that I was going into. Working two weeks of work I did two days of training and found out everything I learned in the first training was wrong and told to dismiss it. I was having issues with getting access to the time system so I could not clock in and management did nothing to try to assist. I did ask my trainer what to do in this situation and he told me my supervisor should have been able to manually enter my time instead he gave me the best words of of “you don’t clock on you don’t get paid.” I tried to be patient but I quickly realized the position was unorganized and not something I can see myself doing later on in the year.

Management that care about top and bottom line like their life depends on it.","Management loves to play lip service from DEI to ESG to work life balance. 

They will say please take care of your health in one sentence, then serve your overlords at all cost the next. 

CFO leads by coming back the day after his wife gave birth. Obviously, family don't come first at Moody's. Only money and labor matters. It shows with bottom level analysts working at the office until midnight or more when things are normal pre-Covid and invading Saturday and Sunday nights during Covid. 

The management would send out surveys to employees asking them how they are doing then turn around either do nothing for years or just complains why the internal score is so bad. 

If they donated $10k to charity, they will make sure the whole world knows about it."

58,,Structured Finance,2021-12-16,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"Overall the firm is really cheap. NO HOLIDAY PARTY because the firm believes it was too big to have one. That should give you some idea.. There was one year where accounting expectations were too high and they cut bonuses in a record year lol

If you're looking to get work-life balance, and you should for the compensation offered to new analysts, avoid Structured Finance. 
Structured Finance groups have extremely bad hours, and many of them have bad cultures. If you end up in structured finance, try to join Esoterics ABS or Structured Credit because the people there are really nice. If you can, avoid Consumer ABS (Autos,Credit Cards) and RMBS.

Your next question might be does that mean I'll get a larger bonus? The answer is NO 

The firm is becoming top-heavy, lots of managers and people try passing on their work to you. In 2017 the firm rolled out a program where people are clustered together and led by a direct manager/staffer whose full-time job is to manage you. I have no idea what these people do, but a manager in this role can make or break your experience. This person is what I would call a politician in training, and their goal is to end up in a more senior managing position or to leap-frog their way into a senior analytical role within the firm while having really cushy hours. Imagine a staffer at an investment bank that works on deals and also assigns work to others on the team, but without the responsibility of having to work on a deal.


How to survive here: Kiss a##, and be smart. Don't volunteer to do more work or take initiative. This isn't the place for it. Promotion schedules have already been decided and there is nothing you can do. You do, however, have to fight for your worth and be vocal in promotion meetings. If you do not say anything, your promotion timeline may be delayed. It's just how things are.",look at the above section

-  Exceptional Work Life Balance 
- Company does seem to care about personal well being 
- Intellectual culture 
- Great location 
- flexible accommodations

There’s a lot of pros to working at Moody’s.","Where to begin? 

Since this is a quasi government job, expect bureaucracy and regulation and compliance. Did I mention compliance? Yes. There’s a lot of it. 

As a credit analyst, your job is 80% is compliance / systems and 20% actual credit. 

This is the fundamental problem: Moody’s is a toll collector, where the business simply exist in perpetuity. 

Depending on your perspective, this is where ambition goes to die and where comfort is maximized. 

Because of this, the room to grow as a junior or rising junior employee doesn’t exist.  And as senior employee, you’re likely to not want to mentor your junior employees. It’s a lackluster competitive environment. 

Run if you want to grow! Run if you want purpose."

If you enjoy financial research and writing, it can be an intellectually fulfilling position. Moody's analysts cover a much smaller set of companies than a typical buy-side analyst, and have direct dialog with executives at rated companies. The vast majority of co-workers are pleasant and cooperative. There is a very strong focus on D&I, and many women among the managers. Work schedules can be very flexible but on the flip side very unpredictable when there are deals/market developments. As a corporation, Moody's is increasingly focused on innovation.","Pay is low relative to banks and buy-side. Promotions require hard work, lots of publications, and additional projects. The bar gets higher every year with respect to expectations. Moody's is becoming a lot more dynamic, and expects much more from its analysts than ratings work. Impactful research, media interviews, and investor outreach is required. US Corporate Finance, while both growing and a backbone of profitability, is taking a backseat to Europe, with many senior managers now coming outside the US (in part due to regulations)."

277,,Mixed Bag,2020-10-26,3.0,Aa2,"- Job security. Pay is not the worst after you get an AA 2 position. However, people in the industry will make career and financial progress a lot faster than you along the same period of time.","- Health insurance sucks. They barely cover anything and will force you to pay your deductible.

- Promotions are really slow, and the culture is such that you have to be aggressive and push for a promotion or else it will never come on its own, or it'll come more slowly. 

-Very seldom is your full-bonus paid out, and your year over year progression will often be a whopping 1%. This make you wonder why so many senior people are staying at the company.. This is because at the top salaries are really good, the firm used to offer a pension, financial and career progression used to be much faster and greater. No reason to leave Moody's when you have work life balance, are making 200k + and have a pension. 

-There are so many managers, and not enough rating analysts. Additionally, there is a hierarchy and you'll be treated as a junior analyst.

-There are so many procedures and compliance related grunt work that must be done for every deal, and this work must be done flawlessly as there are internal teams that are reviewing these forms and trying to catch as many mistakes as possible. 

- Exit opportunities aren't the best. Many firms realize rating analysts perform analysis differently from the market, and may not have a transferable skillset. Ex: Three statement fin statement analysis isn't done in the corporate side, as the emphasis is to calculate line items and input it in moody's models. In Structured finance, a lot of the structure analysis is performed using a proprietary model. 

-WFH - this depends on the team. Before covid, some teams made a big deal about WFH, others are more lenient.

-Work life balance is not guaranteed. Depends on the group culture (how much senior people help out and what they assign to you), turnover, how busy the industry is that you're covering, how staffed your team is."

311,,IT DISASTER,2020-08-06,1.0,Anonymous Employee,Typing here because there's an asterisk requiring it.,"Everything about Moody's is a con. In fact, they con you just to get you in the door. Back in 2018 when I was there the Transformation project was still underway led by the blind leading the incompetent off a cliff into shards of glass floating atop boiling oil. Meetings on meeting, to present at more meetings, to have recap of meetings. Cutthroat environment with MDs encouraging harsh behavior between team members, complacency to women-hating and backstabbing rewarded, and total retaliation for standing up for yourself or others. BDS and TO were the worst of it and happy to hear that they are both defunct. How many millions were wasted?"
312,,Easy to get trapped in your role,2020-07-31,2.0,IT Senior Analyst,"- Great work-life balance, easy-going colleagues, the culture within IT is generally collaborative and non-confrontational. 

- There is a growing willingness to innovate beyond the legacy tech stack. 

- The 1WTC office location is nice. 

- Employees in NYC are given opportunities to volunteer yearly.","- A recent overhaul in the IT leadership has completely changed the organizational structure and culture within Moody's IT. Frequent downsizing created a culture of fear and apprehension which did not previously exist within the organization and undermined the previous culture of collaboration and openness. Employees who would otherwise not have left are looking for new jobs due to uncertainty and lack of transparency from upper management.

- It is easy to become complacent and trapped in your role with little opportunity to move on or expand your skillset. A lot of lip service is given to professional development but there is little follow-through or support. 

- Mid-level direct managers will hold you back from career advancement. 

- Legacy, proprietary tech stack in many areas means experience is not easily transferrable.

- Performance evaluation process is not transparent leading to the general impression that advancements and promotions are not awarded based on individual merit but rather on internal politics. Path for advancement is unclear.

- Lack of institutional technical knowledge and over-reliance on vendors means that employees who exhibit technical interest or capabilities are overlooked; more emphasis is placed on soft skills."

Management has not done a good job of offloading the administrative work to a middle office function. You work a lot! I joined Moody’s with the notion of lower pay for work/life balance yet I have no balance. Promotions are SLOW and you have to fight for one. Over the years, Moody’s has even added more layers so that there are more levels to climb through - but it still didn’t lead to faster promotions. Annual pay increases are basically 3% and under which is a joke. It’s actually amazing how managers are able to keep a straight face when telling you the pay bump at year end. Finally, people who joined mid-2000s and earlier not only get higher comp but they also have pension! There are so many people here who are lazy but will never leave because they are well compensated. Management is trying to put all the dollars into earnings (coincidentally, I believe they are compensated in stock) so you need to fight for every penny and I do mean pennies and not dollars and definitely not thousands of dollars."

i have seen my friends leaving Moody's without having other job offer in hand because of depression.

399,,Comfortable,2019-10-16,3.0,Analyst,Moody's is a great place to work at if your main priority is work-life balance in the finance industry. It is also a pretty good steppingstone to asset management at least in London. Generally friendly and pretty bright people.,"I've only been here for a year and some months but have seen the culture deteriorate significantly in this time. This is due to cost cutting due to ""poor"" results (double digit growth, but missed target...) They sold/rented out a floor and moved people around, fired some, no budget for anything at all. Senior employees with company stock probably don't care, but junior people are leaving in droves. But this seems to be a part of the plan. The company seldom fires, it just pushes people out. Which leads me to the main issue, this organisation is the direct opposite of a meritocracy. There's tons of politics and they would rather promote someone attending Diversity & Inclusion events (or fitting a minority) than people actually performing well. This is a good place to land after you're too tired to work hard and just want to take it easy with pretty smart people with a nice salary and you're willing to accept nonsense politics."

The company used to have the people you actually work with have more say in your advancement, but recently, the company introduced middle managers who don't see/understand your work as much, but have a large say in your advancement, so sucking up matters way more than performance.
Also, due to poor management of handling regulatory compliance, there are teams of people who exist to try and catch you not checking the right box so you can get your bonus taken away.

With that being said, some teams/managers are more open towards it than others. Moody's has a strong diversity and inclusion environemnt. They offer numerous volunteer events and D&I events through several ERGs. The office building itself is beautiful and the office is pretty nice. The desks and cubicles are nicer than your typical gray office cubicle. However, there is no free coffee bar with an awesome barista or gym. There is one cafeteria and a pantry on every floor.

For the most part, the people are nice and intelligent. 9/10 times, if you need help, there will be someone there to help you or give you advice. For the most part managers are willing to work with you to help you out , or put you on a high visibility project. It is a small to medium size company so you can have more visibility to the C-suite.","While I like what Ray and the board are doing, some members in higher positions, i am not a fan of and question how they got there (or why they are still there).  A con for me but if you are friends with the right person or liked by the right person, you will have a much easier time moving up or going anywhere in the company. On the flip side, if you are not friends with the right person, it can be an arduous journey. While not necessarily in silos, it seems like every team has a different set of rules on how they can or cannot move up the corporate ladder.

544,,Consider your Work Life Balance,2018-04-25,4.0,Anonymous Employee,For the most part Moody's employees have a significantly better work life balance than other parts of the financial industry.  While the hours can at time be long and perhaps occasionally include weekends it is much lower than at banks for equivalent roles.  Furthermore the company promotes working remotely initiatives and in general is the most open and diverse employer I have worked for.,The downside of course to this better work life balance is compensation levels that are markedly below banks and a promotion and salary increase schedule that is far more set and bureaucratic.

- exposure to top management of clients at an early stage of your career
- learn some financial modelling, although fairly limited compared to what you can learn at banks etc.
- Some teams within certain LOBs are really fun and do a lot of things together, like grabbing a drink on Friday after work or doing something on the weekend","- bad salary progression and even worse bonus. The entry level salary for an associate analyst is decent in London but the bonus is very low (I'm talking 1.8k after taxes kind of bonus). Salary progression is really bad. It doesn't really get better unless you get promoted
- career progression is terrible. They have tried to change this by introducing a different organisational structure in 2017, but nothing really has changed. Going from AA3 to Analyst takes on average 5 years. Way too long considering you pretty much do the exact same type of work as an Analyst!
- Boring work. This is subjective of course but I don't think that anyone finds putting numbers into Scorecards to get a rating to be exciting. Basically, a lot of the people here pretend that they do real finance work (and sometimes also stay until midnight to prove they are like bankers) but at the end of the day the product is mostly putting financial metrics into a Scorecards and then write a report about the outcome."

Friendly team environment. 

User's are generally friendly and easy to support.

Diverse mix of employees and emphasis on diversity and inclusion makes them an industry leader. 

Generous compensation for what I was doing.","There is nothing “Technical” about this role. Its basic 1st line/hardware support/customer service. Nothing much to learn, lots of monitor deployments to waste your time with. The systems engineering team have no presence outside of NY and don’t provide anything helpful anyway in terms of technology or tools. 

Several third party vendors that carry out tasks at a very granular level so difficult to find the right person. Support from most of those vendors is terrible, they simply don’t care. They have finally decided to streamline and bring in one to take over at least three of those companies so maybe things will improve. 

People will ignore your emails, including senior management. You have to CC in someone important if you need support from people or for them to simply do their actual job.

I suggested many improvements but kept getting  knock-backs. Senior people came up with excuses probably because they were protecting their highly paid positions. 

The only projects you are asked to get involved with are the ones that nobody else wants to do. You’re not asked what you’d like to do. Many broken processes which can create chaos for users.  

In term of progression it is non-existent unless you are already in a senior role or if you are very young and seen to have potential. You can’t be in your thirties and have potential or existing talent. 

Also how about some regular department drinks once in a while rather then only if a senior person from the US comes over with their credit card. Not much team bonding."

Employees buy into and live the Employee Value Proposition, which states, ""Our Views Matter. So Will Yours."" It's a flat organization where junior level people can work closely with senior level people and both can gain knowledge from each other.  The offices are beautiful, the location is great, and the people are collegial and collaborative. Moody's business model works.","The Bad: Then there is the HR Department. In a company that employees are genuinely proud to be a part of, the morale in this group is abysmal. These are the people who run the employee engagement survey and spend a lot of manpower to find ways to retain the best talent, while their own employees leave in droves for better jobs. There have been several occasions when employees have left without another job waiting for them.

 The Ugly:  the Leadership & Organizational Development group, since there is no leadership or organization at the top of the department. In the past few years there has been a nearly 100% turnover. That is unacceptable.

I single out L&OD because the senior leaders, who are the key drivers of the Employee Value Proposition, seem to live by the mantra, ""Our views matter. Yours do when they mirror ours."" The senior leadership is rewarded for implementing early 21st Century ideas to enhance L&OD, meanwhile sucking up valuable resources by taking leadership training instead of providing that training to someone who could actually benefit from it. Incompetence and lack of communication skills are rewarded, hence the turnover.

Every metric is ranked by the book!

Moody's Analytics goes by different titles all together.  An Associate Director to Director is the range of an Assistant Vice President at Moody's Investor Services division.   Someone on the outside looking an can easily misinterpret the seniority of an individual, which is why its important to read between the lines of the functions and responsibilities involved

At its best, when your manager knows how to manage and communicate the needs of the team to senior management, it is a great place to work.

Although there is a lot of admin, Moody's makes an effort to give you opportunities to learn new skills and develop.","At its worst, your manager will wash their hands of you while you are drowned by compliance demands that cannot be filled due to insufficient technology.

Clearly you will not get promoted that quickly at an agency unless you are lucky and your seniors leave for other positions externally. When this happens it can mean that the worst analysts end up acting as bottlenecks in the company, though not always, as often they are found out and are moved to a non analytic position. 

Compliance seem to go out of their way to be slow and unhelpful when needed to give an opinion, but very quick to decide an infringement has been made, their culture is not helpful to the organisation and, in the end, counter productive."

They have since tried to bring their IT up to basic standards but have been using the same incompetent middle managers that got them in the mess in the first place, with predictable disastrous results.  They churn through consultants and flog those that are visa slaves to death.

- It's probably a known fact that you won't earn quite what you might at an investment bank working at Moody's (although the pay is decent and the bonus is all cash, equity being separate) but you will learn loads and get exposed to complex work and senior stakeholders early on.
- Moody's has a real commitment to Diversity and Inclusion, and they have made huge strides in this area in recent years.  It's a very international business so you'll always year a mix of languages and the buzz of the cultural mix is an integral part of Moody's culture.","- Moody's has grown rapidly in the last 5-10 years (organic + acquisitions) and is playing catch-up now they can no longer operate like a small business.  Decision making is still pretty centralised though, which can slow things down.
- Being a US company, there's a tendency to take the US position as the starting point, when in actual fact the majority of Moody's business is now non-US.  This is not unique to Moody's though."

Other perks are the office is very modern, people are nice, and the company cafeteria is inexpensive and fairly good.  Moody's spends a lot of effort to promote diversity and is very LGBT friendly.","Warning: working on the ratings side of the business is different from the rest of Moody's. Those preparing the ratings have to deal with a higher pressure environment when you factor in the unpredictability of your workload (transactions pop up out of nowhere), compliance breathing down your neck (they monitor everything you do), communicating externally with investors and issuers (they hate you when you downgrade them, sorry?), constantly dealing with IT issues, and the never ending revolver door of people leaving for higher paying jobs at banks.  The turnover rate for associate analysts in 2014 was especially high (40%) for a good reason.  People with ambition who can do this job well are in high demand at banks for much higher compensation.  If you're doing this to just work 2 years and then jump to a bank, then it might make sense, otherwise just go straight to the banks if you can. 

People will be frustrated by the lack of raises (less than 2% per year!)."

Run like a BPO (data collection) than KPO (analysis). Management lies in saying that they are into high-end research work
Job description and designations are deceiving - You might get hired as an Senior Associate Vice President (SAVP) in Equity/Quants Research but all you end up is doing elementary data entry
The learning is close to zero and the managers do not encourage/support outside the box thinking
The managers suffer with inferiority complex and are living example of the theory of ""white mens burden"" they are of the perception that the guys sitting in New York are the God and they are always right
Loyalty (lack of opportunity) is rewarded with promotions. These leftovers control the place, add to cost, create nuisance as they get fancy job titles

The environment is very diverse with employees from all over the world. Work life balance is still there (apart from couple employees who like long hours) and the additional benefit of business travel is immeasurable as you really get exposed to top management at a very early stage of your career and build your knowledge and confidence quickly. After 1.5 years I was receiving about 5 calls a week from headhunters so the Associate Analysts from Moody's are sought after, and those who were the best quickly left - so the name Moody's very much matters which is another plus.","The main problem is regulation and the administrative burden that comes with it and which means that you will find yourself spending 25% of your time on admin tasks (as an Associate Analyst). Also a lot of senior/lead analysts are not motivated at all. They are paid very good money for their (sometimes limited) knowledge and they seem to treat this job as a retirement holidays with business trips abroad, while being over reliant on junior staff - on one hand this is a great opportunity to learn for juniors, on the other you may find yourself doing literally everything while the analyst is 'working from home' and signing his name under the research paper which you wrote entirely yourself (again though this depends on the team and sometimes you have those teams where the senior/lead analysts do everything while you just update excel data, which must be extremely boring). In my case it was very demotivating. IT systems are also terrible so you will often not be able to work smoothly, and I will not even discuss how unintuitive they are.

If you are a lead/senior analyst I see very limited number of cons as you can largely dictate your own pace of work, delegate boring/low-value adding tasks to juniors who are assigned to you, have limited responsibility as it is always the 'cttee decision', so if money is ok I would always go for it."

In general people leave the office between 5 and 6. Pay can be good for the level of effort required.  Travel is very minimal.","Operating Environment:  The office layout (at least at Headquarters - 7 WTC in NYC) does not facilitate interaction.  People call each other on the phone in neighboring offices rather than meet with them face to face.  Does not feel like a collaborative, innovative youthful company so be aware of this is you are coming from management consulting or technology.  The internal technology (mobile devices, data systems, workflow systems, personal computers, remote work technologies etc.) are all probably 10 years behind.  I was surprised when I started at how antiquated the technology was.  There does not appear to be a lot of appetite for updating technologies so the outlook going forward remains negative. 

Culture: Moody's seems to have a very conservative business culture.  Decisions can take a long time to get made and can result in ""analysis paralysis"".  The firm feels and looks older from the design of the office to the people filling them, not a great place for a recent entrant from a top tier program looking to develop. Very limited training and development offerings.  There do not seem to be a lot of team building events. 

Overall this experience has not met up to expectations compared to previous top 25 best places to work firms."
