2,,Decent company but not all departments are good,2022-04-13,3.0,,"Decent company, India Leadership has been trying to give equal opportunity to all despite different job roles","Whatever good culture has been embedded in value system of Morningstar is undone by pathetic management of Equity Data. From 2020 onward after the Head of Equity Data changed, situation has deteriorated more. Top level Managers are very incompetent in Project Management, Technological understanding & financial data knowledge. They just do lip service. Many of them don't know even the basics like pulling reports from JIRA & need external help. They put projects in bad shape from start because of their surface level knowledge of dataset they are supposed to build & start blaming subordinates at 11th hour. They only confuse subordinates with unclear directions. Equity Data is fast becoming more BPO like culture and wouldn't recommend anyone to work here unless one could find anything better."

114,,Great Place to Work All Things Considered,2022-02-06,5.0,Private Equity Analyst,"It's easy to harp on the flaws within any given organization, and Morningstar's no exception. People will always want to get paid incrementally better, have a little bit larger of a research budget, a cleaner internal technology stack, or more associates. It's probably true that Morningstar doesn't have the same degree of access to those things as the largest investment banks or buy-side shops, but neither is that the niche we purport to occupy.

Morningstar is a phenomenal place to work, with a tremendous cohort of coworkers. Perhaps my only real qualm is that for the reasons outlined above (in tandem with the grass always seeming greener on the other side), we tend to see elevated turnover, which is always a bummer. Nevertheless, I've never worked at a place where I am more engaged, given more autonomy, and better enjoy the company of my coworkers, which I'd never expected to find in a corporate environment. The work is as stimulating as you want it to be, you're surrounded by sharp, driven peers, and the company really trusts you to get done what needs to get done. It may not be a forever role, but the company really bends over to take care of employees. That's not to say things are perfect, but they're awfully good.

The firm operates as close to a pure meritocracy as you'll find in finance, without a requisite period of paying your dues, grabbing coffees, and mindlessly wading through data while on-call in an associate role. You can carve out balance (not to say there aren't 80 hour weeks scattered in there, but you ARE signing up for a finance gig), and they encourage you to use unlimited PTO. I've never had a vacation request denied, and while there's always work to be done, the freedom to choose how to tackle it and what to prioritize is worth a massive raise to me. Further, we've really leaned into a hybrid work environment, which I suspect will yield meaningful long-term retention and productivity benefits, once empirical data is available to that effect. 

A lot hinges on what you want from a career. Who you want to be. How much you need to satisfy those needs. While the veracity of historical quotes can always be challenged, it's been said that Andrew Carnegie supposed that the amount of money a man (person) needed to be happy was ""one more dollar."" If that's true for you, perhaps you're better off worshipping at the altar of a large investment bank. As for me, I love working for this company. There are flaws, there are funnies, there are foibles, and it's an amazing place to be employed.","We aren't paid IB or buyside wages. Our niche is long-term, and we won't pay for the massive data packages and API's that startups peddle to our peers, which can leave you feeling a half-step behind the market at times. And elevated turnover, particularly among younger employees, can see a decent chunk of friends head out the door each year."

7) The role you were hired for may become obsolete in a matter of months due to lack of strategic direction and you will be expected to resolve problems without any control or influence on the factors causing the problem
8) You will be setup for failure from day 1 and be made a scapegoat for problems that cannot be resolved even by your manager

176,,Poor DEI & maternity/paternity leave policy,2022-01-06,3.0,Business Development,"Collegiate atmosphere
Willingness to truly empower investors
Benefits incl: CIGNA medical insurance, Virgin subsidized gym membership, Cycle to Work Scheme, optional dental health plan, have a stock purchasing scheme (but only worth is if you're going to be at the company for at least 4 years as your money gets tied up longer term into it).","Despite the company externally portraying themselves as a DEI champion, they are very far behind most companies in the same industry. Once such example is their maternity/paternity policy. The company only just increased their enhanced maternity pay period to 18 weeks from 10 weeks before. However, for sales people they don't account for commission earnings despite government guidance to incl all earnings into the weekly earnings calculation used to calculate maternity/paternity pay. Furthermore, the government still taxes your pay during this leave at the tax rate associated with your total earnings, not your base salary meaning Morningstar's ""policy"" is inconsistent with that of the UK government. 
Men only get 6 weeks off in the UK when their child is born so aren't being treated equally to women. More and more companies in Morningstar's industry are providing 6-9months paid leave for both men and women at the same time.

Diversity statistics are poor and predominantly men in senior/key decision making positions.

Do not report their gender pay gap analysis. Unclear why this transparency is not provided.

Weak HR Team: not knowledgeable on policy, provide false information, share confidential information, and are there to protect the business, not the employee. Anything you raise with them will be met with hostility and defence. An employees concerns aren't addressed as their sole approach is quashing any genuine concerns you may have."

I really enjoy the opportunities to work in multiple teams on different projects across 2 years. I also want to highlight the stretch project opportunities which are typically shorter than a rotation but also give me exposure to other teams' work. I'm glad to have a great mentor who has been through the program  to guide me thanks to the mentorship program. Morningstar adopts an open culture where employees are welcome to schedule coffee chats with anyone in the company and I benefit a lot from that too!,The organization is decentralized due to many recent acquisitions. Different teams may adopt different work styles so switching teams and getting adapted takes time (the other side of flexibility).

-Generally friendly people
-Associate team seems ideal for very junior in career recent college graduates (maybe 1-2 years of customer service experience), on the flip side it may feel that training is too elementary for those with more years of client facing experience
-Company sponsored happy hours, currently providing daily free lunch, decent perks in office","-Senior management seems out of touch with the difficulties less tenured CSM's experience while new management lacks product knowledge 
-Issues with data discrepancies depending on which system used to pull given data
-Generally archaic systems, the environment broadly lacks efficient streamlined processes + existing process documentation (SOP's) are often incomplete/inaccurate/outdated
-Required in office time with a huge emphasis on three+ days per week, this may or may not matter but the language used within customer success can be pretty aggressive about this which feels less flexible than tech or some other related environments
-The company is experiencing tremendous turnover, great people continue to leave, and ironically management makes a point to defend this by creating turnover stats that sugarcoat the problem and clients continue to voice their frustration as it impacts them greatly
-Pay could be better, quarterly bonus structure isn't super clear and associates have a pooled among peers component so can be negatively affected by peers which may to be clear during the interview process
-Interview process only included meeting customer success management, no associates or regular CSM's, in conjunction with a lack of expressing the struggles of the role and department I think the interview process lacks clarity

- Opportunities to from an offshore office while travelling (only if your manager approved it, even if your manager approved it, your next manager may not like the decision made in the past by your previous manager)

- Work/life balance, most people will leave the office prior to 6PM. However, work emails will still come after hours even though there's nothing urgent.

- Globalised operations for efficiency

- Automation is encouraged generally, although there are certain business lines that are not fully on-board for fear of roles becoming obsolete.

- Quality assurance: the use of LEAN Six Sigma to objectively evaluate many globalised and centralised processes

- Mission statement and values

- Culture and diversity squad","- Some local offices and business lines work in silos and don't exactly subscribe to global initiatives and values.

- Restructure is used as an excuse for redundancies to remove staff who questioned management decisions and expressed distrust in their manager abilities (not at the head office).

- One may be rejected for asking for more work.

- Managers competing with their direct report for work.

- Misallocation of human resources: not hiring enough head count in some business lines while over hiring in others. Not having an objective quantification of man-hours involved in a role.

- While there are some great people as workers, they may not be good as people manager. Micromanagement was occurring. 

- Starting early and staying late is seen as hard-working and not as a sign that the workload is probably too big for one head count.

-Emailing and calling colleagues after hours.

- Manager(s) making unsubstantiated threats to their direct report on the grounds of damaging the business when the business has suffered no loss, the staff member merely raised questions to their managers.

-Manager using performance monitoring without a warning as retaliation to direct report who has raised an issue with his/her manager with HR.

-HR lacks objective and always siding with management

-HR not informed about global decisions made by CEO Kunal Kapoor and instead trumpets decision made by local management which is contrary to Kunal's announcement.

295,,"If you’re considering a position in the Quantitative Research team, please read.",2021-10-08,1.0,Quant,"Morningstar has a great office in Chicago in a convenient location. There are several Employee Resource Groups led by passionate people who organize meaningful events. The 401k match is competitive. Depending on your team, you can meet some well intentioned, fun people.","The Quantitative Research team has been on the decline for over 15 months now. One of the main reasons for that is the current management team.
 
It is a young team that got promoted early with little applied experience after several experienced people left Morningstar. Though promotion from within may sound attractive, it is mostly done to keep costs low. The main detriment of this is that the team’s collective knowledge remains low and you get inexperienced managers who chase titles and develop inflated egos. Also, the associates don’t have much to learn from these people leading to understandable frustration and lack of true career progression (experience rather than titles). When interviewing, remember that you should also take the time to interview the interviewers and gauge for conceptual understanding. The management team does not truly understand what quantitative research and machine learning are but are well versed in buzz words.
 
Many of the managers are part of a clique that continue to support and promote each other for their mutual benefits. Over time you will notice that the allocation of work and promotions will be heavily skewed to them. These people without due process and proven experience get promoted to inflated titles of Associate Director and Director. This is mostly done by posting fake internal jobs that are created and closed immediately after the intended applicants apply. They talk openly about their private WhatsApp group, relationships with each other, and how they conduct meetings and make decisions at each other’s homes. The intention behind the clique is clear. Promote each other and spread within Morningstar so that you have allies throughout the company. This is great for them but really bad for the team because you feel that their personal ambitions are more important than the team’s health. The team has lost trust in management because you can not provide honest feedback and criticism to the members of the clique and when you do, no tangible change occurs.
 
Over 35% of the team in Chicago and Mumbai have left Quant and/or Morningstar over the past year. Please ask during the interviews what the attrition rate of the team is and whether you are a backfill. It’s a major sign when many people are leaving and there is very little growth. Management continues to market it as that the team is very qualified and that tech companies are stealing them away. They choose to blatantly ignore the reasons why the team started to look for opportunities outside in the first place. After several consecutive negative Net Promoter Scores (NPS) and performative feedback collection processes, no change happened besides tenured people leaving. So if the NPS starts to improve, think about why that is and how long till the recent hires realize the problems as well and the NPS scores start to drop again. Human Resources is aware of this trend but either continue to believe the marketing that the management team does or are choosing to ignore it.
 
As a Quant Analyst, you will get well versed in Morningstar data and some SQL but don’t expect to gain any transferable skills related to what an industry Quant Analyst does that you can use outside of Morningstar. As a Software Engineer, be prepared to be isolated and not have other engineers to work with or learn from. Additionally, be prepared to be managed by non engineers who can’t provide you with career development and won’t educate themselves on how to do so. In order to cut costs, this team pushes wearing multiple hats to an extreme, leading to subpar applications that have limited (or no) use within Morningstar.
 
The team may be called Quantitative Research but there isn’t any machine learning or statistical based research being done. There are a few models that the team built several years ago that need to be maintained. Many folks with Data Science and Quant Finance backgrounds have come and left because they were being used to pull data and write data loading scripts. Again, the management themselves have not done this work but are the ones who dictate what work should be done which is counterintuitive to how a research team should be led. Ask the interviewers what the planned projects are and how you would be contributing to them. Try to gauge how concrete these plans are.
 
There’s plenty of reviews about the lower compensation at Morningstar relative to other companies seeking similar skills so I won’t mention that. But I would like to say that within Morningstar’s Research organization there are pay differences as well. On average, Quant gets paid lower than the Equity Research and Manager Research departments. Something to remember when considering Quant is the cumulative effect of lower compensation over many years relative to your peers who chose the other research departments. Additionally, the tradeoff that most people make at Morningstar for lower compensation is a better work life balance. Within Quant, that is not possible. The management sets the tone. When they are constantly messaging and emailing in the evenings and on weekends, it’s hard for you to draw a boundary for yourself. You will feel overworked with little benefit from it.
 
I write this is for all those coming excited out of undergrad or from their PhDs. I want you to know what the team structure and career prospects are so that you can be aware of what you’re getting yourself into and consider this if you are between offers. I know people who started recently who wish that they knew this information. A job is a significant part of your life and getting out of a bad one after recently starting is very difficult. I want you to be able to make an informed decision and not be blindsided."

507,,Beware of the consequences of having Morningstar on your resume,2021-05-16,1.0,Equity Analyst,Alternative to food stamps but not by much,"For anyone reading this, please understand that you should only apply if you facing immediate homelessness. Morningstar is not an interim solution or a stepping stone. When an analyst works for Morningstar, that individual is marked as desperate. Morningstar's fundamental business model hinges on its ability to hire people at irrationally low salaries and provide them with inadequate resources. If you have any doubts about this, commit yourself to having mandatory voice conversations with at least three (3) former employees before accepting your offer. Mandatory!

The worst aspect of working as an analyst for Morningstar is incredible lack of respect and even hostility you receive from both the companies you are covering and clients. Basically, busy investment professionals don't want to devote their time to the lowest paid analysts on Earth. Moreover, with turnover so high, IR departments are tired of telling the same introductory story repeatedly.

Almost as shocking as external attitudes towards Morningstar analysts are the poor treatment and inadequate resources. Lack of tools, broken internal software, offices cramped beyond belief, IT support as bad as Comcast customer service, and no administrative support whatsoever make the job more challenging. Basically, Morningstar has found a way to treat Kellogg/U of C evening MBAs and CFAs like Taco Bell employees. 

Lastly, while the situation at Morningstar is shocking, it tells a larger story. Having so many talented people working under these conditions suggests too many people are pursuing jobs in financial services with false hopes. The sell-side has been decimated in recent years but the larger picture at Morningstar is much worse. It used to be only smaller firms that engaged in such poor behavior. What Morningstar has done is on an massive scale. Churn and burn.

Another oddity is that the salaries are so low, many analysts don't bother negotiating for a better package. Everyone is constantly job searching as 95% don't want to be there in the first place. This presents a problem in Chicago as every possible alternative employer gets inundated by Morningstar resumes."

The culture is primarily laid-back, with some managers and teams being the exception. Goals aren't set ambitiously, or you can game the metrics. It is also notoriously difficult to get fired or significantly demoted, particularly as you become better at your job and can do the same work level in a fraction of the standard time. 

I would also say that our company is generally ethical and cares about our customers. I don't believe we serve them well, but we avoid creating pressures to hurt them. One of our subsidiaries, Pitchbook, offers an excellent product and has tremendous leaders at the time of writing.","Unfortunately, Morningstar also comes with many cons. 

Our products are abysmal. Analyst teams across the company refuse to use them even though they are free. Product teams are run by people who know nothing about our clients, their needs, or what it means to work in the financial service industry. We have been riding the coattails of Morningstar's first-mover advantage in fund data for decades, but it won't last forever. 

After the better part of a decade, our management team finally realized that we couldn't build software ourselves. Numerous senior leaders tried and failed to re-launch our flagship software product with disastrous results. We have now embarked on an M&A buying spree under our visionless CFO, who is laser-focused on the bottom line instead of plotting our future. The unfortunate side-effect is that our relatively small, $1.3 billion in revenue business now straddles almost every imaginable part of the financial service space. Our ""lean"" (read, cheap) operating mentality means that capital investment is scarce, and a lot of our businesses and products are houses of cards. 

Lower pay makes up for the relatively strong list of intangible benefits. Every three years or so, management does the usual dog and pony show of paying expensive consultants to pay-benchmark us. They'll explain that soon you'll see your appropriate pay ranges, your managers will be made aware of gaps, and so on. For one - senior managers know if there are gaps, but they don't know how large they are, and second - the budget they receive for pay increases does not scale with the level of underpayment. Morningstar knows it is underpaying you; they won't fix the problem. Again, people who are 2-levels from the CEO do not have those pay ranges, and per HR, ""they never will."" 

It's okay to pay at the low end of the range, but it makes for another issue: Morningstar employees tend to be of lower-than-average quality. The good ones churn out for better offers, and those that remain are a mixed bag. Morningstar is a poor place for those who want to join a pool of ambitious people. 

As mentioned earlier, we are spread too thin across the industry, meaning you will never feel well equipped to do your job. Your tools will be a 3-year-old underpowered laptop and ancient monitors. If you work in research, you will likely be missing key subscriptions to do your job. Suppose you are lucky enough to get them. In that case, it will only be after begging and pleading through multiple levels of the management chain - up to the executive leadership team. Finally, you've found someone who might be able to spend a few thousand dollars. 

Last but not least, the favored few who flub major products often escape punishment. If you've been with the company long enough, you are nepotistically re-tooled for another chance at incompetence."

575,,Do not work in HR!,2021-04-04,1.0,Human Resources,"flexible PTO policy, sabbatical every 4 years","Human Resource is upper management is a mess, and I say this with my deepest sincerity. Morningstar continues to hire ""upper management"" from within the organization with limited applicable experience for the roles they are filling. They say they are ""hiring from within"" because it builds better understanding of the business but in actuality most of the untalented management is thrust into power due to close friendships with HR leadership. Middle management and individual contributors are not compensated appropriately AND to add to that, work long tiring hours for department heads who don't understand up from down. There continues to be a mass exodus from HR, leaving only the underqualified in charge. Instead of paying team members who have actual HR expertise or any intrinsic drive a fair salary, they hire external contractors and pay double $$ - I have personally witnessed this time and time again, and am BAFFLED that the CEO has not recognized the leak in talent stemming directly from mismanaged teams in HR.  

Don't let my review of HR dissuade you from working for other area's in the company - area's outside of HR have a completely different culture and different senior leadership. However, if you are looking to work in HR, think long and hard before coming here - you won't be able to make a change until senior management is managed out. 

HR does monitor these postings so you can be sure that they will respond with a wordy explanation negating my comments. But as a former colleague, I can tell you - if they had an option to leave, they would."

The company does nothing to discourage this and strives to incorporate every suggestion in the name of ""consensus,"" which leads to awkward, compromised feature implementations and delays in providing anything of value to customers. Customers' feedback is ignored in favor of internal ""expert"" opinions.

The company is constantly into the latest fads - open office concept, OKR implementations, et al. which are implemented half-heartedly and discarded as soon as the next fad creeps in. Career growth is all about who your connections are, how long you have been there, and how overworked you can pretend to be. People that are actually overworked and lack the time to suck up and complain about how hard they are working are ignored and under-appreciated."

751,,Delusions of Grandeur,2020-12-04,2.0,Anonymous Employee,"You can't beat the 6 week sabbatical after 4 years and the 7% 401k match. You get to learn a lot in a short amount of time, and there are some genuinely good people who work here. I've made lifelong friends! If you're lucky, you'll have a manager who understands the egos of the executives at this company, and protect you from the inevitable fallout in project execution, unreasonable deadlines, and open bullying that can sometimes go on. The education stipend is awesome and you can use $1k however you want with manager approval, which isn't hard to get. The office location is second to none and easy to access. The culture of transparency is stellar. People are honest with each other and have hard conversations to tackle ""thorny issues."" The mission is as good as you can get within financial services. Strong brand. There are some good managers.","The politics at this company can be utterly exhausting. Whatever an executive wants, goes, and if you dare to ask questions, what I've seen happen is, you're marked as a troublemaker and dogged with micromanagement until you've had enough or you're forced out. It's upsetting to watch this happen a couple of times a year at least and the practice seriously lowers morale because it usually targets some of the best people who are actually creative at the company. The people who have been here for years have grown too comfortable, and the new people in charge have zero emotional intelligence. Stagnation is rampant, and our products reflect that. Customers are buying into the Morningstar brand and reputation, but how long can that last when almost everything we produce isn't even ""complete"" by the time it hits the market due to agile? It takes years to roll out features that customers ask for, and when these features are finally rolled out there's a lot of self-congratulation, which is just laughable. Training opportunities are few and far between. So that means that people who are new struggle unnecessarily to keep up with the taskmasters' demands. There is usually no support for new team members from management, and they get by thanks to their own intelligence and a small support system of lower-rung employees who have ""been there, done that"" and are trying to prevent someone else from going through the same thing. If there are training opportunities, they are treated as a box to check. You go through a training and then usually there are no opportunities to apply your learnings and nothing changes. Its just all for show. Morningstar is very adept at putting on a good show, but don't fall for their propaganda saying it's a ""great place to work."" From the stories I've heard from years past, it USED to be a great place to work, then they hired externals because people left to get more money and the culture has degraded. Also the Morningstar Development Program is a scam. It takes advantage of smart young people who have fallen for Morningstar's strong brand by putting them on customer support duty and having them compete to get an associate level role on any team they can get. It is very hard to rise through the ranks at Morningstar in general and that's another reason why a lot of people leave. You will be paid far less than industry standard. Lots of sucking up to executives and toeing the company line that everything Morningstar does is great and that it can do no wrong. We are supposed to be ""daring to disagree"" and that is just not happening because ""leaders"" don't know how to or can't lead properly. This organization is very self-centered and if you don't drink the kool-aid you'll be targeted by management for being different. People here are workaholics and work crazy hours so I'm not sure what the other reviewers are talking about. It is so difficult to get resources to do your job, and when you ask for help/support and are told ""just be scrappy"" it can be infuriating."

It is surprising that they win prizes for equality - it's probably only at board level. Just look at male-female ratios in meetings and you have a clear picture of the gender balance in the company.

The company cut almost everything (raises, health benefits, retirement benefits) and presented it as good news for us and in a deceptive way. They bought two companies, perhaps seeing this as an opportunity to profit from the hardship of employees who can't yet look for work elsewhere in this industry because of the pandemic. The executives seem to think they are getting away with it after trying to pull the wool over our eyes. They have become out of touch and deceptive in their human resources decisions...so far from what the company culture used to be about.

On the rare occasion you aren't being dumped with someone else's busywork, ""real"" work is minimal. Hence, lots of free time during the quarantine.","Unlike what this role is presented as to internal hires, it involves minimal writing or argumentation. Internals with years of experience are hired into an ""associate"" role while externals a year out of college are hired a level up. These ""associates"" publish reports, for upwards of a year, under the names of people who typically had nothing to do with their creation. Copy-and-paste busywork from the broader group gets dumped on these ""associates"", so someone 1-5 years out of college spends more time pasting bits from one spreadsheet to the next instead of learning about the financial industry or establishing oneself as an analyst. The opportunity to write research pieces on the industry is routinely played up in the job description and hiring process, but this is BS: such opportunities barely exist, and when they do, it's yet again more copy-and-pasting old pieces and replacing some numbers.

The group itself is split between people with 5 or fewer years of experience on one side, and people whose main priority isn't professional development on the other. Salary is lackluster. Internal work on reports is very high level and – surprise – is mostly copy and paste. For the prestige that Morningstar seems to think this group carries, the behind-the-scenes is unimpressive.

To internals: absolutely do not apply; you'll be nothing but cheap labor with lots of potential career progression time utterly wasted. And to externals: why would you want to work at this kind of company?"

You don't. Morningstar is not a place for anyone to reach their potential. For managers, you are expected to sell the concept of low pay, no raises, and minimal resources for the greater good -- as if this was a startup. Convince the team that they don't need what they need nor should receive the wages they deserve. The success of this company rests largely in its ability to underpay and underresource staff. Place them in inadequate, cramped office space. Condition employees not to ask for anything, however important. Basically, the strategy constrains costs to manage turnover to X percent a year. I have yet to find anyone who was gainfully employed at another firm in the same position actually come to Morningstar. It is usually someone who is a job switcher or whose previous position didn't work. My advice to candidates, consider employment on the coasts - even if you live separately from your family for multiple years -- even if the household economics are worse. Working for Morningstar can have a severe, negative impact on your career trajectory that will be difficult to correct later."

If you're an international student, don't be lured by their claims that they will sponsor your H1B.

- Benefits (unlimited PTO, insurance) 
- Working for different branches of the company.","Morningstar Investment Management makes so much revenue for the company, and yet leadership treats it like an ugly stepchild that they absolutely refuse to pour necessary resources into. They built an excellent product, but failed in building the infrastructure to support it, and continue to fail in making up for it. My time at Morningstar was very short-lived, but I quickly saw how overworked, stressed, and how insane MIM's support team operates. What is worse is they stick MDPs in this department for a year, no better way to lose incredible fresh talent (and severely underpay them for the role). Management has gotten the feedback time and again that changes need to be made and more staff is needed, and as forward-thinking as Morningstar thinks they are, this old ship turns very slowly and is sinking. If you are considering a role at Morningstar, do not work for this team. It is non-stop chaos, angry financial advisors (because our processes are outdated, severely understaffed), and no one ever asks how you are, because they probably know the answer. After a few months of working here, I left because who wants to work for something that they see nothing but failure coming in the future? I can guarantee this role has caused many to need therapy after (that I wish I could bill them for), and Morningstar should honestly be ashamed of their Investment Management branch internally. On a 12 person team I worked with in 2019, today only 1 person is still there, that should tell you everything you need to know. Most of us quit."

Work is taken very seriously of course, so if you work hard there are great rewards, along with weekly incentives such as free breakfast on Wednesdays, the drinks trolley on a Friday and casual wear every day!

937,,Software Engineer,2020-01-23,4.0,Software Engineer,"Great friendly culture.  It is rare to meet someone at Morningstar who is unfriendly or has a bad attitude in general.  

This is a good place to grow your skill set and career (to a point).  Here you will be given opportunities to take on challenging tasks and if you succeed you will receive more opportunities.

Benefits are fine.  
- Good work/life balance., 
- WFH opportunities as long as you produce.
- 401K Match as well as an additional match on Stock purchase program.","- Poorly outlined guidelines for advancement.  High performance in your own department doesn't mean advancement. Your best route is to apply for internal job postings to advance with consistency. 

- Continuously poor decisions being made regarding the technology that supports the products.

Finally, readers of these reviews will see a lot about ""low pay"", but what needs to be understood is Morningstar is not a Technology company.  It is a Data and Research company that dables in technology.  Because of this Morningstar does not pay their technologists (Engineers/IT/PMs) competitive salaries as compared to other technology first companies.  This has led to top talent consistently leaving once they reach mid-level employee status. 

To counter balance the lower compensation Morningstar does have a fantastic work/life balance and work from home opportunities (depending on department).  For those whose sole motivating factor is base pay then plan on leaving Morningstar in 2-4 years.  For those who value a total benefit package which includes work/life balance, you could easily become a Morningstar lifer."

The general atmosphere is also very collaborative, and there is good communication between product and tech. There are busy periods and quiet periods, with a lot of emphasis on work life balance (i.e. accept that you may have a couple of long days here and there, but make up for it but taking more time off elsewhere). Flexible work hours are also great.
Most of all, in terms of the finance world, I really appreciate and embrace the Morningstar ethos which brings integrity and transparency to the market.","Biggest con is pay. Morningstar seems to underpay its employees (especially in tech), so if making a competitive market salary is important to you, maybe skip. So it all depends on where your priorities lie - and there may come a time when being consistently paid 20% less is not worth the benefits (which many other companies have anyway)."

Super welcoming and warm. The higher ups also will talk to entry level talent as if you are on their level, which is not the case at other companies. If you work hard and are ambitious, they will notice and take you under your wing. They give you opportunities to try very complicated things without any relevant experience as long as you have a good rep and raw talent.

I started with the MDP program when I decided I to make a career change after 2 years at my old job after college. I am grateful for all that I have learned and to have developed many skills that have built my technical, people and project management, operational, and overall business skills. What I have learned here I can take anywhere and succeed. 

- great insurance 
- great 401k benefits
- unlimited time off + 6 week sabbatical after working there for 4 years
- beautiful office 
- great tuition reimbursement program
- great name to have your resume. Morningstar is extremely respected in the financial industry","- so many people who are deadweight. If you work hard, people will rely on you and have you do more while others get by with doing the minimum, consistency messing up- FOR YEARS. They never want to fire anyone, even though everyone is aware of how bad certain people are at their jobs. 
- products are poorly built because we can’t retain our tech talent. I have seen many people leave in the past year and they all complain about not being rewarded for their work or getting passed up for promotions, even though they have been told they are top performers 
- sink or swim culture. Works for some, not for all. You usually get very little guidance on how to approach a problem or come up with a solution. It’s a good thing because you can show how much you shine, but it’s cruel to expect younger people with little or no experience to perfectly execute something 
- poor people management. None of the managers are trained to actually manage people. HR just expects them to wing it.
- the MDP program lies. I believe they might be transparent now but when I started, they told all of us you were entitled to 3 rotations within 3 years and you could work in marketing, Ops, behavioral
Science, research, HR, etc. You find out the day you start that you will in fact be stuck in a queue for 8-9 hours a day, handling horrible advisors who are upset at bugs in our products or who are too stupid to fill out forms correctly and thousand dollar mistakes. The job was originally posted as “product consultant” which translates to “learn how to use this product perfectly, understand our data and methodology, and handle all the s$@&t that comes your way with a smile.” After your first rotation, you don’t even have an assigned rotation like other programs. You basically are just another internal candidate competing with everyone else in the past 4 classes of MDPs."

Internal Systems not really up to scratch
Low pay
An ok place for recent graduates to gain some useful experience, but not really a place for grown-ups"
1031,,"Egregiously low pay, severe lack of resources",2019-06-30,1.0,Equity Strategist,Few - smart colleagues. Midwest housing costs.,"Compensation is totally disconnected from employee performance and contribution. There is no possibility of meaningful wage increases. Talented customer-facing employees are treated like low-end customer service agents. Voluntary turnover in equity research is excessive.  In short, Morningstar is NOT a talent-focused business.  Instead, it strives to be a data company that operates on razor thin margins and doesn't seek to maximize the utility of high performers.  This model has made a small number of people very wealthy, including the founder.  If you want to be on the wrong side of this equation, join the firm as an employee.  If not, become a shareholder.

What is even more outrageous than the low pay is the lack of resources.  IT support, compliance assistance and travel are severely constrained.  At most financial service firms, employees such as sell-side analysts that are expected to interface with customers are given a high level of support so they can serve clients, make press interviews, and create unique deliverables.  This isn't the case at Morningstar.  You are forced to make do minimal resources with no possibility of improvement. 

As every year ticks by, I become more disenchanted with Morningstar. Like most people who have been with the firm for any length of time, mobility is an issue.  The lack of large competitors in the Chicago area basically means leaving the state and changing fields entirely.  Effectively, Morningstar has become the employer of last resort for many equity research staff."

- Team (Quant Research) is relatively new, just completed one year so all young people are there who believe in working smart and having a perspective of learning and  gaining. ( This is majorly due to our manager who provides this environment).

The office layout is modern and work dress kept casual.  It's a very convenient location in the heart of downtown.","There are 3 main problems with the MDP program:

1) It is not challenging

It is not a secret that everyone goes on to the phones for their first rotation.  After the first 2 months, there is no growth opportunity.  It becomes mundane and the stretch projects offered do little to increase one's skillset.  

The work given to MDPs even after their first rotation is still simple.  In short, this program is not for the ambitious person.


2) Underpaid

The salary is far below street average with an almost laughably low bonus.  


3) The Work

There's a great deal of apathy at this firm which shocked me.  There are far too many people who are dead weight and don't do work (either due to laziness or there isn't enough work to go around).  

In short, this firm is the opposite of lean and there are many teams with far too many people assigned to do the same exact job. 

The laid back culture has had some negative affects as some floors in the building are almost entirely empty on Fridays.  It's great not to be in a workaholic culture, however, it shouldn't be the case that nothing gets done can get done simply because it's Friday."

-The bonus structure is confusing, and for most, the company's performance makes a much bigger impact on the bonus payout than personal performance.
-Pay is quite low, but management pretends it isn't. You're not fooling anybody.
-Some colleagues are responsive and helpful, others are worse than useless and make you wonder how they ever got into their position.
-HR is not particularly competent or helpful.

Don't get me wrong, there's a lot to like about working for Morningstar. But, the positives are outweighed by the negatives of low pay, unhelpful HR, and frustratingly incompetent coworkers. Hence, the two-star review."

Incompetent managers are rewarded with promotions and increased flexible working which sees them rarely in the office, or working at all, it seems. 
Staff turnover is high, especially among young people, who figure out fairly quickly this is not a meritocracy, and that they will be treated no differently than their colleagues who do significantly less. You can expect to be signing leaving cards pretty regularly.
A lot of middle and senior management have been there a long time and it seems to be an old boys club, where they have extremely high job security regardless of company results or team morale. 
A lot of services are being migrated to cheaper labour centres, namely India and China to the detriment of consumers.

Competitive pay, opportunities to earn more through hard work, opportunities and guidance to progress your career? This isn’t the place for you.

I wasn’t going to write a review until I saw a reply to a very good review. The reply dismissed much of the reviews comments concluding ‘For someone focused exclusively on monetary compensation, Morningstar is probably not the best fit’ and ‘With regards to compensation, we don’t believe we have a systematic compensation issue’ 

You simply do have a compensation issue. To say you don’t means you are not in touch with your staff. You just need to look at the reasons why the steady stream of people are leaving. Just speak to your staff. I don’t know about you but I want to work hard, put the effort in and make a difference. If you aren’t going to pay me a competitive salary sooner or later I’ll start to not work as hard, not put the effort in and likely leave. What I put in I expect to receive back.

The workforce is incredibly diverse with several employee resource groups (think ""clubs"") that allow you to get involved both within Morningstar as well as the city of Chicago in general.","This program only sounds good on paper.  The first rotation is spent on the phones answering phone calls from investors who ask questions about how to use Morningstar's research products.  According to HR, this is supposed to introduce you to financial concepts and Morningstar's products in general.  I suppose it does, but only on a very surface level.  80% of the questions received are dumb ones like ""my Morningstar isn't working - how can I fix it?"" or ""how do I add a chart to this presentation?"".  After the first month, the job becomes very mundane and literally everyone hates it.

The second rotation is not much better.  There is such a mad scramble to get off the phones that people settle for second rotation positions that are only marginally better albeit still terrible.  Rotating becomes extremely competitive since there is such a bottleneck of people on the phones.  The positions that are available aren't desirable positions so many people just end up leaving to company.

All in all, this program does not push you.  Rarely are roles intellectually stimulating and you end up losing skills that you walked into the company with.  I know several people who were Excel whizzes who had experience in VBA and SQL that ended up just forgetting it because you literally never use the first year on the job.

It's been said on here as well, but MDPs start out at 50k a year and the semiannual bonus averages at $500 which is laughable compared to other financial firms.  Employee benefits are on par with the rest of the industry so there's really nothing special there.

-	Training is excellent. Not just annual stipend but many opportunities to learn new concepts within your own division and others. Constantly evolving methods of doing business and tools and products and offerings means its never dull for long
-	Progression opportunities. You have to make your own luck, lots that complain just sit around waiting for things to happen. IF you are serious you want to move up your manager and HR will help you. If you put the work in, I tend to find those who moaned the most put in the least effort
-	Varied role (as long as you are medium to senior level)
-	Transparency in roles/opportunities/renumeration etc. They have improved greatly and keep trying to do the right thing there
-	Respected brand. Their “Core values” gives everyone the mandate to do the right thing by investors and clients 
-	Beer trolley and free breakfast on certain days
-	Lovely office environment. Break out spaces, private rooms etc, clean and spacious and casual attire only unless meeting clients.","-	Progression for the more senior roles is a bit harder as by definition there are fewer jobs around 
-	The bonus target is never met. Ever. If people work hard for 8 years in a row and not once has the target been met that logically points to the fact that the targets are too high. 
-	Everything is run out of the States. If you want to wipe your bottom in Europe you had better make sure the committee over there will provide you the resources.  And then you must hope they don’t take the resources away halfway through your `project`

If Morningstar really cared about its equity analysts, it would compensate them fairly.   The wages are WAY below industry norms and that of many other careers that require far less out of the employee.  I would dissuade anyone with an interest in financial markets from even applying to Morningstar. Being an analyst requires three things 1) hard work 2) intelligence and 3) good communication skills.  It makes zero sense to work for Morningstar-level wages if you possess all three of these attributes.  You can make far more with less effort doing almost anything else - corporate management, sales, etc. The reason that most analysts stay at Morningstar is that they are stuck due to family commitments and geographic restrictions."

Professionalism - Being a US based company, they know how to approach everything in a professional manner right from the hiring, regular meetings to the resignation process.

2. Casual dress code - No mandatory formals. Employees can wear casuals on all days.

3. Perks - Loads of perks that includes life insurance, mediclaim, 1 free snack a day from the vending machine, snacks for shift based employees, Sodexo meal card, CFA fees reimbursements for eligible employees and education stipend for work related trainings conducted by external experts.

4. Employee friendly environment - No yelling at the subordinates for mistakes. The team leads or managers will explain how to reduce or rectify the faults and improve in the most professional manner.

5. Ability to change the job profile - After working for more than a year in a particular post, employees can apply for change in the job profile and work in different departments or positions subject to clearing the interview and performance.

6. ESOP's for oustanding performance - Although not mentioned in the offer letter, some employees get rewarded with ESOP's for their oustanding performance subject to vesting conditions.

7. Pay and increment - Pay is slightly better than the industry standards and the employees on shifts are compensated with handsome bonus and increments too are good but your performance would have to standout from the rest to get the best increment.

8. Open work-culture - Cabins are reserved only for meetings. Everyone from the employees to the higher management work in open desks.

9. Higher average intelligence - Most of the employees are smart and proactive which is a result of tougher hiring interviews. When I got interviewed there were around 200+ candidates and barely 10 people were selected.","1. Work monotony - Work can get a lot mechanical and monotonous wherein sometimes it feels the process could have been automated with better technological investment. This can be a pro for a laid back person who would want to settle in his career.

2. Limited learning - A data analyst's learning graph would mostly fall flat after some months if he doesn't try to approach the work in a holistic way which most Data analysts fail to do. There will be a lot to learn if Data analysts could focus on the use of end product and explore out of their work process.

3. Work pressure - Data analysts are needlessly pressurized and given unrealistic targets which are never met yet the team leaders and managers carry on setting unrealistic targets. On the counter view, it is deliberately done to squeeze the maximum potential in employees.

4. Training process - The training provided to the new employees is great but the practical sessions are hindered due to poor software infrastructure. Better to get the new employees on-board the work a bit earlier."

If nothing breaks and the phone lines are slow (which is rare) you usually are free to do whatever you want as long as its productive. (Study for your CFA, grad school, etc.)

Opportunity to do stretch projects (if you're lucky and you find something that is not just grunt work)

Ability to take time of whenever was nice and flexible as long as it was approved by your manager. However it is not ""unlimited"" like they say. It will be between 15-25 days off that you can take in a year and this will include sick days because there aren't a number of sicks days set aside to be taken. Be prepared to work certain bank holidays to because management will say so - like MLK day or Presidents Day.","Many. 

1) You'll be promised a rotational program but there are no jobs to rotate to and if you're lucky to find an opening you may be competing with people who have 3-4+ years of experience on you who just want to rotate laterally in the company. Upper management rarely leaves because the work life balance is so good. So you'll be stuck as a customer service rep for your first job out of college.

2) Pay is low in general for the company and most roles but technically the pay for a customer service rep in Chicago is lower 50,000k so that's how they keep you at the company cause with the job title you have, you can't make more anywhere else. That doesn't stop many MDPs for looking for new roles after they realize 9 months in that their stuck with the decision they made. 

3) Very flat company structure so moving up is difficult, therefore people move laterally therefore its more difficult to rotate after your first year. 

4) To maintain high metrics you only get between 25-30 minutes a day to get up from your desk to use the rest room, walk around, network. You truly live in a silo. An MDP shouldn't feel guilty for asking to take time to meet with an employee on another team to learn about their business. 

5) Your job is to put out fires, not change the status quo. Product changes take a lot of time and it seem like many changes get released without proper QA'ing and communication to people on customer support is pretty much non existent as far as what exactly happens in those product release or their purpose. So when something in the product  breaks and you're an MDP,  be ready to be the last to know but its not like you can do much about it because you'll be repeating yourself call after call trying to play off the situation until it gets fixed. But be ready for it to be broken again it he near future. 

6) Product assignments are totally random, it just depends on which manager you speak with the most, not necessarily your skill set that you bring from college. Anyone can do their job without a college degree so if you want to a top 20 school or were ambitious and in a good program - hold out for something else. Having Morningstar on ones resume is a large resume booster but be prepared in interviews to play up what you really do at your current job as an MDP because the reality is its repetitive work on company specific products where you wont have any influence on the decision making and larger strategy of the business unit.

All in all - if you're a creative, analytical, inquisitive person who is ambitious and doesn't mind working hard and being challenged don't take their role. Its a good buffer if you have nothing else and need a decent company on your resume but if you're in any other position, hold out you can do better and you don't need the stress of putting out other peoples fires all day long.

The only reason some of Morningstar's products still exist is because there are no other competitors in the space (yet)"

1205,,Morningstar Development Program,2018-04-30,3.0,Anonymous Employee,"The best thing about being a MDP is having the MDP community. Now that every MDP starts in client support, you'll instantly be placed on a team with 5-10 others just out of college. This makes for a fun, social work environment with frequent happy hours and weekend bonding. It also helps that no one on support is allowed to work more than 40 hours/week. (The fact that the 'social' aspect of the job is my biggest 'pro' should be taken as a double-edged sword).","Unfortunately, the MDP is often not what it claims to be. It's not uncommon for someone to get stuck on the phone for 12+ months because 20+ MDPs are all interviewing for the same 3-5 positions. Do not believe anyone when they tell you it is a 'rotational' program. The only rotational aspect is the fact that about 25% of MDPs leave each year. 

Additionally, as a MDP, your pay will be significantly lower than were you to work a similar job at a different company. Of course, this salary cap is lifted upon graduating from the MDP program, but that puts you at about 2.5 years on the MDP salary (think 50k starting, plus a 0-6% increase twice annually). This salary is certainly fair when on client support, but quickly loses its appeal when accepted for a (real) job."

1208,,Morningstar Development Program,2018-04-15,1.0,MDP,"Fair work/life balance -- Consistent hours for most employees. MDPs on product support are strongly encouraged not to work more than 40 hours a week so M* doesn't have to pay overtime.

Progressive culture and values -- Most employees are value-driven, and for the most part, are relatively down-to-earth. There are significantly fewer egos than one would expect from a reputable investment research firm.

Respected name -- Morningstar is generally considered to be the most respected name in funds. Most people in the financial industry will know Morningstar if you mention it to them, though the name is less recognizable to the general public.

Good data -- Morningstar is respected for a reason, and that's primarily because our data on funds is unparalleled. Our fund analyst teams are also highly respected, and that is becoming true for our credit and equity divisons as well.","Poorly developed products -- M* does not attract top talent on the development side because of low industry pay. The products are mostly outdated, though they tend to function better than the new ones which emphasize looks over performance. Issues with the products tend to take a long time to get resolved because of a lack of resources.

Low pay -- While there are decent benefits to help mitigate this fact, the truth is that they are really falling behind here. The low pay leads to high turnover and a loss of potentially attracting much-needed talent.

Extremely conservative business structure -- This falls in line with the others. Morningstar has a very conservative fiscal model in that they tend to underinvest in just about everything (except for the office decor and furniture which is shockingly nice). The most prominent underinvestment is in its people, and this bleeds through to everything else. This leads to what feels like growth at a glacial speed.

MDP Program -- I've heard they changed their advertising for this program since I applied last year, and I cannot speak to what prospectives are currently told. That being said, when I applied in 2016 what was told to us is drastically different than what we got. We were told that there are many different first positions open to MDPs; while this may have been true in the past, all current MDPs are stuck on product support for their first rotations. During orientation, we were told most MDPs rotate to their second position at around ~8 months; unfortunately, most MDPs tend to now stay on the phones for 12+ months, and then end up taking a second rotation they don't really want just so they can get off of the phones. In order to rotate, all MDPs must hire internally for specific positions. Given that there are a lot of MDPs, we are all competing for a relatively scarce number of positions; the equity and fund analyst positions are the most sought-after, and there are probably around 8-10 that open up per year. There have been MDPs who have waited on the phones for 16 months to land one of these positions. Finally, the managers of the support teams are unsurprisingly interested in solely the performance of the support teams, as this is what they are judged on. While this is obviously good for the business, it also means that they have little incentive to care about MDP rotations and career progression. In fact, a lot of the time managers get in the way of MDP development because they are worried about staffing and performance issues."

Stretch projects are a good way to get exposure to various areas of the company (data, research, HR...) and to take your mind off the monotony of everyday life, but are mostly grunt work projects. You just need to apply to these projects with a brief explanation of your interest and/or prior experience.","The MDP program is a complete waste of time.

This is a completely arbitrary decision and dependent on your manager.  The freedom to decide when to rotate that the company touts is very misguided and borderline dishonest. Rotating requires applying to jobs within the company and going through several rounds of interviews once again.  As a result, rotating does not encourage trying new teams/departments if you are going to be asked about prior experience and demonstrated interest. It is certainly not unusual for people to stay in support for 12 months or longer, which is absolutely ridiculous for a 2 year program that supposedly offered 3 rotations. It most certainly does not in that time frame, except for a tiny minority of MDPs. In addition, getting permission to rotate is just the beginning. You have to wait for a position to be publicly posted within the company to apply. Sometimes these are positions available to MDPs, but you can also apply to jobs available to everyone in the company. Naturally, postings are all competitive so it is not unusual to see people getting rejected several times from rotations, which means you are stuck on support in the meantime.  The lack of structure is harmful for the program. I would not recommend this program to anyone. The job drains the energy from participants and does not encourage or reward hard work. If you are a motivated college student looking for meaningful work, I recommend looking anywhere else."

Unclear priorities - too many saying, too little decision made. And when decision is made, sometimes it is made in a rush. Lack of consideration and communication. And for front-line employees, it's difficult to execute.

Terrible pay - unfair and strange policies that don't reward performance sufficiently. Unless money is not your concern, think twice whether you want to take a pay cut.

The ""morningstar time"" - how could people be late to their own meetings for as long as 7 MINUTES? how could people cancel an early morning meeting at last minute? This is unprofessional."

Everyone in every department is happy to meet with you and give you advice.

Colleagues are all incredibly intelligent.

Higher than average salary compared to the rest of the customer service industry.

Well known and looks great on the resume.","If you are interviewing for the MDP it shouldn't be a surprise that you are 100% going into customer service for a year, sometimes longer if you don't get the position you were initially going for or if it's not currently open to MDPs. Most second years immediately go into the data analyst position which is virtually the same as customer service, without the phone calls, and more flexibility in schedule.

Many MDPs are dissatisfied with the program, and after a brief alleged scandal with the MDP staff, a surveyed showed more than 50% of MDPs are EXTREMELY dissatisfied, with minimal changes made after the results.

Many enter the MDP as an easier method to get into the buy-side and/or sell-side departments of Morningstar. The fact is, unless your manager approves you applying, after your 1 year is up, and if the position is open during the time your manager approves of you applying, your likelihood is very slim until you “graduate” the program. At that point, you could have easily gotten the necessary experience at another firm that would translate well into the position; you will find a vast majority of analysts at Morningstar did not originate from the MDP.

Lastly, there is a high turnover rate at Morningstar from people that become disillusioned or have easily found better positions that are substantially more satisfying, primarily from the MDP but many of those on the technical side as well.

Morningstar recruits from many of the best schools in the nation that have the potential to outperform anywhere. If you plan to join Morningstar, plan the long-haul and a potentially stagnant career if you don't get a position on the career path you're looking for. 

I keep in contact with many former Morningstar employees: former MDPs, engineers, analysts, and we are all much happier leaving, in better positions (PMs, ER, IB, Consulting, M7 Grad School). So if you at least want a year of easy R&R before moving on, accept the position and if you're okay with brain-addling work, you'll have plenty of time to think and apply to positions that you believe befit you more."

1291,,Marketing at Morningstar,2017-10-12,2.0,,"Most employees are dedicated and passionate, beautiful office, kind people.","I enjoyed working in marketing at Morningstar for a number of years. The Chief Marketing Officer (Rob Pinkerton) appeared to be a smart and pedigreed man. He enthusiastically campaigned for the position of CMO with a strong vision to make Morningstar into a modern marketing engine. He stepped into a hard role: the leaders at Morningstar have been there for decades and only knew how to value antiquated marketing efforts, everyone was quick to place the blame on marketing for low revenue numbers, and he inherited a disaster of a marketing organizational structure, so I felt for him at first. However, after years of working with him there were some alarming trends I could not continue to ignore:

Pinkerton has no interest in fixing any of the glaring logistical issues that weigh on each marketer. The organizational structure, ill-defined roles, and supposedly “agile teams” required to complete projects are a complete mess (and have been for years). Marketers trip all over each other, spending days doing redundant work and wasting everyone’s time. Pinkerton does not want to even hear about these problems – let alone help – or get to know the strengths and weakness of each team member and deploy each person to their best and highest use for the good of the company, like a strong leader would. He writes off and most times completely ignores enthusiastic and exceptional marketers, instead choosing to focus only on a select handful of favorite employees and then wait for everyone else to leave in succession. 

He boasts on previous posts that he’s been able to recruit marketers from large companies that he deems “cool,” but this is a direct result of the Morningstar brand name in Chicago and the company culture – two things that were there long before Pinkerton was in his role.

Pinkerton spends most of his time managing up to the rest of the C-suite, instead of providing productive guidance and mentorship to his team. He’s a polished talker and is well-read on the marketing industry, so he can speak in broad sweeping generalizations about his vision enough to get buy-in from the C-suite, but then he provides no guidance to the department on how they’ll get there and he isn’t held accountable.

Expect continued turnover from marketing should Pinkerton remain CMO."
1292,,Irrevocable Damage,2017-10-12,1.0,Senior Technologist,"Good location, there's some bright spots left based on some positive reviews left on here... still hopeful company will find itself and go back to its roots. People generally mean well.","Where to start...what once was a thriving culture of collaborative minds has now turned into a toxic environment full of bullies. The leadership is incapable of bringing people together and fostering an environment where people feel valued and are able to do their best work. Morningstar's culture used to be what attracted high caliber talent to its doors and employees would look past the below market pay because they truly felt happy and proud to work here.  The caliber of technologists used to be on par with Silicon Valley, you used to leave inspired.  Now people can't wait to get out. All the great technologists have left and the remaining are folks that are good talkers. As a result, the company fails to execute and products never get off the ground.  The high turnover particularly in the tech org and the new ""C"" level leadership that were promoted from failed acquisitions have done irrevocable damage to this company. I still hope that one day Kunal and Joe finally wakes up and make some changes."

1297,,Pinkerton hubbub casts shadow on Morningstar,2017-10-07,1.0,,"Great research. What other company employs over a hundred financial analysts to get to the bottom of it all? Morningstar heartedly fulfills its mission to accurately report market opportunity (or lack thereof) despite where the chips may fall. The company founder, Joe Mansueto, is also a most benevolent soul. Wielding his 60% controlling interest during the financial crisis, Morningstar made the conscious decision to retain its employees despite significant drops in revenue due to a spiraling economy. Other executives that lost their jobs faced ruin, as employment was impossible to find. Thank you Joe.","While the research is top notch and the chairman’s penchant for kindness has helped many many people, Morningstar’s marketing department, led by CMO Rob Pinkerton, is a disaster. Freely admitted in a 2017 interview, the position of Chief Marketing Officer is Pinkerton’s first job in marketing. Like any amateur that poses as an expert, Rob Pinkerton sells himself with the acumen of a snake oil salesman. Look at how he describes his tenure at Hello Wallet in the same interview? Another failed Morningstar acquisition. Despite horrible engagement metrics, Pinkerton presents his pet programs as a grand success to senior management where he also promises golden pathways to younger audiences. Alas, he cites accomplishments – even on this job board – where half of those laurels belong to the Individual Investor team, a completely independent and autonomous group. Those achievements were well underway before Pinkerton arrived. Everyone knows this so-called CMO’s threadbare list of tactics lack revenue attribution and worse offer little engagement as proven by bounce rates and anemic form completes. He can’t even supervise the basics.

My fear is that senior management actually believes Pinkerton’s mad schemes of a future millennial customer base, when Morningstar’s true north are mature investors. One of the most common mistakes an amateur marketer makes is a cavalier assessment of a brand’s ability to jump the line. Usually, it can’t. Microsoft’s Sataya Nadella says it best:

Ryssdal: What's the last semi-significant mistake you made? 

Nadella: I would say the realization that in many cases, customers have already chosen to work with you and yet you consciously, or unconsciously, abandon them to go work off on the new shiny object is a mistake I've made recently and in the past. And every time I made the mistake, the good part was I've been able to recognize it fast enough. It's tempting in tech to sometimes move on to the next thing.

The saddest part about all of this is that Morningstar’s mission really isn’t rocket science – that is, leveraging a vast army of brand loyalists into a billion dollars. Alas, Pinkerton won’t do it because he can’t do it. What he can do is drive a 60% turnover rate in the marketing department over three years. If you're forty or older @ Morningstar, I suggest you start to look for new employment. The man likes em young. 

Cataloging Rob Pinkerton’s millennial obsession:

“Born with smart phones in their hands, millennials are natural digital marketers.”

“I want to pack the stage with millennials.”

“I’m not interested in your (non-millennial) opinion on the meeting, I want to hear what the millennials think.”

“I observed a focus group with millennials who were eager to learn to invest.”

Good god. Who talks like that to a work force? Through an inevitable, desperate response, Pinkerton will deny or spin everything here, except the truth of his behavior firmly exists in Morningstar’s public discourse with new witnesses born everyday."

They have great medical benefits (company pays a decent amount out of pocket),"I'm mourning the old days of Morningstar past when the culture only allowed for the hiring of employees that fit in to a laid back, professional, collaborative and respectful environment.  My opinions and examples are tied to the marketing department.  There has been a tremendous amount of turnover in the marketing group in the past 3 years.  The other Glassdoor reviews have responses state that there has been a 15.2% turnover in the past year but does not reference the 3 year timeframe where the percentage seems much higher.  There are also remarks  that the reason marketers are leaving is because they can't keep up in the ""transformative and modern marketing"" organization that has been created and became so overwhelmed that they decided to leave where life would be easier for a simpleton.  On a sale of 1-10 the marketing sophistication and platforms (in my opinion) are about a 2-2.5 based on other marketing organizations I've worked at over 10 years ago and compared to other companies in the Chicago area.  The reason there is high turnover is because the marketers in Chicago are looked at and treated as if they are technically inept and spoken down to in a condescending manner.  In addition, there is lack of leadership across the group who don't seem to understand the current employees roles and how to best utilize their background or skills set.  There is also a lack of resources, transparency with goals and budget prioritization, training within this group.  Lastly, the base salary tends to be lower compared to other marketing organizations which would be acceptable if the previous culture was still intact."

You don't have to work hard, or know much about your domain, or deliver what you promised, but you can still get promoted and manage a large team, and travel to global offices as vacations. The only thing you must be really good at is talking. There are several forms of it. The best way is drawing a big, fancy picture of future. The future must be so fantastic, so untrue that any doubters won’t give a damn to prove it being unrealistic. Then, senior managers will buy it, since they hear no objections but only the bright, gold days in the horizon. Now you can have tons of resources, people, money, and time. You tell them it will take 3 years to finish, 5 years to be fully ramped up.  At the end of second year, of course you have done so much, so well, and the mere reasonable decision based on the solid slides facts is to expand the project, to challenge yourself and the team even more, to bring the goal not only one level higher, but three, five levels higher. The company will double down on this initiative, give your more resources, build another offshore team, “let’s do it”. After three years, things seem not going super smooth. Your phase I deliverables can’t be fulfilled. Nothing is really working. Ooops. Don’t worry about it. Blame on your dependencies. This excuse always works. Why? Do you think you are the only smooth talker here? That is quite an arrogance. You miss your target merely because your upstream is totally an idiot, a damn liar, “can’t get one single thing done”. You are deadly mad at them, as you are just a victim of this bureaucratic culture.
 It doesn’t mean you don’t have to watch out. Actually, it is the opposite. You have to keep your true workers totally unexposed. Hide your real talented people. You sweet talk them, making them feel you are a true friend, someone they should trust and be loyal to. Without them, you won’t be able to make to year two, remember the opportunity to expand at the second year? On the other side, watch out other talkers! They are your real competitors, in the fight of seeking companies’ resources and supports.","(Glassdoor viewers, my word can only represent my point of view, so please also read other reviews to see the full picture. I am sure you will find I am telling the truth here.)
Very unfairly low compensation. In the Salary section, you can find enough samples for your position. 
Many mid-level managers are incapable. They don’t have much domain knowledge, or technical skills for their job. They are politically smart and opportunistic. They utilize their international employees to get the work done, and they only present it. I have been working in this team for almost 5 years, I had ZERO meeting with the manager of my manager. Everything I do is kept within my team. 
No career path for technical experts. I am confident to say I am the best in my category in Morningstar, but I don’t make any progress in my career, except the “senior” title. The only reward I got for my great work is to assign me more work and harder tasks. I thought it was a great way to enhance my skills so I welcomed them.

1331,,Life as a technologist,2017-07-10,4.0,Software Engineering Manager,"In the 5+ years I've worked at Morningstar, I've had the opportunity to work with great people in different tech roles across the company. I've had a lot of fun and experienced many challenges.  To be successful at Morningstar, you need to be focused on solving problems (strategy through execution...not just ideas) that deliver value (revenue or cost savings).  

It's up to you...If you are comfortable putting yourself in a position to innovate you will be rewarded.  As a 30+ year old company, Morningstar cannot rest on it's brand name only.  In the last year we have made decisions to simplify and modernize our approach to building applications by providing development teams with a 'paved road' approach that allows each team to leverage tech that is best suited their needs and puts the power of decision back into the hands of developers. 

Our tech...The migration from our on-prem data centers to amazon web services is certain to be a challenge, but brings a great deal of opportunity for people looking to work on the latest technology.  People are willing to help each other and if you present a business case for change that drives value (revenue or cost savings) you are almost always rewarded.  We have multiple products lines that rely on various technologies, there can be challenges getting synced across teams, but also give you the opportunity to work on the tech of you choice (and change the tech you work on regularly…if that’s what you want).

Leadership will listen....Provided you are engaged/willing to tackle an issue.  Staring with the CTO, each head of technology has an open door policy. If you are interested in contributing immediately and are willing to reach out and get involved with solving problems, this is a great place to work.  If you're looking for someone to guess and cater to your needs, you're going to have a tough time.

A few other notes...
* heavy emphasis on internal promotion, people are hired from the outside, but there is a generous amount of growth internally
* work/life balance is as good as it gets
* extremely respectful work environment -- in a world where headlines in tech revolve around the need for change, Morningstar should be looked to as the gold standard for the progressive, respectful workplace
* employees extremely willing to help one another
* it goes without saying but, unlimited PTO is great as is the 6-week paid sabbatical every 4-years","Change part 1...There's no way around it, from the end of 2015 through early 2017, change has been constant and rough.  Different direction from multiple leaders in the business have been difficult to consume and has caused stress and confusion amongst engineers.  Are we working on the right thing?  What's our priority today? As a technologist, you really need to be committed to working through issues and understanding the needs of the business.

Change part 2...The entire technology leadership team has turned over since the end of 2015.  The 1st half of 2016 was especially rough when there wasn't clear leadership/vision across the tech org.  With the appointment of the new CTO in late 2016, things have stabilized significantly and we have a clear direction with an increased alignment with product leadership.

Change part 3...We still continue to lose very talented technologists.  The tech market is very strong and we have lost several key people to other opportunities.  On the upside, for those who stay, there is an opportunity for promotion and the people who have left typically do so for VP or C-level roles.

Compensation...We have work to do on our compensation program.  To be rewarded, you need to produce, then ask to be rewarded...in most cases ask multiple times.  There is the sense that you need to go out and get an offer in order to prove your market value."

1342,,Deliberately underpays employees,2017-06-08,1.0,Equity Analyst,Positive working environment with good collegial relationships.,"Morningstar deliberately underpays its employees and to a significant degree such that it is not worth it working there. Base pay is 30-40% below market rates accompanied by insignificant bonuses. No account is taken of seniority as senior employees bringing a wealth of external experience to the company are not considered senior, but are expected to work their way back up again after being hired at a more junior level. All this is done to enable majority shareholder Joe Mansueto to hold on to and enhance his huge profit margins. The company runs expenses into the ground and tends to be located in the less desirable areas of cities where there are not good public transport links - all to pay as little rent as possible. So its cost base is low and therefore there is no reason to justify underpaying employees to this extent. This is not how I expect capitalism to work.
I handed in my notice when I realised that the situation would not improve for a long time, and I was faced with working there for years longer without gaining any recognition for my work, and being paid a pittance for my efforts. Morningstar rewards incumbency as opposed to those obtaining great results: promotions are concentrated on the old guard, people with long service who accept being significantly underpaid. No surprise then that there is high turnover and that often the company struggles to find suitable candidates for vacancies. Morningstar's employment and pay practices make no sense in a world characterised by globalisation, employee mobility and a war for talent."
1343,,Unique advantage: work-life balance,2017-06-07,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"I don't know of any other company, especially in the financial services industry, that offers such great work-life balance. If that's your priority, this is the place for you. 
Pros:
Excellent work-life balance (reasonable work hours, vacation, sabbatical)
Excellent benefits (health insurance, 401k)
Interesting work
Not stressful
Respectful, diverse, all-inclusive culture","Compared with other companies that make you work 14-16 hours a day and pay you for it, Morningstar's compensation leaves a little bit to be desired. If you're young and hungry and you want to advance quickly and increase your salary quickly, this is not the place for you.
Cons:
Monetary compensation (salary) below market. They will counteract this by saying that ""total compensation"" (including benefits, etc.) is aligned with the market, and there is some truth to that. But if you're in finance to make a lot of money, you'd probably be better off at a bank or asset manager. You'll make double the money, but then again, you'll work double the hours, too.
My conclusion: this is the perfect place for me, but I understand why it may not be such a good fit for others."
1344,,Morningstar,2017-06-04,5.0,Shared Services,"I don't have a background in finance, so was initially unsure about considering a role in financial services. Morningstar is different. It's highly ethical and is full of smart people who collaborate together. It's the kind of culture that strives to hire people with different backgrounds, perspectives, interests, and areas of expertise. I've been given the opportunity to move around the company, try new things, even move across the globe. Morningstar goes out of its way to retain committed, hard-working, and engaged staff who believe in its mission to help investors of all shapes and sizes.","Every company has its worts, but Morningstar's pale in comparison. Our structure is complex, and our scope is vast; these realities do create some challenges."
1345,,"Incompetent, Corrupted Middle Management: Inside Stories from Workplace Engineering",2017-06-03,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"A lot of other reviews have good pros, so you can refer to them.","*Poor Employee Retention: The company is well known among recruiters. Your coworkers leave with dissatisfaction with management. Some people choose to suck it up and choose to stay for at least 3-4 years because you need your sabbatical leave (6 weeks, paid) and vested 401k. But morale is still extremely low, though few people shares their feelings with others. The company is also very slow at replacing open positions or doesn’t replace at all. You see your manager doing non-managerial work a lot. A lot of managers are not actually managing. 

*Not Much Work-Life Balance: You are expected to work in this fixed range of 9 to 5. Your boss will also call you nights and weekends. He talks about working day and night like it’s a good thing. That’s when you can establish friendship with your boss if you are that type of person..  by the way, don’t bother coming in early because you don’t get recognized for that. Having said that, it’s relatively easy to take time off, so unless you are on vacation, you don’t have much flexibility.

*No faith in Your Manager: He often skips a meeting you set up. (With or without excuses, it’s not important to him.) He may not respond to your message or give any feedback, especially technical matters even though he asks you to consult him. There is hardly any communication unless you specifically approach him; he doesn’t come to you. He says he will take care of something (for you), but he later asks with much frustration why you haven’t done it yet.

*No HR Support: HR does not take issues related to your coworkers or managers very seriously. You need to follow up with them to at least get some kind of response. When they do, they say someone else will contact you. The person reaches you rather reluctantly only once. She might say she would reach back, but expect you won’t hear from her again. HR doesn’t seem to have much power there.

*No Fact-based Performance Reviews: Reviews are highly subjective, mostly based on what he or other people think about you without facts or quantifiable matters. The goals you set up are just for documentation purposes to satisfy HR requirements. Your manager may write you up on something you didn’t do or an incident that never happened. Again, no facts are presented there to back up the accusation. When you defend yourself, he will say that he is only doing what he was told to do (I assume by his boss).

*Coworker Spies: I was warned early on by a very close coworker of mine that some of my coworkers were secretly tasked to watch you. You should be very careful about what you say and do, and you don’t easily trust coworkers even if they seem friendly to you because they are testing you. Usually those who are watching have been with the company for years. Stepping out of your desk for a meeting can be interpreted as slacking off.

*Politics and Red Tape: It’s top down as well. If your manager’s boss says you are wrong, your manager will say you are wrong. Discussion is over because your boss does not want any trouble which may affect his next promotion.  Also senior managers and directors love to reiterate top executive messages like puppets and you will get a lot of “forwarded“ emails from them. Each manager then responds to say they agree without going much into why they agree. 

*No Teamwork: You receive very little support from your team members. Your team members usually work in their silos and don’t like to get involved in issues you may be encountering. You also need to be careful about asking and phrasing because they may tell your boss about your incompetence and ignorance behind your back. Some people are not officially part of the team, but they make changes without notice and break systems. You have trouble understanding who works on what. There is also a lot of finger-pointing, and you may be humiliated in meetings and in public like second class citizens and treated like parents punishing their children.

*Disorganized Product Management: They say they are agile, but they are not. Business wants big plans and likes to pass to Engineering, who is stuck with a long period of coding and testing. Business doesn’t like changes because they don’t want to take time to revise and tell their clients to change. When the product is (finally) finished, it’s not always what business wants. Yes, it’s waterfall. What’s worse is that business does not sign off requirements. Engineers need to ask Business and write requirements down for Business. 

*No Innovation: In product development, senior management makes decisions single-handedly without analyzing problems, side effects, and compatibility. They like shiny, new tools and services everyone is talking about in the industry. No one seems to argue. Because problems may not be solved, many engineers are spending so much time fixing issues and adding over-complicated, often hacky patches all over the place, which are not always visible to senior management. At the end, you are recognized by “hardworking,” not the quality of work. They like it when you struggle a bit and make things work somehow. Big issues may come up, but firefighting is generally regarded as a way to establish a closer, better relationship with the top. (Yes there is a lot of firefighting in this company..) The company is managed by the same kind of people with the same mentality. If you don’t act like others, we get weeded out. They are stuck with the same problems over and over again with no innovation.

*No Bonus: The company hasn’t been doing well financially. You may be told your bonus would be 10-20%, but you won’t get that. Some of my coworkers said their manager gave them 0% because of poor company performance. (It’s sort of a lie because you might receive a bonus.) If your salary goal includes any bonuses, think again."

It is very difficult to get fired, and the company went out of its way to avoid layoffs even in the Great Recession.  Basically, it's the ""government job"" of finance and investing.  A good place to work if you want a steady gig, are not too ambitious, are just trying to get your foot in the door, and/or have other priorities in life (like family, traveling).","Compensation tends to be well below the market--if you're talented and hard-working, you can almost definitely make more elsewhere.  This results in relatively high turnover among the best employees. Those who stick around generally fall in one of two camps. The majority are mediocre employees who are just passing time, sometimes going years without producing anything of value.

Beautiful office

Location in the center of the Loop, close to transit
One of the biggest names in the industry","The Morningstar Development Program is not what it seems. For starters, you're definitely going to be put in either Data or Client Services for your entry level role. This is totally fine in itself, but this isn't revealed until after you accept your offer. They're both essentially call center/help desk environments. Both have their challenges, but Client Services is a nightmare. 

If you get placed in Client Services, get ready to get yelled at by the most obnoxious and rude people you've ever met in your life. The priorities change daily, which would be fine if there was an explanation behind it, but there rarely is. How you handled a call one day will be excellent, but the next day may result in a chat with your team lead and management. There's a feeling that management isn't always on your side. Everything starts and finishes from a viewpoint of what you did wrong rather than what you did right or what was out of your control. 

Speaking of which, your mileage may vary with managers. If your team lead and manager are responsive and understanding, you may be able to truck through until you move into another department at Morningstar. By the way, expect that to take at least a year. But otherwise, don't expect much. You'll get the runaround and a winding explanation anytime you express any concerns (or even have any questions) about your role or duties. There's rarely a straight answer. 

The MDP program says it promotes your career development, but I feel it is a very impersonal program, given the number of people in it. It's a bit chaotic and stretched thin, from what I experienced. You'll meet with someone in MDP leadership once every few months to discuss your career goals, and they are very pleasant and cheery people. But until you get the approval to move out of your first role, they aren't much help."

1375,,Company breaks Labor Laws,2017-04-04,1.0,Anonymous Employee,Nice office. That's it. More cons than pros.,"Low pay.
Morningstar's pay is among the lowest and the raises are 1-2% a year. Management blames employees and claims it is because of performance, but then employees talk and discuss and it comes out that everyone got the same raise. So everyone had performance issues? Doesn't HR read these reviews?

Dishonest HR
Someone below talked about how Asian workers did not get promotions and HR replied that the rates are same. This is nonsense. I had several Asian employees in my team and they all were frustrated for the same reason. I was friendly with them so they confided to me that they could not switch groups easily but non-Asians just seemed to move from role to role each year. I began to observe this and I had reason to believe that this was true to a large extent. The template seemed to be that if a non-Asian had a role and left, Asians would not be considered for that role. If an Asian person left, then other Asians had a chance at that role.

Breaking Labor Laws
Here's a biggie. Some years ago, I applied to an position that was advertised. As I was an employee, I could see the HR person and emailed her directly. She replied saying that the position was not a real one and that it was posted for immigration purposes! She said this in an email! I was shocked that a company like Morningstar would break labor laws so blatantly. I did not blow the whistle, but I have that email with me. I hope President Trump cracks down on these illegal and unethical practices. I am sure HR will come out and deny it and quote some facts and figures. This happened to me so it is true."

Clearly senior management aren't interested in attracting and retaining top talent outside the HQ. 

There are two salary reviews a year, but in practice it happens once a year and you are lucky if you get a 2% raise. ""Promotion"" at Morningstar usually means that they change your title and give you more responsibilities without additional monetary compensation.

Career progression outside the Chicago HQ is practically non-existent. Good performers aren't rewarded and low performers aren't penalized.

People are pretty decent in marketing/design. I think overall it's pretty steady. Lots of companies have ebbs and flows. I think Morningstar is no different.,"A year with a new CMO,  and marketing is pretty bad right now. This place is a disorganized mess. They talk about 'big ideas' but don't really support the areas of the company that actually make the money, which makes no sense. It makes the businesses mad too. I've been here a few years, it's gotten way worse, pretty much marketing kindergarten hiding behind a respected brand.

Lots of whining and infighting within marketing, super, super lame operational leadership. You can tell the marketing leaders don't understand the businesses they try to support. But pretend like they do. They try to act like they're at a startup. . Employees are kind of confused plus problems are handled with tons of passive aggression or straight-up ignored. Honestly it is uncomfortable sometimes."

Excellent benefits. Time off is superb, medical benefits better than market, lots of perks.

Good (enough) pay. Many complain about pay, but that's really a function of management being tolerant of complaints. A lot of changes were made to improve the compensation system, and deserving employees were rewarded. You won't make a fortune, but you will be treated fairly and live comfortably.

Nice leaders. The people are very nice. Joe is a genuine guy you can actually talk to. The client service head is the real deal, and many senior product and tech leaders are brilliant, committed people.","Lack of accountability. Deadlines slip, things go awry, and overspend occurs. 

Senior leaders not in touch. Most senior leaders have lost touch with the core of the workforce. Real challenges are being glossed over. The best of the senior leaders feel handcuffed by executives who think they know better.

Troublesome HR team. A few senior HR people have agendas and want to rule the world. Favorites are created, or you can be branded as a misfit if they don't like you. One key member of the HR team recently left, and many suspect the problems will get worse in his absence. 

Aging infrastructure. A lot of capital investment has been made, but years of neglect and ""scrappy"" decisions are leaving scars that will reduce client satisfaction and employee productivity."

Health care benefits are better than average. You can't beat the company's mission. Fun place, not bound by tradition.","Chaotic, incapable management do not align resources with priorities. Promised spend never arrives; no one is held accountable. Underperforming employees, even at a senior level, are shuffled around the company. Rampant lack of re-investment in programs and people leads to missed opportunities. Junior-level folks in some areas lack mentorship and deliver poor work unchecked. 

Also, a nearly philosophical reluctance to pay market rates has led to increased turnover as the job market improves. (For my position, I found that Morningstar pay was roughly 30% to 45% below market rate.) Because of this, Morningstar is on track to become an also-ran in many areas. Interested in working here? Depending on the area, I would strongly reconsider, especially if you are mid-career. The chaos just isn't worth it."

Which means that employees got so much opportunity to explore growth avenues within the company rather than look out. They are happy, learning in their roles, interacting with global teams and growing in their careers. Morningstar is the only company that I know of that offers so much internal growth to people. Anyone who wants to grow with Morningstar should join the company NOW  !!","You have to be committed and work hard. You need to put in sincere efforts.

If you slack off and make mistakes and are lazy, you will not get fired or reprimanded or held accountable, and will continue to enjoy very generous benefits.  You may get docked off a little bit as far as bonus goes, but that's no biggie.  You will still command really good benefits and a great place to work overall.

1. Paternity and maternity leaves
2. 1.25 earned leaves each month post probation, usually 6 months
3. 1 casual leave per month
4. 2 Restricted leaves per annum to be consumed only on the days which are allowed for RH
5. Health insurance of 2.5 lakhs if admitted to the hospital
6. Education stipend of max 15k per annum to be approved by your manager and HR
7. Tax free Flexi reimbursements that can include petrol, mobile, internet, medical/dental - supported by bills. You need to declare it at the beginning of the financial year failing which you lose this benefit (get it post taxation)
8. Cash grant equivalent of RSUs once a year if you are really a top notch performer
9. Birthday cake on your birthday.
10. HR, Managers, directors - they all talk about being open making you feel good
11. Annual party and annual picnic
12. Evening snacks at 5PM
13. 8 PM snack/mini-dinner if you are working for night shift
14. Night shift allowance.
15. INR 1100 worth sodexo food coupons
16. AC fare or cab for females staying beyond 8 PM - to be approved by manager - which they mostly do.
17. Newspapers, periodicals at office reception
18. Even if you continue to perform the worst of your career, you never get fired or placed on PIP. everyone gets a ""Meets expectation"" every year.
19. Play carrom a lot - most of the time they won't have work - and come out a champion.
20. Annual cricket teams, clubs - free t-shirts if you participate
21. You will soon have a feeling that you can spend your life here and retire from here.","Don't be fooled by the benefits that you read here for Chicago or UK employees. None of these apply to Mumbai office employees. 

You will be using the swipe in/ swipe out card based on which your hours are going to be calculated. You have to be inside the office for at least 8.5 hours each working day - 42.5 hours each week, failing even an hour- you attract loss of pay for a day. Carry overs are not allowed. You don't get an award if you're staying beyond 8.5 hours.

You can't get more than 2 Work From Home(WFH) in a Quarter - yeah that's right - that too ONLY IF there is a valid business reason approved by your manager and HR.

Employee referral policies are pathetic. You can only order two large pizzas in that referral amount if the referred employees stays for 3+ months.

Cash grant (RSUs) are divided into 4 instalments - 1 instalment each year. So if you received a cash grant of 1 lakh in 2010, you get 25k in 2011, 25k each in 2012, 2013 and 2014. So wait for 5 years to be rewarded for the work you did this year even if you are a top notch performer.

No sabbaticals for Indian employees. No unlimited PTOs either. Just 1.25 earned leaves + 1 CL each month.

If you plan to come by your self owned car, parking is a big problem if you don't get to office by 9:30 AM.

You will have no growth in your career irrespective of what group you join. You can join as a data analyst, as a tech lead in .Net, as an architect for Java or a technical manager - doesn't matter. You WILL remain at that position even after 5-10 years if you remain in this organization irrespective of how best or top notch a performer you are. Going to HR will be banging your head against a stone wall.

Employee reward mechanism is absolutely absent. No HR has ever heard of such a thing. You don't even get a China clay cup as a reward or recognition of your great job.

Managers are dumb and silent. They can't speak in townhalls and are afraid to ask questions.Most of them will say AYEs to Chicago and London. It's in their genes.

Expect your colleagues to be dumb and stupid and followers. Very few are leaders and may not stick for a couple of years unless forced. If you are a leader, you will get lost in the crowd.

HR, managers, directors- none of them really want to bring in a transparent culture at Mumbai office.

Expect to work on small monitors except if you're lucky and get to work in Mobile team where you get Bigger monitors.

Infrastructure team is pathetic and there are no SLAs for them. If you raise a ticket for a hardware, you will need to wait for 2-3 months. Even as a new joinee, you will need to wait for your machines and may have to follow up with IT team rigorously to get started.

The building elevator is as archaic as the policies themselves. Expect to be waiting for 15-20 minutes at peak hours.

Cafeteria on 7th floor - managed by building management - is pathetic. You can't even think of having water. It's pathetically unhygienic and full of arrogant waiters.

You will soon have a feeling that you can spend your life here and retire from here. That's where your career path will start decaying. Pack your bags and run away. Forget all your friends and fun you had here."

- Being a product company, the pay and benefits must be reasonably above average. But those are only slightly higher than what other large services companies offer.
- Lacks REAL project managers who know atleast something about the technology, and also have a fair idea about the domain/product. Most have really impressive communication skills, but nothing beyond that.

Managers who have no experience in business except for Morningstar. The company is a case of passive-aggressive personality disorder on a corporate scale. The best way to work here is by always managing upward (while ignoring your nominal duties), coming up with great, creative ideas that are impossible to implement, then giving the job of implementation to someone else, becoming Joe M's personal friend so you can have a C-level position in a field for which you have no training. By the way, don't believe the HR story about flexible leave policies. Yes, you can technically take as much vacation as you like; no one does. The people I know who still work there work very hard and suffer under severe pressure to produce while not receiving the resources necessary to produce quality work. Not having a vacation policy combined with strong social pressure means that you will likely not take much time off. The company has found very effective ways of exploiting white collar workers."

Good general business experience
Great products.","First role is veeeeeeeeery entry level. You're either placed in their call center as client service support for their products, or you're cleaning up data as a data analyst. It's very rare to get hired as a research associate and EVERYONE is trying to get those jobs internally.  It can be surprisingly disorganized. 

All the pros of meeting whoever you'd like, or attending any training sessions, go right out the window if you're in client service. Then you're on the phones from 8-5pm with a 1 hour break in between. If you want to meet someone or take advantage of a class, it better be on that. 

Management in certain departments are reluctant to hire MDPs because they'll rotate away, so they are hesitant to invest.

Training doesn't exist. It's a ""figure it out"" type company.  

Technology MDPs make almost 30K more than non-tech MDPs. (Yes, tech MDPs make 75K). 

The company is very, very, VERY cheap. Food runs out at the ""patio parties"". Bagel Day is the only free food you'll get. And they don't freakin pay you!  Don't be surprised when they only want to give you $500 relocation.

Great People, a lot of the negative comments about Morningstar are about political infighting. In my experience on the technology side people generally try to help each other but aligning priorities is a constant challenge with a fragmented team.  

There are people on the technology team that are true experts in their craft and are able/willing to help junior and intermediate people learn.  Morningstar's open and honest communication value means that you can ask questions, you can challenge the opinions of senior people, it's a great collaborative environment.

Senior people are accessible and approachable.  

Technology group is a meritocracy for the most part.  Good ideas are implemented regardless of who suggested them.  Most Senior Managers are qualified to be in their position, CTO is very bright and still gets his hands dirty with a keyboard from time to time.","It's proven difficult to retain the best and brightest.

If you lose a team member you have to re-justify the position which is tedious and time consuming.
After months of interviewing, you find the right candidate and then find out the position was frozen.  This encourages us to hire someone who is not perfect quickly before the position is withdrawn and you need to start over again with re-justification.

As mentioned in the ""Pro"" the technology team is not very political (from my perspective), but I have seen quite a lot of politics being played on the non-technology group."

- Company transitioning from a growth company to a stable value company.  Will not invest in business lines until after there is some sort of external monetary commitment for service offering.  Creates a situation where Morningstar is late to enter any new development in the industry.
- Company reorgs at least annually, usually at the expense of almost all employees.  Has created a culture of resentment and low morale.  Culture used to be collaborative, happy, and energetic.  Far different now due to ongoing change and lack of direction and communication.
- Low Pay compared to other firms in the industry.  You will make roughly 60-70% what you could make doing the same job within a different firm.  
- HR is ineffective.  Very disorganized, no clear direction, and constantly trying to make things better but are really ineffective at doing anything of any significance.  Group continues to grow larger and larger.
- Company has restructured at the expense of good performing employees to pay everyone roughly the same.  Took a socialist approach to bonuses and thus, will eventually push out the high performers and attract low performers to stay.  Additionally, bonuses never get paid in full no matter what due to unattainable goals.

I think highly of Joe Mansueto, the CEO. His down-to-earth and Buffett-esque leadership style is laudable and I enjoyed the interactions I had with him during my tenure.","Compensation is quite poor - I more than doubled my base salary by going to a startup. It's only after several years after getting a market correction that I realize how poor my compensation had been relative to the market during my career at Morningstar.

Moreover, the company's extremely lopsided management of tuition reimbursement left me with a very large repayment (tens of thousands) when I had previously been recruited with promises of tuition assistance as a portion of my compensation (with no requirement for paying back). Adding salt to the wounds, I have I have friends and colleagues from Morningstar who weren't asked to pay back anything at all at the time they left the organization while I will continue to pay the company back years after my employment ended. 

Through this all Morningstar taught me a valuable lesson - you need to look out for yourself and not expect that the company is going to give you a moment of thought/consideration the moment it isn't intrinsically motivated to do so. It was a hard lesson to learn and was very disappointing after having spent nearly a third of my life as a high-performer at this company."

Occasional patio parties in the summer, but those have reduced. They offer 6 weeks paid sabbatical every 4 years which particularly appeals to the type of employee who is unmotivated and looking for an excuse to take off from work. Nice cool looking office, but you cannot take that to the bank.","Senior Management
The CEO is a good man, but more recently he seems to have lost control over his company and does not know what his underlings are doing. The Presidents who report to him have been in the company for 15 to 20 years and have gotten used to doing less and less for higher and higher salaries and bonus. They aren't leaders, they are just place-holders and seat-warmers. People down the chain snicker at their abilities instead of looking up to them for leadership. While incompetent, they are mostly harmless. This cannot be said about the lower level of managers who are actively involved in political machinations to make themselves look good while grabbing credit for work that their direct reports have done without giving them the credit. This is rampant throughout the company. It happened to me and many others I know. These managers place themselves as intermediaries between the lowest level and the senior management and give them the message that all the ideas and innovation was their idea and everyone else just follows their leadership. This seems to work and these people are awarded promotions.

Work Environment
The work environment and the people were great when I joined, but around a year and a half everything began to fall apart quite rapidly. The software division had a re-org and some unworthy people were promoted way above their capabilities and given fancy titles like Director, VP, Sr VP etc. Most of these people had collected accomplishments by claiming other people's work. With greater titles come greater responsibilities, but these people got arrogant and began to throw their weight around. Courteous people suddenly became insufferable and hard to work with. I began to get the Sunday afternoon blues, when from Sunday 3pm onwards, I begin to dread coming into work on Monday. Everyone got into a hunker-down ""cover my backside"" mode and everyone backstabbing each other. The sales team was particularly notorious and would blame other teams whenever they failed to get a deal, and would hog all the credit when a deal went through. And of course, they got the promotions, bonuses and raises along with the accolades leading to resentment in the teams that actually built the product that made this happen.
My own manager got into some trouble with some clients he was working on, so he began to involve me in the mess that he created, so he could spread the blame around. He had not bothered to call me into meetings when things looked good. He was weird and seemed to suffer from sort of bipolar disorder with passive-aggressive behavior. He would be nice and pleasant to my face and then send me nasty angry emails soon after. Morningstar seems to have a lot of such people with mental and psychological issues.

Diversity
Diversity is practically non-existent at Morningstar. If you are not from a certain ethnic group, you have no avenues of career growth. Do not buy the lie that HR tells everyone that you can move around in the company and do different things. The reality is that if you are Asian, once you are hired, you will be chained to that job until you leave, you die, or they get rid of you. Diversity exists only at the lowest level of developers and QA people.

Human Resources
HR is arrogant, rude and their job seems to be only to protect the company and not help employees work better. They lie to you when they bring you in. The HR person I worked with misled me by saying that bonuses were usually 25% for the group that was hiring me. Reality was only about 7% and raises were gone by the second year. They come up ill thought plans to give people experience working in other groups and most of these schemes die quickly. For example, they started talking about allowing employees in tech get some financial experience and then nothing happened. Morningstar is great at creating MBAs from top schools like Kellogg and Booth, but horrible at figuring out what to do with them. Many of them end up in support jobs taking phone calls.


Salary, Benefits
Salary is probably the worst in the industry. The game plan is to hire kids straight out of college at low salaries and have them compete with more experienced people to drive down costs. But you get what you pay for and this caused the multi million dollar cloud project to completely fail and get quietly shelved. Some years ago, HR hatched a plan to ""convince"" employees that they were paid fairly by putting out a page of numbers for each one, but then no one bought it. It was a bad idea to begin with, because everyone compares their measly salary with their friends' in comparable jobs and feel cheated. Good luck keeping good talent, Morningstar! I myself took a huge paycut to accept Morningstar's offer only because I thought it made sense at that time to trade off salary for good experience. The ""benefits"" are not any better than any other company though the company likes to tout it that way. 

Bottom Line
Pass on Morningstar. It is no longer the great place it was. Join only if you are offered or can negotiate a great deal because that's all you will get for the next many years until you quit. If you are young (27 and under), join, get some experience and leave. Morningstar is currently paying for its sins of employee alienation and hard working employees are leaving the company in droves, leaving behind the slackers."
1640,,Morningstar has been an excellent company to work for. I've worked here since I graduated college in 2010.,2014-09-10,3.0,Workflow Coordinator,"Great company culture, flexible hours, no limit on vacation, every four years you get a 6-week paid sabbatical","Coordination between teams, salaries are lower than average, but the overall compensation package makes up for it in my opinion."
1641,,Not a place for the career minded or ambitious. The company  is currently troubled and needs to make big changes.,2014-09-05,2.0,Product Manager,"While Morningstar's historic strengths have been diluted greatly the last five years, the company still features a great group of people who generally believe in the company's mission. Employees are highly educated and love investing. The office space is very nice, and the company culture is laid back. 

The work-life balance can not be emphasized enough. It is a place that still trusts its employees to do good work and will take care of you should you need time off. The benefits aren't as great as they used to be but still are a nice feature. The sabbatical program is a really great offer. For a young person or someone in the latter days of their career, the light work load, benefits, and reasonable job expectations can make for a great workplace environment.","Where to begin. While the founder and CEO deserves high marks for being an approachable and passionate leader, his personnel choices of late and his general approach to operating the company have wreaked a lot of havoc. The senior management is turning over slowly but still features a raft of lifers who manage upwards, engage in passive aggressive behavior, and largely don't have the skill or experience to meet their mandates. There is little consequence for failure if you operate within the favored clique of insider managers, so bad decision making and lack of managerial skill have calcified in most areas of the company. 

Compensation policies have always been extremely frugal both in general and relative to other companies in the financial services industry. Recently, the company shifted to a socialized, company wide bonus system and the introduced a young and inexperienced global pay czar at the HR level. These moves have lead to pay packages well below even a few years ago's already substandard offers.

The company lacks strategic direction, mostly because it retains a very inward-looking approach to business. Strategic initiatives often make no sense . . .the recent cloud based software push that lead to nothing but wasted time and energy, the drive to compete with middle ware software vendors in the Advisor software industry, the push into real time and commodity data that fizzled and died very quickly. There is no emphasis on planning and bench-marking, so major initiatives get way down the road before anyone can determine that they are off the rails and doomed for failure. The recent company re-organization is a prime example. 

It cannot be stressed enough that there is no real avenue to build a career, gain seniority, and sharpen your skill set without playing the political games the company requires. The current management team basically has a ""Do Not Solicit"" sign out at all times and emphasizes a yes man culture. Smile and nod your head and you may have a chance. If you voice an independent opinion or offer constructive criticism, it blows back on you. This has lead to a steady stream of departures from the company in the most critical areas. The 10-15 year experienced, value added veterans are leaving as fast as they can, leaving behind a mix of youth and loyalists willing to play the promotion game. The talent pool is definitely depleting at the company. 

Finally, beware of the company's advertising. It is largely untrue. While it claims great products, it has skimped on development and support. While it claims to attract and retain great people, it underpays them and yawns when they leave."

Monumental shifts in the company where people and divisions do a reshuffling happen quite often, which brings more changes that the Company is struggling to execute.  The company has shifted to a centralized company, which in an of itself is not a bad operational strategy.  However, it has toll on its employees and clients.  As a result, the culture has suffered and the products.  There is more to a company's organization than updating organization charts.  Little thought has been given to documenting and implementing how the company should operate as a cohesive unit and how to get things done for its clients.  Many key leadership and management have left the company, and now the new CFO is cost cutting and trimming headcount throughout the organization.  Salaries are below market.

Our company has always been a gem in the investment industry for its limited hours and relaxed environment which are still consistently present at the company. Expect to work less than 45 hour weeks typically and enjoy the free soft drinks, tea and coffee (and bagels on Wednesdays). I think generally speaking, our managers mean well and do care about their employee's wellness.","Compensation packages, limited upward mobility, strategy inconsistency, regular corporate missteps, increasingly opaque.

Over time, Morningstar is losing touch with its employee base. Many coworkers sit with hardly anything to do, and yet our headcount is exploding YoY. Projects regularly stall without adequate developers (or developers that are required to actually work at work) and during vacation season, people lose all sense of delivering what's necessary to our clients in a timely fashion.  

Simmering resent is perhaps as widespread as it's ever been during my tenure with the company - at face value everybody is happy, but when you talk to anybody over details, people are truly miserable. Limited hours sounds great, but this slack in employee time results in employees feeling underutilized and underappreciated. Add to this substantially sub-par pay packages and our hard working, innovative and bright employees are the ones leaving the firm. Often the long-term employees here are either high ranking and loaded with stock (very smart as well) or they're manipulators of the system who feel free to take 4-6 weeks of vacation a year and move slowly at best when they're on the job.

Over the past couple of years, two out of three have eroded away. Morningstar still has a beautiful and appealing office, but the work culture is bad and the people are in shambles. 

Work Culture
I saw a sea-change in the work culture during my few years at the firm. People used to be helpful, happy and collaborative in the beginning. There used to be many team building events and parties. This has been replaced by a culture where only a chosen few are happy and everyone else is looking for the first opportunity to jump ship. The politics in the company has increased exponentially. Towards the end I was suffering from the Sunday-afternoon syndrome from 3pm onwards when I would begin to dread the coming work-week. There is a tendency to promote certain people based on dubious credentials and these characters function in a very arrogant manner.

Management
The middle management thinks that they are much better than they really are. Work is not recognized or appreciated and these managers act like shields and do not promote the achievements of their reports to the higher-ups. The reason is that they can garner all the credit by claiming other people's work. This becomes a motivation killer because employees feel that nothing they do is going to get them to the next level anyway. Performance Reviews are a joke and merely a tool for the manager to harass the employees they do not like or are feel threatened by, or a way to reward the employees who cozy up to them and do not feel threatened by. Project priorities change every day so employees are left confused as to what the long term vision is. At the end of the year, you are left with a bunch of project that you are 80% done with and that does not play well in the performance review process. You can sense that there is an undercurrent of secrecy, tension and backbiting. 

There is an initiative in the company to bring about uniform-ness in the product offerings and this project has been bungled by putting the wrong people in charge. Morningstar's tendency is to do everything on the cheap by assigning new college grads to work on this which would be ""Morningstar's future"". Management does not want to hire more or get contractors for this, so they are cannibalizing developers from their existing products that are in high demand and need development. While senior management never tires to gloat what this would do, everyone at the lower rungs knows that this is going to fail and would die a quiet death eventually in some face-saving manner. However, this is also starving the successful products, so the future is cloudy.


Compensation
Compensation is a sad joke and it always has been. They hire you and claim that they give out 40% bonuses and that the average is 20% but the reality is it is 10% and nowadays it is 3%. The chosen few (usually yes-men) get more but I talked to many employees and they got between 0% and 5% leading to dissatisfaction. They firm touts its ""great benefits"" but it is not that much greater than outside and they refuse to believe it.

Career Growth
Non existent. If you are lucky to get in 17 years ago, or have somehow been directly hired to a senior level, you are in good shape. If not, do not expect to be able to grow. HR sells new hires the ""you can work in different parts of the company"" line, but this is not true at all. I suspect that the company itself is not growing, so there are no new positions and the company is always in a save-money mode.

Overall:
A great company losing it's way.

Advice for people looking for employment
Join Morningstar if you are aged below 27 and have plans to do an MBA from Booth/Kellogg and have the company pay for it. Morningstar is a good name for the resume and you can get in easier if you work at Morningstar. Morningstar does not know what to do with MBAs so most people after finishing rather than stay around and work in a call center/tech support job.

If you are over 27, negotiate a title and salary that you will be okay with for the next few years because you aren't getting any significant raises or bonuses."

1739,,Morningstar: It's Like Being in a Family with Cheap Parents,2013-04-24,5.0,Client Manager,"- Collaborative and team-oriented culture where most employees truly care about their respective projects
- Rapport among employees is like that among casual friends
- Many teams have excellent morale and a strong sense of purpose
- Work-life balance ratio is amazing; you can take a vacation almost whenever you want, for how long you want, and it's not uncommon to work 7-hour days","- Compensation is variable; pay raises/bonuses are all over the map, with the company erring on the conservative side for most employees
- Some of the technical employees are very hard to work with because they a) speak little English b) are in China/India c) are difficult people to begin with and/or d) are not motivated. Every employee should be required to learn about our clients, who they are, how we serve them, etc. We should also treat employees as ""internal"" clients, if you will."

1742,,Morningstar needs to hit the 'reset' button,2013-04-10,3.0,Senior Product Manager,"I worked at Morningstar for over 10 years and saw the company evolve from a true start-up to a maturing, global business. What made the company great in the early-mid 90s no longer sets it a part from the companies of today, however the ability to forge your own path is still attractive if you're an individual who can take initiative, network with the right people, and not wait for someone to offer you what you want in terms of more experience.  The flexible schedule is the real standout in terms of strong Pros - very few companies get that people are not children and if you treat adults like professionals and expect them to manage their time and take ownership of their work, they'll deliver and you can avoid a 'clock in, clock out' mentality that comes with a paternalistic approach to vacation/sick time.","Executive management consists of folks who have been at the company 16+ years and it is starting to show in a negative way - lack of focus in terms of direction and vision, inability to commit to certain goals in a tangible way (e.g. put the resources against the products that have the most potential for growth and kill the ones that don't make money) and aversion to the types of calculated risks that will be necessary to avoid Morningstar from becoming another Value Line. 

Many folks mention a 'flat hierarchy' and while that can be helpful, I think it's starting to work against the company. The people in the executive ranks have made their millions; the middle managers and their teams who are the ones cranking out all the work get paid below market wages but are expected to do the job of 3+ people. Burn out is common and if you're good at your job, the expectations keep getting higher.  

No mentoring for managers and no career path development. HR is a disappointment - while the HR management claims to care about employees and the desire to be transparent, an initiative in 2012 to address salary concerns went no where and died after several months."
1743,,Company has good reputation and will pay you less for it,2013-04-04,2.0,Data Analyst,The overall culture is good and the people are very nice mostly.

1744,,"Dull job in a poorly managed, mediocre, and bureaucratic organization; no place to build a career/ grow valuable skills",2013-04-03,2.0,,"If you need a job, Morningstar's ok. Expect little more from your time there. What the company doesn't offer in interesting work, industry avg. compensation, bureaucratic competency, or enjoyable social events, it attempts to make up for in:

1) Management that seems reluctant to downsize
2) Promoting those that stay at the company the longest
3) Casual Culture  
4) Solid benefits (Medical, Dental, 401K) 
5) Partial tuition reimbursement: CFA & MBA ($17,500/ year + 2 yr post-graduation commitment to work for M*, or all tuition $ must be paid back). High placement at Booth & Kellogg (Part-time only). 
6) Bagels on Wednesday's, soda daily
7) Generous vacation/ sick day/ sabbatical policy (Can somewhat vary under different managers) 
8) Nice mission statements","Many departments are slow moving, dead end, and don't care to develop employees. Most positions are uninteresting, unfulfilling, and inadequately compensated. 

Despite office congeniality, morale is low, team work mentality rare, and back biting common. Real incentive/reward for hard work, or growth of earning potential, doesn't exist (except on some sales teams). Business is challenged and in an awkward stage of development.

Confused and/or false messaging from upper management is persistent. Same as any other company, you can't trust the rhetoric. The execution of principles and policies is inconsistent across departments and managers. An innovative and entrepreneurial spirit no longer exists, having been replaced with an attempt to maintain status-quo. Value-creating start-up has been traded for an institutional deal-making culture. But, the transition has been managed poorly. 

The realities of daily business are very different from the recruitment pitch and stated principals. It's no longer a ""think different"" type of place; it's products are not all that excellent. Expect a difficult time transitioning jobs in house or progressing beyond your present position."

The work  is as monotonous as you would experience as a trainee at an investment bank, but the company is much less demanding regarding time at the office.","The company is basically a start-up that was in the right place at the right time (had a fund rating product in the '80s when employers started converting pensions into 401(k) accounts and shifting the burden of retirement planning to workers). The upper management believes there company has been successful because of the brilliance of their management. In actuality, the company has succeeded despite rather than due to the management. Sometimes there is nothing more dangerous than success; Morningstar is a case in point.

Business decisions are made by people unqualified to make them and inexperienced. These are the ones who have worked for the company for years and who, whether competent or not, are trusted by someone above them who is similarly incompetent. The result in the area where I worked was a real Lord of the Flies kind of story where people with no management experience and little experience in the general industry were put in positions of supervision over others. Imagine someone that might be working as an assistant at a reputable investment bank instead being the head of a 100-person group.

Morningstar's business is struggling as the organization long ago exceeded the limits of their competency and two market crashes within 10-years has removed the attraction in many of their clients' minds of investing in the market. The company is attempting to shift its focus to institutional customers, but haven't realized that this is a much more competitive market with players who are much more well established, much better run, and have much deeper pockets.

1803,,Very Bad Salary,2012-02-23,2.0,Analyst,Morningstar has a great mission. Joe Mansueto is an icon.,"They don't mind screwing people over on pay. If you do not work in Chicago, you have to deal with local HR. Local HR is the deal breaker. If you do not work in Chicago, it is like you do not work at Morningstar."

However things are not too organised.,2012-02-20,4.0,Senior Research Analyst,"Work-life balance, Open culture, opportunity to innovate / experiment",Unorganised especially in the new countries where operations have commenced lately.

1806,,Not as flexible as they claim to be.,2012-01-28,3.0,,It is a growing company.,"Although they claim to be flexible, the company culture does not really promote it."
1807,,Morningstar is a great place to intern during the school-year to gain experience in the financial industry.,2012-01-21,4.0,Equity Analyst Intern,"Results-focused
Casual atmosphere
Analysts often willing to help interns
Smart, qualified people (I worked with 6x CFAs)","Difficult to get into Morningstar Development Program as an intern in 2011
Formal training could be more intensive"
1808,,Relaxed Midwest culture,2012-01-13,5.0,,Culture and people are Morningstar's greatest assets. The structure is flat. There are multiple opportunities to socialize and get to know everyone.,There really is no downside besides compensation. It also lacks a global presence but is working on building an Australia office.
1809,,"Just OK, IT's a Job",2012-01-10,3.0,,"Good Benefits, 401k, Medical, Vacation are all great.","Disconnected teams, Disconnected Exec Management, Lack of clear direction. Ran with NO CTO CIO for too long."

*Flexible work hours
*free cokes and coffee in the office
*good location, easy to get to and from.
*Good networking in the industry","Management in some areas are rude and very condescending. There really is a lack of people skills. As an employee outside of Chicago, there was little to no training, and difficult to get support - pretty much a fend for yourself type of environment. Very cliquish in nature, and lots of politics. Processes required to close sales to be very cumbersome across most SBU's  thus obstructive to productivity.  All in all, Morningstar makes it harder than necessary to keep morale up and good employees from straying."
1813,,Opportunity to develop your own career path,2011-12-15,5.0,Equity Analyst,"Very flexible work environment, including reasonable hours and occasional ability to work from home. Great benefits including 6 week paid sabbatical every four years. Great people, very friendly, open environment. Management open to feedback. Ability to be entrepreneurial and develop your own career path.","Compensation is low for finance industry and equity research in particular, but this is offset by reasonable hours and other flexibility.

No career planning, little transparency in how salaries/travel are determined."
1818,,"Great company, with a few drawbacks",2011-10-19,4.0,Business Analyst,The culture at Morningstar is very relaxed and inclusive. The rapport between employees is generally one of casual friends. You are recognized by your peers and management when you perform well. Management is very understanding when an employee needs to take time off for personal reasons.,Morningstar has a large technology base off-shore so increasingly a lot of the work has been shifted there. Compensation purely in terms of salary is not on par with competitors because of the large off shore workforce.
