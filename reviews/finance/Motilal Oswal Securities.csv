The training for calls and the pressure environment can help in improving the communication skill also make you very comfortable in the front end calling and in making conversation.

Since you would be pitching a lot of stocks and financial instruments you will get a very good insight on the overall market and how the financial market dealing happens. Along with that, you would learn a lot about the fundamental of the company which will be helpful in the future.","A lot of things would depend on your team if you are part of a good team and it has good data set you will be able to perform otherwise you won’t able to perform or generate revenue. If there is no revenue you would have no incentive this would not be good as the basic pay will be very low.

There won’t be any work-life balance you would be working almost 12Hrs a day which can impact your mental health. If your targets are not then also you would have to sit back for more work
