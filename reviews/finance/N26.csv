Quite messy when it comes to roles, task, etc. it really depends on you Manager if your team has a clear objective."

5,N26,Everything I expected,2022-02-25,5.0,Senior IOS Engineer,I heard N26 was a really good place to work as an iOS Engineer and it certainly did meet my expectations. The other engineers there are amazing and have a deep knowledge of the technology and all the best practices. Great place to learn with high quality code.,None that comes up to my mind right now.

8,N26,Stay Away!,2022-02-12,1.0,Senior Software Engineer,"I made a lot of good friends while at N26 and the work, while at times, chaotic, has the ability to teach you a lot.","The company is completely dysfunctional. The product organization has been completely castrated by the CEO, who demands that all decisions be signed off by him. To make matters worse, he has surrounded himself with yes-men, who are happy to collect their paychecks while adding nothing of value to the organization, such as a CTO who has no technical background.

Decisions are made on whims, and are always chasing a quick win, just to keep the VC money flowing. It took how long and how many warnings from BaFin to finally build out a legitimate fraud prevention team? Why make a real commitment to building a bank if you can fake it until you make it instead.

Why did N26 enter both the UK and USA? Money. Why did they leave both markets? Because no one ever asked what would make those markets successful, so instead they bombed. Why should any one think a commitment to expanding into eastern Europe will be any different?

And to sum up how out of touch management is, early on during Covid, there was a company-wide meeting, where the founders were fielding many tough questions about the recent layoffs and their lack of work from home policy. The COO decided to cut the meeting short to announce that he was dropping his new techno album and you could contact him for a copy."

Despite the negative sides I would still recommend it as a place to work, given that they fixed the low salaries for the design positions.","The main issues at N26 are imho from the upper management. The direction of the company is very much top-down and -though they have been trying to change that- the individual teams/segments have not enough ownership to drive the initiatives that they believe would have the most impact. As a result, processes become sluggish, people sometimes become less motivated because to achieve anything you need to go through endless loops. 
Furthermore the employees have little trust of the leadership team. From my experience, after a while I stop caring on what the leadership was saying and focused on my work and team (which was great). There's no point watching the founders Q&A sessions if all you get out of it is inconclusive, ready-made answers."

A fast-growing company where, for better and worse, things change fast.
I still use the prodcut to this day, despite the chip on my shoulder.","There were madenning layers of obfuscation between the day-to-day job and the goals of management. A depressing lack of information was shared with CS staff, which made it impossible to be a genuinely enthusiastic ambassador for the product. 
An unfortunate reality of being a CS specialist is that your job often isn't to solve the customer's problem, but to sandbag the customer until they either give up or the issue solves itself. The most serious and most frequent issues were often to do with each supported country's own unique banking laws, and the many legal grey areas e-banking start-ups base their business on.
I could have written these problems off as the price of working at a company breaking new ground, but at no point was customer support given reason to have faith in management's vision for the company, because it was never shared with us."

No increase for more than a year!
So much stress during the hypergrowth that was like hell. They put people on kurzarbeit and then 29 days lates they extend the funding round with 60 Million. They never had an issue to keep that people they just wanted to use the program just not to pay them. Also they used that to get rid of some people. Many people left because of that.

Another many reason that people leave is because of salary. If you joined more than 2 years ago you still be in a low salary. When you ask for an increase they give you excuse and they tell you you are in the correct range. But you do not know the range of your position. They put many people on PIP in order not to increase their salary.

Everyone calls it now the titanic of Berlin. Everyone is making fun of by saying everyone is jumping the N26 ship. People that they are great on what they are doing they just go to another company and they get much more money. The only people that stay are the ones that are friends with the management and the ones that are not really capable to do anything.

7 million customers but maybe half of them are not even identified. They just sign up with the email and they never complete the process to receive their card. Revolut and vivid are ahead now. No more innovation or new products coming in the future. They made such a big deal when they released dark mode that was a big feature 😂"

The CEO is clearly not capable of the position he is having and since he's the CPO as well almost all good product managers have left the company. When talking about Valentin, a lot of people referred to him as a child that wants his will and nothing else. Proper product strategy papers have been declined by him based on his own ideas. There is no clear and stable focus or direction for the company and nobody knows who is responsible for what. On top of this, the experienced Head of Products have either been fired or were kept super busy with responsibilities for multiple groups. In a series of bad hires and promotions, there is now a mixture of product directors / product people in charge that either have no idea about building a tech business with these dimensions or they are super early in their careers. A lot of project managers turning into Senior Product Managers and alike. Product Management is equal to doing project management for the ideas of the CEO/CPO.

Most of the competent and driven people had left the team in the beginning of this year because they were underpaid and overworked, replaced by agency recruiters who care only about commission and not at all the quality of their hires (which I can imagine will have a very negative effect down the line across company).

Money at the end of the month to eat
Free drinks ?","- Awful management ! All the rumors are true !

- Founders are friendly and took time to discuss with their workforce during momentum of crisis but it seems just beow them it's a total mess.

- Low salaries ! They said they have 2 rounds March and September, it's a LIE. On March it is to go on another level (BTW no one understand anything about this and when you ask HR they say it's confidential. Wut? This information has been made public therefore this is not a company secret anymore). On September they tell you that since the policy around it has changed and it is also ""in relation to the general bahaviour"", basically you can kiss goodbye the tiny piecce of cheese you would get out of it anyway.

- Never integrating CS suppot in anything. Therefore you learn about major changes of the product sometimes the same day as a customer. #adaptability

- Buggy processes. Never applying feedback.

- Firing the talents but outsourcing on external centers that do not follow the same quality standards.

- Promoting ass-kissers despite more capable employees. It makes you wonder who is taking the decisions upstairs.

- Departments that delagate the shitty tasks to lower level because reasons ? Of course, consequently, responsabilities are increasing on a personel level but not the money ;)

- Q and A's sessions are the best dodging bullets scene I have ever seen. They are only good if you want to learn irrelevant topics about management and how good marketing is doing.

- Forget about evolutions. You are just good to be an extra. Nothing more"
110,N26,Used to be good - terrible nowadays,2021-03-15,1.0,Software Engineer,"- Good salaries in general (if you negotiated well in your interviews)
- Foods & drinks available in the offices
- Interesting product (but not updated)","- The product has stayed frozen for the past years. It used to be innovative, fresh and pushing the limits. Nowadays no features are ever added, no support for crypto, no investment options for most markets. We have fallen behind the other players in the market, they used to be copying and trying to keep up with us - this is no longer true.
- Very hard and bureaucratic process to get a raise (and only 1-2 instances per year for this)
- Lower standards for hiring: the hiring process used to be harder, nowadays it seems that almost anyone who is willing to join us (fewer by the hour...) gets an offer. Giving a ""no"" to someone gets a lot of pushback sometimes and pressure to change your review to a ""yes""
- Bad hiring process - related to the previous point: the questions have been the same since before I joined the company (3+ years), a simple google search will give you most of the answers.
- No salary updates for people who have been in the company for a long time: there are many discrepancies in many roles, for example engineers with the same title making 20k more than other, not always deserving this difference.
- Very bad engineering decisions in many areas: this depends a lot on the team you're working on, I would say half are bad though. Some areas have unqualified ""leaders"" (see previous point on bad hiring...) who boldly take random architectural decisions that have a huge impact on the team and its roadmap. Months/years are then spent following these crazy, poorly thought-out decisions which lead to even worse situations and a mess.
- People quitting: so many people have been quitting lately that there is a weird atmosphere in the company, people are no longer proud to say they work there. The better employees are all going elsewhere and we are left with these unqualified leaders/employees happily taking all the new responsibilities and getting promotions.
- C-level/upper management are mostly terrible. The ones that are good are the ones who quit over the first months they joined (check the news on C-level changes and you'll see how many are changing all the time). The others are completely clueless. The current CTO barely addresses the tech department in general, I have never once heard him talk about actually useful proposals to improve *anything* in the company."

115,N26,Je t’aime N26!,2021-02-26,1.0,Engineering Manager,"Always wanted to work for a startup bank!! Maybe one day others will believe it too!!!

Throughout the last few years I witnessed exponential hypergrowth, in the sense of new blood coming into the meat grinder and old discarded. At a very calculated interval of 6-12 months!
What a gamechanger!

Such a splendid atmosphere eating sugary snacks to keep running in the treadmill! The very little benefits and below market pay in engineering keep my subordinates very stimulated. The -1 budget for team events is an added bonus!

Loved working with burned-out engineers while trying to avoid the political minefields of toxic managers and ‘yes men’ that wait us in every corner. 
Turned a blind eye to bully engineers turned managers overnight and mastered avoiding sec sociopaths that were given management duties!

I had the opportunity to be called into last moment meetings about compliance topics that should have been done yesterday, fudge the way to the next audit to avoid more regulatory fines from Bafin and hear about customer data stolen that nobody knows what they were!

The company mission kept me on my feet, year after year! Let’s do 200 things when realistically we can do 50.
Who cares as long as we can have cool warehouse parties with the founders!

Total lack of focus and working processes made me better at useless ping-pong with others… almost championed the public sector 9-3 style of N26 Bank.

Unfortunately other directors that come and quit within the year were not so determined. So weak :(
Same goes for all those who disappeared on a friday afternoon. You didn’t see it coming, did you?

The epitome of success is measured by how many CTOs we are changing within a year. Ask any engineer!
My favourite interim CTO moment was when our saviour got promoted, fired managers that disagreed with the complete lack of plan, toured around offices like a rockstar with his baseball cap and ‘agile consultant’ supporters, got demoted AND quit… ALL in 6 months.
What a ride! It got me more acquainted with kitkat!

Finally, a big thanks to the HR hard core. Ruthless, trained in hire & fire techniques, they always find time if it’s about whipping.
With resourceful denial they have been downplaying the countless something-hit-the-fan moments, giving us lots of self-praising bot-style answers about N26 achievements! The joy!!
I love the way they take feedback constantly over the years and making N26 great again!!

After all, it's no surprise that N26 is the top startup employer in the world! Constantly hiring and in hypergrowth.
For example, since Feb last year we are 300 employees less! If this is not sustainable growth towards 0, what is it?!

Apollo 13, is the mission that exactly matches N26. I’m proud to say that with such determined leadership we made it already 5 times there!! Hurrah hurrah!","Nothing… except those works council persons that dare to gather in bars to resist the masters. Treason! 
Good thing that the CEO sent the cops in time and showed them who’s the boss!
I’m confused about his later tweet tho!

Still miss those Amalfi coast CX retreats that we get pampered with. What a celebration of being in love with ourselves! After all we deserve it for doing such a job!

I have no doubts about the glorious future! Running out of money or flash sale are the two success scenarios on the table and I can’t wait to give every last drop of engineering essence for our leaders pocket and future keynote story!

Je t’aime N26!"

While I did plan on learning a lot while working here, don't bet on it. The bucket load of work and re-work that you will be doing which are outside your OKRs (Objectives and Key Results)/ KPIs will keep you busy. Related to the aforementioned lack of a technical roadmap.

I recommend overlooking this company if you are looking for your next job."

166,N26,N26 is a company with a lot of potential due to its people and product,2020-10-06,4.0,Data Scientist,"Before moving further, it should be clear that my review cannot be free of my personal biases. My goal is to share my view that is based on my personal experiences as well as the sentiments of the people that I interact with in my day-to-day job; as objectively as I can.

Without trying to discredit critical opinions or bad experiences that people have shared here, I have to clarify that I perceive a portion of the reviews on Glassdoor as non-objective, and at times citing false information. But overall one can find a wealth of useful pointers about the company. 

Working at N26 for the past 6 months has been a fruitful ride. I have had the chance to collaborate with very capable and motivated people and work on topics with huge potential. Across the company, the overwhelming feeling is that people are excited about what they do and they strive to see the product succeed.

Some frequent points of criticism

* Inclusivity and HR culture. N26 is a workplace that puts a lot of effort into those topics. For sure mistakes have been made and they deserve the attention they got. But it would be unfair to not acknowledge that most people internally experience a healthy environment with many forward-thinking initiatives from the company.

* Experience level of the employees and professionalism. N26 attracts and retains high-quality people - I believe that is clear. In the set of people that I have worked with, I only encountered the level of professionalism one can expect from a high-caliber tech organisation. The friction that is discussed here is often the result of the overall organisation structure that is not yet fully geared to support the mission of the company.

* Relationship with the Founders and transparency. Judging by the reviews on GD, this is likely the most controversial topic. In my understanding, this topic is often entangled with the views people have on the company's strategy.

 In N26 there are regular AMA sessions with the Leadership team where participation is encouraged. All internal topics are heavily discussed during those sessions. Metrics and OKRs are openly discussed regularly as well as strategic / product and growth updates. 


On the other hand, the founders have showcased lack of trust towards the employees in the past and that weights heavily on many. The stiffness of the founders to adapt to what the people ask for is partially explained by the field that the company is operating in (very strongly regulated and tense). But to deliver on the big goals, eventually the company will have to find more efficient ways to scale the delivery of value towards the customers on a global level.

After this lengthy intro :)

Pros:

- young and dynamic company with good quality employees
- good working environment and great offices 
- clear company focus on diversity and inclusion
- the company has become more wfh-friendly. With most people working fully remotely for the past months and the company acknowledging this direction moving forward.
- projects with a lot of impact
- a product that is loved by many","- More structure and definition of practices is needed in some areas of the company. Not all functions/roles are similarly mature.
- Data access can be a burden for certain teams.
- Frequent confrontations on the media about the company internals
- The pace of delivery of global features needs to increase"

- Subsidised travel card + urban sports club (reduced after covid)","- Grew way too quickly last year and the year before. Culture was not preserved and it created a lot of technical debt, as well as pummelling morale.
- The first thing I noticed here was how antisocial the office is. People talk little with each other. Teams are often bubbles that barely interact with others. There are no social events other than Friday 6/7pm pizza to discuss the work week
- Management pretend to be engaged and send round surveys etc but nothing seems to actually change. I just hear empty statements.
- What were the first things to suffer come the COVID-19 crisis? Employee benefits were cut, half the design team (amongst others) were put on furlough, and come promotion time, no raises are given but instead virtual stock options with a list of conditions casting a shadow over their perceived value
- Little support for the droves of people moving to working from home; it’s somewhat forgivable given the shock for everyone, but it was an opportunity to be supportive for parents with kids now always at home, people struggling with poor mental health, etc. All we were told was to “invest in our work from home setup” and to come back to the office as soon as possible.
- Said office is dark and gloomy, the only colourful areas are the ones used for marketing photos. There are some nice goodies like barista coffee machines and beers/soft drinks, but given the lack of cosiness, I think they are meant to be enjoyed at your desk…"

- Good company focus on diversity & inclusion","Customer Service department was very stagnant and really didn't fit in with the vibrancy and agile nature of the rest of the company. It felt like a CS department from a bygone era that has gone backwards rather than modernised; all other departments had amazing, modern offices with engaged, autonomous staff. You then visit the CS building which was an old, run down office in need of severe TLC. Alot of practices in the department were also being added in where most progressive & modern CX departments are making an effort to move away from. (Such a the removal of an independent QA team and many menial processes being placed into an ever-growing and stretched ""second level"" team rather than making an effort to reduce these menial processes or by empowering agents to handle these themselves for a better and efficient customer journey and experience)

Very archaic management practices within department; specifically the culture in the department seemed to be geared as such as that TLs (which there were far too many of, so much so that some didn't even have teams...) were just babysitting teams and any real people decisions were taken by CSMs (which there were far too few of for the number of agents in department and TLs) or by WFM. The large amount of TLs and the lack of upper structure lead to a large, unwieldy & disengaged junior leadership team. 

Incredibly poor stakeholder management skills in some support teams. It's very clear that some teams (such as WFM) have progressed from Agent roles and haven't received any coaching on how to work, communicate and collaborate effectively with agents and leadership.  Was very concerning to see an abundance of ""power trippy"" behaviours from members of these teams which was felt by all levels of the CS function. 

No real effort on efficiencies in the customer journey and delivering an amazing level of service for the customer, unfortunately.

It also felt very disheartening that CS was forgotten about by the bigger organisation. Lack of any C-level visibility in the building or even any sort of attention from them."

178,N26,"Great place to learn and grow, several things to be improved",2020-09-09,4.0,Anonymous Employee,"- strong focus on performance: from what I've seen, promotions were strongly related to performance within the respective job. Other factors (e.g. politics, business need, relationship to superior etc.) can't fully be excluded in promotion decisions but seem to be less relevant than in other companies I've worked for 
- lots of responsibility early on: since N26 is still a relatively ""small"" tech company (at least when compared to the big American tech firms) the contribution of individual employees weighs more and directly affect the success of the business. 
- steep learning curve: there are plenty of options to find a niche to specialize in. Due to the volatile environment and often changing priorities, I always feel challenged to adapt to the new ""normal"" and constantly need to acquaint myself with new topics.
- Employee stock option program: starting at a certain level, employees receive virtual options that will be cashed in when N26 goes public. This is particularly relevant to employees who believe in the future success of the company.
- great coworkers: Overall, I've met smart and very pleasant coworkers, the majority of whom are driven and deliver good work
- perks: the obvious fruit baskets, free drinks, candy, monthly meals, subsidies for sports and public transport, personal development budget (for job-related online classes, languages courses etc.) and more
- career boost: without doubt, N26 is a boost for the CV. Looking at the alumni list, it's impressive to see where employees move on to after a couple years at N26. Including several ex-N26er starting their own businesses.","- base salary/compensation: overall, acceptable (due to nice perks) but not above average. It is fine for the the Berlin market as cost of living is relatively low,. However, with increasing rent levels, adjusting salary might become necessary in the medium run. Bigger tech firms pay better but offer fewer growth opportunities/responsibility. N26 is not the best place to work for people who look to maximize short term financial gains.
- not fully established internal processes: following the hyper growth phase in 2019, there are several places with lacking structures internally, leading to unclear communication paths and responsibilities. Even though this seems to be getting better over time, there is still plenty of work to be done
- work-life balance: Many employees do not work typical 9-5 jobs and overtime is not being compensated financially. Even though it is rather typical for start ups/scale ups of this size in Berlin, this is not ideal. Remote options that were implemented recently due to Covid-19 helped in that regard"

aaand that's about it, the rest they have cut under the mantra of ""cost savings"", while we're still raising tons of investor money to pursue their DJ career.","The product org is the biggest joke I've seen in my entire career. Everything has OKRs and KPIs, none of them match the current company direction. If you don't hit these numbers, nothing will happen: no accountability whatsoever. Several initatives even go into the opposite direction of their KPIs, but if you think that stops anybody from continuing them - you're wrong, some people even get a promotion for that performance. As a result everybody just does the bare minimum of changing colors, merging buttons, adding icons or somehow changing layouts that a poor UX person can put it on their CV for their upwork profile. Nobody, starting from the CEO and the CPO has a clue what to do with the product. One day we want to do multi-banking and multi-accounting, the other day trading and savings, tomorrow crypto and insurances. In the end we just want to play catch-up with Revolut, which we are behind half a decade in feature development. We have the highest product to tech people ratio in the industry, yet nothing they can come up with is in the slightest sense innovative or ground breakingly unique as a differentiator. Even the app from Sparkasse has more features than N26 and delivers more per quarter. If you look at the background of our product people, several of them actually come from customer service from some kind of career progression path. Because chatting with people over a coffee is really all qualification you need for you to do product management here. The result is that they make the funniest and most ridiculous decisions - mostly driven by the product director bros that have not the slightest clue of what it takes to be a director but always give you a cool bro excuse on why the don't do the thing that makes the most sense. A common excuse PMs bring is that they are being micro managed by Valentin, especially here on glassdoor, but the reality is that they just really suck as product managers. Frequently you find PMs going to conferences to talk about the bleeding edge sh*t they don't do at work in order for them to secure their next gig at some other startup.

Compliance is a total joke department, the first thing they introduce is waterfall software development so some banking operation dude with no technical background (probably originating from customer service) can micro-manage every line of code that's being released to production. Apparently it reduces risk when you can't ship anything anymore. Instead of fixing real compliance issues, they focus on writing 40 page processes that nobody can ever adhere to, implement or inspect.

Security is a total cr*p show, the best security people they have are some kids with an AWS certification on how to define a VPC with security groups and due to that are super arrogant. Similar to Compliance they want to review code and ""security test"" every little piece of code MANUALLY before it goes into production (yes, you have to wait three weeks for them to look at it, plus another to test before you can release). The best they can find is that your JSON parser throws exceptions when it's getting malformed input - thanks for wasting everybodies time without any added security to the product.

AML (the department that should fight fraudsters and money laundering and such) is a lead by a recent grad that apparently wrote a couple of sentences in his master thesis about it. 

Feedback culture is, after the PM org, the second biggest joke here. Everybody needs to constantly gather feedback from random people to improve themselves or get a promotion. In reality, you obviously ask your best friends to give you good feedback and then half of the company spends at least six weeks in calibration sessions, reading out loud what your friend has given you for a feedback and how that compares to that other dude that got feedback from his friends. Then in some elusive round of important people, they decide based on your name and your friends feedback whether to give you nothing, a 0.5% raise or a promotion with no salary increase (""acting"" they call it). To top if off, there are constantly engagement surveys going around to make sure everybody is happy. If you wonder whether there is any change coming out of these surveys? Nope. They completely stopped after the last time, where they gave away free chocolate during Christmas to show that they care about you as an employee. Instead every team now has to come up with a set of actions on how to improve things. As you can imagine, the number one complaint is that our C level completely sucks - which obviously doesn't get fixed - as well as the other things you complain about. Feedback culture at N26 is completely broken and a waste of everybodies time.

If you read other reviews, maybe you have read about Kurzarbeit (furlough). Effectively it was a huge layoff program of several hundred people. Anyone sent off was already circulating in low performer lists for a couple of weeks before the decision was made official. The crisis was apparently the right time and trigger to scam the German social security fund for some social security money to send these people off for an infinite vacation. If you read it while you're on KA, you are definitely not coming back ever: find a new job ASAP. Fret not, all the money we're saving and raising due to that is spent every month in a six digit marketing budget, excluding the enormous salary that the new Marketing Director from Uber gets from doing nothing all day.

Since the crisis all hiring is frozen, yet people leave in masses. There is not a single week going by without a ""goodbye"" email. This happens in waves, so every year you can count on the full company to completely replace itself: you rarely find anyone working here for longer than a couple of months. The obvious result is that we have to promote inexperienced people into roles they are no fit for, again causing more people to leave. On top of the usual half-a-year re-org attempt to fix the broken matrix organization, we constantly have to merge teams to keep them somehow functional. Oh right, if you think that would cut the workload somehow, reprioritize initiatives or extend the timeline expectations? Not at all, Valentin will personally blame you and your team for not delivering. 

Due to that chaos, it's absolutely impossible to do changes that are bigger than changing the color of a button or a adding some logos. All big projects (which for granted have great project managers) fail or get cancelled half-way through because nobody is capable to deliver them. Everybody involved in the process feels entitled enough to say ""no"" to anything, starting from PMs that see their OKRs at risk, armchair architects whose sole education comes from Martin Fowler blogs (no wonder, half of the company is actually working at Thoughtworks or worked there in the past), low-light tech leads that don't want to do additional work and then the usual compliance and security people that want you to not change a single thing ever. The bias for inaction really sucks the lifeblood out of everybody and makes people refrain from doing anything that improves things.
 
Working from home is a constant topic that comes back up every week and in every Q&A session. Apparently everybody becomes more innovative when they sit together in meetings instead of using Hangouts, at least that's the latest narrative that Valentin and Max want you to believe. I'm always wondering how they have so much time to micromanage everybody back into the office when they could also tackle real problems of their company. Looking at the recent history before everybody had to work from home, I have a hard time to understand how anybody at this company is innovative in the slightest sense. In the past, this caused the whole building to be out of meeting rooms all the time.

To top if off, they were so concerned about the health and safety that they filed restraining orders against their own employees (!) to make sure they can't vote for an electoral board of a works council. The whole communication and reasoning around it is beyond doubt the most ridiculous narrative I've seen in my entire life. Thankfully the press covered it properly, so stay away from such a company and I can only hope that everybody working here is leaving as soon as possible."

Personal Development Budget - once you pass probation, you have access to 1,500e (at the time of writing) to spend on things like conferences, books, courses, coaching.

Benefits - Pre-Covid times there were OK benefits like subsidised train tickets, gym memberships, free lunch once a week. Those have now been cut or elinimated though.","Founders - they don't trust the people they have hired so they micromanage. They're not particularly inspiring. 

Lack of cross-functional teams - in Product & Tech there are a lot of teams but many are understaffed or incomplete. Don't expect truly cross-functional teams, or skills like Developers, Designers, Agile Coaches, Tech Leads, Engineering Managers to be available at the level necessary. That also results in many people playing multiple roles or being spread thin. Some roles are very demanding and there are high expectations but there's not much reward (benefits have been cut, salaries are not always in-band or to industry standard).

Office - there are a few offices in Berlin and they are quite different. If you're unfortunate enough to be in K72, forget about a comfortable work environment. In pre-COVID times there were not enough desks for new joiners and everyone is cramped on top of each other, there is not enough meeting rooms. No secure bike storage. R22 is just dull.

The atmosphere is bad and people are scared to speak up. No HR support or oversight at all, no flexibility for people. A lot of people do the same job but earn different.

N26 used to be a great place to work but that time is long gone."
202,N26,"Lies, incompetent managers, and a Compliance department sinking",2020-05-29,1.0,Compliance Analyst,- Free drinks & sparkling water,"- There are not many benefits anymore. They removed or reduced all of them: no more office dogs, Urban Sport Clubs and commute subscriptions became much more expensive, no more team offsites, no more pizza on Fridays. They say it’s due to the COVID-19, but I do not believe to see those benefits coming back, as they were looking to remove them for a long time.

- The company is still not profitable, and it shows: they are firing complete teams and are sending a huge amount of employees to Kurzarbeit. Most of the employees are not getting renewed during this time. It literally feels like the company is sinking! 

- The Compliance department, despite being one of the most underpaid departments within the company, has not been hiring for months. Their backlog is so huge that cases are pending for WEEKS. People are leaving like crazy due to a lack of proper management, process, and due to tools that are not adapted to their work. Their backlogs keep growing which makes this bank “The Bank Fraudsters Love To Use”. — “It’s in progress”, management says. But they do not have any plans. They seem to have forgotten their last BaFin order, which was asking them to urgently solve the backlog in IT monitoring. It is incredible they still have a banking licence. 

- I have seen every type of misbehavior working there: managers promoting each-others, harassing their team members, sexual misconducts, and violence. HR is much aware of those cases by having dozens of reports on their table, but no actions are being taken. It took them 5 weeks to offboard a violent manager, and that happened once people started to make noises about an eventual police and press complaint. 

- Employees have been requested to not publicly give bad comments which could connect to N26, as this would put the bank’s reputation at risk. Why don’t they try to fix what’s wrong instead of asking people to not communicate about it? The Engagement Surveys got so bad that they stopped presenting the results."

LACK OF DRIVE Change of focus and strategy every 2 months which results in misalignement between teams and frictions. Key to hierarchy recognition is yes-(wo)man attitude politics and slides, it’s easier with them. 
LACK OF TRANSPARENCY Engagement survey results are so bad the report is hidden (shared since, but only overall company). Explanation given is that we did not appreciate the measures taken. Those measures were not tangible or please share a list, appart from adding it as the last company OKR. 
LACK OF INNOVATION Product and tech hardly delivers relevant financial or even basic features when competitors have a solid roadmap. Instead we change the design of the feed or group 2 buttons in 1. 
LACK OF INTEGRITY Employees are not considered and treated like disposable. C-level put a part of the headcount on kurzarbeit 100%, mostly people of lowest levels, instead of spreading the effort across teams and levels. 
LACK OF CARE A big part of the headcount is the HR, absolutely not involved in employee journey. I have the feeling they rather send survey by email than speaking to employees and being involved in feedback cycles/performance reviews/promotion discussion or Culture Amp account manager is good. Inviting the whole company with public walk-in sessions to avoid 1-to-1 check in just sends the message your time is too precious to adapt to employees calendar. 

Bonus: after years of employees asking for an equity incentive, they offered to trade salary increase against virtual ESOPs when company valuation was at its highest. A very low proportion of eligible people took it."

We have ~50 people leaving each month!


- Dogs at the office. Sadly, they are being restricted and banned :(

- Of course, if you read these 1-line 5-star reviews that started to multiply lately, they all say “it’s the best company to work for”.... It must be because employees are sooo happy they have to shout it out to the world, and not, to take a ""completely fictional"" example, because N26 has internal campaigns begging employees to leave nice reviews on Glassdoor....","The COVID situation really made it clear that this company doesn’t care about people one bit:
- They fired or furloughed a lot of people, blaming everything on the virus. 2 days after all contracts were signed, they announced that they got another 100 million in funding, which they are gonna use for growth. How are you gonna grow when you got rid of a big chunk of your workforce?
And why did you have to put your employees through weeks of existential uncertainty and sleepless nights when you knew you’ve got money on the way?
- They didn’t tell employees about all confirmed COVID cases at the offices, and failed to inform people that they work in a potentially unsafe environment. Is trying to avoid “bad press” really worth putting people’s lives in danger? I guess the management of N26 gave a clear answer to that.

But even before the virus, N26 was a horrible place to work:


**Zero transparency or inclusion of employees**
- They keep all plans secret from the employees (we only heard about things like the UK exit or Kurzarbeit (furlough) from the news, they told reporters before they told us.
- Even when they have a Q&A session, they never give a straight answer to anything. If you ask them “how much is 2+2?”, They will just say “well, sometimes it’s more, sometimes it’s less, it’s complicated”... Or they simply ignore the questions that are too tough for them.
- When the employee engagement survey became really bad, they stopped talking about it. Next time, they simply cancelled the survey :D If you don’t talk about the problem, it doesn’t exist, right?


**Sales, PR and marketing is the only thing that matters, product, tech, security or regulations are the last in the line.**
- Basically, hardly anyone cares about banking regulations and data protection. I’m honestly surprised N26 hasn’t lost their banking license yet. Yes, there have been a couple of articles about it in the press, but that’s just the tip of the iceberg. 
- The product offering and the features haven’t changed significantly in the 2+ years I’ve been working there. But they changed the brand colors, and the number 2 in the logo looks slightly different - cause they think people care about the color of their card and nothing else.
- The Tech department is treated as just a nuisance, when in fact we are making the actual product you’re trying to sell! In 2019, we had 3 different CTOs within 8 months :D The current CTO is a college friend of the founders, and he really doesn’t know or care about anything that’s going on - as long as you don’t spend money on anything. So now there’s no money for much needed equipment and infrastructure upgrades, but of course, management offsites and “business” trips are still a priority.


**Evil and manipulative HR leadership, and they have too much power**
Not talking about the recruiters and generalists who do the actual work, but the HR management are all talk and no action. They put all their energy into lying to people rather than making actual change.
- Example: we’ll introduce salary bands to ensure everyone’s paid fairly and different people get the same salary for the same work. Yeah, great idea, it has been shown to reduce bias and increase fairness. N26 implementation: we’re not telling you what the salary bands are, just take our word for it that you’re paid fairly :D
- Another example: we’ll introduce a structured promotion process to make it transparent and fair to everyone. N26 implementation: process is introduced 1 month before deadline, no structure or clarity, employees and managers spend weeks putting together a promotion pack which nobody reads because only politics and servility matters for promotions :) Cherry on top: people who have been doing higher level work for a year or more find out at the all-company meeting that they didn’t get “promoted”.

**Main office unfit for work**
- In the middle of nowhere with very bad public transport
- The building is going to be demolished next year, so no repairs, no air conditioning (it was standarly 35 degrees inside during the summer), constant drilling and construction INSIDE the office even 8 months after we moved in.
- The cheapest, most uncomfortable furniture, so everyone has back and neck pain (my team is mostly very fit 25-30-year olds, but even so).
- They’re packing more and more people in the rooms, and don’t care about ergonomy or fire escape routes.
- When it rains, the roof leaks even on the ground floor (with 4 floors above), as in, there have to be buckets collecting rainwater inside the rooms!
- Almost anyone can just walk into the office, computers getting stolen from your desk all the time

**No home office and very little vacation** 
- N26 has 6 offices at the moment, so most meetings are remote anyway. They still didn’t allow home office because…. oh, that’s right, the bosses don’t have to have a reason.
- Even in the current COVID situation, they want people back at the office (60-80 people in one room) from the middle of May!


**Politics and yes-men above everything**
- Anyone who has an opinion or tries to reason with the C-leves gets bullied out or fired. Alternatively, they burn out and quit, even when they don’t have a job lined up.
- Anyone on a senior level or above is expected to lie, cheat, and bully people reporting to them, all in the name of falling in line with the management narratives. This means that competent leaders have been replaced with people whose only qualification is in lying and agreeing with the management. Oh, and explaining why it wasn’t their fault when they screwed up.
- Rich, white dudebros are the only ones with chances of success."

As the company pushed beyond being a small startup last year, some more experienced hires were made. Unfortunately most of these people are gone, as the business struggles to keep experienced hires.

- Still a great place to start your career if you are a graduate. Many interns and working students enjoy a fast-track to making an impact, and they are less likely to care about the terrible N26 pay.

- N26 still seems to be a reputable brand in Berlin from the outside.","- Oddly slow pace for a startup, there are new hires from stuffy traditional banks who are used to faster processes. Decisions aren't made and uncertainty engulfs the culture. Transparency is non-existent. 

- Incredibly high turnover, even for a startup/scale-up. How so many people can leave (even without a next job lined up) is alarming. Look beyond the company's chosen top 'featured' glass door reviews for a more accurate image!

- Questionable moral compass. Founders and leaders seem to care as little about their employees as the customers they're ripping off. No clear stance as a company or brand, no CSR play in sight. No creative campaigning or storytelling, just the same old cards as all the competitors, coupled with a sub-par app.

- Immense pressure trickles down from the top. The business is still reeling from two failed market launches outside of Europe, whilst the product itself has seen zero innovation in the last years. What was the cool new disruptor for Germany is actually not so disruptive anywhere else, and the panic to fix this is really felt.

- Delusional decision-making shows how out of touch the Founders really are. They seemed surprised when no one took advantage of their ESOP scheme, and thought senior hires would be ok with them placing a 26year-old friend of theirs as a new C Level direct report (or most likely, they just didn't care either way)."

Often, people are only hired because they come from ""big brand name companies"" and  the hiring team seem to think this means these people will automatically be some sort of asset to the company, but time and time again this has proven not to be the case.

*There's no clear business hierarchy between teams or managers and the result is that the majority can't agree with each other, and projects are often miscommunicated or delayed.

*ZERO chance of promotion of salary increase once you're inside the business (unless you're friends with the CEO or work in HR) so make sure you ask for a wage you'll be comfortable sitting on throughout the entire duration of your employment upfront. Don't let them tell you you can ""negotiate it later"", because believe me, that's not true.

*There's no one steering the ship at N26 so you can expect to feel undermined, frustrated and fed up very soon after starting here. It's a constant circus and very few senior team members seem to care.

*It's quite common to find yourself doing the work of  2 or 3 people, with no hope of renumeration or an evaluation afterwards. They lead you on with their so-called ""annual compensation scheme"" but it's an absolute mess with deliberately vague guidelines. Even if you do follow the scheme, the chances are your application for promotion will be denied without good reason. This is the point at which most sensible people leave the company for a better paid job.

*Don't expect to get recognition for your work. Your manager's probably too busy. 

*There's no official guidelines around working from home which basically means if you have a cool manager that doesn't care, you get it, and if you don't have a cool manager, you don't.

*One to one meetings and 6 month check-ins with your manager are rare. They just don't have time."

Management doesn't care about employee wellbeing.

Basic working conditions requirements such as ergonomic chairs that don't break your back, or having a few screen breaks to rest your eyes are not met.

Lots of responsibilities, big projects, dynamic
I've been at N26 for more than 2 years and have lived through it all. Really great to see N26's continuous improvements in benefits and perk offerings. As a parent, our best benefit is definitely NonaCare.  N26 offers parents access to Nona Care membership and provides 5 hours of childcare every month. The sitters have been great! What can be better to know that your company also care about you.","the current office is too far from my home

Being part of that journey, being able to contribute and seeing the impact I have is something that few other companies can offer.  A day at N26 can be a lot of things, but never dull or boring.  

You'll probably be challenged quite a bit at N26, but that's what make it such a special place. The pace at which you learn and grow as a professional is just unmatched. It's a real career accelerator. When I reflect on the past years, it's quite incredible to see what we have achieved.

Eventually, it's a company that genuinely cares about its employees. Compared to my previous employer, it's definitely day and night... There is also an acute understanding that what will make N26 successful in the end are the employees.","There is no real cons per se, but as I said in my pros it's probably not an environment for everyone neither... you need to be willing to be challenged, to learn and to grow... which means it won't be easy everyday.

There are many opportunities to learn and grow, and to work with a variety of people, one example is the 'Get Stuff Done Days' which allows you to work with different people, from different teams, on different ideas. There is also a lot of autonomy which encourages you to think creatively about your role and how you can impact in the company. In addition to this, the people here are great and I genuinely enjoy going to work everyday.","It's a fast growing company but it's still young, this means that some of our current structures can't fully support the demands of a larger company. This can be frustrating at times however this year we have the opportunity to strengthen our framework and improve our internal operations due to the focal point moving from being bigger to being better as a company."

We all know that last year was all about hyper growth and that made everyones role more difficult.  But changes to communication, how well the company is performing and the impact we are making is great.  December was a great month - we had better benefits introduced including 2 extra holiday days per year and an additional one for every year of service.  The balance between work and life is getting better too with more flexibility in working.  Things are definitely going in the right direction and I am really looking forward to 2020","Last year was a major challenge for many people and that caused a lot of uncertainty, long hours and lots of change."
253,N26,"Great place to learn, to grow and develop yourself",2020-01-03,5.0,Senior Recruiting Partner,"I really enjoy working for N26. N26 is the first company where I could really develop myself:
- flat hierarchies
- senior management which is very driven and passionate and you can learn from them
- great chance to implement new processes and improve the status-quo
- if you see a great opportunity, ask for it you and the probability to work on the project is very high
- getting pushed out of your comfort zone every single time
- good possibility to widen your network
- colleagues which developed to friends","I would not say kontras, rather question marks you should ask yourself, if N26 is the right company for you:
- the environment can be every demanding
- we are coming right from the hyper growths phase, there are things which are not in place yet and you have to figure it out on your own
- you have to be flexible and adapt very fast,  N26 still a young company ;)
- sometimes you have to do tasks, which were not discussed before hand
- f you are willing to work hard and smart, the development ways can be endless

254,N26,Disorganised and terrible management,2020-01-03,2.0,Customer Service Agent,"The company offers good pay in comparison to other positions in Berlin, however due to the awful environment the pay is not enough of a pro in the end.","I joined the company when it was still relatively small, during my time there the company grew exponentially and in my opinion they could not keep up with this growth.

Management was often disorganized and inexperienced, priority was given to people internally to be promoted (which in theory sounds great), until you realize that this means very inexperienced people were getting promotions, and often proper process was not followed.

For instance job offers were sent out by email internally, often requiring a written test, resume, and cover letter for you to be considered. You would then need the approval of your team leader before you would be considered for an interview. Not great if your team leader openly dislikes you (and most other females) for no apparent reason. If you do jump through all these hoops, and have your interview, you may then find out that they gave the promotion to someone else (and had been intending to all along), without this person even being interviewed.

This is just one of many things which created an unfair and downright depressing atmosphere at work. It is little wonder that most people felt overworked, under appreciated, and were often taking many sick days."

Smart people surrounding me.
The BBL and the snack and beverages we have at the office are very good.","Sometimes the leadership of the company seems very confuse to where to go and the next steps.
Fire-fighter mode during a very long time, these also leads to the management choosing to keep toxic people in the company, mostly because they deliver some result, but they also keep other away."
260,N26,Operations,2019-11-28,1.0,Operations,"I hope many people will understand this is an honest review and although some words might seem too harsh, each was written in good faith.

- Some colleagues can really keep your morale high. 
- You get free lunch every Wednesday. 
- Free snacks and soft drinks.
- You might be able to evolve a bit in the company. 
- They've just fired the incompetent COO, so they might actually be sentient.","You're expendable if you're in Customer Operations (customer service, banking operations, etc…). It's a segregated (us and them) situation. People on the outside despise you. There's nothing you can do against that. 

Every other department looks down on you because you're not part of the ""earning"" departments. You're the ""cost"". 
That's what corporate brainwashing does to you. 

You're on the receiving end of everything all the other departments have done wrong:

- The CEO made a poor decision, (he let a lot of fraudsters in. He wanted to launch in as many countries as he could without consolidating all the broken parts in the company and app before, etc…)
- Tech created a bad line of code somewhere, (happens all too often)
- Design created a poorly thought out design, (or plainly stole ideas from Bauhaus and Monzo or whatnot because that's what designers do)
- Product created a useless feature in the app, (nothing has evolved in my time, they're twiddling thumbs all day)
- Marketing sold a malfunctioning app via millions of € spent, (they're the greatest bunch of big-headed and lying bunch of people)

Yet, you're the paria, the Untouchable. 
There's true condescension and no actual bonding between departments. They've managed to fence everything. Product, Design and Tech are cherished.

For the rest:
- low salary,
- low to no recognition from your leaders,
- everything is still startuppy. Structure is none-existent. You wouldn't expect that from a bank.
- poor planning from A to Z. In terms of space (you'll be moving every two years at least), in terms of employee happiness, in terms of their beloved IPO (which they've always said they were against) but will surely arrive in three years tops.

About this last point: they're looking at ways of shaving off a bit of the payroll by enticing employees into an ESOP scheme. It's quite easy, you surrender 2-4 thousand bucks a year and get ""stock options"" which would basically quadruple in value. But nothing guarantees that your lost income will eventually be repaid by these stock options. 

They're just looking at ways of saving money people.

There's a good chance you'll end up an alcoholic, coke or X addict after a few months in the job because of the pressure you endure.

Chief Executive Officers (you get two for the price of two): One of them thinks he's a DJ and surfs on his rich person aura to pick up girlfriends.
The other wants to be the Austrian Steve Jobs and keeps micro-managing everything although he's barely liter-ate enough in German. They've surrounded themselves of yeasayers (people who say yes to everything you have to say). 
He's in a competition with this other person over at Revolut. It's like the Soviets did something bad to his Austrian ancestors in WWI or WWII and now he wants to exact revenge upon him in retaliation.
In this revenge act, he's opened the gates of identity verification to attract the greatest number of users. There's now a lot of cleaning up to do, and this fellow here is responsible for the mess. He's fired many people he deemed at the origin of the issue. He's the source of many of the company's troubles with regulators and employees. Not many people respect him in the company.

Chief Financial Officer (he's present or not, you can't really tell): The DJ I was telling you about in the previous paragraph. He's almost never there. Hasn't had a clear role in the running of the company. I think he brought in some initial capital and is a bro of pseudo-Steve Jobs. Enough to have three (not one, not two, but three!) positions in the company now. He's CEO, CFO and interim COO (read more about it below). 

Chief People Officer: She brought her protégés with her when Soundclound crashed. So that means she fired a lot of people over there and then recruited them here. She's like the CPO, she knows whatever the CEOs want and is always there to please them. 

Chief Operations Officer (or former because he was fired yesterday): Stood in shoes too big for him. Had no prior knowledge of Operations. He failed at all tasks assigned to him. He recruited people who went through consultancy companies and expect them to solve world hunger. They don't, it's as simple as that. 
This guy was craving to be accepted by the bosses, he was constantly pressing for ""happy customer journeys"", ie (he loves this ""ie"" expression by the way) people who had gone from a bad perception to a good perception of the company. He spent his final six months in the company brining these same stories up each time he was given the mic.

Chief Product Officer: She's a good talker. She knows how to take care of her employees and get them whatever they want. She's got no particular knowledge of what Product should be. She just says whatever the CEOs want to hear. 

Chief Growth Officer: Nothing to say about him really. He's just been promoted to lead this department, made up of Marketing (they fired the Chief Marketing Officer eight months after she began because they overspent for few results). He's young but not too overly confident, which is something you wouldn't expect when you first see him. 

Chief Technical Officer: He's pretty good at managing through hard times. Otherwise too concerned about other departments' work. Had to merge Data and Technical roles because the other two interim CTOs they had were of no use.

Chief Science Officer: This was the greatest joke of all. They recruited this guy as a CTO before realising he was too self-absorbed to actually do anything productive. So they created this fictional job, Chief Science Officer, which allowed him to be paid heaps while spending his time attending conferences where he would speak of himself and how great he thinks he is.

Chief Banking Officer: He's probably very good. Hasn't been there for too long, but he's taken over some of the most complex themes."

It is a toxic work environment, low salary, bad promotion cycle that ends up with people not getting paid or promoted when they are told they will be. Working overtime without payment is common and expected. Then hearing about how the department allocates money to people already in higher positions/ friends.

So much lack of communication and decision making with no basis, other than to appease higher ups and/or authorities, without considering effects on employees and customers.  Much talk of transparency and flat hierarchy, but management cannot be questioned and will bully or fire people who do not fall in line. People who have been in the company since the beginning and worked extremely hard have been fired for this reason. Employee morale is getting worse and worse.

Everything is  sacrificed for hyper growth and company obsession with expansion, without being internally ready for it. Internal processes and product are a mess after such a long time, with temporary solutions that do not solve the deeper problems at hand. This makes it difficult to imagine a future where things are better. Always a feeling a tension and stress due to constant crises from dealing with issues regarding this, that could have been solved by consulting the employees doing the hard work every day, expected to work overtime, without extra pay or appreciation. Employees doing jobs of management and higher ups, without anything in return.

Employees aren't heard or respected, to N26 we are all easily replaceable. When asked about salary ranges, which are tied to levels but not shared with anyone, the company response was essentially 'this is what you get, if you don't like it too bad'. Zero transparency - it's almost November and there are no plans in place, or at least no plans communicated, about next year.  All decisions are made top down and everyone is expected to just do as they're told. Plus all major decisions are made last minute, with entire teams and departments completely kept out of the loop. Everyone is constantly scrambling to keep up and fighting fires - it's a completely unsustainable way to keep working. Have you been working hard? Think you deserve a promotion? Too bad, your options are to jump through a thousand hoops or be friends with management (it also helps if you're male and Austrian). The promotion cycle is not at all equal across departments with some teams giving out promotions after 4 months and others denying everyone. We're trying to expand worldwide, but we can't even get our current product working properly for our core markets and competitors are very quickly surpassing us.

Understand corrupted processes, nepotism, strongly rooted unspoken hierarchy and political games. Career growth is for the ones who are friends with the ""good people"", rewards for performance and achievements are widely ignored, and so will you be if you dare reaching out to your manager when company-wide raise round time comes (in September). You'd get 10 appointments for your anmeldung before having a chance to talk about your performance with your manager, simply because processes are a facade to shut employees up when real things only happen behind the curtain.

Pace is way too fast and colleagues are exhausted, working way too hard because C-level expects us all to work 200% everyday. As the CEO puts it in a Q&A streamed throughout all offices ""it is not a company for lazy people, we [the two founders] work very hard every week to achieve our goals and we think everyone at N26 should work just as hard"", shameless when facing employees paid on average 30% below the market (30K for analysts, roughly 38K for some Team Lead positions).

Office dogs (hi Benno). Some really good people but this is getting rarer and rarer.","A lot of the problems at N26 are because of the incompetence of the C-level as leaders of a large organisation. Nepotism is rife, especially in the upper ranks — the most important factor in getting a position is not competence/experience — it's who you know. This is bad for the company — the best people, if they've not played the politics game, do not get to become the decision makers. Instead, the ranks are filled with yes-men (and women) who'll toe the line of senior management on all issues. As other reviews have mentioned, there have been several high-profile departures of the N26 veterans from both the product team and tech teams. When asked about this, the CPO said in an AMA (paraphrasing) ""They were not good enough for us"". These people, who were instrumental in taking the startup to where it is now, left in large part because they were unhappy with the direction the company is taking. This direction is basically: get VC money with promises of growth, launch an unfinished, unfocused, half-baked product in a new market, be surprised when it doesn't pan out, repeat ad infinitum. Prime example of this: 6 months ago, all the hype was about the UK launch. Now, UK customer numbers/metrics are so far behind the initial projections that now, there is absolutely no mention of the UK market by the C-level.  The reason for this: Monzo is so good because of their laser-sharp focus on the UK market. Now the big thing is the US launch. There has been plenty of effort to drum up fake excitement in the ranks about launching a sub-par product in the US. This is bound to be a failure: The competitors have a much more focused, more feature packed products whereas we will soon move on to preparing for launching in Brazil (where Nu bank is dominant already with a great product). When asked about this growth over product mindset, the CPO's response was basically ""You're wrong"" (she actually said this but just with in more words ""I'll challenge your belief that we're neglecting existing markets""). This mindset of ignoring problems is actually a lot broader and there are several other structural issues which stem from this that I'm not covering here. An example: Our internal employee survey has been tanking for a few quarters and there has been no concrete response from the management (other than a lavish offsite for upper management). When you ask questions in AMAs with C-levels, the response is very much like a politician being confronted with a policy failure: They deny that there was a failure, and if there was, it's due to external factors. Mostly though, they claim that everything is rosy and if you think it isn't, then the problem is with you and not the company. Concrete numbers on this: When asked ""How likely do you think that this internal company survey will lead to actual change"", some teams had an ""agree"" score of less than 20%. Oh well. There are other problems as well: The hierarchy is rigid with several levels of management, one above the other. While being a tech company, the people in the broader tech organisation have basically no say in the direction of the company and are generally looked upon as second class citizens. This shows: our deployment pipeline breaks often and outages in live, customer facing services are frequent. A lot of developer time is wasted trying to fight the deployment process. Our tech onboarding process is a joke. The CEO still interferes directly with Product teams, not trusting them and not working based off of user-research data. The cofounder keeps chanting the mantra that we need to recruit and retain the best people, but they're paying really poor salaries, especially in tech (some of my colleagues have left the company and ended up with 25% raise). They've only introduced ESOPs now and with really archaic vesting conditions (what about people who've been here for two years already? They've lost out on the highest growth phase). The office is poorly connected and the move was planned so badly that less than a year after moving, there's no space left. Meeting rooms are perennially booked so people end up having meetings in the kitchen, terrace etc. The promotion cycle is rigid and requires two weeks worth of work to produce the 'promotion-packet'. And on and on and on. The laundry list of problems is huge but the bigger problem is that management is unwilling to tackle these problems."

The office in Barcelona is brand new, very nice, and in a lovely area (Poblenou).","Successfully shifting from a small start-up build by passionate interns under the guidance of two founders to operating as a global-scale, innovative bank is the single biggest challenge that N26 is facing now:
- The company has grown so fast that the processes have not kept up (or in some cases they don't exist yet). This is frustrating. Some information only exist in the brains of long-serving people, for instance.
- Some functions are still only in Berlin, and distance makes collaboration harder (thinking of critical ones like the regulated bank, legal, operations, etc. which are crucial for product management). Although it is easy to convince people to come to visit Barcelona for a few days, and some of these functions start to be hired locally as well.
- Parts of the company culture are questionable and show that the top management still has trust issues (i.e., they need to learn to let go, N26 is not staffed with interns any more):
           - working from home is not really allowed (although in Barcelona we are more flexible and do it anyway, but it's not structured)
           - perks are below-par compared to other start-ups/tech companies in Barcelona (free lunch on Wednesdays only, no restaurant tickets - every perk there is is also offered by the other shiny start-ups in Barcelona, and then some)
           - the company all-hands is on Fridays at 6pm until 7pm with free pizza, feels like a mechanism to lure people to not leave early for the weekend (this does not prevent people to leave before in Barcelona)"

317,N26,A really enjoyable company to work for,2019-07-23,5.0,Manager,"I have been working at N26 full-time for more than a year

Pros

As we see the team growing, I feel it is important to provide critical feedback on the company. Many other reviews I see here are just bashful; you have to think how mature are these 'somewhat experienced' people if they're taking time out of their days to bash a company online. We are growing very successfully but at pace, we can’t be the small start up forever and that does not always sit well with some.  

Less Hierarchical, for people wanting to avoid politics and having worked at larger corporates in the past, I can confidently say there is much less of this at N26. It is often the case that you will debate against seniority (e.g the 'experienced' people) - this is the key to success. Seniority often leads to complacency and misplaced ego, you must be willing to question your own assumptions and take criticism from others - how else can you grow? 

Self Learning at N26 enables us to tackle problems that are entirely unique and consecutively encourages us to seek unique solutions. We spend a lot of time diving into the data and business with no initial directive apart from improving our product and the way we do things. For the thinkers out there, this is ideal. 

Data & Logic First - No decisions are made with a ""because-I-said-so"" attitude. Due to the speed of growth and collective ambition of employees, there is no room for assumptions. N26 bases all decisions on data where it is available. Some 'experienced' hires sometimes need to get used to this since they're accustomed to common practices. If the vision is to create something new for the world, how could we possibly do this by following in the footsteps of those we're trying to replace? 

Growth at N26 -  It is quite obvious that several of the brightest people at N26 will be future founders. There are many ambitious employees who yearn to make an impact and change things. They work a lot out of a sincere addiction to what they do and subsequently they get rewarded. 

Culture - At N26 we have a truly diverse workforce with 70+ different nationalities just working from our Berlin office. We are continually opening up new offices abroad and we get given the opportunity to work in some fantastic locations.  We can bring our dogs to work, have free snacks including healthy fruit, veg, nuts and dried fruit and not to healthy chocolate’s biscuits and sweets. We get free lunch on Wednesday’s (with vegan, vegetarian and fish and meat options), drinks on tap (hot, cold, soft and alcohol) - Pizza Friday’s and then, let’s not forget we have some truly iconic parties.  However to be successful at N26, vision should be embedded in your culture. A vision for your team, a vision for the product and a vision for the company and I love how we do that here. It comes with its sacrifices - but what doesn't? Moreover people at N26 seem exceptionally collaborative and friendly with one another. We arrange many of our own monthly social activities, share learning resources and constantly discuss new projects we can tackle to improve the product. We also get 1,500 to spend on personal development of our choice. 

Office Hours - I have read some reviews on people working long hours, but I personally don’t see many in the office past 6.30pm. Given we have the flexibility to come in early or late (it’s very adult here). People may choose to work longer hours but it’s rare. I tend to be one of those that comes in later around 10am and leaves later and I'm normally the one switching off the lights at 7pm so I can only speak for myself. I guess there is an exception to the rule and this is customer services, they do work shift time and ergo may work later hours (but they are not in my building). I get to meet them at our regular parties though.","Office in Berlin - Our other locations have some very flashy offices, but the Berlin office renovations seem to be dragging on for a long time. It’s also rather an old building we have moved into. I know this is just a temporary blip but we also have very hot summers in Berlin, 30-38 degrees at times and it would be nice to have air conditioning (and not just fans). That said, we seem to get a lot of treats during hot spells including vegan ice cream cookies, amazing artisan flavored teas, cute hand held fans and ice cream tubs (there is always a vegan option). You get the feeling everyone is trying their best to make it as pleasant as possible and we know improvements are coming. 

Growing Pains - We have added over 1000 staff in the past year and we don’t look to be stopping. I think to be successful here you have to be comfortable with ambiguous environments and comfortable with change. Experiment and measure is at the core of what we do. This environment is really empowering for me but it’s not for everyone. We don’t have everything together yet in terms of process and procedure but I don’t even think we want to be that type of company either.   LEADERSHIP and OWNERSHIP is what will drive culture and productivity forward - nobody should be telling you to take on these qualities, it is something you should do own your own."

Corporate rules for their advantage like promotions every year (0 hypergrowth), and startup benefits (poor salary, 0 bonus, 0 equity)

Interesting challenges, if you're given the time and space to focus on them.

Dog friendly, with lots of furry friends around for cuddles.","N26 is now a shadow of its former self. It's culture, which used to be one of its strengths, has become completely toxic. Employee morale is at an all-time low. The ramshackle ""headquarters"" in Berlin is certainly not the premises that you would expect one of the most valuable fintechs in the world to be situated in. It's difficult to get to by public transport and you'd be lucky to find a working coffee machine on one of the floors. 

Senior employees are leaving by the droves and there seems to be a resignation announcement/farewell party every other week. However somehow management seems to be turning a blind eye and continuing to proceed as if nothing needs to be addressed. 

Employees are not fairly compensated (although some departments more so than others) because N26 believes its ""brand"" on your resume is worth more than fair market pay.

And finally, leads seem to be running around like headless chickens from one crisis to another. This results in unclear priorities and very little work getting done. 

I am not sure why N26 is valued so highly - the investors haven't seemed to have looked under the hood. They would have been frightened if they had."

Growing pains became a growing nightmare. Month after month moral is dropping, good people are leaving and the overall atmosphere becomes more and more unbearable.

- Management completely detached from what is actually going on
- every decision is based on 'does it make us grow' and not 'will it work?'
- co-workers resigning and farewell parties are  part of your weekly routine
- strained, overworked leads
- constantly growing pressure
- constant fire-fighting yet pushing and pushing on more markets, more products, more things that won't work, go up in flames and need to be fought again
- more overtime than one could ever take off later on
- understaffing in many teams and departments ends in hiring of people with no relevant skillset (""everyone who shows up is being hired"")

The company provides the usual perks found in other ""startup"" companies: beverages, food, discounts at gyms and some stores, professional development budget, etc. You can choose your equipment, SO, accessories.","Management and leadership are the worst aspects of the company.

Team leadership is usually bad, having people without the skills to manage people, conflict, differences in opinions, perspectives, and backgrounds. Communication and understanding suffer on all levels. It is easy to find people who were promoted because no one else was available.

Management creates a fantasy world where they say that open communication and feedback are welcome but the reality is the opposite, questions are regarded as criticism and lack of professionalism.

Job descriptions frequently don't match reality. The evaluation and selection process for candidates is awkward, unstructured, and highly influenced by the evaluator personal preferences and mood.

From a technical perspective, the company creates nothing, it is more than happy to follow tendencies such as adopting Kotlin as the main programming language because it is a ""better Java"". Services infrastructure is a weakness and frequently a bottleneck, despite the efforts of very capable engineers that have to deal with difficult leaders and managers. Technical discussions with tech leads are usually very shallow and, again, decisions are usually based on one's preferences instead of adequacy.

Remote working is treated as an exception by management.

Contributors are now rewarded based on connections and fake feedbacks in a truly political game because most of the managers are either busy with meetings all day long or they are clueless about what is like to be a software engineer since they never used this hat. 

Lowered hiring bar

In order to throughput more engineers to even out the metrics for the constant outflow of good engineers the hiring bar decreased considerably. N26 is a hiring factory rather than a software factory and of course, quality is sacrificed for the sake of quantities. Worry not, at the end of the day you are just another number in a spreadsheet. 

Non-competent people in key positions

N26 developed a keen eye for putting the wrong people in key positions. This applies to all levels of the internal food chain (Tech Leads that have zero soft skills or don't know how to communicate with humans, Managers that just deliver Google Slides and book meetings, as well as engineers in principal positions that just use their title or former companies experiences to harass others that challenge their ideas and if one wants to bring value).

If you like a political game and your surname are either Targaryen, Lannister or Stark, N26 is the place for you.

Office Management

Workspace is a joke. 

You see shiny pictures of fancy meeting rooms and dogs all over the place on the web. Dog-friendliness is accepted with rules. Fancy meetings rooms no longer exist and most of the people depicted in the photos are mostly former employees. 

In summer months, don't expect any Air Conditioning to bring the workplace to an acceptable temperature, but you can get a hand fan if you are lucky enough. (I said a hand fan, not a USB one). 

Side note: The Founders' rooms have individual AC units blowing up the hot air away into the engineers working area.

Forget everything you know about ergonomics and posture since you are bound to sit in desk set in the common-agreed height as for your 2m or 1.60m tall colleague. Good luck with that. But I think now that correlates with the number of people asking for painkillers in the chat conversations.

Pile of Tech Debt / Low Throughput

Putting new software in Production is extremely slow. Obtaining the Pendulum of Doom in WoW a 10x faster/easier. That is due to environment instabilities that occur on a daily basis as well the cumbersome amount of paperwork and approvals required to do so. For a company that claims to be agile, that is unacceptable. 

Lower environments are playgrounds for engineers working in the platform. That translates into instabilities that impact every single team in the company every single day. Developer productivity is overall low, given the headcount."
333,N26,The Cons of Both a Start-up and a Bureaucracy with None of the Benefits,2019-06-27,1.0,Tech Lead,"* Free refrigerated drinks.

* Free lunch on Wednesdays.

* Dogs are allowed in the office (hi Benno).","* Low pay which is not related to either experience or performance.

* Engineering managers who don't even know how to read the code of those they evaluate.

* Performance evaluations driven by political connections while ignoring contributions, there is literally no place to list contributions.

* People get entirely skipped in performance evaluations with no explanation.

* Product Managers who have never written requirements.

* Principal Engineers with less experience than junior engineers.

* Out-dated technical stack that doesn't perform, doesn't scale, and has frequent outages.

* Rigid, authoritarian, control that retaliates against people who actually solve real problems.  If a solution was not dictated by your unqualified manager, you will face retaliation even after you fix problems and make improvements.

* Decision making in off-site ""inception meetings"" that leave engineering out of the process and whose members are hand-picked from the most politically connected.

* Extremely top-heavy organization.  ""Target Operating Model"" introduces several layers of managers with poorly defined responsibilities filled by unqualified, but politically loyal, people.  It is not uncommon for work that takes an hour to be frozen and blocked for a month while the managers above hold endless meetings about topics they know nothing about.  You will not be invited to these discussions about your work.

* Despite the massive headcount, most have no idea what to work on, and those who do the actual work that keeps the business alive are badly understaffed."

- Some startup perks, free snacks ,fruit, drinks
- Not much pressure to deliver things, so work life balance is good","- Your compensation, title, and performance review are based on everything BUT your performance. You need to demonstrate loyalty to the toxic management team in order to get recognition in this company. The best indicator of whether you're fit for a promotion is if you've worked with C-level at previous companies.
- Management makes decisions based on gut feeling, confirmation bias, and totally skewed perceptions of reality. They ignore hard data and facts, and will actually punish you for bringing them forward. Because if you make decisions based on data, then you're obviously not loyal to them.
- No real technical leadership. The best engineers problem solve based on analysis, and they have all been either pushed out or have quit because they have no way of making a real impact. The company is left with either people who will listen to anyone, or political players who just try to accumulate more power.
- ""Hypergrowth"" killed the culture and productivity of the company (really, it's hard to find a team that has produced real value in the past year), but saved management. They replaced all the quality employees with brand new sheep whose roles are completely undefined and who will listen to anything they say."

Compared to the Start Up scene in Berlin, N26 presents way better salaries and perks. But that is: it. 

Management (C-level but more especially leads!) have no idea what they’re doing, but they deny anything that could prove them wrong. They are not here to help you grow or to encourage you in projects because: they don’t know what your job is, they don’t know your KPIs or OKRs, so they get afraid and will just say “no”. They don’t look for excuses, they just say no.

Then, they victimise themselves. It’s not their fault if this or that happened. Because they’re leads and managers only in case of success. If you failed, it’s 150% your fault and they will deny any action they may have had.

N26 is a bro company like we love them in Berlin. 25 years-old guys are Directors because they helped the company 3 years ago. (Guys, yes, it’s almost of course only males) they just come here after failing in a Rocket Internet company with the worse Management skills and come here to try out terror management for a very very high salary and very very low abilities. They’re just here for the fame because N26 is the new trend and while you’re doing your maximum to make the company successful, they are just here to take credit for you actions and make sure you will stay at the lowest level while they make their promote their friends to jobs they have no abilities for.

338,N26,N is for Nepotism,2019-06-14,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"Some free food, free drinks, etc.","Founders surrounded by yes men (and women). This makes them completely disconnected from reality. According to them and the people surrounding them everything is always amazing and only getting better. However ‘on the ground’, senior people are leaving in droves (some of them even without having found a new job just because they’re so fed up), being replaced with successively more junior people.

If you can tell the founders a nice story and you are able to befriend them, you will get promoted to smithereens. The sky is the limit. Doesn’t matter if 75% of your team has just resigned, you are still eligible for a huge promotion.

Hypergrowth is the excuse for everything. Especially for introducing increasingly vague roles. Coordinators need coordinators that need coordinating. Through all these levels, the vision and priorities of the company get completely lost. This results in every new hire being more disconnected with the company and the product as the one before them.

And even after hiring all these people, no one seems to be able to actually deliver features (really, the app has been basically identical to one year ago). A bunch of things are even being outsourced to a consulting company. 

Speaking of vision. Somehow everyone that’s in charge of building the vision of the product is completely out of touch with our competitors. Where a couple of years ago we might’ve been market leader in a lot of things, now there are a bunch of competitors in Europe that have a feature set that make N26 look like the old banks we are trying to replace.

The architecture is riddled with ticking time bombs (some of them with easy fixes) that the technical leadership has no clue how to fix (if they even acknowledge they exist). Instead they rather rewrite code that was recently rewritten because... I have no idea.

There is people in management  you have no idea what they are doing all day  and they poorly hide the fact that they are paid to do nothing all day.
The way they manage shift is riduculous you really feel like you work in a sweat-shop there and they advertise about their work/life balance when you going to finish some weeks work at midnight..
They open call center in  even cheaper place than Berlin while firing people who been in the company for a certain period of time and know what they are doing.
People get promoted only because they are friends with the right person.
They  just hire expat for 6 months and then fire them  within the probation period and they fire employee in 20 min, the way they treat people is inhumane.

Simplicity, Integrity, Drive and Excellence — it doesn’t matter if these are the values of a bank or a parking meter, they are meaningless. A fundamental understanding and appreciation of work values does not exist hence it is not promoted. The apathetic leads and managers have absolutely no idea what they are doing. In this company nobody really cares about empowering others to achieve great results, let alone working together for a shared purpose.

- Politics over performance

Politics are used to assess behaviour, while feedback is weighted based on who says it. Those witch hunts go very far behind the scenes: People secretly take pictures with their private mobile phones of employees at the desk and then talk them down in emails behind their back. The employees are then singled out and getting fired.

- No alignment, not in control and not able to ride on the hypergrowth wave

The absence of a level of structure, guidance and clear communication of roles and what is expected, leaves employees unaligned and departments off sync. Overchallenged HR, mixed up contracts, delayed salaries, last minute arrangements. The lack of commitment paired with the inability to drive collaboration can be seen in form of a permanent high backlog of months old customer inquiries. The cases are passed along from person to person for weeks without a single attempt to solve the problem.

- Security issues

1.1 There is ""high school"" group of hysterical and non experienced employees that tries to control the game in hidden way.
Everybody should say how much they like stupid ideas this group generates, otherwise they may find that the person understands people from this group are not experienced at all. When they find that they will start the process of hunting this person so that others will afraid to say a word.

Some examples:
- Infrastructure is broken almost everyday in a hidden way (you will find it only after seeing your product being down). Concrete examples of this are ignored. Discussion of improvement is banned formally - it leads to hunting.
- Lack of controlling the quality of solutions delivered (teams are free to skip QA checks if they personally don't want it). The result is regressions introduced everyday. Everybody thinks this is normal behaviour. Discussion of any improvement leads to hunting.
- Nobody controls the scope of releases. You increase the scope in any moment just because you like it. You can move tasks between releases just because you like it, no considering of clients need or at least consultancy with product owner.
- No commitment to releases. The only thing you need to care is making ""high school"" group happy, delivering business value is not important.
- Resume Driven Development is everywhere. Clients needs are not considered, what developer likes is priority #1.
2. ""Culture of feedback"".
Company advertise its ""culture of feedback"" but in fact it's the tool of hunting those who made ""high school"" group unhappy.
Feedback culture assumes safety of both sides who share feedback and a possibility of being listened. In reality you have to listen to untruth and your words mean nothing. No facts are provided as a proof of that untruth, and your facts that proof your position are ignored.
3. Politics is priority #1. Delivering business value is priority #100.
4. Responsibilities of people are changed in random way very often.
You can be hired for one set of responsibilities. But after you started working you're said there are no responsibilities at all - try to find your place under the sun.

Consequences of all these points are that experienced people leaving the company at high speed. They are replaced with lots of students/interns.
Hard to find any team working with the same number of people for several months - people are leaving constantly.

This is very unique company. I've never seen anything close to this and I've seen lots of companies."
369,N26,Fast-paced startup with significant opportunities for career growth,2018-05-21,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Small team in NYC working on bringing N26 to the US. Flat team structure (no bureaucracy or painful hierarchies). Open lines of communication and instant feedback loops. Everyone is extremely smart and driven towards a common goal, and we also enjoy each other's company both in and out of the office. There's also respect for having a life outside of work and a good sense of balance. 

Huge opportunity to take on as much work as you can handle and drive your own workstreams and outputs. I've found that my scope of responsibilities is quite large, and since joining, I've broadened my skill-set significantly in areas I wanted to expand upon.","Coordination with Berlin can be difficult at times given time zones and hypergrowth there. Nonetheless, people always are willing to help out and make themselves available when needed. 

Small team size as of now means fewer hands to help with all that needs to get done. That said - plenty of opportunity for new joiners to take on key tasks and responsibilities as we continue to grow the team"

While this has since improved greatly with some more process and time taken to scope projects, the company is at times still prone to this."

We all have different professional and educational backgrounds, not just business or banking. So don't be intimidated, there is a place here for you. The interview process is super thorough, several rounds with a take home case.

Everyone here is very intelligent. From intern to C-level, man or woman, people are equally respected. Within my first week I was given projects to lead.  People often get promoted so there is opportunity for growth. All of the C-Suite is super approachable and take your feedback into consideration. 

We get free lunch once a week. Free breakfast and unlimited drinks in a super cool office.  You get a brand new Macbook (or Windows)! 

N26 is definitely one of the best startups in Berlin, if not the world.",Sometimes there are unnecessary deadlines.  There could be more lead time in certain cases.  People are very opinionated and often offer unsolicited advice in areas where they have little knowledge.

383,N26,More apparent than real . . .,2017-06-27,1.0,,Nice team and a lot of people with different backgrounds ! Great flor for growing good and creative ideas with a nice spirit.,"It's not about the development of the employees, but the development of the company. Employees are poorly paid. It is expected that it is all for the idea. 60 hours per week are no exception but the rule. Involved in the success ? ...  not really. There are no special services next to the salary. If someone isn't working as expected or open his mind saying his opinion (which is agains the mainstream )  his time has expired. This is probably mostly to some executives, lacking in empathy and humanity. Leadership is clearly preferred by fear and domination. The result is a one-sided dependence, without that you notice it. Problems are sometimes not openly communicated - which cause to misunderstandings between all parties."

How the teams are working together is unique and I am convinced I won´t find it anywhere again. 
Despite the fast growth in terms of the team size it is an amazing team and not distracted at all. HR/ recruitment is doing a fantastic job (not only in terms of recruitment) as everybody who is joining has the right professional skills and attitude and personality, which is for me most important beside the tasks and projects.","Sure, there are still processes which need to be placed and executed. On the other hand it wouldn´t be a real startup if that wouldn´t be the case. There is always room for improvement, but I can see the effort also the management team is doing."
