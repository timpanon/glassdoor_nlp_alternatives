- They introduced the appalling policy of hiring based on racial preferences rather than competence, complete with panels of people chosen by the colour of their skin to have a final input around the suitability of candidates for the position they were applying for.
- Honesty, if in any way critical of left-wing ideas, is utterly unwelcome - e.g., voicing that the above policy to hire based on race is terrible, was a sufficient crime to swiftly land me in an HR review (which was ultimately dismissed, as I didn't actually do anything except think for myself and try to act with integrity)."

The couple of branch visits a year the MRD is usually late so misses the morning meeting and leaves early!!  Majority of the time not even “hello or “goodbye “ I had an MR who’s been with Nationwide one year ask me who she was!!  Its outrageous and I really hope the new CEO looks at the structure and pay.

50,Nationwide Building Society,Very Comfortable,2022-02-22,4.0,Technical Product Owner,"The business is a Mutuality - which means the whole mentality around operating is focused on the members, including the employees. 

The is the exact antithesis of most corporations with a purer capitalist mentality. The base salaries are market rate for non-technical roles, nothing to get overly excited about but not bad, but other benefits such as 30 days holiday, 8x life assurance as standard and 16% employer pension contribution when you put in 7% makes for a very comfortable employment. 

The profit sharing process is unlike anything I have experienced before where everyone either gets ""the bonus"" of everyone doesn't. It is in no way linked to individual performance, but there is also no incentive to perform better to increase said bonus.

Nationwide also have a work from anywhere policy, so no pressure to commute to an office if you don't want to.

I'm sure everyone in permanent roles feels incredibly secure as no one ever seems to get made redundant, maybe even when they really should be... 

It would be incredibly comfy to just sit in this role until 60 then retire on the phat pension.

Complete flexibility and no micromanagement over stepping out, hours worked etc. Completely operating on trust (based on your line manager I suppose).","The organisation is very slow, old fashioned, lacks agility, a lot of ""dinosaurs"" in the decision making roles and it's very hard for younger innovators to get up into those roles. Sadly it seems we will have to wait for retirements to arrive... Lots of bureaucratic hoops to jump through and unnecessary approvals that other FS companies did away with years ago. A lot of focus on ""delivery"" and projects which inhibits organisational transformation - no one who is empowered to do so, seems keen to make the tough calls on opimtising the organisation and how it operates."

124,Nationwide Building Society,Great company to start at.,2021-12-03,5.0,Customer Service Consultant,The salary of nationwide when you first begin is very reasonable. Especially if you are leaving college and joining at the age of 18. It enables you to purchase a car and pay a variety of bills as well as enjoy your teenage years like you should.,The salary climbs gradually and even when you are up skilled or join another department in customer service the wage rarely jumps up more than £400 in one go. This makes it a great company to start at but you will want to either completely switch departments or find employment else where after a few years.

there is way too much observation/ assessments/ reviews, everything is so regulated and strict and the job can feel suffocating as there is so much to do as a cashier
the pay is shockingly low for what we are expected to do and the stress we take on 
there is way too much micromanagement, silly initiatives and time wasting activities like mission promises, goal setting, diversity promises... our job is to serve the members who need us, and these other tasks just get in the way (we are also expected to do this while the branch is open, serving people and needing to do our own balancing etc)
they will tell you that they focus on career development but more often than not you are denied internal roles and your manager will struggle to replace you, therefore creating a tension when you are trying to advance your career

181,Nationwide Building Society,read before you join,2021-09-08,1.0,Senior Technical Specialist,"based on my biased experience, none except that if you work in the Engineering center of excellence (IT) you will get plenty of rest and you can be as 
inefficient as you want without consequences. Basically hop on the gravy train and wait for retirement.","so i am not going to generalize, my comments are purely based on the experience I had as an individual working in the Engineering center of excellence. So when I mention ""company"" i mean the engineering department. This is a summarisation of the conclusions i made working within almost 6 year time span.

this is a highly hierarchical company, which means that the lower you are in the hierarchy, the least you are going to be heard and able to drive any change. In fact if you try to improve you will be seen as a show off and will put back back into place very quickly.

you will be (and I emphasise the verb WILL) discriminated against if you are not British regardless of your capabilities, the exception being when you rub the right shoulders and exhibit a highly extrovert personality this especially relevant if you question decisions or behaviors from someone higher in the chain

Incompetence is a big problem especially within the top management layer. Decisions are taken without evaluating alternatives or consequences. You could be asked to work on a project without having any infrastructure to work against because no one has thought about it before. I know this is over simplifying but it is a basic example of how narrow minded and incompetent the so called decision makers are.

Career prospects are limited to the chosen ones, ie the ones who mingle with the right people. I have never seen anyone who keep their head down, excel at what they do and behave with integrity and work hard and consequently are promoted or given opportunities. In fact when the topic of segregation and inequality was raised amongst ethnic minorities, the company launched an inclusion program to try to water down the issue. In the end it was clear it was just window painting. If i can summarise the engineering department i would say it is corrupt and toxic."

Moving towards a more devops focused culture.
Line management is kept separate from task management so your line manager can care about your well being without having to be a slave driver at the same time.","Doesn't seem to be anything in place to promote staff. People just have to apply to other internal jobs of a more senior grade, so their project loses their experience just because they don't know how to promote people.
Leadership do sometimes interfer with projects in ways that go against the advice of all engineers working on that project.
Seems like the higher grades of Engineers don't get the time to actually do much engineering and spend their time in meetings trying to keep the project on track. This probably isn't what most people want to aspire to. Seems like anything above E3 is often (but not exclusively) just a meeting goer.
While there are some great projects to work on, there are also quite a lot of legacy systems still hanging around that you might have to work on, depending on your team."

The packages are reasonable - pension is amazing if that's important to you.","The culture is a disaster - there is a severe lack of honest and integral leadership with a princple of Accountable Freedom that people take to mean they can dismiss any decision they don't like. 
Decision-making is abstract at best, ineffectual or non-existant at worse. Decisions are changed willy-nilly and hardly ever align to strategy 
The leadership are aware of the challenges but none of them seem to think it's their job to affect change. 
When things get tough they change the Op Model to avoid having to do the hard cultural work.
The communication has been massively impacted by the lockdown - the relied far too much on corridor conversations - now the society is more siloed than ever."

263,Nationwide Building Society,The Modern Workhouse,2021-05-24,1.0,Customer Care Advisor,You are never alone in the way you feel about the office,"The office is terrible. If you want to feel like your back at high school where everyone has their own 'clic' then go for it.

You are also undertrained, overworked, underpaid and expected to take everything that the customers throw at you. You are told you can hang up if you are abused but reprimanded when you do so even if the customer is just straight out using the call to insult you.

But don't worry. Provided you have 100% compliance at all times you will be fine. Right up until the point you dip to 99% for the first time in years at which point you will be given an official warning.

Also, do you have a life outside of work? not anymore. Your partner could literally be dying and you would still be expected to follow all protocols about booking holidays off to make sure she doesn't die alone.
 
Step1: Book a Holiday. 
Step2: Have it refused for no reason. 
Step 3: Repeat steps 2 and 3 for what seems like an eternity only to be reprimanded for submitting too many holiday requests.

(Just to clarify my holidays were available to use. They just didn't like that I was requesting them)

In short. Just don't. If you value your mental health, sanity and life in general then this is not the place for you. McDonald's pays better and you are treated like an actual human."

I always asked for development but was passed up time and again, mainly I believe due to not being great at their interview style.

- Head office is quite modern although this depends on what community you're in. 
- Plenty of professional and friendly stakeholders who genuinely care about nationwide and its members. 
- Good laptops and upto date software packages 
- fairly flexible although this is largely down to your team's culture. 
- Very good nationally recognised brand
- Some inspirational leadership; however, there are still plenty of old timers scared of change. 
- Good levels of collaboration and not overly task focused; definitely has a more human element then some commercial banks I've worked for. 
- relaxed dress code has made the organisation feel a lot less corporate. 
- slowler pace then working in a city centre environment; definitely a good work/life balance.","- Truly woeful location for a head office
- Salaries very good for the local area but lower then competitors based in Bristol/London 
- Extremely limited connections to and from Swindon rail station
- Limited on site parking after 8am (you can literally see cars abandoned in the middle of the road).
- Traffic around Swindon can be horrendous after 4.15pm meaning that it can take well over 30mins to reach the train station or M4 Junction.
- No subsided usage of Swindon's public transport for employeees which isn't helping congestion and pollution around Swindon (shuttle buses that nationwide provide are often oversubscribed leaving many people stranded). 
- Main organisational strategy of recent times is to religiously focus on cutting costs in order to remain profitable (knee-yerk redundanices and restructuring having been arriving in waves throughout the past few years).
- Private healthcare has now been withdrawn for new starters (below senior management level). 
- Not a  particularly diverse organisation with middle and executive level overwhelmingly white and middle class. 
- Some really grotty toliets in Nationwide House."

Very hard to progress further in the company as a lot of middle management jobs are with people looking to keep their career at that level.
730,Nationwide Building Society,Shocking,2019-03-21,1.0,Collections Advisor,"A commendable job working at the Financial service voted number 1 for Customer Satisfaction.

Onsite catering facilities are very good and food is of an excellent standard and reasonably priced.

A very good pension package.

A very charitable company that also supports local charities.

Very fun annual Christmas party.

Managers are knowledgeable and do genuinely care.","Three absences from work will see you placed on a 'Health Plan' requiring a Doctor's note for any upcoming illness. Absences are then used in patronising way against you in 1-2-1s which contribute to your end of year/annual review. In which, you are given a rating that dictates your bonus... Any excuse the company can use, will be used to stop you getting a half decent end of year rating, which in turn stops you getting a half decent bonus (Probably due to having a banking mentality) although they are of course a Building Society and are different....

This cut costs mentality can be understandable in an economic climate such as 2007 but the recession was many years ago and with steady growth predicted for the coming years (despite Brexit scaremongering) you'd think they would put a permanent fix to the lifts that keep breaking down, meaning taking the stairs on your 10 minute break. You will then get a petulant email from your line manager asking why you are 2 minutes over your break time.. Just come to my desk and ask me?

The company also now employ a 'Supply your own plastic cup' rule. Where there are water dispensers without cups. Therefore if you haven't brought your cup in, be prepared to go thirsty. (Cut costs mentality)

Your opinion will be ignored, Nationwide often ask for employee feedback and then discard it, the best example of this was the Christmas party, staff were asked to vote for the venue they wanted, one venue won by a clear margin, but the other venue was selected (Cut costs mentality)

Once you are taking calls and no longer in training, your training will consist of GCSE standard PowerPoints and handouts are in black and white, again cutting costs with that banking, I mean Building Society mentality.

The salary is supposedly industry competitive but competitors in the area offer a superior salary. Before advertising this, research should have probably been done.. 

They operate an absolute zero tolerance on mobile phones at desk policy. However if you are a manager, this does not apply to you. Some managers even have two phones at their desk.

Any disciplinary is done through a 'HR' where someone from the other side of the country will come and speak to you as well as your manager where they will analyse your statistics, this will last 30 minutes.. Or 5 minutes if your manager just spoke to you at your desk about it.

If you plan on travelling from out of town to do this job, be prepared to pay for parking at nearby car parks as the on-site car parking facilities are very small and you will need to get there 50 minutes before your shift to get in and also make sure you have a passenger or you will be turned away. Once the front desk were actually handing out handheld alarms for female employees to use the car park down the hill.

Extra curricular work that helps in career progression often involves work outside of normal working hours, fair enough. However, be prepared to be out of pocket expenses while your receipts for spending your own money are 'processed' for weeks and a refund is done.

In summary, Nationwide has a good reputation and says it cares for its employees, in practice it really doesn't. There are very little job opportunities within the building itself and achieving a higher pay bracket is so unattainable that you'd almost think they don't want you to achieve. The company has outdated practices this is largely due to being an old fashioned bank trying to operate in the 21st Century, with rigid processes and a hierarchy that are out of touch with the office. The people in positions of power clearly do not trust those in the lower end of the company to do their job properly, therefore everything you do is monitored and therefore this level of distrust can only demotivate an individual.

If you do work for the company, do not try and work from the bottom and try progress up, you will spend a longer time than you first intended, colours will become paler, the air will get heavier and your happiness levels will suffer."

I mentioned to management that they aren't supposed to track appointments being booked and yo state how many we should be booking as they could lead to pressured sales which is heavily regulated.

You get failed on quality checks before you’ve even been told that the goal posts had changed. And woe betide you if you are temporary and get pregnant. I’ve seen it twice in the last two weeks. Women have either been terminated or moved to another role so that the managers don’t have to deal with the “problem”. Personally, I’m looking for another job and will be closing my Nationwide accounts. Also, work systems are terribly old, and you often have to use two or three systems when one should be enough. There’s also a lot of copying and pasting because the systems you use don’t communicate - no different really to the general lack of communication amongst the management to their teams.

The company and employees do genuinely care about staff, members and their money and, the focus is always on the best outcome, not minimising cost and maximising profit.","Internal Process provides adequate control but, also means the company makes poor decisions to get things done quickly and hemorrhages money on Business Transformation. It is members' money and it is horrible to see money get wasted as a result of decisions where the right people haven't been engaged.

From a career progression stance, there are good opportunities at Nationwide. They will try and employ internal applicants in most cases however, they should be more transparent with what they are looking for in a candidate rather than being nicey nice and wasting their time.

The internal promotions process is shocking. I was offered a role at a competitor and a role at Nationwide however, purely due to a process, they would not even consider negotiating salary.

NBS think PRIDE is some unique thing that only they do (its not) and its pushed down your throat at every turn.  Its like being in a cult!

They spent £10m hiring out the NEC for a week to do a new corporate launch, got a new CEO in who got £2m signing on fee (google it) to join and he said we at the launch we are all one family, a mutual blah blah then had a mass cull of staff (SLT unaffected obviously).

There are a lot of managers in positions above their abilities, getting paid huge money, purely because they have been there for years.

Finally the amount of 121s that take place, I had weekly manager catch ups, monthly 121's, I had to produce so many examples constantly to justify a payrise.  If they cut all of that nonsense out and just let people get on with things they could save money on middle managers who are there to just do 121's and have a happier workforce!"

In the retail sector, professional growth is limited to becoming a branch manager, a mortgage advisor or a financial planning manager. This is because the roles within different areas are never available as there are few opportunities. 

The pay at different levels is not commensurate with other banks and building societies. However, in true capitalist fashion, the salaries and bonuses of the CEO and top directors kept rising, while the retail sector kept getting their pay reduced for different reasons."

891,Nationwide Building Society,Generally OK - but some areas remain managed by hierarchy which will never be fixed :-(,2017-11-22,4.0,Anonymous Employee,"I've worked at Nationwide for just over four years now, and its fair to say that the organisation does, on the whole, have a host of really professional, friendly, approachable people I have ever worked with. Again, on the whole, this stretches across all disciplines meaning the atmosphere is one of support and ""we are all in this together""  - which is great. Other good things about Nationwide include:
- no written rule that you have to be in the office, and working at home is often encouraged (to combat no space whatsoever in their Swindon HO)
- No fixed start/end of day times for Head Office roles like mine
- A very very good pension offering which is rare these days in the UK
- A subsidised on site restaurant at all main sites (including London) meaning lunch is, generally, cheaper than the high street (for hot meals) 
- Free car parking at the Swindon and Northampton head offices
- Option to choose additionally flexible benefits on an annual basis, including the latest Apple Products 
- A genuine desire to deliver for external customers in everything that is done - rare in FS these days!
- Fairly good basic salary for HO roles","The organisation is going through a large period of change at the moment, but this simply isn't managed well. What was once a great place to be, is now slowly becoming poorly managed. This is partly because Nationwide has a demographic of people being there for 20+ years in some management roles who play lip service to the changes that need to happen, but when it comes to it, have no ability at all to lead change as Nationwide is all they know. This is particularly obvious in the Architecture area where an obsession with hierarchy in the senior leader team stents growth and confidence for people in the more ""junior"" roles. It's not uncommon for some of the more senior leaders to point blank ignore you unless they want something  - sadly this isn't something that Nationwide advertises to the outside world on its career page. Other cons include:
- The Swindon location is absolutely bursting at the seams - get there by 08:15 or you won't get a desk or a car parking space (and this is even with god knows how many people working at home on a daily basis)
- Main reception in all the Swindon sites look great, but get behind these and you'll find offices that are filthy, dated and need serious TLC - the toilets in particular are just destroyed from years of use. How much is a new toilet guys?!
- Holiday packages for roles with 2.2 and below are very poor compared to the market (HR say its OK as their manual tells them it is) 
- Providing company cars seems to be a lottery - but its OK, HR have a manual they read once in 1989, swallowed, and never passed it out again!
- The organisation is in chaos at the moment with change directed from the CEO but the ""leaders"" who have been there for 20+ years have little ability to direct change because they know nothing other than Nationwide-  a massive risk I feel
Career progression is driven by length of service in some areas and not capability."

You will be looked down on.   Yes, you can move up in the company and actually there is an unwritten rule that its to be expected but when going for management roles you'll find that if you're not in the 'club' or have friends who are in the right places - its going to be hard.

Generally, driven by big egos who are indecisive and have no management skills but are managers! figure that one out.  Who constantly have meetings and seem to decide on nothing, oh and when they do,  the decision, its  very often a complete disaster.  I don't know if this is typical of financial services, but here its like going one step forward only to go two steps backwards.

I've stayed in touch and nothing has changed since I left. If I hear it's changed I'll update this review.

961,Nationwide Building Society,Supportive Collueages but Difficult to Progress,2017-04-20,3.0,Anonymous Employee,"Employees of Nationwide are generally friendly, intelligent, supportive and engaging individuals. Nothing is perfect (see ‘cons’) but I can say that the office environment has generally been supportive and positive. I've had the opportunity to work with some lovely people and the social aspect of my working life has been good. I can honestly say that I’ve had fun with my colleagues at Nationwide and have enjoyed my time here overall.  

Personal development is actively encouraged and is of a good quality, with soft skills training being a focus for me personally. I’ve been lucky to have strong, supportive line managers who wanted to see me succeed and encouraged personal development. 

I love Nationwide's attitude on supporting the community and if you want to participate in fundraising events this is supported by management. I’ve both participated and organised fundraising events and count these experiences as some of the highlights of my time at Nationwide.","I truly believe that to progress your career in Nationwide, your face must fit. I was saddened to find that despite Nationwide promoting an inclusive culture, underneath it is no different to any other financial institution when it comes to promoting its people. I have struggled to progress my career despite being competent in my role, and making it a priority to address my areas of development in a proactive, positive way. 

I appreciate that these types of statements are difficult to prove without detailing personal experiences and confidential information, which I will not do. It also appears as though I am giving mixed messages in my praise of my Line Managers and colleagues, but they were not the decision makers when applying for progression roles in my division. 

I must stress that Nationwide is not a bad place to work, far from it.  All I would ask is that potential employees keep my comments in mind and remember that, even if you struggle like I have, it doesn’t mean that you are incompetent and not deserving of a future in your chosen field."

Great place to work for new starters & graduates to bring them into financial services.","Unfortunately due to low risk appetite that Nationwide adopts, there is a lot of control & governance which impacts the freedom that people should have to thrive & push themselves.

If you are going to apply for Nationwide especially in a customer-facing role, confidence and personality is key. Sales experience would help. They don't give targets but we do have monthly meetings with the Branch Manager to discuss how many appointments you have booked. Also, if there is a lack of appointment booking for Home Insurance or Investments, expect e-mails to find out why which is bewildering to me.

On top of this, the bullying and blame culture is beyond belief - I have witnessed behaviours that have led to individuals not being able to perform, taking lengthy periods of absence and even resigning with no other job to go to, just to get away from the awful 'deliver at all costs' culture at Nationwide.

Monthly appraisals in which you get told for an hour and a half that you don't want to be there because you aren't booking 30 appointments a month. Told by line manager I had the best customer service he had ever seen, but still got a part met for the quarter because I didn't force people to come in and open current accounts/credit cards that they didn't want or need. Rarely leave on time at the end of the day and when I put in a request for overtime pay as I had stayed late by 30 mins to and hour everyday for a week I got told that I was lying and had the overtime rejected. Couldn't book any holiday due to staffing levels as the turnover was so high they couldn't employ new staff fast enough and we were always short. Ended up with 10 days of holiday remaining when I left the job (in late October) and I was forced to take this as pay. Line manager told me lies about what my fellow colleagues were saying about me. Was told that colleagues had said I was 'too slow and had no urgency' when doing bankage for the branch, spoke with my colleagues and nobody had said anything of the sort. It is a nasty bully culture and if you don't conform they knock you down until you can't take it anymore. Cried at work on several occasions as a result of being placed on a review where I was told that if I didn't improve my business in a month and a half that my job would be at risk and being spoken to rudely by  a CSM in front of the whole branch. I notified the SBM of what had happened and nothing was ever mentioned to the CSM, because the management have their own little clique where they will cover each others backs and protect each other from anything. In my last 26 days with the company after handing in my notice I was given a total of 4 days off (1 Saturday and 3 Sundays when the branch was closed) and when I questioned this I got told that due to staffing levels that they could force me to work two 6 day weeks and that I would have to take this as pay, because as I was leaving the company they couldn't give me the time off at a later date...very crafty and is proof that there is very little care for the welfare of their staff! Avoid at all costs. They want to come across as a company who just cares for their customers and really looks after their staff, but this couldn't be any further from the truth!"

Whilst most people are very nice to work with the level of talent is mixed which can be frustrating. Lots of duplication across different departments. In Architecture there are too many Chief Architects (most organisations would have 1 but NBS has 3) all pulling in different directions and with too many tools (each team has procured its own tool and many do not integrate with each other).

Area I worked in had the highest level of staff turnover and sickness in the country, which appeared to be the direct result of a new area director starting in 2015. Expectant mothers are treated particularly badly, with a couple of instances where staff were forced to leave.

1084,Nationwide Building Society,Awful,2016-03-23,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"Good benefits package which runs alongside salary. Bournemouth location is very convenient for public transport, but not much else that's positive.","Where to start.... I worked here for nearly 25 years-- initially, I worked for Portman, who were fantastic to work for. I hung on after the 'merger' (read; take over) in hopes that my department would be made redundant. Management lurch from one catastrophe to the next, everything it reactive instead of proactive. 
Managers are not trained in the tasks of the team they manage, leaving the Team Seniors to handle complex queries (non; Team Seniors are not called 'assistant managers' as this would make them part of the management team and this would require a higher pay scale. 
Pay is not in line with geographic location so that most people who work in the level 1 sector of the society in Bournemouth are forced to take second jobs to maintain a standard of living comparable to their counterparts in Swindon (Head office is located there). 
Constant desk moves and shuffling of layouts which costs up to £500 per desk, per move; this is members' money being spent on a reshuffle-- this is a constant thing in the building. Level 4 managers have 'PA offs' in which they compete to get the best gift for their PA each year -- one winner received tickets to Egypt for her and her husband: the costs are expenses, so again, this is members money being spent inappropriately. 
Changes to job roles aren't written down so that your contract doesn't resemble your job at all.
Very cliquey and if your face doesn't fit or you aren't a 'yes person', your card is marked.
One Operations Manager has had a huge number of complaints (including one from an entire team) lodged against her, yet still retains her position, despite having more complaints via the union than any other manager, ever. 
Different rules apply to different people, according to which manager likes them and who drinks with who.
Impossible to speak directly with level 3 or above; they fob you off to their PA.
Hiring is based on who knows who-- at least two managers in the current 'Nationwide Now' department were hired because of close friendships with the hiring team. One was told to 'meet for a cuppa' over dinner with friends in the weekend and came back from that 10 minute cuppa with a new job that she hadn't even applied for.
I witnessed anti Semitic comments over dinner from a woman who is now a team manager.

This place is rotten to the core, uses members money inappropriately and had no respect for lower level workers (who are referred to as 'natural wastage' when they leave). I made a mistake in staying as long as  I did; don't make the same mistake."

It wants to change but it can be hard for people in the organisation to take criticism.  

In particular to the architecture division, it has some of the lowest engagement and enablement scores within the society.  There has been lots of change lately, with new leadership and an influx of senior architects.  However, instead of embracing PRIDE values, there is extensive infighting and backstabbing in this area.  This is impacting the morale of the division and impacting the brand."

1146,Nationwide Building Society,An IT department that doesn't know what it's doing. Lead by ineffectual management.,2015-02-23,2.0,Principal Applications Developer,"Nationwide have good benefits and are really flexible around work hours and working from home. A 35 hour week is becoming rare but Nationwide has stuck to it. 

Head office has good facilities, restaurant, coffee shop, gym and hairdressers.","Every department is different, I was in a Practice in Group Operations. The director has publicly stated his desire not to be a software house. I joined after a round of redundancies PRISM (branded restructuring) and left after another 'Working with partners'.

Software development is now supposed to be delivered by 'partners' again this actually means software development has been outsourced to IBM, Accenture & TCS. 

You would have thought that Nationwide would have learned from the disaster that the Voyager programme was (led by IBM). But instead they think these 'IT specialists' can do it better than there thinly stretched internal teams. Which by now is probably true as it's died a death by a thousand cuts.

The situation has been made worse by the fact that most of the senior management has been recruited from x-lloyds people. Who clearly believe outsourcing is the answer. 

They've done this outsourcing without having any robust Quality Assurance function in place beforehand - so don't have a measure of software quality before outsourcing so can't measure if it's being improved. I know of specific examples where it has got much worse. TCS being the main problem.

Management is by fear, all senior managers have very slopey  shoulders and don't want to be seen taking any accountability in case something goes wrong. I heard a rumour that the head of my practice had admitted he walked around with a resignation letter in his jacket. So he could have it to hand in a seconds notice. Really gives people a sense he's committed and believes in all the things he was trying to sell to his people. 

From talking to other people around the business, no one was happy. I hope that there is, and someone leaves a positive review. I just haven't meant them there."

The culture is all about putting people first (customers and employees) and it is really well-embedded throughout the organisation. The company invests a lot in nurturing talent and I have always found there to be good opportunities to broaden and develop my career at every level through a range of different roles. The pay and benefits packages are excellent in my opinion, with good pension, holiday entitlement and range of other benefits (varying by job level). Individual performance is measured through a combination of task delivery and behaviours, and company performance is heavily determined by customer satisfaction, rather than pure financial performance, both of which help to maintain the people-focused culture. I have always felt able to contribute to the success of the company and I’m proud to work for Nationwide.","Head Office is becoming rather busy these days, leading to problems with car parking and finding meeting spaces. The technology and systems are rather “locked down” which can be frustrating as it gets in the way of doing the job.

1199,Nationwide Building Society,Nationwide - On Your Side... or maybe not.,2013-10-16,3.0,Anonymous Employee,"A safe company that has survived the financial meltdown. 

Big enough to offer opportunities to progress your career, but not too big that you're just a faceless individual. 

Great people that regularly go the extra mile. 

Easy way to start a career in the finance industry. 

Reasonable salaries. 

Stress-free work that isn't particularly challenging.","This may not be apparent from the outside but Nationwide is a hugely dull company to work for. Despite being the first UK provider to offer online banking, Nationwide no longer innovates and is now lagging behind its competitors in areas where it used to be a market leader. 

The Executive Directors, and in particular the CEO, are so risk-adverse that it has stifled innovation. 

Nationwide's public image is confused as a result of mixed messages from the marketing department. 

Incessant 'cost optimisation' programs have adversely affected every division across the entire society and there has been little investment made since the disastrous Voyager program (with the exception of the swanky new office in London for the Chief Exec). 

IT systems are outdated and in desperate need of modernisation. 

Massive amounts of outsourcing have resulted in many talented people leaving the organisation and the loss of invaluable skills and experience. 

Promotions are often given based on tenure not competence, and it is widespread that someone whose ""face fits"" is promoted to a new role in a different department despite having no knowledge of that department or the role they are now performing - this is particularly apparent within the IT division.

Training budgets are laughable... and remarkably are now being cut even further. Classroom courses are unheard of, and even web-based training is no longer available."

Having said that i do believe some people make a genuine concerted effort to progress, though as with anything there is an inherent resistance to change as pioneered by management.","Recruitment process is not particularly transparent as senior managers have an 'idea' of who they would like in their particular span of control, this gives rise to those being employed on the basis of who they know as opposed to arriving on merit (a term that seems to be non-existent herein).
overall as discussed, pro's outweigh the negative management but be prepared to make massive sacrifices to entertain management whims."

I enjoyed my first few months there and the bonus was related to performance and it did make me put the effort in. I was also given some oppurtunity to devlop.","Very Cliquey, Stupid conflicting targets and expectations, conflicting messages from senior managment to what line managers say. The company is trying to cut cost wherever possible, whilst asking us to be more efficent spend less time talking to customer / dealing with queries we were also expected to hit a sales target and deliver the best service possible. It isnt possible to sell to someone with rapport and consultative sales whilst hitting cost cutting targets."
