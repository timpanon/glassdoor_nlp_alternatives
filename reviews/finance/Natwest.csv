Lots of Overtime available to give you ability to bump up salary","Customers service ethos and framework of scrutinising calls and conversations doesn't take into regard the detriment customer's can cause staff's mental health

Management in service do not know what they are doing half the time, it seems to be that such roles are provided due to favouritism rather than merit or their ability to manage people and provide assistance when needed. I have personally moved away from speaking to management for assistance and instead ask other senior members of staff

Bank makes it seem that the ability of promotion is available to anyone and that internal promotions methods are set up in a way to help staff progress within the bank with ease but in actuality that is not the case, staff targets needed to reach before being promoted or even getting a small pay rise are sometimes unattainable and these targets are set higher and higher year by year.

Being a bank that is fully aware of inflation rates and rising living costs the pay provided or the increases in pay rise does not properly address or take in regard these rises

The pay is terrible and does not match the work"

- Badly managed - strategy changes every other week and you’re expected to keep up

- Work you will receive as a grad is so varied, some managers seem to actually value graduates and offer them L&D opportunities and some treat you as an admin assistant/general inconvenience 
- Early Careers are genuinely so weak. Never seen a scheme within Banking/Finance so poorly run and plenty of my friends are also on grad schemes 
- Management talk constantly about D&I but I've personally experienced sexism within my team, witnessed racism and other generally vile behaviours from various colleagues (it's worse the more Corporate you go) 
-The PQ is not recognised, also is very poorly delivered & there seems to be no communication between Early Careers/Placement Managers who in my experience are reluctant to even allow you time to complete 'outside-of-desk' work

722,,honest review From experienced person,2021-09-13,1.0,Customer Service and Operation Analyst,"1) Work life balance is there. you can opt for flexible working hours also. 
2) Employee centric company as in they don't strictly follow hierarchy if you want to raise your concern you can skip the level... and raise your concern even if it is related to your manager.
3) Great opportunity for freshers. Also who are not frequent changer can stay here and settle down.","1) slow growth or one can say zero growth. 

2) Great opportunity for freshers only, not for those who have spend 1-2 years in this organization. As you will be dragged to internal politics and if you didn't lick your manager's boot you can never find growth here. 

3) After entering into this organization you can't expect people on above hierarchy to be supportive all the time or even knowledgeable. I personally noticed people can't even speak English but are holding some really important positions which can affect other's career."

Inconsistent approach to operating procedure because of ambiguous guidance and training which leads to pieces of working taking either 30 minutes or 6 hours, and then staff get interrogated and blamed for not reaching daily targets due to this. 

Lots of team reshuffles due to the massive workload meaning you don’t get a chance to make friends with anyone before they (or you) get moved into a different team. 

No recognition, and no pay increase if reshuffled into a more complex work team.

Work Life balance is a joke
Managers will say they care about work life balance but will also give you a lot of work so that you will not be able to finish on time and if u extend your shift they will ask for the reason so that they don't have to pay for the overtime

This company is so focused on cost cutting that they are literally no ready to pay for the hard work you are doing by extending your shift to complete the work, even if you tell them they will give some excuse and try to not give you overtime pay

People who are looking to work in a company that values it's employee hard work and gives them growth based on their work ..my advice to you is kindly stay away ..here only favorism works.

Every decision taken is based on cost cutting ..even if it makes the employees life hell. They don't care they just want to save money .

Slow growth..and less pay compared to other companies.  For a year of hard work you will get peanuts

Technology - For a bank, they definitely keep up with the trending technologies. They keep investing in using AI solutions from the market and coming up with their own ideas to improve customer experience

Leaves - There are ample leaves available and the most important thing is, every manager is aware of the fact that we are entitled to take our leaves and they even insist us to take leaves and get refreshed. The bank gave special leaves if the employee or the family members are affected by Covid.

Increment and Bonus - They are better compared to service companies",Not much that I have seen so far

* Monitor everything
* 15 min total toilet break
* Hot desking
* Failure of own values
* Redundant and archaic systems 
* You have to do so much in 30 secs of a call it can be frustrating to the customer.

Many employees networks in the business which are good to help the community and colleagues but they lack of understanding from a management level, as some managers don't understand the network importance and think it's a waste of time and don't provide staff time to support the network and expect them to use their holidays allowance  to do that or stay out of hours to do it as they think it's not relevant to their jobs.","Management dont listen and hate to be questioned. Decisions are made at the top, irrational decisions made without taken customers impact into account.  Staff pay the price when speaking to customers. Staff are never asked their opinions and when we say something we are ignored. 

Terrible HR support, they have no idea of what happen at local level as they are based in Manchester/ Edinburgh and staff feel they have no one they can raise their concern without being judged or worried about being targeted. Many times had to go with the flow as you feel to small to say something in the department or organisation. 

Very hard to move within the business if you don't know someone. You will see yourself applying for jobs internally and expecting to go for a coffee with hiring manager to have a chance of having your cv looked up. If you don't do that, forget about it or you will move nowhere and will stay at the same place forever. If you want to move to another area you need to look outside the bank. You never have the skills or aren't  good enough for the role."

2428,,A bunch of low IQ folks together,2020-02-26,3.0,Operations Analyst,"Short Term - Decent job for short term : 1-2 years, beyond this you're wasting your time and energy.

Work Life Balance - No work usually (depends on department) after office hours.

Salary - on time.

Stability - For permanent employees, it's a stable company. Although, it's decreasing day-by-day.
If you're on contractual, avoid this and look for permanent position.

Women Friendly - Policies and transportation are women friendly.","Work Profile - It's a cut copy paste kinda work for all entry level jobs.

Fundamental business is going down while company is profiting from cost cutting initiatives.

Tech : Old, inefficient and faulty program are used by mgmt and the blame is put on analyst for low productivity.

Process Lead/ Process Senior/Manager - 

They'll try to highlight their importance in front of managers/team every chance they get.

Create chaos and behave like school teachers.

Always trying to lick & impress their boss as if they'll get a promotion.

Pray to God, you have a decent manager.

Managers flirt with female colleagues, while a minute number of females (seniors/employees) take this as opportunity.

Some managers will cancel approved leaves and avoid giving holidays to team to impress their boss.

Perception - You should be seen busy or process magical numbers (without quality) will impress managers.

Process Knowledge - Senior analyst share half baked knowledge with new joiners, resulting in quality issues and escalation. Beware!

Restructuring - Every solution to any problem is frequent restructuring. By the time, you learn one process, you'll be shifted to another.

No growth - No matter on which role you join, it's a back office role. It takes around 8-12 years, to become a manager.

Colleagues - Don't be friendly with seniors and managers. Sweet talk but be smart enough. Avoid sharing personal life with colleagues as gossiping is crucial task undertaken seniors and managers. Most people will backbit** behind your back.

Hiring - Too much contractual hiring and delayed joining in last one year. Contractual employees are being extended for 6 months instead of making them permanent.

Cost Cutting - All perks, allowances and leaves are being removed in name of cost cutting.

Sarcastic Trainings - Company will teach you about ethics, anti-money laundering, complaint mgmt, etc. But none of them are slightly concerned about it.

HR - They're here to protect management and their nuisance"

2441,,Avoid Internal Audit Graduate Programme,2020-02-21,1.0,Internal Auditor,"Salary is significantly higher than equivalent roles with accountancy firms
ACA qualification
Impressive offices","Extreme micromanagement. You will work for audit managers who are trying to get their bonuses (you won't get these), and will treat you poorly via denigrating work and excessive micromanagement leading to loss of motivation.
Nobody takes any interest in your development or cares about your performance. Slow development and work opportunities, so many people fail to achieve the necessary number of professional working days and competencies/ladders to become a chartered accountant. Most people are working in teams where the ACA has no relation to their day to day job for about 3 years.
Salary does not increase, no bonuses, no recognition for good work. Work most days consists simply of admin tasks and compliance with onerous internal auditing methodology so not much room for development.
Incredibly hierarchical structure, work will be reviewed by multiple layers of management, each with their own review points that often will be contradictory in nature and has the effect of being a horrible place to work.
To save money, RBS decided that you have to study the whole ACA qualification online, with no classroom support. The external training provider outside has had significant issues with the delivery of the online training.
Lost of job losses and redundancies as they downsize the department, nobody is safe from this workplace vibe.
Lots of office politics, extreme political correctness and tokenism making it an unpleasant place for a caucasian male. 
Disillusionment means exam failures among current ACA/CA trainees are far higher than the market average.
No decent exit opportunities, either internally or externally unless you are prepared to take a pay cut.
No potential for progression or early promotions, it will take 6 years minimum to be promoted to audit manager despite studying and completing ACA qualification, also the pay becomes less than what job market offers after 3 yrs. No opportunities to rotate internally with different audit teams or to different departments.
High staff turnover so people come and go. Internal Audit is a place full of bank 'lifers' with few skills, and moved around to plug holes in the bank's workforce and where careers go to die.
Very stuffy working environment, few people talk to other teams and sit together in their own teams despite hot-desking. Senior management sitting in their ivory towers have no idea what is going on and rarely even visit the office. Still severe issues with RBS' internal culture, lots of finger-pointing over serious issues and no responsibility taken.
Those with good performance ratings are remunerated by an extra £10/week takehome for years of good work. haha.
The internal job satisfaction survey was very very low for internal auditors who have been there for less than 3 yrs and at 'appointed' (not managerial) level, which is hardly surprising. I would recommend avoiding this graduate scheme if you have a choice."

8) The bell curve is so big here, so whatever your performance, you will be rewarded ""Meeting expectations""
9) Comparisons will be very open, eg., If someone attend office being sick, managers will demand the same from all.
10) Rhetoric and Rhetoric.. for a simple things they speak a lot, action none...
11) Most important point - Attrition is very less, mainly because employees are are not groomed well.

2620,,Adequate but Antiquated,2019-11-27,2.0,Customer Service Agent,"I have enjoyed my time with the Royal bank of Scotland. Many people aren't equipped to handle the call centre environment and it shows. As much as people like to moan about managers and staff they cannot control how a customer behaves.

Everyone I have interacted with within my centre or within managment have on the whole been lovely. The one caveat to that are the agency workers and certain departments who have a chip on their shoulder. This however does not effect me.

Other Pros:
- Flexibility, I play a sport as a hobby. However my manager and I are able to look at heat maps and re-jig shifts so I cover hot spots to enable me to continue my hobby. 

-Decent holiday alotment and you can buy more through the RBSElect scheme 32days including Bank Holidays and you can purchase and additional 5 days leave.

-Decent culture in the bank and an atmosphere of striving to improve from previous bad press. 

-Senior management are fairly transparent on the whole.","- My role is taking calls. You will be expected to answer calls. ( Personally not a con but the major complaint from other staff.)

- I handle FPOC complaints and have no change in compensation for this. i.e a new start is on the exact same wage as someone who handles complaints at 6 months. The only difference in my wage is the Annual increase which is tied to Yearly Review by manager.

-Favouritism is alive and well; If your face and attitude fits you will get ahead especially if you get on with your manager. ( I think this is industry wide however it could be a Con)

-You are expected to be Agile. In that Just because your team is booked for a meeting does not mean you will get that time. The issue with this however is early morning teams have a quieter time and will almost never have any off phone activity pulled due to customer demand. However on a core shift you may very well lose your precious time away from customers and never see it returned. 

- Deputies were told 5 weeks before christmas that their role no longer existed and they would have to apply to be TM of new teams or go back to On Call role and accept a wage reduction. The TM roles they have to apply for are open to outside candidates and candidates from other centres. Meaning there is a high chance some will be jobless come January.

-Talent is not necessarily recognized you have to force your way into opportunities. You may suggest 100 changes to process as an agent however all that counts for nothing when you apply for a role in change or journey management."

Students value this, he says.","Ostensibly, RBS's shriveling markets and international banking business doesn't look like a great bet for anyone planning a glittering career in banking. In the past three years, RBS has cut more than 8,000 jobs from its investment bank, pulled out of entire business areas (equities, M&A), and seen its investment banking operating profits decline by 89%.

7. Unprofessional environment as no one from the higher side comes for auditing and the work environment has become monotony (same as LALA Company).

1. Employees are expected to book their seats every week, even if you are to sit in the same seat.

2. RBS prides itself for seeing its name in employee happiness indexes, which in fact nobody has ever heard of like PCI, Stonewall Workplace etc. You will never find its name in popular great place indexes like Glassdoor and LinkedIn. Because factually, it is a Dead Place to Work in.

3. No Cabs/Free Food provided. There is no pick and drop service for its employees. You can find most of them struggling in metro, buses to reach office, and employees have voiced their concern but RBS is yet to listen.

Bad Reputation in market.
1. If you end up working here, your reputation in the job market drops steadily as RBS carries a very bad name for its UK practices and is shamed for old/stale technological adoption.

2. RBS is now a UK focused bank, hence any chaos in Brexit will deeply affect how it performs - in fact it has decided to cut down bonuses and appraisals of its employees in 2019.

3. Famous for cost cutting measures. RBS has runs cheap employee benefit schemes such as Great Place To Work, Employee Health - which in fact are cheaply funded and hold no actual benefit to employees. You only get to read them in emails.

Poor Pay.
1. Pay is of substandard level compared to its peers and you should expect very slow growth in the company.

Dead Culture
1. You'll find Babu-type desi employees around, who have ended up in the company without true skills and have stayed for over 6-8 yrs in the firm.
2. Ideas are only discussed in meetings, no real implementation is ever seen.
3. You'll be surprised to find - Automation of excel sheets is still the go-to term used in its initiatives, even the top leadership focuses on this!
4. People are slow moving, as its technological adoption is very poor and cheaply sponsored.

Whether its Gurgaon, Bangalore or Chennai, RBS is a dead place to be in and needs to work a lot to improve itself."

* Great for grads; really easy to get you started. If you are ambitious and able, you will quickly go to a different company to use your full potential. Otherwise, RBS is big, slow and political enough to hide in the crowd and progress with other means.
* Great to retire; loads of people already in RBS are coasting to retirement. You can join them.
* Great for under-represented groups; there is an active drive to hire and promote ethnic groups and women (at least in words)
* Promotion of volunteering, charities, equal opportunities,...
* Great Edinburgh HQ. Good Bristol office. Relatively good India offices","* London offices used to be human warehouses compared to other tech companies. Situation has improved in some, mice have remained in all.
* RBS is management-heavy even for banking standards.  There are teams with 8-9 non-productive managers for every one contributor. And this is after numerous rounds of lay-offs.
* Staffing is driven by cost, not value. Expect no future in London, as headcount is being constantly reduced, in favour of Scotland and India. 
* Scottish talent pool is a minnow compared to London's. RBS' reputation in India is that of a ""safe"" place with 2nd rate work; no match for candidates compared to Flipkart, Paytm etc. Result is a constant lowering of the median talent.
* The constant brain drain and hiring freezes has resulted in a vicious circle of hiring only contractors, buying expensive COTS or outsourcing to external suppliers. For its size, innovation and technology in-house is negligible.   
* On the other hand there is incredible waste of money at the technical level. 
Huge projects in the tens of millions delivering little to no value. All. The. Time. Comparing with how efficient challenger banks and trading upstarts are, it is rather depressing. 
* Expect to make no difference as an engineer. Not because it is a big organisation, but because few to no technical decisions are based on technical merit. Politics and hippos rule (highest paid person's opinion).
* Pace of change is glacial. Everything and anything takes months or years. There is incredible bureaucracy for every single thing. There is a deep hatred towards automation. RBS lags behind technically at an ever faster pace, burning even more cash trying to catch-up."

- Lack of ambition

- Edinburgh is MASSIVELY over staffed while London is far too lean in many teams. Understandable to an extent as London is expensive, but to witness the comparably low level of ability out of Edinburgh staff, it makes you wonder if hiring a few decent staff in London over 3x as many in Edinburgh makes more sense?

- Distrust of the more mature investment banking arm by, basically, everyone else in the bank.

Great focus on personal development in particular - professional qualifications relevant to your career 

Good holiday entitlement - which grows with service/seniority.

Business definitely has an entrepreneurial spirit, offering individuals the opportunity to be creative and individually responsible for improving things. However there is often still a lot of red tape in particular from middle management/senior leaders.

Executive are very open to new ideas and creative ways of doing things. They have a real commercial and supportive manner for the most.","Less ability to cross pollinate roles for such a large organisation (as it’s getting smaller) and most certainly more silo’d - like it was many years ago.  It’s challenging for people to work in other functions of the business from which they started 

Banking benefits very poor (all readjusted and many removed after the bank crisis) 

Massive focus on positive discrimination of women. Eg. They want more women in senior positions. Whilst this is great - the organisation is falling into the trap of meeting a target instead of getting their basics right and employing the right person for the right job.

After being asked to review the company honestly, a manager was assigned to groups of people to ""monitor"" the responses which employees were providing to a questionnaire provided by head office.  Actively encouraged to change responses which were deemed unsuitable.  This practise is illegal.
Offered ""kickers"" for upselling people to different accounts and encouraging them to take out various indemnities, insurance and accounts.
When groups of employees were given the news that they would be losing their jobs, team leaders created groups in the call centre names ""huddles"" then looked at each other in unison, before delivering the news together.  A ridiculous approach, rather like a cull, very unethical, and crass.
The manageress encouraged us to give her a good review, as a bad review ""could affect her pay"".  I personally would rather have left an honest review, not a skewed one. 
I could go on and on.  It is a terrible place to work, and certainly not somewhere to carve out an eventual career.  There is no room for manoeuvre if you're an ambitious individual, the workplace itself has a very sorry feel.  Simply avoid at all costs."

If you can stomach the culture you can learn a lot - though it's as much about how not to do thing as it is how to do them properly.","I worked at the Thanet Grange call centre and the watch word was 'expediency'. Today's absolutely mission critical, 'everyone's running around like headless chickens trying to achieve it' priority will be forgotten by the tommorow  - even though the problem still exists. Some very weak managers who are led by personal bias/favouritism and impressed by gobbledygook management speak rather than self evident (if inconvenient) facts, leading to some incredibly knuckle headed and short sighted decisions  - be prepared to face palm multiple times daily. Too much emphasis on achieving certain meaningless statistical targets at the expense of overall performance in areas that really do affect the bottom line. No senior managers around after 6pm  - not good when the call centre opens and deals with high call volumes until 9pm. Not a place to work if you really care about getting it right  - has had deleterious health effects on me and others I know. Beware managers who are happy to leave their work for you to manage when it suits them, but who don't like it when you dare to express a relevant and useful opinion when it doesn't. Too much credit and attention given to those who neglect their core duties to do tasks that curry favour with managers, too much slack given to people who are well liked but obviously not performing as they should  - need to make sure the rock solid reliable performers -  who actually deliver the real work - get the credit they are due."

This can be somewhat detrimental if you have any desire to “progress” or be “promoted” within the bank. Progression is extremely slow as people tend to have their feet “firmly under the table” where movement is concerned, often meaning that new (senior) roles rarely open up and if they do (see aforementioned point) you do not stand a chance if you’re not in “the circle”."

Further claims of mis-selling, compensation and redundancies are a matter of time.  

Staff morale very low and many managers just remain in their positions for too long to care about the staff.   Internal employee opinions often conducted under senior management supervision to achieve a glowing score.

4086,,Needs an overhaul,2017-12-07,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"RBS has some very loyal and kind people working, but these people are extremely rare to find nowadays. Most people who are here long term are bitter and resentful.","Where should I start?

The first is that RBS has many many departments that dont talk to each other. As an example, you are a manager who needs 20 resources. Most of these resources are needed for 1 or 2 days to implement something in production. Now there are disjoint departments (will definitely be 20 departments since you need 20 resources due to the silos in RBS) with their own format of huge word documents, sharepoints and sometimes online systems. For each of these resources you will need to fill in the same information in 20 different formats (some of which take weeks to fill in). You think thats the job done? Absolutely not. Now you will not only need to chase these 20 departments, but they will also randomly allocate resources to you in 2018, 2019 etc even though your project ends in 2017 and you have mentioned that in whatever format of form they asked you to fill up. Then to get these resource dates amended, go back to start of process and fill the same forms again. It is tedious and stupid beyond belief.

If you are not an IT person, this is probably a good place to work. But if you take years for planning any IT project, then by the time you deliver the project your technology will be so severely outdated that only the RBS employees who are also customers will know how to use it. It is compulsory for an employee to open an RBS bank account so 100K of their customers are 'compulsory customers' anyways along with many more who have worked here in the past but are too lazy to change their bank.

Secondly, the number of contractors they have outnumbers the permanent people by a huge margin (was something like 10% permanent). Due to this, the number of people doing short time fixes and patch is higher than people who think long term (long term here is anything greater than 6 months). The contractors don't really care about the bank but just keep patching things over and over instead of planning for fixing them.

Third, the 'blow your own trumpet' culture. Some departments keep doing this over and over. If their projects fail, they get incidents, they still act as if things were a massive success and start rewarding people in bulk. In these pockets, even If someone sneezes, they get an LOV award (living your values). Other departments meanwhile do not even reward their people if they make millions of profit. The reward system is not related to what you achieve, but depends on the type of mental disease your management has in that either they will go overboard thanking people even if they have failed, or they will not thank at all. 

One more thing, their layoff strategy has no basis. Someone critical to a project could be laid off, while someone else with nothing to do will be kept on. Mad really. 

They now have location based layoffs. Most people in London are being laid off now as they have a strategy to have most people based in Scotland."

Diverse.

Great for those who're simply looking for a paycheck at the end of the month

Simple 9-5 working day. Most employees (including senior)have left the building by 17:05.

Historically a stable role however this is likely to change during 2018 due to planned redundancies by CEO. Ross Mcewan plans to have the bank profit making by 2019","Low wage bracket when compared to identical roles within HSBC, Barclays & Lloyds bank.

Many outdated processes which need updating.

Reluctance to streamline processes as the bank staggers through its divestment phase.

Not much in the way of progression due to planned redundancies of senior roles.

The bank processes are mostly archaic & tedious. To the point where they need to be taught first then an individual must inevitably rely on trial an error to complete a task.

The bank fails to effectively invest in upskilling the young talent. Mainly caused by its new found focus on risk. This is born from the bank needing to be sold as ordered by EU commission after 2008. 

Unreliable appraisal process 

Employee needs are often overlooked

-Although there is a fair amount of diversity within the bank, there is an obvious ""boys club"" phenomenon apparent within most teams. This unfortunately leads to those who don't fit the mold being overlooked for progression opportunities. 

Notorious high turnover throughout all teams.

No Bonus - Pay increases are minimal 6% for standard annual appraisal. this then decreases to 4% once within 90% of the maximum salary"

Team managers are lazy and seem to enjoy constantly threatening people's jobs over losses which they admit they would have done the same thing on. Some won't even do their job the first hour of their shift - even when built out to do a specific task they rely on normal members of staff and not even deputy's to run an entire department while they go to the canteen when supposed to be working - I have had to do their jobs whilst also juggling mine many mornings. 

The floor managers (bar 1 however I will not name names) are abysmal. None of them have any people skills in a job where it is essential, and not a single ounce of compassion. An example would be where a colleague was needing surgery and they would not give that person a day off for an essential pre appointment and demanded they swapped a shift. Another would be a refusal of a holiday for a MOS who needed that as she was receiving IVF treatment that day. 

There are literally no routes of progression other than working up to manager level as every department connected to fraud which is non customer facing is facing redundancies and downsizing with their jobs being moved to India, for no reason other than to save RBSG money. This means that the entire department is depressing with it being a matter of time until another persons job is moved over to India. 

The bonus system has been edited to benefit staff less, and the grades for this can be given to you by someone who doesn't know you at all and only goes off of statistics such as AHT which actually makes no sense - by all means not wasting time on calls is important. However the amount of pressure put on staff to reach ever lowering targets meaning that customer service skills are thrown out of the window in order to get a customer off of the phone as fast as possible. 

Absences and the treatment you receive in regards to this seems to be very inconsistent in the way that some staff members jobs are threatened after 2 absences in six months yet that same manager has had more days off due to absences in the last 6 months than they have been in work; leaving work early and making up random reasons why (boilers broken at home... at midnight and so nothing would get done until the next day after their shift would end anyway). 

There is a reason there is, as my manager puts it, a ""revolving door"" of staff. It's not the job itself; the job can be interesting especially on higher risk calls when unskilled. The reason people are constantly leaving is the ridiculous treatment of staff highlighted above and then the pressure put on them by staff leaving and not replacing them in a timely manner. This means that there are more calls waiting to be handled, creating worse cases to deal with through escalations and complaints. The place is ran with no long term plan in mind and because of this there will never truly be a change. No one wants to work in a place where you feel you're constantly at threat for losing your job for menial reasons."

Very limited Growth opportunities, you will get promoted if you have some godfather to support you. your sole talent can not give you a WIN in this company.

performance appraisal process is very much hidden and peers are not treated fairly, whatever your LINE manager is saying you have to accept ,you have no choice, because there is no third person or HR person can interfere .

Due to this at the end employee is trapped and become frustrated. and in no time the good talent leaves the organization which are a backbone of  the Bank. Line managers don't even care about their reportees. most of the times the feedback is just adjudicated and derived out of their actual performances. lack of a 360 feedback also makes the process a bit unfair.LMs don't even want the employees to attend the Global leader townhalls so that the voices can not be reached to the people.

It is a very ""political"" environment, some teams pursue their own interests only and sabotage initiatives, back-stabbing happens.

8 to 4 JOB","Culture : First of all those work as contractor , going to hell their life. because they treat as a Servant in Home because RBS employees those working since long time they think they are king and know everything specially LADIES Leaders , they can do anything with you which you can't expect. BIG difference between contract and permanent staff.

WORK : There is no technical work at all , already running systems in very obsolete technology and have to solve only PROD AND PREP ISSUE, everybody running around it , if you solve then you will become champion and will get BIG Reward which they give only to permanent staff not to contractors. they won't give any KT to contractors and expect will do it at own and will finish assigned work on time.

They have one special Team which called KSOR Team  , that called KEEP THE SHOW ON ROAD Means whatever issue assign to you regarding any system you are champ and will do it without taking any person help. and if you try to search people for help so LEADERSHIP People will say why you taking help and do search on CONFLUENCE PAGE.

The whole day passed in running batches and monitor logs and solve issue. that's it.

Those who have knowledge about domains and system they are full of ATTITUDE and difficult to take help from them.

RBS is a full of those employees those are there since long time and they will not get any JOB Outside instead of that because they know become old in Technology and Age.

They try to do harassment with contractors also.

It knows no shame, and it is still very much about getting profit before anything else. On first impressions it may look slick but reality is that its sick. This is a company that doesn't care about its employees, a company that has no morals. Its a basket case. As long as the upper management get their bonus they have no cares for the business or for the people in it. I listened to a meeting and you know they are so insular and detached, planning on how to cut wages and mess with the junior ranks, they wont go. And they think it hilarious at what they are doing to the pension. Really if you have any sense and moral compass then you would give them a miss. Any opportunity with RBS is a wasted opportunity. Think outside the bank, what are you going to do when you make a move from the bank ? you will have RBS on your resume and you know what the rest of the world thinks of them."

All the talk is on 'doing the right thing' for the customer, which means very little when  translated into service. The bank works because of the staff that remain there, the systems and just about every process seems to get in the way of the staff in the bank. The bank systems (can't say too much) are ancient, not linked and full of 'sticky plaster' solutions, it amazes me the FCA / PRA allow the bank to operate some of the systems they do. 

In the last year pension benefits have been eroded, bonuses scrapped (only for the lowest rungs of staff!) and there is next to zero investment in training, culture or retaining talent at the bank.

The overall culture at the bank is very much like an arm of the civil service, there is little drive for efficiency, a lot of tribalism and 'computer says no' attitude, and an upper management completely disengaged from the base of the bank. We don't 'sell' we 'help', we don't do mortgages we do 'dreams', pseudo culture brought in from the most cost effective 'corporate advisers'. It feels like switching the band on the titanic, the tempo might improve but the ship still sinks! And we wonder why it's been nearly ten years since the bank turned a profit? (we're told every year it's 'mistakes of the past' i.e 2008 credit crunch, however this is getting quite distant now, and it's hard not to believe these are in fact the mistakes of now)."

5057,,Good Place to work,2016-07-27,3.0,Operations Analyst,Great community to work with.  Great work life balance.,Cross departmental rigidity. Some times it may take long to complete an assignment due to handovers.
5058,,The exodus continues in Stamford,2016-07-27,2.0,Vice President,"Good base salary. Generous vacation. Good work-life balance. Many people are pleasant,  friendly, and helpful. Nice office in convenient location for public transport and parking. Good amenities.","The workforce in the US has, and still is, being reduced drastically and continuously. If you look at the Warn notice list on the CT State website you will see that over the last few years and right up to the current date, they have been cutting jobs in batches of 30-50 or so typically once every month. The building was half empty when I was there and UBS has now moved into two floors. It was clear this branch had and more positive times in the past. The continuous exodus affected the behavior of staff and influenced the business decisions as people fought strategically and flexed their muscles in order to demonstrate their importance. However, there were some exceptions to the rule who just continued to roll their sleeves up and got with the job. I think there were also frustrations that cuts didn't seem to be happening in the UK offices at quite the same level as in the US, and that this was unfair. During the time I worked there management had not yet figured out a strategy on how to improve moral or provide any justifications for why staff should choose to stay.

Most of IT headcount had already been moved to lower cost centers. Typically for every one position in the US there were multiple replacements (usually about three) hired in the low cost location to equate. However, usually they were of a lower level of experience and the timezone differences and sometimes language barriers did not help. The level of knowledge and standard of work coming from the lower cost centers, with a few exceptions, was poor and in my opinion would not provide value in the long term. Many times I had to deal with support teams in other locations who did not respond, could not understand English, or did not have any technical knowledge or in fact know anything about the system or technology they were supporting. Sometimes development teams I had to work with would say ""we cannot do this"", even though the request was, in my opinion, not particularly technically challenging.

The level of bureaucracy was the worst I have ever witnessed. To get access to systems or to co-ordinate work with other teams took vast amounts of electronic paperwork, persistent follow-up, and escalation. The majority of emails to request access or help from other teams either went into black holes, or required persistent reminders and escalation to get actioned. To get the level of access required to do my job took several months after joining and many hours of persistent effort., and this was very frustrating. When working on projects sometimes arbitrary dates or goals were set just to please a manager or fit in with what was in a document. I think that sometimes developers and analysts lost sight of the goals they were trying to achieve, and were more focused on sticking to poorly designed project plans and arbitrary paper trails or documentation. One manager once said to me that he knows that it doesn't make sense for me to do something, but ""If we need to tick a box on a document, we will"". It was hard to believe that it could be any worse, but if anything required interaction with RBS Group staff or their systems then the level of bureaucracy rose to even more ridiculous levels.

For the most part, the technology stack is a little behind the times.They are one or two versions behind the latest and are still using outdated front-end technologies and frameworks. Some of the internal applications were some of the most poorly designed, bad quality user interfaces I have ever seen. Some didn't work at all, and I can't believe how they got through any QA.

There was limited budget. No travel to other offices with very few exceptions (mostly from the UK, not from the US, which caused some frustrations). Even the paper, pens, and other stationery was taken away from conference rooms, and we were told if we needed these things we needed to buy and bring our own.

There was no real work-from-home guidelines or policy and it was generally discouraged."

Definitely working 9 to 5 from now on.

Furthermore,  there are senior level employees who are given senior level compensation in roles that the bank doesn't need anymore. However, this isn't surprising because it seems those who underperform, or are a huge distraction and nuisance to other workers, get the same treatment as value added, hardworking employees.

Most of the dev related  job are either is of low quality or support. Most of good players of rbs idc had left or leaving. So coming to pros

good HR policies (cab food etc)

Hr has no power to protect human values or employee concerns.

No Innovation is promoted or recognize where as a Hippocratic agenda lower level management show that they push people for innovation in meetings. Where as they want to work you as slaves for 24 *7 when ever they ask(I was asked to work on uat issue at 2 am several times)
Highly political environment.

HR is there to do paper works.

Third party suppliers are then brought in to 'help' but they usually lack skills and experience and need hand-holding all the way from when they arrive to when they leave.

- Very good work life balance (this is one of the main reasons why many people stick around)
- Offers good domain exposure e.g. Investment Banking, Payments etc.
- Offers challenges pertaining to managing legacy systems & their decommissioning, large number of interdependent systems
- Work flexibility (from home or in different timings as suitable), free transport, food, baby creche
- Air travel (international) entitlement by business class for _all_ employees
- Clean pay structure (all fixed, no variable component - bonus is discretionary)","Corporate & Institutional Banking (CIB):

- HR merely exists & there are very limited touch points (all you do is call a helpline no. & speak over the phone like a call center). 
- The bank is going through immense restructuring & turbulent times (shareholders pressure) & is expected to last until 2020.
- Mostly regulatory, mandatory or BAU work, not really much to innovate. Budgets are majorly impacted due to pressure from shareholders & annual fines.
- Pace of change due to legacy platforms is too slow due to lack of knowledge & interdependency across systems. Most of the SMEs have left the organization & others have moved across to other platforms internally. Hence, adequate knowledge of the product across team remains to be insufficient.
- Most of the long term plans (1.5 - 2 yrs+) often get derailed or de-prioritized. It's mostly a norm than exception & have witnessed it for at least 5 years. As a result, lot of capital is drained without significant ROI.
- Change in leadership & significant restructuring happens too often (twice every year). Hence, the after effects or problems arising from actions/decisions of the earlier management falls on the new leadership team who would naturally not take any accountability. New leadership team has it's own vision & priorities which is much different from earlier one. Hence, it's an easy excuse for everyone & no one is penalized.
- Since organization is getting shorter every year the pace of change is very high which the leadership team isn't able to manage effectively. This effects annual appraisals, promotions & other incentives for those below.
- Most of the good staff has left (at all levels). A good percentage of those who remain (especially at higher positions) are not very capable but would naturally stick around. Naturally, it's an easy guess what the next leadership layer would be."

Work life balance is good if you can convince your manager that you work hard.
Easy to stand out from the crowd if you are skilled.
Pay is good if you are hired externally.
Flexible working good if your manager isn't old school.","Recent restructure is very bad news. New management claims that the organisation is to become more horizontal, but it has gone the complete opposite direction. Extremely top heavy, and it's getting worse.
Way too many new managers who love to spend all day ""discussing"" and ""having a think about..."", but ultimately don't have a clue how to execute and play it all by ear. When things succeed, they take the credit, when they don't, they will happily shift blame to their more junior staff.
Managers are terrible at differentiating between the fakers vs people with real talent.
Pay is extremely inconsistent within grade bands, and will take a very long time to rectify naturally due to HR policies.
If you get promoted, expect a very disappointing pay rise (if at all).
The old ""retail banking"" culture is starting to take over the whole bank. Very narrow minded way of thinking with little common sense, blindly establishing and following procedures with no appetite for creative thinking."

There are still some great people who are working in this organisation.

The new corporate values.

Some of the office accommodation (Gogarburn) is of high quality.","Since the financial crash this organisation has changed from the best place I have worked when I really felt valued and appreciated and was able to do a good job to a place where there is bullying and obstacles are put in the way of getting a good job done - this is partly due to governance (fear driven) and also the lack of experienced staff.  

A lot of good staff have left over the last few years and the clean brooms at the top level do not have the corporate knowledge to implement their ideas. 

There have been a number of new ways of working, operating models and structures, each time the person who brings this new idea then leaves the organisation before the model gets a chance to become embedded.

The increasing movement of jobs from the UK to India in order to cut costs has resulted in a number of third party companies in the sub-continent making a lot of money from the Bank. Within technology the net effect has been lowering of morale in onshore staff, lower quality and increased timescales.

The organisation is now very much smaller but in some areas the workload has increased, with redundancies and attrition there is now a real shortage of managers in some areas. The remaining managers have too large a workload to do their job effectively and the stress is palpable.

Political interference has been extremely damaging to the Bank. In particular the EU requirement to divest a part of the UK business. This has swallowed up people and money and has prevented the Bank investing in its technology to serve the organisation and its customers."

I was always proud of and I am still proud to be associated with this great organisation.

1) People centric. They really treat you like a human being rather than just bodies with a suitable mind to binge on which most companies are nowadays.
2) Every individual is treated with respect. This is what I like the most. Even the contracters are managed with great respect (although some of the contracters given to us are really DUMB but nobody used to yell at them... that's the culture which makes it royal and not some local bodyshop)
3) Quality of work is good but since project delays are common so execution takes time which takes away the real essence.
4) PAY is decent 
5) The best part - FOOD is AWESOME !!!! Yummy... hygienic....
6) Transportation is another very strong selling point since very few companies really bother to provide decent transportation ....","1) Some managers are from poor service companies and they are not absorbing the real culture/values of the company.. they cant digest people leaving at 5 so they will always be looking for some stupid reasons to make you stay longer.... these FOOLS are not realizing that this will take them nowhere....You really have to be the part of a company to grow with it....
2) I never understood the criteria of bonus distribution... although it gives an impression that it is given to people closer to the immediate manager....

New CEO and new structure with same old people leading. Company talk about employee engagement yet morale is low. Employee Opinion Survey is undertaken once a year and yet with incredibly poor scores for my area I haven't seen one action to help improve what people said, clearly a tick in the box exercise. Very inefficient with big blame culture, copying loads of people in unnecessarily on emails, bullies and too many old timers who have been there 20-30 years and are set in their ways. There are some great people in the company but many lack ownership and empowerment, also some of the worst people I have ever worked with, horrible. If you are in marketing, projects are handed off to a Marketing Delivery team for fulfilment who often take ages to get things done. Really bureaucratic processes and backward systems. Risk adverse and big fear factor in many areas. Never seen so many meetings, people in meetings, working groups and numbers on conference calls. Lots of silo's and changes in strategy common."

A lot of the hub departments that are based in NL were inherited from the takeover of ABN AMRO and they have been busy for the last 5 3 years in reducing it as much as possible.

I will admit to having a lot of good times there prior to the last couple of years that I was there. It was an easy commute into Edinburgh and the working hours were convenient.,"In my last couple of years there the atmosphere changed for the worse and it was obvious that the aim of the organisation was reduce headcount to leave only the best performing staff to run the ship. I respected that approach, but there was too much pressure put on those who were deemed to be under-performing. I came into that category, but I strongly believed that I was being unfairly marked down. I was a hard working and loyal member of staff who always enjoyed a challenge, but because management didn't give me enough time for vital training, I struggled to do the job I was being asked to do. The Union was involved in my case, and they agreed with me, but I was left with no option but to apply for voluntary. This was accepted, but I'm still left with a bitter after-taste.

Every few months the strategy changes; new buzzwords, new structures, new rules to live your life by... 
Unless you are under the wing of somebody senior your career will stagnate and die. The best thing you can do is join high, stay for a year or two and then move on.
Horrible ancient systems that  don't communicate with each other and frequently crash and leak. 
""Ivory tower"" - in HR the leaders sit in Edinburgh and the little worker ants are based in London. They have no clue what anybody does, many times during meetings they're asking to review projects that finished months ago.

Have been told recently that ive been here long enough (a few months) to know certain procedures that ive never done and nobody has shown me. So many things which i come across regularlybut have never been sat down with someone running throughit step by step. I get that people are busy lots to do but i think they should have a plan of action for new entrants before accepting them so that less mistakes are made. They have told me everyonemakes mistakes but i dont see it like that when its other peoples money im dealing with. Weve been told that we dont have targets to meet yet it is very high pressured when it comes to booking appts etc. I get businesses need sales but i find it disheartening if the business cannot be honest with its staff about targets and what happens if you dont meet them.

- Nice colleagues. 
- Opportunities to work overseas in London.
- Opportunities are available for internal transfer if you are able to network within the department.

- for bonuses, you need a rating of at least 4/5 to be considered. Hence most people don't get it.
- No job security even if you are a permanent staff, operations are continuously being outsourced overseas.
- Head count not being replaced, (perm staff leaves, a contract head count is given), 
- People are consistently leaving, making handovers very rushed and done improperly. 
- Hard to achieve work life balance, as the teams are already under-staff, expect to do more than one person's workload. Most are expected to 'double up'

Sincere suggestion. Never join RBS by seeing salary hike. It is not good organization who expect growth and recognition. If you dont want to take any challenges, and it is a good company to do valueless work and no where useful.

Poor project management,: Always busy with doing politics. This company is being run by bunch of illogical managers  No seriousness and never take responsibility.  hardly any other employee friendly policies,

 1. Project  Management is a complete failure.
2. Resources always remain insecure being here.Unpredictable future. Job security is a concern
3 Hidden layoffs.

 They will never say that we don’t have any work in projects, they will say your performance is not good that’s why we don’t want to continue with you and you can search for a new job.

Employee facilities like Cab, Food  are excellent. 
RBS itself is a great organization.
Company building is also very good.
They understand their social responsibilities and support charities.","Cons: 

1. Once you join, hikes are very less. People get average 4% hike yearly. So it is very important that one should be aware of  the cost of living in Gurgaon and do not let RBS HR fool you with a lower package, while joining the company. Because that will be the salary you have to survive for the entire time, you will spend in RBS. 

2. All the work is done by Software designers in this gurgaon office and they are not paid any bonuses if not in the favorite list. Promotions are impossible to get.

3. If you are into development, settle for the minimum CTC = (your years of experience * 2.25). This is because whether you work for say 2 or 4 years - yearly appraisals like 2.5%, 4%, 3% will not increase your joining CTC much and you need to survive and maintain your living standards. Also to compensate for all the hard work you will be doing without any promotions and meager hikes.

4. They will ask developers to also do support activities on weekends without any extra pay."

Very political - people who have been there for the longest have an advantage.
Does not seem to be a meritocracy - it is NOT true that the best ideas are encouraged
Extremely few are genuinely interested in doing what is right for the bank. 
Plans of action are backwards: instead of first establishing the goals and then the way to get there, there is an undue focus on structure, meetings, processes, without a clear understanding of what the point is.

1. Work-Life balance
2. Very good projects
3. Good learning opportunity
4. Opportunity to work with multiple vendors
5. Very good pay [this will be a problem when you decide to quit, as no other company in the  market agrees to pay this much]","1. Incompetent leadership team which do not even understand the basics of the project requirements.
2. No governance on the Onsite-Offshore model. Offshore team has no control over the Vendors.
3. Offshore team has no contact with the onsite business team and has no reputation for their hardwork. Vendors will obviously setup an onsite team which works closely works with the business users, and takes all the credits of offshore RBS team.
4. No visibility for the offshore team. Management takes no responsibility or initiative in maintaining good relation with the business users onsite and strengthen inhome capabilities.
5. No transparency on the rationale behind taking decisions, anything can go bad at anytime which will screw up the entire project inspite of good resources and inhome capabilities.
6. There is no one to monitor the vendor resources in the offshore. Vendors do not have any work at all, they slack all the time on personal works and subsequently enjoy free cab ride in addition to a hefty billing towards the project.
7. Notice Period is another tragedy in RBS. You must serve 3 months of Notice during which all your access to the project will be stripped off. There is no flexibility in negotiating the notice period even if the resource has no work at all.
8. No transparency in deciding bonus and hike. Members within the same team can get different amount of bonus and hikes...irrespective of their performance. If you really perform well at work and do not spend time chatting with your manager then you are likely to get no pay hike and zero bonus...beware!!!
9. All sort of unnecessary things are done first [like improving gym, dormitory, worker collaboration, library, internet kiosk], and all important things related to project decisions are taken slowly...making the resource to hate the workplace.
10. Logical thinking among Managers is out of picture. Most of managers here aim only getting a ransom pay, bonus, etc., and no justice is done in terms of work....if you are a Manager then its a very good company to work till retirement, as no one will chuck you out even if you just fill the spaces for namesake."

Most of the people I worked with directly were actually quite nice.","But things went downhill very quickly. It was a rudderless ship, and you felt it all the way down the lines. I found that those in the US were treated as secondary citizens in many ways. We rarely got information from management in a timely manner and our benefits were far from comparable to our UK colleagues.
