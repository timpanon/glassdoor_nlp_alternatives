4,Natwest,A dead end role that expects far more than it deserves,2022-04-06,2.0,Personal Banker,"I liked the people I worked with and I think most people could say that about their branch. You all face the same challenges and have your ups and downs together. 

Whilst I worked at the bank, I really needed a routine and this role fits that well. Open and close at set times and set days; undertake any extra tasks you might have and see the same customers. You will get to know your regulars and this is either a nice thing or a pain, but your co-workers will help laugh it off.

This is subject to branch but my managers would back me to the hilt if I needed it. They would stick up for me infront of customers and internally and you're not expected to be treated badly by customers. You're allowed to stick up for yourself and not bend over for rude and unpleasant customers like you are expected to in a lot of other customer service roles.","Despite what you will be told, this is a sales role. Your performance and your yearly pay review is assessed against how many products you sell via digital channels. It doesn't matter what extra responsibilities you may undertake, the bank only cares about the sales you are making, everything else is secondary. The most insulting part of this role is that no matter how much you go above and beyond for a customer, you will only be recognised if it results in sales figures.

Poor pay structure and no bonuses. Frontline staff dealing with challenging customers and delivering fantastic customer service will never receive financial recognition because it doesn't look good. Some kind of financial bonus is the least staff deserve. To top this off you will hear non-stop about how many other great services you have access to as a member of staff. These are trivial and come as standard among any company with more than 500 employees nowadays. They are not substitute un leu of better pay.

No access to any kind of favourable products. No preferential mortgage rates, loan rates, cheaper insurances and no discounts on packaged accounts. The bank recently eliminated the last remaining discounts for staff so that they can ""experience our products just how our customers do""... really?

Poor pension. You will have a retirement savings pot set up for you by the bank and that is it. The bank pay nothing into it, it's only you. You can elect to pay in an amount from your wage and it'll be tax free, but the insulting wage you will be starting on, it doesn't offer you anything.

No progression. There is very little room to progress in branch banking at Natwest. If you enjoy the sales aspect, you could become a Senior Personal Banker who see customers in appointments and help with their wider finances. A more fulfilling role but once again despite what you will be told it is sales driven and focused. From their you could become a bank manager. However you have to fit in with the clique and is currently oversubscribed. Plus the typical role of a bank manager is dead. What once were traditional duties are handed down to the personal bankers and they only serve as sales team leaders to the senior personal bankers. If you really want a career in the bank, look at head office jobs which nearly all start on better pay.

Natwest is rebranding to a ""digital-first"" bank. You will bear the brunt of the fallout it causes amongst the people who need access to branch banking services most and it really takes its toll. To top this off, redundancy calls will come up every year and depending on the size of the branch you work at, there is little job security in branch banking."

The branch managers are gossips, constantly slagging off staff in the back office and discussing private matters where anyone can hear it.
If someone has an issue with another staff member it’s extremely unlikely that they’ll approach them to discuss like adults, 
They don’t deal with under-performers, their response is to put them on PIPs until they quit or move them to severely under performing branches.
The whole company is bottle necked, there are lots of talented SPB’s who end up leaving as there’s no where for them to go in the company.
Premier banking changed so much, it wasn’t about building a great relationship with clients it turned into a glorified SPB job and you just had to flog as many products as possible."

In the winter when there were blizzards and the met office were advising people not to travel, he took the decision to keep people in the office. This resulted in people literally being stranded and having to stay in hotels because they couldn't get home. He then had the audacity to say that he wasn't to know that would happen.

278,Natwest,Challenging,2020-11-25,2.0,Senior Personnel Adviser (AGR),Money is decent. You get to speak with members of the public. 9 to 5.,The job can be very stressful for many reasons. They say there are no targets but there are plenty. For instance if you havnt booked someone in for a mortgage you'll get pulled up for it. Even if I saw a customer and our product was 2k more over 2 years compared to another lender the management would say well our service is better?! So if you wanted to get the products like mortgages you had to manipulate and use your charm. You'll basically get questioned after every customer as to why they havnt taken such and such products. Sometimes the customer feels there are better deals elsewhere. But that doesn't matter to them.

426,Natwest,Needs an overhaul,2019-10-15,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"Natwest has some very loyal and kind people working, but these people are extremely rare to find nowadays. Most people who are here long term are bitter and resentful, and their skills are so outdated that they need to start over anywhere else.","Where should I start?  

The first is that Natwest has many many departments that dont talk to each other. As an example, you are a manager who needs 20 resources. Most of these resources are needed for 1 or 2 days to implement something in production. Now there are disjoint departments (will definitely be 20 departments since you need 20 resources due to the silos in Natwest) with their own format of huge word documents, sharepoints and sometimes online systems. For each of these resources you will need to fill in the same information in 20 different formats (some of which take weeks to fill in). You think thats the job done? Absolutely not. Now you will not only need to chase these 20 departments, but they will also randomly allocate resources to you in 2018, 2019 etc even though your project ends in 2017 and you have mentioned that in whatever format of form they asked you to fill up. Then to get these resource dates amended, go back to start of process and fill the same forms again. It is tedious and stupid beyond belief.  If you are not an IT person, this is probably a good place to work. But if you take years for planning any IT project, then by the time you deliver the project your technology will be so severely outdated that only the Natwest employees who are also customers will know how to use it. It is compulsory for an employee to open a Natwest bank account so 100K of their customers are 'compulsory customers' anyways along with many more who have worked here in the past but are too lazy to change their bank.  Secondly, the number of contractors they have outnumbers the permanent people by a huge margin (was something like 10% permanent). Due to this, the number of people doing short time fixes and patch is higher than people who think long term (long term here is anything greater than 6 months). The contractors don't really care about the bank but just keep patching things over and over instead of planning for fixing them.  Third, the 'blow your own trumpet' culture. Some departments keep doing this over and over. If their projects fail, they get incidents, they still act as if things were a massive success and start rewarding people in bulk. In these pockets, even If someone sneezes, they get an LOV award (living your values). Other departments meanwhile do not even reward their people if they make millions of profit. The reward system is not related to what you achieve, but depends on the type of mental disease your management has in that either they will go overboard thanking people even if they have failed, or they will not thank at all.   One more thing, their layoff strategy has no basis. Someone critical to a project could be laid off, while someone else with nothing to do will be kept on. Mad really.   They now have location based layoffs. Most people in London are being laid off now as they have a strategy to have most people based in Scotland."

Good pay/package
Excellent location","Overall the business is great to work for but this particular department has a revolving door of staff because it's tiring, robotic and depressing. Managers are decent until the snakey senior managers breathe down their necks because they care more about targets that they pretend don't exist but really do. 
Uniforms for a role where the onyl customer interaction is via the phone - stupid waste of money."
499,Natwest,Drove me to drink,2019-02-21,2.0,Senior Personal Banker,"- The uniform burns delightfully fast when thrown in the fire. 
- The bank closing at 5pm meant you had a set escape route at that time and couldn't work late.","Context: I worked in branch banking, so customer-facing. I quit this role without anything to go to, because my mental health was deteriorating and affecting other aspects of my life. I luckily found something else very quickly, but I was happy to use my savings than continue working there.

- Extremely understaffed in branches - I felt as though I needed to transform into an octopus with eight legs in order to be in four places at once. This is a highly pressured environment where customers are demanding, enormous amounts of money are in our hands and stress levels are though the roof. Recipe for disaster? Yep.
- 'Sleep your way to the top' culture. Oh, the things I've seen and discovered...just not professional in any way.
- Worryingly low quality training and preparation for a VERY demanding role (just a few weeks, and the knowledge was about 2% of what we actually needed).
- They lied about it not being a sales role. IT IS ALL ABOUT TARGETS. The FCA should be horrified at what really goes on. I had a few managers who openly said to me ""We are still all about sales and targets"" - despite this being unethical and an outright violation of the FCA's terms.
- A distinct lack of security. I've been spat at in my office, insulted, demeaned and know colleagues who have been physically assaulted. 
- A complete lack of heart in the HR department. You contact them through a computer and they send a miserable, robotic response after 2/3 days.
- Ancient back office systems that made us all want to bang our heads against a brick wall."

- Disorganized

- bullying is torlerated and stems from branch managers

- lack of day to day structure 
- impence pressure put on branch staff since a lot of branches are closing
- lack of direction 
- often branch managers are immature  
- virtually no support from management 
- lack of formal training, this is very worrying as if you are branch based you do a lot of complex cash handling and the only training you get is via an online module 
- cash differences constantly happen
- instability due to branch closures and RBS’ role in the financial crisis, still very much suffering from that

599,Natwest,Awful company - not interested in staff or their wellbeing,2017-07-13,1.0,CSO,"The benefit package is good and they do pay well, reasonable amount of holiday too.","Where to start!?

Holiday has to be booked a in the November of the year before you want any time off, its then done on whos been there the longest. Which as you can probably work out, always goes in the favour of the management.

The finger pointing is out of hand. Management literally go on a witch hunt to blame people for things they haven't done. If they like you and you are a favourite then its fine, however if they don't like you then you are for it. Use to dread returning after any time off.

They make you feel like you are a burden to the business should you need time off due to an illness.

Expected to work longer then normal hours and receive no pay. Expected not to take a full lunch.

Have to ask to go to the loo.

If management don't like you  then they will lie and try and screw you over in mid and end of year reviews and when challenged they back down as they have no evidence.

Only time management ever try and take an false interest is when the staff survey comes out each September. However, they can work who said what, so should you say something bad then watch out as they will be after you.

There is this bizarre thing with management where they have such large egos that they don't deem junior members of staff worthy to speak to or treat with respect.

Targets are huge and so is cold calling. Expected to book customers in for reviews - which is really trying to sell them a product. If you don't get so many credit cards, or loans or mortgages then they string you up. 

Awful company to work for - avoid at all costs. Everyone who has ever worked there and left will tell you how much better life is outside of the bank"
600,Natwest,Senior Personal Banker,2017-06-11,1.0,Anonymous,"- Can work with helpful people if you are lucky enough to be in the right branch

- That's about it..","I rarely take the time to write review about employment but in this case I thought to make an exception. I can write an essay about this company but I will keep it brief:

- Company culture: Toxic, favoritism is sky-high, if you are chummy with the manager you can 'get away with murder' as the say. These lot make you bring the worst out of yourself, since being nice and kind to them, does not get you anywhere, only makes you a doormat. 

- Teamwork: Hugely dependent on what branch you are working at, meaning that every branch is like a different business, therefore it can be OK or an absolute nightmare. 

-Career progression: It is very much a DIY job. If you genuinely do want to get ahead, management could not be less interested, especially if you want to move at another division of the firm, as it is seen that you are no longer 'one of us'. 

-Work life: Its all ab out targets! This bank does not care about customers anymore, despite their hypocritical claims that they do. If you let slip on those targets, you are out, simple as. I have seen people on the verge of breakdown due to the intense micro-management and bullying by managers in branch. As a result- mis-selling is slowly creeping up again."

They will help you progress but they wont force you. Great holiday times and with incentives being based around service rather than sales it is a much more positive working environment.,"Sadly the stigma that goes with ""banking"" means you will at times get negative customers no matter how much you try to help them.

Staff leaving and not being replaced leaving current staff overworked and very stressed! Claim to have no targets, but from my 7 years in banking (3 in NatWest) it's getting worse! Hourly emails requested to see what has been sold & witch-hunt conference calls with all members of lots of branches present. Bonus based on branch performance which is impossible running on low staff levels - so the extra work/hours/stress count for nothing, not even in good stead for future promotions as they no longer exist!
