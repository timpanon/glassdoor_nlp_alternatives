I was in the brokerage, vault custodian, mlo, trainer, etc - got EE reviews and took on every extra duty or event I could. When it came time for Advancement each time, my manager would just say, the younger kids just don’t want to put the time in like we did. Complete crap. What’s the point of being a god company if you favor the old time employees who don’t put effort in over the newer ones who do. It was completely degrading and demoralizing."

Navy Federal does care about our well being for the most part.,"Navy Federal has adopted a new hybrid model requiring employees to return to campus 1 day per week. Many of us have been working from home since pandemic began and have 0 interest in returning to office. I have a feeling there will be several voluntary resignations in the near future, as some of us are still fearful of catching the virus. Additionally, many of us are on the phones constantly and there is no real value in returning to campus. Our weekly team meetings are done virtually and everyone is fully engaged so i don't see a need in doing them in person, as this only increases our risk of getting sick. As long as our numbers are good, please allow those interested to continue 100% remote work."

30,,My opinion,2022-03-21,3.0,Member Service Representative,Family work life balance and medical accommodations. Good company to start with.,Low pay for the work expected
31,,Great Place to Learn,2022-03-21,5.0,UI & User Experience Designer,"Great team management. Our team's current manager does a great job at helping us and making our lives easier. She works hard to increase communication between us and other teams, advocate for our work, and set up healthy cross-team processes that properly utilizes UX's skillset. 

Awesome team dynamic. There's a strong emphasis on working together, support and collaboration. This is a team that wants to help each other. Team members help onboard each other, share knowledge, and encourage growth. High level designers happily mentor and teach less experienced designers. I owe my promotion from level 1 to 2, in large part to the higher level designers on my team. They gave me opportunities to lead and shine, and helped me when I needed a push.

Reasonable workload and flexibility. Most of the people on our team have a healthy workload that averages around 40 hours. This includes proper time to complete tasks well, ability to move deadlines up or back as long as its communicated, time to work on passion projects that better the overall department and company, etc. Every once in awhile there's a tough week, but this is usually only twice a year.

Respect for people's time and lives. Most vacation requests are approved as long as two weeks notice is given. Respect is given to personal needs such as scheduling doctors appointments or picking up a kid from daycare. I've never been questioned for taking some time off during the day for a doctors or dentist's appointment. Also, Navy Federal has their own healthcare center with free personal 

Opportunity to learn and pursue deeper interests. Our schedule is flexible enough to allow us to pursue deeper interest in our field or related fields. Our manager will even add these to goals on our performance as she knows us pursing these things benefits everyone. We have a mentorship program where we can pair up with someone in our own or related department/discipline such as inclusive design, more advanced UX work, research and testing, accessibility, development, etc. 

Promotions are generally given fairly, even if they take a bit. If you're working hard and going beyond your core role you will be promoted. In UX this means doing your core work, leading initiatives that improve our design or product process, solving problems as they arise or before they actually become issues, and helping others on them team. There are some politics to it, as in its easier to get promoted if you're working on a high profile project that's prioritized by upper management. However, if you're doing well you will be promoted within a few years.

Amazing benefits, especially with retirement. There's a 7% retirement match + a 3% cash balance pension, which vests quickly and is the most I've seen. On top of that, there's great healthcare, life insurance, 20 vacation days after 3 years, sick days that accumulate forever unless you use them, employee interest discounts off financial products such as credit cards and mortgages, etc.","For the UX team specifically, lack of career mobility. They're currently working on a plan to fix this. However, right now it's slow to move up more than one level. Most designers who come in as a junior become promoted within 2-4 years, but after that there's nowhere for them to go for awhile. It's very rare for a designer to get into a management track unless they were already very experienced (late 30s or older). It's much easier to move into management from other teams in the digital department. Because of this, its much better to join the team later career and retire here. 

Conservative culture. This can be seen as a pro or a con, but Navy Federal is more old school in corporate culture. They are very structured. Executive management has overwhelming power in the direction of decisions and products. HR decides on raise percentages across all departments with a percentage for each performance rating. For ex, a meets expectation rating gets you a 3% raise, an exceeds expectation gets you a 4% raise. Getting recognized for strong performance beyond this depends largely on your management and job role within the company. Also, it generally takes a long time to get promoted as its based on merit, tenure, and sign off from higher level management. 

The company needs more focus on diversity and inclusion. They've made a lot of strides in the past few years. However, there have been a few instances of clear racism that have not been properly addressed. This depends on team and department, however Navy Federal tends to ""talk to"" rather than discipline, demote or fire offending employees. Many of our employees, especially in digital are from varying ethnicities, religions, and countries."

No free ranging it’s all controlled by a logistic software so if you take too long in the bathroom or if you take your break later than usual it’ll reflect poorly on your adherence.

If there is a position, regions are very loyal to their own and your development will go back to ground zero rather than advancing at the pace you were in your prior region - this is a huge issue with this company. The mid managers are so poorly qualified for their position, that it seems as though they are given it based not on job performance, but other reasons such as who they know, how they act around upper management without regard for how they treat their people or their time in rate.

171,,Box checking culture obsessed on returning to the office with a good benefit package,2021-12-09,3.0,Consumer Lending Specialist,"Great benefit package. Generous paid leave, 401k match, pre-defined pension (basically additional 401k match), affordable insurance premiums, advancement opportunities, tuition reimbursement, job security, etc. The annual bonus is good monetarily (bad for culture). Also NFCU is not publicly traded or privately held. That is really good at times as the company focuses on long term strategy vs making the next quarter. Greatly improved technology over last few years. Mary McDuffie, President, is absolutely wonderful.","Working in different departments is like working at different companies as far as how employees are treated. Annual bonus program is based upon archaic performance review process, placing a lot of power with direct supervisors. This stifles constructive criticism and innovation. Breeds a box checking culture which is evident with the obsession with returning to the office. For example they send out survey after survey and many do not want to return, yet management does not listen in the tightest labor market in history. NFCU successfully operated for two years without forcing individuals in the office and still will not let it go over ""culture"", which is vastly better now that before the pandemic. Front office released a FAQ on ""Hybrid"" and consumer lending VPs immediately jumped on how to stuff people in the office 4 days a month because that's what the magical document said. What days will who be there, does sick leave or vacation count against the 4 days, how will it be tracked, what is the penalty for missing ""campus days"", etc. just to check a box. Sad part is leadership knows employees do not want to return, yet sit in meeting after meeting strategizing about how to sell it and tell employees it is better for them. If they spent as much time collaborating about how to improve the business as they did sticking human beings in cubicles, the ""culture"" would be better. Hopefully everyone across the credit union will stand together and refuse to go back simply to check a box, can't afford to fire everyone."

The fact that they don't open up new billets makes people working in branches extremely overworked, makes it hard for anyone to be able to take time off whether it is for doctors appointments, you're sick, vacation that you have earned, it is all looked down upon because we just didn't have enough staff even when fully staffed. They refused to open up new positions for us. The manager and assistant manager didn't do anything at all but talk in their office while me and the other supervisor did our jobs, their jobs, and any issues that came up in between. To say that we were overworked was an understatement. Then if you didn't get something that they were supposed to be doing finished in time you got in trouble and it went into your file which was a negative point towards your performance review. They made us find ""documentation"" for everyone every month, if you didn't have anything for an employee they would make us find some error, even if it was minor, just so we could have documentation and of course, this would go on their review as a negative. The assistant manager had her buddies and even if they were the WORST employees with a million mistakes, and never worked and always called out, the assistant manager always made sure they took care of them. The hard workers didn't get the credit they deserve. Mind you I'm not talking about myself and I'm not being petty as I always got high remarks and great performance reviews. And no, this wasn't only this branch, I've talked to others all over and they are the same."

If you get the right supervisor or leadership and get along well with them, it will make your experience a lot better.","Nit-picking and micromanagement are definitely alive and well. High turnover rates have caused greatly increased stress for existing CCO employees . Tells you they don't focus on numbers, but it is 100% about the numbers and with the behavioral based models there is no target ""number"", it is always moving. If you get a supervisor you don't work well with, it will have a major impact in your day to day and what you get coached on."

Depending on your department you could have a ton of leave and no ability to take even a single day off for months
With 14,000 call center employees to pick from in an extremely competitive environment, it is virtually impossible to get promoted for a professional back-office position from the call center. Back-offices prefer to promote from within back office or from without

Ludicrously outdated tools and software

Imagine a junior manager whose focus points are her serial lawsuits against her HOA and appearing busy in a way that deflects any attention from executive leadership. Combine this with a head design manager too demoralized by years of corporate status quo to deal with this situation, or for that matter any of our others.

Junior manager fails to understand basic design terms and principles from design systems to process to mobile design. She will chastise a designer for missing a weekly check-in with nasty emails, while the bulk of her own time is spent discussing her endless issues with the team’s project manager, a third component of leadership who is more on the ball than either manager - but ironically has almost literally no responsibilities or function beyond taking in design tickets occasionally and being the sounding board for junior manager’s unrelenting self-created dramatics. 

Executive leadership has no experience in the design or for that matter digital. Tools are antiquated and out of sync with reality outside the company, and the team has no say. Weekly team meetings continue to be cancelled due to lack of interest. If held, they are a perfunctory check-in at best and at worst a time for junior manager to share personal anecdotes. Coding of design system, or for that matter anything else, is glacial and poorly executed."

Normally there is a group/ team chat that you can interact with if you need advice or help with a call.,"HR is hard to get ahold of and often just lead you in a circle. back office groups are the worst to deal with as they are known to hang up on you, be rude, not listen completely to what you say, or even ignore you entirely. if you are in loans you WILL call the loan review team and title assist regularly and it can be very disheartening, and annoying.

Otherwise, skip working here OR only work here as a stepping stone to a new career. After a while, the pay didn't seem fair.","Everything. The campus is nice, but I wish more money would be spent on investing in their employees' paychecks and knowledge of the industry. Lackluster training was a big reason why I left, moving around to different sections of mortgage in the same job title, but with a different role. While being there for less than a year, I was a loan officer, a processor, a mortgage support assistant (MSA), and felt like I needed to be my own manager at times without managerial pay. People would come to me with questions because our MPS or management would judge us for needing help. When asking for overtime, because it's needed here and believe me, you'll be begging to be allowed overtime hours, they will tell you you're only allowed 5 and you need to justify why you need more hours, while you're trying to keep up an unreasonable 80-100 loan pipeline, as an LO1. They tell you an LO1 typically carries about 50-60 loans, but that isn't true. You get more than that, sometimes double, and when you're stressed out they say ""it's okay not to feel okay :)"". For the amount of stress on employees, we should be paid much more. $20/hour doesn't cut it. When you ask for a raise, they deny you before you plead a case.

They almost fired me for missing work due to pregnancy complications even with notes from my doctors and the hospital. I had to get special written permission from my obgyn to allow me more time to use the restroom than a “normal” person. One of my coworkers on my team was refused permission to leave to pick up her 3 year old from school who was vomiting. She was a single mom with no one else to get her daughter.

The only reason I lost any was due to promotions for me or the supervisor. Aside from one case when a supervisor switched shifts.

Management does not know what they want for process improvement and cannot provide any cohesive vision to organization
Organization mostly hiring contractors and not requiring any sort of long-term knowledge transfer (documentation, training, etc) which will cause disaster in a few years

I processed refinances over a year old. Poor management overall. I worked 70 hours a week. On paper it was great money, but it was blood money as my entire life was processing. Until they get their management and volume under control, I would not recommend Navy Federal mortgage"
691,,Some positions are decent some not,2020-11-24,3.0,Delinquency Control Counselor IV,Non member facing positions are great in terms of work-life balance,"If you are in a member facing position, work life-balance is lousy, every minute of your work day and every move you make is completely tracked, down to the amount of time you spend in the bathroom. I understand the benefit of monitoring employee productivity, but too much of anything can be a bad thing. When supervisors are reprimanding employees for going a minute over their allotted personal/bathroom time, you have definitely reached the point of 'too much'. Some positions are not compensated fairly, and a lot of the performance based raises, awards, and bonus pay outs are very political. Some of the supervisors and assistant supervisors are only in their positions because they have made friends with their superiors, causing issues down the pyramid because you end up with incompetent direct leadership."

695,,Great place to work!,2020-11-18,5.0,N/A,Fantastic company focused on their members and their employees.,I was unchallenged and tasks were repetitive.
696,,I wouldn’t wish working here on my worst enemy,2020-11-18,1.0,MSR Mentor,"Working from home, yearly bonus.","I worked here for 4 years and was continuously led to believe advancement was “right around the corner.” Except, it never was. I had 12 supervisors in my time there and though they claim they have your best interests in mind during each transition, it’s simply not true. You have to start from the bottom each and every time to prove yourself. I had 4 exceeds expectations competency ratings (given yearly) as well as 2 back to back Sustained Superior Performance awards, all while mentoring multiple teams and stepping in to work overtime upon request - all to never even be granted interviews for available positions. Meanwhile I watched my peers, many of which younger and less qualified, get promoted over me time and time again. 

In 2020 I did not have a single holiday off though I never signed up to work a single one. In other words, if you have certain phone skills that they do not have enough of (Advanced Account Services) you will almost always be guaranteed to work. Talk about work life balance, right? 

Supervisors are like professional cheerleaders. Many times they have no idea what is going on and are just forced to give the half-thought information they’ve been given by upper management. Most of the time it’s a ready, fire, aim approach. There are daily changes which you are given no time to actually comprehend, but reprimanded in the event you make a mistake. In my four years there I think I actually had time to read 10% of the emails I received. It’s just a constant grind of endless phone calls for 8 hours a day. Oh, and if a phone call takes you over your break or meal time? That counts against you. I often referred to my phone as a baby monitor because that’s what it feels like. Every aspect of your day is measured as a data point and everything is micro-managed.

I have worked many places in my life but this was by far the biggest bait and switch I have ever witnessed. They preach that they care about their employees, but they have fished the talent pool dry in Escambia County. You’re just another butt in the seat. The only thing they REALLY care about is hanging that 100 best places to work sign out on the front lawn of campus. My experience is one that is, unfortunately, shared by many. Since quitting NFCU, I have regained a sense of being. Working there was one of the worst periods of time in my entire life and I have never felt more mentally strained. I would not wish working here on my worst enemy."

Of course, promotions only come from knowing someone. 
There are a lot of people with Napoleon complexes. I have seen blatant ageism, racist and sexist behavior. I have seen adults crying in the restroom from inhumane demands, never seeing their spouses or children, and never being good enough. I am not specifically speaking about women, either. 
If someone doesn’t like you, you are screwed. I have had lies written on evaluations. (And if you try to argue, you will be stuck in your job forever- seen as a troublemaker) I have seen others who were written up and fired over lies. And, going to Employee Relations is like talking to a wall. They work for Navy Federal and if there is an issue reported to them, they will pretend to be your friend and then stab you in the back to ensure you are to blame for all issues reported instead of the company or management. They should all work for the CIA- they would make great spies. 
Management knows they are safe to belittle and bully employees until they quit. And once they are beaten down, they get fired for being useless. 
They treat employees like crap and use fear to control.
I would rather work in actual hell than be employed there. I am so looking forward to retirement."

It is very very structured and during my time they did relax on the ""numbers"" but every month you do sit with a manager one on one and discuss your performance from the previous month. Every call of course is monitored and there is a quality service department that also monitors your calls every month and provides you feed back. Depending on this quality service rep, they will make or break your job. That department dose not all provide feedback the same by any means. Reason for leaving was due to the unfairness in the quality service department and how much it had an affect on moving up in company.

The other trainers were just basically good at processing but know nothing about the mortgage industry. If you ask them an industry question that isn’t located within their policies of how to process, they won’t know the answer. Low wages compared to the rest of the industry. Processors at other companies not only receive hourly wages but monthly bonuses. Navy Federal offers low hourly wage, at least for the Greater Pensacola Operations campus and does not have monthly bonuses. The annual PIP in addition to your hourly wage is still less than the industry standard’s salary. There are too many new “leaders” who have no idea how to supervise their own team. There were so many new processing teams that were created that not only had a newly promoted duly but also a newly promoted senior. This is a disastrous combination. Even the assistant manager was newly promoted. They expect mandatory overtime even mandatory overtime to assist other departments but makes it difficult to take time off even though your time is sacrificed for the company with overtime"

She often pitted employees against each other and seemed to tell half-truths (or even full-out lies) to cause drama. On a personal note, she accused me several times of ""getting around the office"" because I (a female) would occasionally carpool with my coworker (a male) to work since we lived several blocks away from one another. (But interestingly, never brought this up to my male coworker.) She also often criticized my hair. Sometimes she would tell me to wear it in a ponytail because it made me look more professional, but then one day I wore it in a ponytail and she told me it made me look too young and reprimanded me."

It has pushed me to the breaking point. They will say that they want you to develop yourself and your soft skills, that they don't coach to numbers- they absolutely do. They look at your handle time, how long you spend inbetween calls, you check your email, bathroom breaks, meeting times, everything. You're every action is recorded and reviewed regularly.

Health insurance has always been a good policy.","I continue to be appalled at the thuggish mentality of management in the Call Center. Employees get promoted in the Call Center to become management if they have an appalling thick-skulled mentality. In a recent meeting in Winchester, a woman who would eventually get promoted to an upper level management position, came to a lunch and learn to address a group of 20 employees on upcoming changes. Throughout the 45-minute meeting, she continuously did not conjugate verbs correctly. One of the incorrect things she continued to say several times throughout the meeting was, ""What I have saw is ..."" Correct English grammar would be ""What I have seen is ..."" I was appalled and wanted to put my hands over my ears and say, ""Stop! Learn how to speak English correctly, please!"" That woman was just promoted to an upper level management position. In a recent email, someone in management said, ""Your efforts have not went unnoticed""!!! Correct English grammar would have been, ""Your efforts have not gone unnoticed""! Most of the training bytes and materials have misspellings. I send the examples of misspellings to my supervisor, which are ignored and are not acknowledged. This is a Fortune 100 company in title only because of the good health insurance. In so many other aspects, this company does not deserve to be on the Fortune 100 list. I am absolutely appalled that a woman who cannot even conjugate verbs correctly could get promoted to upper management, which re-enforces my theory that NFCU doesn't want the best and the brightest. They want to dumb down and dull employees into a numbing dullness. Why would a woman be promoted to upper level management in the Call Center who cannot conjugate verbs correctly repeatedly? This is so frightening for someone like myself who felt I had so much to offer a company and five years later my career has gone nowhere."

The mortgage department is extremely understaffed and has been that way for the last year. In addition to the understaffing, mortgage production has turned into a contact center in which it takes working 15 hours a day to handle a 40 loan pipeline in purchase. Refi processors are handling well over a 100 loans. More tenured employees have been lost due to the extreme stress.

You’re there what feels like all day and Saturday’s too. One Saturday off is considered “good.” Branch jobs are lowest of the low. You have to know everything about everything and even when you do you still aren’t good enough. Promotions? Those happen is you throw your other team mates under the bus or suck up to the managers. If you voice your concerns or opinions about anything, even why you think it’s raining outside, it goes no where. Managers are not working the floor yet have so much input when your goals are lacking. Some employees are extremely lazy and avoid helping members but then end up getting praised by leadership. Drama drama drama. CORONA VIRUS really shows the truth of the Navy Federal Way. Yes, we are essential. That being said..... It took weeks before they closed our lobby to members and some branches are still assisting members in their lobbies. The branch employees who are unable to telework have been forced to use their leave hours since they can’t come into work. Teleworking is simply not an option. Talk about not supporting your people. Oh but you can go 80 negative on leave so you can still be paid.... Gee thanks. Now I’ll work another 10 years to make up for the negative leave I had to take to be paid because I had to stay home. Navy Federal is exhausting. Members are entitled. The hold policy on checks has changed 1,306 times in the past few years causing MSR’s unnecessary stress and argumentative members. Pay is decent but I swear you could be here 10 years and not be paid enough for it. I’m interested to see where Nfcu stands on Forbes list coming up next. This is such a disgrace."

We knew for several months this was coming and people still work on campus while businesses all over the country are sending people home with the ability to telework or with additional paid leave instead of asking to exhaust your sick and vacation leave.  Then Tuesday, a fellow worker was in the news for presumptive positive test for the virus and they still have us working and still telling us to exhaust our leave bank if we get sick (even though its obvious that exposure cannot be ruled out on campus) when they know we were put at risk as this individual has been in contact with more than just their teammates....but common areas, bathrooms, elevators  etc.  And then we are told they prioritize some employees to get the equipment early leaving us to wonder what measurement tool they are using to decide whose health is more important that others.  For they are not being asked to exhaust their leave like those that the company made the decision not to provide equipment to at this moment.

They lure you in with a lower salary/position stating your PIP will more than make up for the difference.   ISD middle management is a joke, they have no formal management experience.

Management will fault you for not meeting KPIs and SLAs when volume is incredibly high and we're unable to keep (while often working mandatory overtime). Changes are slow to come to fruition and staffing has been an issue in the past due to high volume and what I mentioned.

903,,Decent place to work,2019-09-20,3.0,Collections Specialist,"Awesome benefits & insurance  and on campus benefits are even better.  Decent 401k; bonus program,  and company paid cash retirement (If the pay was better, thus the matching higher, I would be more excited).  Pay is nothing great unless you are in management or a specialized area.  It seems that leadership understands that most of the jobs are terrible desk/ computer/ phone jobs and do their best to keep you engaged and happy.  Good tuition assistance and on site partnerships with local schools.","Unless you have a lot of experience in a specialized area; expect to start on the bottom (ie collections, member services or mortgage processor).  Very competitive due to so much recent growth and large influx of new hires all looking to promote.  Many managers and supervisors are very young and inexperienced.  Very PC corporate culture.  Expect to work a lot of overtime to be competitive.  Pay is regional, you may be paid significantly less depending on where you live.  Company training is expected (not job specific but in-house development) and annoyingly basic.  Most entry jobs are numbers driven and performance reviews are not based off any real potential of the employee (again, expect to work overtime to keep numbers up).  They say that they encourage work-life balance but it’s impossible to take time off without affecting your production goals.  Also, there are several blackout days for vacation every year and you have to compete with fellow employees to get the time off that you want."

When I first started they gave you time for personal development which has now been cut.

Rampant nepotism in Vienna and Pensacola with people Hiring/recommending all of their friends and family to work there.   Inappropriate  sexual relationships between management/executive staff and direct reports are commonplace.  Poor and/or delayed leadership training leaves front line leaders making bad decisions that are “passed down” from their reporting structure.  Promoting people internally too quickly unprepared to be mentoring others on leadership when they themselves are not effective in role promotes cyclical toxic behavior.  Overlooking these concerns reinforces (best case) poor or (worth cause) unethical decision making.  Continued growth allows senior leaders to turn a blind eye to many obvious problems.   Inconsistent across departments/sites/etc. causing many valid employee complaints. “Our members are the mission” is an almost comical tag line since the majority of our 18,000+ employees have no idea what our mission, vision, or values are.  In my time with the company, I can only count on one hand the number of leaders who ever really talked about them.  - These people were described as “passionate” or “outside of the box thinkers.”"

The company relies largely on archaic, fragile, and unintuitive systems. The fact that we still use Lotus Notes for email and calendar management speaks volumes alone. Business units and departments are very siloed with communication barriers and no collaboration. In particular, employees below manager level (at least in my department) are forbidden from emailing senior leaders/managers without permission from our senior management. Getting promoted or moving to other internal positions is a matter of who you know and how well you know them.

Working remotely/from home is “frowned upon” across the organization, even though we have the means to do so, because they “want to see us working.” This largely comes from CEO Cutler Dawson’s personal vendetta against working from home. Coming from another organization that freely allowed working from home, especially in the D.C. metro area with its horrible traffic and severe winter weather, this has been a major setback for me.

Management, at least in Marketing and Communications, frequently gives contradictory, bizarre, and even threatening feedback. You could be told that you are exceeding expectations one day and on thin ice the next. Managers have the ability to appoint non-management team members to weigh in on individual performance reviews, a system that can be seriously abused with affects to our compensation and bonuses. CEO Cutler Dawson puts up a pleasant and jovial front, but he is also known to outright fire employees who contest any of the issues discussed in this review."

If you're in the right team then the atmosphere is fantastic
Pay is ok for a credit union, though often times pay for many positions are much higher at other non credit union banks. Many people often leave due to this. The best way to get higher pay is leaving and then returning 2 years later. Many employees have done this as well since they end up getting more than regular performance raises would bring in.","Sadly some departments have become too concerned with numbers only. Because of this, micro-management has occurred a lot. Often if an employee speaks up in a proper way, they get reprimanded, removed from current team and put somewhere else, or terminated. Often times, work that has a HUGE impact on the credit union is not performed correctly. Then when it is discovered by an employee, upper management sweeps it under the rug. This is a HUGE concern on many levels. Compliance levels especially. I've witnessed too many people let go because they spoke up to do the right thing and to follow the policy NFCU has established. If this continues I feel its a matter of time before NCUA catches on. Favoritism plays a huge role in some people chosen as management. Often times these people have no idea how to run or manage a team. Yet, they seem to just climb higher and higher. Just  cause someone is good at their job, doesn't mean they will be a good leader.  *****If you are lucky enough to be in a department that doesn't have micro-management and isn't number focused, NFCU can be fantastic place to work at. If you do apply, make sure you find out if your department works on KPI or not. I recommend any Business Analyst position, anything in ISD, Marketing or InfoSec****"

Depending on the position, it can feel like you’re being underpaid for the amount of things you have to deal with daily at work. Upper management is not supportive. No work life balance. No real opportunities for growth. They believe in favoritism, only way to move up. With minorities, it almost feels like they have to put in double the work to prove their position just because of the person they’re, even when great performance is obvious.

Work life balance is possible with the right team, however, I’ve seen too many people come into work extremely sick because you’re only allowed so many personal days before you get in trouble for using your sick leave. Even if you have it available you’re penalized for using it more than a certain amount of times. When I first started I always heard of how it’s a revolving door company which is true to a certain extent. There are many that have been with the company for many, many years while many that joined the company were quick to transfer due to office morale.

If you start working through a contractor, you will start with good Pay (though it will disappear if you need to pay for benefits).  Everyone’s goal is that you make it through the first 6-12 months of extreme stress and the ‘hazing’ period as a contractor, as you feel like an outsider, then if you are “lucky” you get to go “perm”. That’s when they hit you with the pay cut. Yep that’s right! They drop your pay. So you will leave work Friday making one amount, then show up on Monday doing the same job for less money. That’s if you make it through the childish ostracizing. There is a definite disconnect between Navy Federal employees and Aerotek employees. Many of Navy Federal employees definitely seem to have a chip on their shoulder and it can make you feel like an outcast second class citizen if you let it. Everybody proudly and openly states “If you wanna become perm, it’s about who you know, not what you know”. 
It seems like they are so anxious to grow, that they rush to promote supervisors, but they seem to promote the loudest in the group rather than the  most competent for the job. Unfortunately the power is often mishandled and misused. This creates a revolving door of employee turnover at a rate of which I have never seen. Very unfortunate. It could be a great place to work if handled differently."

This could not be further from the truth. We are tethered to small desks in a cube farm with angry, belligerent members calling in back-to-back calls. Managers are stats-driven and no level of work effort is good enough for them - they just set higher expectations. Terrifying for me to have been lured and conned into accepting this job because I have much higher level of work experience and licenses within the financial industry, which means nothing to anyone on any level at Navy Federal. I was lead to believe career path would be an easy process but, in reality, is hopeless and impossible. Over 950 employees are Member Services Representatives and it is nearly impossible to ever get out of the Contact Center. Resembles a sweat shop but in a Call Center environment. They just implemented changes that allow employees to go to the bathroom other than when all breaks are pre-scheduled, however, by not taking a break when scheduled, it ruins adherence stats on how closely the employee stayed on schedule fenvironment. Quality control is like death by 1,000 cuts. They never find positive things to say - they always criticize. A deplorable oppressive, suppressive and depressing environment."

1206,,"Weird Culture, good pay if you land on right team",2017-09-12,3.0,Business Operations Analyst,"It’s a pretty easy place to work if you land in the right situation.  Typically you won’t have to work more than 40 hrs a week, unless you land in IT or some systems related role which requires being online or on call when systems go down, there is maintenance, etc.  The benefits are good…full gym on site, 7% 401k match, decent amount of vacation and sick leave that ramps up after 3 years of service.  If you get a good performance review, due to the bonus structure, your compensation can be very good.  The mortgage discount can be very good.  However, base salary tends to pay slightly less compared to other similar companies.  It’s a big company, so its very easy to move around and try new jobs (especially because preference is given to internal hires vs. external hires).  Casual dress code on Friday is a plus, though it really could be extended to the full week for most positions.","There’s a very strange culture that borders on nepotism.  Everyone in the building has a family member or spouse that works there.  And because the company grew so fast, there are a lot of people in managerial positions that don’t have the skills or knowledge required for their position.  They got the role simply based off of seniority.  These people also tend to hire more unqualified people to work underneath them, so the company is falling into a cycle of bad hires.  So it sort of becomes a “who you know” situation when it comes to promotions. Compensation is highly dependent on bonus, which gives managers a lot of power over their employees.  If you land in a bad situation, it can negatively affect your compensation for a year.
As for career development, it can be hard to develop marketable skills with the tools/software that Navy uses.  I have lobbied for Navy Federal to use tools/software that are more common in the marketplace, but Navy Federal is so behind the curve when it comes to technology that I would be shot down.  And there’s only so much you can learn from Lynda.com (free for Navy Fed employees).  In addition, the data infrastructure is horrendous.  Massive growth over the past 10 years has created an incredibly fractured database system.  Third party data tools are common, as they are easier to use than actually fixing the root problem.  Efficiency has been ignored at the company because the massive growth is making the company look so good.  In turn, senior leadership have sought to “create empires”, hiring just for the sake of making themselves more powerful in terms of number of reports they have.
Parking is a huge problem, though it has gotten better with the opening of the new parking garage.  There are no telework options, except for some key roles in IT.  Everyone is required to be in the office 5 days a week, which is absolutely absurd in this day and age.  Especially in the DC metro area, with its ridiculous traffic.  Sick Leave and Vacation are in separate buckets, would rather have as single bank of leave.  401k match doesn’t vest for 2 years.  The CEO puts on a good public face, but says some things to employees that are downright offensive."

However, if you have a military background, just move to Pensacola and you will find a great career at Navy Federal. Otherwise, be prepared to spend years as an entry-level MSR. Depending on your management, you may have to prepare yourself to take verbal abuse from members while your manage---uh, sorry, ""leader"" will take the member's side without a second thought. It's all about member service! The members are very entitled and abrasive as a result, so, enjoy calming down cranky man-children that are mad they have to wait 2 business days to withdraw their $50,000.00 check. Constant fraud and fake members trying to scam you. Oh, and don't mind your work and break schedule. It was not uncommon at all to go to lunch at 3 or 4 in the afternoon, and to stay much later than your assigned time because management won't turn away members.  So much was made about ""personal sacrifices"" and ""being a servant"" - well, you could sacrifice your basic needs, come in everyday early and stay late, know your job inside and out, do everything you can to make your members happy, work every Saturday for months at a time, volunteer off the clock for functions, and still not be a good enough for a piddly little promotion.

Empowerment is supposed to be at all levels, taking accountability and responsibility for actions and decisions in the gray areas of policies and procedures.

Whether it is an MSR making a decision for member service, a supervisor making a decision on returning fees, or a manager making a decision for  disciplinary action, if it's not agreed upon at other levels, then there is disciplinary action and retribution that can lead to termination.  I have been strong armed to terminate employees for behaviors that did not warrant the action.  I have been forced to keep employees whose actions absolutely warranted termination.   There is a unspoken motto that you can document a person up to the highest award and out the door, depending on how others perceived that person.   There is so much grey area in all of the policies and procedures, with the intention of empowerment.  However at the end of the day the same actions and behaviors from one person at one location would be allowed, at another location they would be fired.

No benefits 
Terrible Management
Extremely low pay
Unfair treatment 
Micromanaging

First and foremost I wanna say that I have never had a job that has treated me worse in my whole life. Everything started out well with a cubicle and a manageable amount of work. Then a months or so in they moved me into a makeshift desk where they kept the printer, desk was 1/3 the size of the small cube I had before. There were no drawers provided, no scanners to file papers, a nice big pillar within grabbing distance taking up what little space I had, and people would walk through my ""desk"" to go down the isle which was very distracting. Manager did not care about complaints regarding this. The amount of work I was assigned was ridiculous, I would ask other interns what they did and it was 1/5 the amount of work. Other employees in my team who didn't (no offense to them I understand coming here from another country) speak proper English or have a degree like myself were doing less work than me. Not a lot less work but much easier work which wouldn't be bad but they were considered REAL employees who got benefits and paid more than my $11/hour, way more. On a side note I've had people ask me how much I get paid that work for the company and they laughed right in my face. I was an intern which meant I was allowed to work less hours than a normal employee because of school, well I took about 8 hours off a week, and my manager didn't lower any of my assigned workload even a slight bit. She simply said ""oh the intern before you did the same amount of work when going to school"" which would of been a reasonable statement if it wasn't for the fact that in our meetings they showed stats that the amount of claims that came in per month on average increase from 4000 to 7000 from the pervious year. The previous year that that intern worked, was a almost 2:1 difference. Oh and he actually had a desk fit for a normal human as well as the rest of the interns that worked there. Honestly I felt singled out for no reason, I was nothing but professional with management and had no complaints about my behavior that may have caused me to have gotten on someone's bad side. There are more things I could but that would probably make this review to long to even bother reading, which heck it could already be. I was miserable every minute of the day I was there, but I was all for one ultimate goal, to be a employee at Navy Federal Credit Union. Finally the day came where I got my opportunity, I had applied for two positions and had two interviews schedule for Friday for those positions. I went out and bought a suit, got a haircut, and practiced more hours in the mirror than I could count. I came in that Friday turning heads, I didn't sleep the night before I was so excited and just kept going over possible interview questions. I came in that Friday with a meeting schedule with my manager that she strangely had scheduled for the same time as my first interview that she refused to change. So I had to cancel one of my two interviews but I was still excited. Everyone in the office wished me good luck as well as offered advice and was happy for me(except my manager). Well I headed off to the meeting with my manager thinking only of my interview afterwords. Well to put it short I was FIRED on that day. The reason was being late. Now to be honest yes I was late. My manager was extremely strict with the time you are allowed to clock in 7:58-8:04 to be exact actually. A 6 minute time frame which no other managers that I heard of instilled as well. Well it was midterms at school and I believe I had been late a few times the last couple weeks. To be precise I believe the last three times were 5 minutes, 2 minutes, and 1 minute late to clock in. I had a 1 hour 15 minute drive to work in a extremely traffic filled route to work. Yes it is my fault and I understand that I did due to me not wanting to be there any longer than I had to be I didn't show up 30 minutes early like she suggested. Oh and you can't clock in before 7:58 so that would a unpaid 28 minutes to ""go grab a coffee"" as she suggested. Well anyways despite the fact that other employees of hers would arrive 2 hours late due to oversleeping or call in sick multiple times a week(BTW SHE MARKED MY SICK DAYS (3 to be precise) AS DAYS I WAS TARDY) I was fired. Well you're probably thinking that it's okay because I still have a chance at those two interviews? No, I was unhirable after termination apparently. And was the rumor around the office that our manager hated when people left her department and did everything she could to hold you back? Yes. But yeah that's my story, props to you for reading up till this far if you did. I hung my head and was escorted out of the building with my little box of stuff. If you're applying or have an interview you'll most likely have a great job there that you'll retire too, but be warned if you're a intern."

Lastly, even though I don't work there anymore I can honestly say that the experience of working at NFCU paid positive dividends to my future career.","There was unfortunately one big con, and it was the reason I had to leave:  career advancement was completely non-existent.  Don't get me wrong I love NFCU and still have all my accounts there.  I will definitely stay a member for life.  But I couldn't just do the same job forever.  At some point I needed to do more with my career and it was simply impossible for me to make headway towards that goal with NFCU.  I've seen this same criticism in other reviews and it's real.  Personally I don't think its the product of anything malicious but it is a bug in what is otherwise a great place to work.  Whatever role they hire you for be prepared to stay stuck there for the entirety of your employment."

Management thinks they can do no wrong and displays a belief that you are very lucky to have a job here.   The non profit company is now going through growing pains and is starting to cut corners.  They have openly talked about this in town hall meetings.  Cutting down training programs and expecting more for less looks like the future for Navy Federal Employees.

I understand the policy with cell phones ie no texting, out of sight, no phone calls, etc.  I follow this policy more than anyone.  Unfortunately, I would see my Supervisor texting on the cell phone and/or looking up something when I would go to my Supervisor's desk.  This happens quite frequently.  I would also see the Assistant Manager and Manager with what looked like a personal cell phone while walking around.  At times, I would see them texting.  If it is an NFCU cellphone and the texting is for NFCU business, that is fine.

During one occasion, the SVP was talking with a fellow MSR about his house remodifications for close to 30 minutes.  Another supervisor was standing in front of me listening to the conversation for a fair amount of time.  I did say Hello to both.  The SVP even pulled out the personal cell phone, looked up an item regarding tile replacement, and mentioned that to the MSR.  Since our business unit does not involve house repairs, this 30 minute time block was not NFCU business.  During our working hours, we are supposed to be working on NFCU matters.  We should not be talking about house repairs for 30 minutes, college football, March Madness, etc.  I see actions such as this more often than I should."

- cafeteria on site
- PIP, which is your yearly bonus
- affordable benefits - the cost of benefits has increased only one time in the past decade; the dental coverage has the highest annual max I have ever seen
- diversity! the HQ location seems to have a good mix of different cultures and ethnicities
- the CEO is very approachable and cares about the people in the company","- the parking is HORRENDOUS (and this is an understatement)... the parking deck will be full at 8:10 AM every morning. So if your shift starts after that time, you are stuck parking at a church nearby and waiting for a shuttle... 
- some of the supervisors in the collections unit are not quite the type of people that should be in a leadership role. they pride themselves on NOT patting you on the back for a job well done BUT picking you apart when you mess up. they insist that this builds character and helps you be better. In reality, it just makes you wonder what you are doing with your life... If appropriate people were chosen to be supervisors, this job itself would be awesome, even in collections... 
- training is terrible... you will leave training confused and not knowing much more than you did when you began... training is done virtually via webcam... you are watching a training class in pensacola, FL... they won't hire actual trainers at the HQ building because the cost is too high... its sad because then you, the representative, are the one that is scolded when you don't know how to do your job..."

Their resources are far too complicated to navigate to get the job done. You are expected to stay at your desk answering back to back calls. Your time is tracked and the expectations are unrealistic. The stress that comes with the job is off the charts. I seriously contemplated going on anti anxiety meds for the first time in my life.
1290,,The job was not what they said it would be,2017-02-24,2.0,Account Service Representative,"The best reasons to work with Navy Federal are the outstanding benefits package, and the friends you make.","The downsides to working for Navy Federal are many: 
-They have grown so quickly that the back offices are lacking in the appropriate work force to complete requests.
-They have changed their standards as far as training new MSR's so a lot of unnecessary mistakes are occurring which just makes it harder on the MSR that is receiving the second call from the member.
-They do not have clearly defined goals or achievement markers for you to hit so you know when you are on the path to advancement. It's all subjective to who you have as a supervisor. If you have a great supervisor that helps push you, then you will move up as an MSR 2 or 3, but if you have a lazy supervisor who is there for themselves and has little to no useful contact with their MSR's - then you will just stay MSR 1 forever. 
-Once again, they have grown so fast that the expectations they place on MSR's to take a 100 or more calls a day with little to no break in between is unrealistic. 
-It is nearly impossible to advance within the company anymore. Because of the increase in the workforce to handle the new membership level, they no longer post positions for other dept's within the call center. They used to post spots in other skills, now they just fill them when they are hiring new employees. If you can't move to another department to gain more skills, you have little to no chance at hiring into a back office dept because you lack diversity. However, to be fair, if you have a spotless attendance record, an Exceeds personal performance review, and you are a fantastic MSR..you might get hired. 
-They tell everyone they need to take learning and development classes. But, they either don't have classes that relevant, or if they do it is a limited class and they are all filled up. If you manage to be one of the lucky ones to get into the class, you can be pretty sure that workforce management will deny it because they can't afford to have you off the phones based on the projected call volume for that day."

Another big pro is that NFCU recently released teleworking opportunities for employees who meet certain criteria.

Training is limited and 'as you go'.  You're told to take your time and ask for assistance, but this is counted against you. Scrutiny is high and morale is low.  I worked and sat at one desk over a year and only met two people near me and only because they were in my team.  Parking is terrible, expect a shuttle ride from a parking lot 10-15 miles away or if you’re lucky a 10-15 minute walk. Micromanagement down to every second. This is not just an exaggeration.  Even if all your numbers are met you will never be good enough. No life and/or work balance.  Vacation must be planned six months in advance.  Even if you plan ahead of time, getting time approved is nearly impossible.  Sick time is non-existence and not allowed within the culture.  Even though my supervisor saw me extremely sick and made the effort to show, I was given a formal warning for missing one day of work.

It can be extremely overwhelming. It is difficult to get the hours you would like to work, as well as getting vacation approved.

Unfortunately, it didn’t work out for me, and I’d like to use this opportunity to tell you why.  Please don’t take what I’m writing as complaining or being negative, as that’s actually the furthest thing from the truth.  I’m writing this because I care.  I’m writing this as constructive criticism and I’m putting it all out there, as honestly as I can, to help Navy Federal become a better place.  I truly care about many of the friends and coworkers I left behind.  Many of these people will remain in my life for years to come and it’s with the best interest of the organization that I write this.

What I mention below is going to paint ISD (the Navy Federal Information Services Department) with a large brush.  While there are exceptions to the list below, the vast majority of what I’m saying applies to ISD leadership across the board.

ISD has ineffective leadership
The leadership in ISD is either missing, rendered ineffective, or completely misguided.  At every step of the way ISD management can only be considered amateur. At no time is there any confidence that the management does any sort of planning, has any enterprise technical standards or goals, or does anything other than react to complaints of the business.  Preemptively working with the business to identify their needs ahead of time in a strategic manner must be done in order to gain the confidence, support, and respect of the business.  The trends that are being followed are just that -- those of followers, not leaders.  There is no innovative, out of the box, or otherwise creative thinking going on.  Barring all that, there is no technical, logical, or practical thinking or leadership being done in any way that results in effective procedure, policy, or process.  No one in executive ISD leadership has had the role they are in at a previous company, nor have they held that position in a company remotely our size.  This is evident by their action and inaction and the overall ineffectiveness of ISD as a whole.  Many of the BRMs are able to salvage the complete failure of their bosses by working directly with the business units, however, the technical debt that ISD has incurred over the years has built up to almost an unsustainable amount as a result of failed management.  This technical debt manifests itself in both overworked IT staff and a complete loss of faith in ISD by many business units.

ISD has no vision
The introduction of NextSteps/ITIL has brought about a mindset of siloed empires built on top of Service Owners, Service Managers, and Resource Managers.  This top-heavy, expensive suite of middle management does nothing to increase collaboration and ownership of the final product delivered by ISD, but instead encourages a myopic and otherwise small worldview of the IT services we provide.  This mindset has compartmentalized the IT infrastructure to the point where a sense of ownership and problem solving has all but disappeared from the organization, with teams reluctant and unsure how to step across boundaries and borders to see end-to-end improvement of delivered IT services.  The introduction of “OneISD” is in itself also fool hearted, as not only does it segregate ISD from the rest of the Credit Union (shouldn’t we be “OneNavyFederal”?) but it is impossible to attain without the current culture of silos and finger pointing being replaced.  While the hope of a collaborative team of IT professionals who all work toward a common goal is admirable and the right direction, without a plan on how to implement said goal and a budget to do yet another organizational restructuring, it’s as naive as attempting to build a house without blueprints.  Such things do not just happen on their own, but one must become the change they wish to see.  An organization that is designed as independent parts does not simply mesh without realigning and restructuring the parts in place.

Retaliation in the workplace
When an employee becomes targeted by management, they are often held to a different standard as long as the eye of management is focused upon them.  I’ve seen on several occasions an employee that has been unjustly the target of management oversight to the point where the employee must either take the abuse, go to Employee Relations with hope that ER can be of assistance, or must leave the company.  The targeted employee in these cases has become the focus because of either questioning a policy, underperforming due to lack of training/being hired for a different skill set, or because someone in a position over the manager has expressed a dislike for that employee.  In all cases, the added focus was not done in a fair and just manner. Management used its position to intimidate the employee rather than hold a mature and professional dialogue with the employee in an attempt to understand the employee’s position and come to a joint resolution.

A class system and cronyism in action
Managers are treated as a separate and higher class than regular employees.  Not only are they given assigned parking spaces (when parking isn’t even an issue, such as Milton), they are given perks such as free baseball tickets, better equipment not offered to regular employees, access to organizational information that is relevant to all employees, and above all the joys of “Manager’s discretion” in regards to policy.  This translates directly to inconsistent treatment of employees across the various teams of ISD, some of which enjoy perks that others do not.  These managers regularly participate in cronyism, covering for and protecting each other to retain their positions of power and control that they hold most dear.  Internal promotions and job opportunities are not given to existing members of the team as a chance for growth, but instead given to managers from other groups, or people they know will “toe the line”, even though those people aren’t the best fit for improvement in the organization.  As the great George S. Patton once said, If everyone is thinking alike, then somebody isn’t thinking.  Those who think alike are held in higher regard than those who have actually solved these problems before and may offer a fresh or different approach.

Managers are incapable of measuring quality
I have seen over and over again that ISD managers lack the ability to determine a quality employee over an employee who is mediocre or brings little value to the organization.  What matters to ISD managers is not the technical ability of the engineer, how hard the engineer works, or what kind of support and leadership that engineer provides to other members of the team, but instead if the engineer is in his or her seat exactly on time and if they put in extra hours.  I’ve had this conversation with managers and they WANT to see people putting in extra hours.  As an engineer, if I have to work a lot of extra hours, that means I’m bad at my job.  If I can’t preemptively fix a problem before it happens the second or third time, then I’m not a very good engineer.  This mentality is insanity, as problems for which an engineer is called can mean a service interruption which has a very real impact to the business and our members.  Automation or some sort of process should be in place that prevents me, as an engineer, from being called at 1am to resolve the issue.  Systems will always experience failures, but if you are routinely putting in 5-10 extra hours in unplanned work each week, then you and your manager need to do some serious reevaluation of what it is being done on the team.  Staff level employees also have their time micromanaged as if they were hourly.  Comp time is not given out freely for extra time worked.  Myself and other engineers have had to work over 40 hours in a week and still take leave for time we missed due to sickness or appointments.

Disagreement is considered dissention
If an employee disagrees with a policy set in place by management, even if this disagreement is done in a professional and respectful manner, that disagreement is not considered constructive criticism or a matter of opinion, but is considered dissention and that employee is then labeled a troublemaker and disgruntled.  Open and honest conversation, which is organic and needed for any organization to grow, is frowned upon.  Too often the stick is used and not the carrot.  Employees should be incentivized and encouraged to ask questions and do a better job, instead they are just beaten back and told to fall in line, even when that line leads right off the cliff.

A culture of complacency
Management and leadership is not actually concerned about improving the services ISD provides, but instead they’re concerned about playing political games, furthering their individual careers, and participating in acts of self-promotion while retaining and building their empire.  I spent countless hours helping my teammates so that our group as a whole could provide better service, and I was told by my management not to help those poor performing employees, that those teammates needed to fail, even if it was to the detriment of the team.  A failure in ISD is a failure to the business and a failure to the Credit Union as a whole.  That mentality is unacceptable, especially in our “leadership”.  Furthermore, because accurate reviews are not given out at PAR time, employees learn quickly that it doesn’t matter how hard they work, who is getting the Exceeds Expectations review has for the most part already been decided, so anything they do above and beyond is wasted effort and wasted stress on their part.

The review system is broken
ISD employees are not allowed to get fair reviews because there is a quota on the number of Exceeds Expectations that can be given out at review time.  Many employees who deserve better reviews are given Meets Expectations so that the chosen select few will receive their Exceeds Expectations.  This is all because the review is tied to PIP, and because of this, ISD management is literally taking thousands and tens of thousands of dollars away from deserving employees and giving it to their favorite employees.  I received the worst review of my professional career here, simply because of a broken review system.  The same manager who gave me this mediocre review selected me Service Manager a year later, after I left his team and he wanted me back.  Clearly I must have exceeded expectations, though my PAR and my PIP did not reflect that at all.

PIP is broken
The financial gap between a Meets Expectation and an Exceeds Expectation is far too great, especially for the 80-82 grade level where I was situated.  If you want to give employees bonuses, give them bonuses that are not PIP.  PIP should be equally shared among everyone in the Credit Union who is eligible, much like things are done at USAA.  Higher performing employees can and should receive another bonus that is not PIP, but by freeing the review system from PIP, employees will be eligible to receive fair and accurate reviews.  The quota system that is currently in place is disingenuous at best and thievery at worst.

Compensation is broken
As previously noted, because of the broken review system, I only received a Meeting Expectations on my first PAR.  Nearly a year later, when I was selected for Service Manager, because of my low PAR, I was only offered a 5% pay increase for what would equate to a ten-fold increase in responsibility.  This pay increase actually still kept me lower paid than some of the lower-performing team members that would be reporting to me.  I regretfully had to turn down the position, not solely because of the money, but because I would have been in a position where change and improvement would have been pushed against me by my ISD leadership and the quality of my life would have been reduced dramatically.  I was not going to sacrifice my home life for a company that was not capable of appreciating my skillset or making the changes necessary to improve quality of service.

Telework and Compressed Work Schedule
Telework is always a touchy subject.  I will simply state that Navy Federal should not make claims that telework is an option when it is not available on a recurring basis.  I was told by my hiring manager that telework was indeed an option for me, as other members of the team at the time were working from home up to two days a week and we had full-time telework employees. This manager knew full well that I was not allowed to telework at GPO, but I was still sold that “benefit” at the time of hiring.  Furthermore, telework is an important Service Continuity issue.  In my role at a previous organization, we lost our data center and access to our office building due to terrorist attacks that came through the postal system.  From that point on it was clear and evident that being able to perform one’s job remotely was imperative to keeping the business running.  It became a requirement going forward that everyone in IT be able to perform their job remotely.  Employees were given the necessary equipment to do remote work and it was mandated that they work remotely at least one day a month to keep their equipment up to date and the process fresh in their mind.  At Navy Federal, compressed work schedules are implemented in a way that employees who work 4-10s cannot take either Friday or Monday off.  Since Fridays and Mondays are typically slower days, I can only assume that this is done for political reasons, to discourage CWS, or as a way to “prevent” those employees who have the ability to take CWS from having three day weekends.

Unprofessional work environment (GPO)
The desk and work environment at GPO is insulting and unprofessional for an IT organization.  Not only is there not enough space for two engineers to collaborate at one workstation, the noisy contact center style desks do not allow confidential or secure conversations to take place.  Additionally the background noise makes it almost impossible to hear and be an active participant in Adobe Connect sessions at your desk without either learning monk-like powers of focus and concentration or putting a finger in your open ear.  Additionally those next to you trying to have work conversations do so right at your desk during conference calls, preventing you from hearing what’s on the phone no matter how hard you try.  Listeners at the other end of the conference call hear the loud background noise from your deskmates conversations.  We are not contact center employees.  We need to collaborate and that requires an environment that’s conducive to collaboration."

I have to say mine REALLY sucks. Some senior management doesn't even have the knowledge or skill to be at where they are. Let me give you a simple example, that person doesn't even know how to use Excel to graph a chart, and I was told it is my job to know how to do everything, not his/hers. Isn't that scary?! Aren't you supposed to have solid knowledge and skills before you lead us?! At the same time, they don't give you a clear direction, ""I don't know what I want, but I know this is not what I want, so you go figure it out"", that was the feedback I received. Seriously?!
Please show up for YOUR meetings, don't reschedule it over and over, and  sometime even forget to reschedule it, then tell everyone ""Oh, I can't communicate well today"" when you come back from shopping or your super long lunch break, are you kidding me?! Do you know all the data I used was YTD, and I have to redo all the analysis because you can't communicate well today?!
The other con would be the pay time off. Sick leave and annual leave are separate; you can only use your sick leave when you or your direct family members are sick, and sometime you need to provide doctor's notes. I’m sorry if you're healthy, because you can't cash out your sick leave when you leave the company."

- NFCU likes to promote from within so if management interests you it is an option. That said, promotion is not automatic - only so many management positions and the job security is so high (see cons) that turnover in these positions can be rare depending on what you want to do.","- Speed to market for new products, services, or processes is extremely slow. Bottleneck is generally found in middle management who would prefer to have their superiors make a decision than own it themselves. Additionally, the company grew so fast that the technical infrastructure is an absolutely mess which also contributes to the slow speed to market.

- You do not get fired for poor performance. You have to do something borderline illegal to get fired. Think government level job security. This has resulted in a class of employees (from MSR to VP level) that mail it in day after day and management is generally too passive to let them go or even reassign them to somewhere they can do less damage. Most people would consider job security a pro but I enjoy working around capable people so this level of job security is a major turn off."

I've been promoted several times and have always had lots of opportunities for training and advancement. Of the three supervisors I've had, only one was incompetent in the role and I was able to get away from her quickly.  The systems I have to work with aren't spectacular, but they're decent enough.  My management takes constructive advise very well and is willing to escalate good ideas.","All of my experiences using my extensive benefits were great, until my husband and I decided to have our first child.  

First: the maternity leave rules were hard to find and harder to understand.  I had to read, then re-read, then email HR, then email HR again for clarification on their previous email before I finally understood what leave time the company would pay.

Second:  After having a great experience with all my other benefits and finding them more than adequate (especially for the area), the maternity leave benefits (or lack thereof) were sorely dissapointing.  There is no *true* benefit.  

Employees are allowed a mere 12 weeks per FMLA which the company is required to follow in my location.  They do not allow leave beyond what they are federally required to allow. 

Leave compensation:  After requiring the employee to use 2 weeks of their personal leave, the Short Term Disability program will pay 75% of the employee's pay for 4 weeks.  That's it.  That's all.  Nothing else.  Any other time you take and want to be paid for, you must use your own leave store.  Oh, and extra bonus:  when you get back to work and have 0 hours of leave accumulated because you took it all on maternity leave - you have to build your leave back up to 32 hours and maintain a minimum balance of 32 hours before you take any additonal leave OR you can be dinged for it in your performance review (which affects your annual raise and bonus).  When you earn 7 hours of leave every 2 weeks, that means you're not supposed to take leave until 10 weeks after coming back from maternity leave.  Anyone who has ever put a child in daycare understands how impossible that is with all the germs going around and very immature immune systems.

Flexible Work/Leave Options Available to New Parents:  None.  There are no reduced schedules, flexible schedules, or telework options offered (unless you were grandfathered in on the very small pilot program years ago).  Additionally, there is no increased leave offered."

1469,,Navy Federal,2016-02-07,4.0,Anonymous Employee,"Great benefits, great job security, lots of growth potential.",Still catching up with the reality of their current size and growth rate. Always underestimate their growth. Can lead to poor leaders in supervisor and management roles. Has become much more of a corporate environment and has lost their ability to really connect with the employees.

1473,,Understand the Culture in Advance,2016-01-26,4.0,Manager,"There is a fabulous bonus structure for every single employee, which is truly extraordinary. If you are looking for stability and structure and a large community, you will enjoy that at NFCU. NFCU offers many training opportunities and benefits and many employees work their way up the corporate ladder. Relationships and soft skills are important here, and it's family-style culture can be a double edged sword.","NFCU seems to reward management for knowing exact details about problems, which reinforces a culture of non-empowerment and micromanagement.  If you're new you will have a hard time competing with employees who have been there for decades and know everything and everyone. If you're looking for a flexible, creative, empowering culture that seeks to solve its problems and relishes the challenge of modernization and values independent thinking, this is not the place for you. Change agents struggle here.  I do think one's experience here varies widely depending on whether you are a front line employee assisting members and you deal with extreme structure, complex systems and trainings, or if you are in a different part of the credit union.  The lack of flexibility runs across the organization, however, and rigid, old fashioned business thinking prevails."
1474,,Overall good,2016-01-24,4.0,Anonymous Employee,"The benefits are fantastic and most of the people I work with are good, cool people with a decent work ethic.  Even the VPs I've come in contact with are nice and approachable.  Some areas allow for flex time, so you can sort of make your own schedule, even possibly work four 10-hour days so you can have a three-day weekend (my current area does not allow for that).  The benefits are pretty outstanding even if the pay seems like it might be a little low.","It's a bank, so you're usually expected to be there when the weather is bad.  Depending on the section you're in, there's not really anywhere to move up unless you want to be a supervisor or manager.  Parking is a nightmare--this sounds like a trivial thing, but it's been a problem since I started working here 8 years ago and it's only gotten worse.  Telecommuting is nearly non-existent, as it is ""not part of Navy Federal culture."""
1475,,"Great Company, But No Company is Perfect",2016-01-20,4.0,Member Service Representative II,"There are great benefits, like currently 7% 401K matching and health insurance even for part time workers which most companies won't do.  The company structure overall is very efficient and organized which helps everyone do their work with less stress and frustration, and there is an annual bonus (percentage of annual income based on annual review), a Christmas bonus (a few hundred $), and for branch offices sometimes a branch bonus ($100).  There are many people at the company who have been there for decades and really care about the company, the membership, and fellow employees.","In the branch office, you're expected to be perfect, and at my branch some of management seems to want to point out any error but rarely gives a moment to express appreciation.  Training is patchy on many things so if you're not good at retaining everything as you get it in bits and pieces, and later you make a mistake, you're held back from other areas of learning.  There is no consolidated training in an organized way in a full class where information can be learned in an organized way so if you don't have the right issues come up at the right times so you can learn those skills, then you don't get to absorb those things, and sometimes management looks at you as if you're not learning enough.  Things are often so busy in the branch office that you often don't have time to get extra tasks done unless you just breeze through them and don't really read through.  Also way too much politics in the branch office with some people being treated differently than others."

They can say or do whatever they want about you no matter if they are wrong. If they do not like the way you look, or if they wanted someone else on their team your screwed! They will make your life hell until you either quit or you are called at home after work and told don't come back we will ship your stuff to you. If you did nothing wrong and have proof it does not matter. .. They will just say you ""didn't fit in with the team"". How do these people sleep at night?"

They strive hard to motivate and attract great and talented employees.  Their priorities and practices are in line with their mission and core beliefs.,"FMLA only applies if there are more than 50 employees in s specific region.  That did not apply to my branch, therefore maternity leave was considered short term disability.  6 weeks with a newborn, in my opinion, is not enough.  Were it not for the poor maternity leave support, I would have continued to work for this organization"
1484,,a TRUE review,2016-01-13,1.0,Acct Services MSR I,"Good pay for the area, good benefits","I just want to say that I have no idea where all of these positive reviews are coming from. It seriously makes me question the integrity of this site. I worked at NFCU for almost a year and I think I met maybe 5 people who liked their jobs-- everyone else HATED HATED HATED it there. They only stayed for the money. 

Too many cons to list. You have good health coverage, but you cannot get a day off to go to the doctor, so what's the point? People ask for time off 6 months in advance and they are turned down. They don't care if you are getting married or your Dad is having open heart surgery -- they just DON'T CARE. 
You are monitored down to the second in everything you do. You cannot even talk to a coworker for 2 minutes without it costing you. There were people who worked 20 feet away from me for more than 6 months and I never knew their names.  You are supposed to try to talk members into new products/services in a RIDICULOUS manner that makes you sound like a bad infomercial. And if you don't do it, it will cost you. You will never get a new position. I refused to lower myself to the level of an annoying infomercial host. 
In account services, you are not trained to handle a lot of the calls you will be taking. You are supposed to look it up in the manual, which is a joke. Even the people on the assist line cannot find what they need in the manuals. The stress level is unlike anything I have ever experienced in my life. It got to the point where I was crying on my way to work, crying at work, crying on my way home . . .
They constantly waste money on stupid things like cupcakes, paper hands, plastic junk to commemorate joke day (or whatever random day it is) instead of putting money into training. Why not use that money to pay someone to be there to help MSRs who are new to the floor????? You are thrown on the phone with virtually no idea what you are doing, and NFCU is OK with that. They tell you to ""fake it til you make it."" Do they not understand that this is people's money that they are letting trainees mess with?? If you make a mistake and someone's mortgage check bounces, there could be consequences for that person. All NFCU cares about is that there is a body in the chair to answer the phone.
My supervisor had just been promoted from another department and could not even do the transactions that we were taught in training, so she could not help us at all. We also did not have a team coach for 3 months-- we were left high and dry to try to figure things out on our own. 

Trust me, this place is a JOKE. The only reason they are voted a top employer by Fortune magazine is because they look good on paper. Think about it --- you can't get the day off for your Dad's heart surgery or talk to your coworker for 2 minutes, but hey, here's a cupcake. That should make it all better, right? WRONG. SO WRONG."

An overall disconnect from management (myself being one of them) to the general employee with their needs and transparency. In working for NFCU for 7+ years most were extremely rewarding from a professional as well as personal perspective. However management in all areas of the contact center (loans and credit card specifically) are trumped significantly by their field (read: branch operations) counterparts. The middle management in the Winchester Contact Center is uneven, disconnected, inconsistent and in some respects unethical.

Mortgage employees are on overtime the majority of the year and consistently have increasing work loads. The employees are then reprimanded if they fail to meet service standards for the members which is hard to do when you have over 50 loans at almost all times.

You spend 8-9 hours on a phone each day depending on the shift you chose if you're in the Contact Center. Typically, you answer the same questions all day. It's a call center job. I had problems with HR regarding Short Term Disability and my actual ADA paperwork. They claimed they lost it and then found it a few days later. Also, technology is super behind.

1571,,Branch Manager,2015-06-30,5.0,Anonymous Employee,Wonderful company to be a part of. Upper management strongly believes in recognizing the efforts of front-line team members.,The cons that I experienced within Navy Federal had nothing to do with the company as a whole. There are no cons that I can list regarding the company.
1572,,MSR,2015-06-29,4.0,,Great company to work for.  Excellent training.  Amazing Benefits.,Micromanaging within the branch was horrible.
1573,,Terrible mid to low managment,2015-06-27,2.0,Inside Sales Department,The benefits are pretty much the only good thing about Navy Federal if you have a terrible manager. My teammates where great and easy to work with. If you're at the point in your career where you want to settle down and have no intentions to grow this is a great place. The yearly bonus is great. Many people stay only because that bonus. Its the happiest month when its Partners In Performance (PIP) month. It will also be a great place if you love politics and red tape to get anything done. If you think you will be a successful character in the Game of Thrones this place will be the fast track to Sr Management. Company is very stable and your job is secure. It takes a act of congress to fire anyone. 90% of the work is done by 10% of the people that work here. Great place if you can be apart of the 90% that does 10% of the work. There is a great gym that you can workout during your work hours. The cafeteria also is a great place to spend most of your work hours. If you can't find your managers they probably are taking their 4th break down there. If you're not feeling well just go down and see the nurse. Life is good.,Navy Federal loves to put out fires rather then prevent them all together. There are more band aids and duct tape then getting things right the first place. There are racist managers and HR knows about them but won't do anything. Case of sexual assault but who cares when you have all that member money you can just pay the employee off. Nothing get done because the mid to low managers have huge egos. They don't trust anyone to do what the company pays them to do. If you don't drink the Kool Aid management will find a way to make your life miserable. HR is not your friend. They are only there to protect the company and its image. God forbid you use your brain and think for yourself. No such thing as innovation because people like the lazy pace. Managers will get scared you are out for their jobs if you start being creative about making the company better. Navy Federal treats its employees like numbers and that's it. There are so many talent people here but egos get in the way of success. Managers in my group fought with other business units hence another reason nothing got done. If you want something done tell your manager the opposite of what you think should be done. Managers love taking credit for ideas so they will put their own spin to your idea and take the credit. When crap hits the floor it wasn't their spin that caused the issues. Some groups promote job security by not sharing information to other teams. They know someone else on other team can do their job better. ITIL training is something the company is promoting its employees get. Unfortunately ITIL is not something they want you to have NOT for the sake of the direction of the company. It opposes what ITIL is saying a company should do. Managers expect employees to get certifications not for their career growth but to say to others they have someone with that cert. Come early to work because there is never any parking too. If you have a micro manger you will get your yearly bonus taken away. Obstacle are always put in front of you because management loves to see you fail. They ask you to build a bridge with toothpicks. I could keep going on but whats the point right...
1574,,Mostly good,2015-06-26,4.0,MSR Contact Center,Terrific support...with the right supervisor. I like the support I've been receiving from my current supervisor and team.,Tough to move up. A lack of continuity in leadership styles.

1596,,Great company to work for,2015-05-14,4.0,Member Service Representative,"I loved working for Navy Federal. There was great camaraderie in the branches and many opportunities to grow. Compensation packages are above average for customer service banking positions. Those working in headquarters have more perks than branch employees, but benefits are still stellar across the company. Growth is generally encouraged by management. There are countless opportunities for branch employees to expand their roles by taking advantage of training opportunities such as loan officer training and mortgage loan training. Employees are generally valued by top management. Monetary incentives such as annual and holiday bonuses were awarded when I was employed in the company.","Navy Federal's hiring and staffing procedures in branch operations should be overhauled. New postings for full time positions for member service representatives were extremely rare, while part time positions are a dime in a dozen. One may encounter plenty of bureaucracy and quasi-nepotism in terms of promotions and applying for internal positions, depending on the branch manager/regional manager. There has been many cases of deserving employees with years of technical know-how knowledge and credentials being passed over for external candidates with existing relationships with the interview board. The company's movement toward expansion has frustrated many employees due to the growing member to employee ratio. Wait times continue to grow due to the lack of staffing in the branches."

1629,,WORST JOB EVER!!,2015-01-02,1.0,Acct Services MSR I,Pay and benefits. That's it.,"I don't know who these people are who are leaving reviews that Navy Federal is so awesome. They have to be getting paid to leave reviews like that. I do not know anyone who likes it there. It is absolutely the worst working environment that I have ever experienced. I have worked retail, convenience store, etc., and this is by far the worst job I have ever had.
You are chained to the phone. Period. You can't go to the bathroom when you need to and you do not get to talk to coworkers. Don't expect a day off for a family funeral, your Dad's open hear surgery, your wedding day, whatever. It's not gonna happen. 
If you need a question answered, do you walk over to your supervisor's desk and ask?? Absolutely not. You send an IM and keep your butt on the phone. And good luck getting a straight answer. If you ask 3 supervisors the same question, you will get 3 different answers - try doing your job with that kind of information - yes? no? sometimes?.  What are you supposed to tell the member who is on hold and waiting for an answer? 
You are monitored down to the second in everything you do. Yet people in other departments are apparently allowed to let mistakes in the phone list and on alert info go uncorrected for over a year. 

There are training bytes that you are required to do, but you are not given any time to do them. We are told to do them on our breaks.

They have implemented a new program designed to inform the members about NF products and services. Be prepared to sound like you are in an infomercial: ""Would you have a moment for me to . . . "" ""Does that sound like something that could be of benefit to you?"" It's cheesy and degrading."

I couldn't keep food down or sleep for almost a month earlier this year before I talked to my doctor...and I'm a person who usually performs very well under pressure. I would say that the biggest con CAN be a management team that constantly micromanages and disrespects their ""lesser"" team members. The second biggest con is the member attitude you have to tolerate at times. I have been spit at, had things thrown at me, and have been seriously belittled, all because I wouldn't cash a large check, etc. Some of that comes with customer/member service, but still."

Although training is limited to the role of the employee.","The upper management lacks humility and are almost elevated to a god like status. They enforce rules at a high level without bothering to see how it affects people at lower levels of Management. Exceptions are made all over the company, it all depends on affiliation to upper management.  Morale is low and people are unhappy.

There is plenty of wasteful and overlapping projects. The company is rapidly hiring full time and contractors, expanding departments. This has contributed to employees and contractors who are either busy or have no work. The upper management has eliminated flexibility to employees. For occasional family related problems e.g child or spouse sick or no school, employees are forced to use vacation and sick leave for family related issues but are disallowed from working remotely. 

The problem further gets magnified when employees who are forced to come in spend the entire week dialing in to virtual meetings when they could have done the same from home."

If you suck up to management they might promote you.  You get Sundays off.,You can work 11 hour days.  You only get 30min break per day.  There is a double standard with managers.  There is very low opportunity to advance within the Branches if you do not want to move across the country.  You get very little time off.  Management documents everything you do.

There are many opportunities for growth and a great career path. They offer their employees many benefits above and beyond what other companies offer.  Navy Fed also prides itself on never having a lay off.,"In the particular department I was working in they were severely understaffed. They did not want to hire extra staff for the amount of work necessary and they were requiring mandatory overtime of at least 10 hours a week.  They also hire temp workers in certain departments who do not have access to the same benefits. When business slows down they get rid of the ""contractors"" to avoid laying off their own staff."

Employee benefits are as good but not better than similar companies out there. Health care,  401k Match etc. They have extensive training and career support for various areas of the business. Employees are truly what makes the company while Management takes the credit.","Work life balance is a promise not followed by upper management. They are constantly nickel and diming employee's time almost negating any morale people might have, created with the perceived wonderful benefits provided by the company. People with families or temporary medical issues are forced to follow norm imposed by Managers. There is lot of favoritism here, only managers and their family members  ""connected"" are on the gravy train with upper management even if they lack people skills. Morale is seriously low.  Bad managers are rewarded, they constantly hire managers who are clock watchers and finger pointers...under the guise of  work optimization and performance. Especially when nothing is really broken.
Career opportunities, there is remote potential to move between departments unless you ""know"" someone, internal postings are a sham, as candidates have already been selected. Good luck obtaining reference from a manager you cannot work with....you are out of luck!"

They have the best mortgage programs in the industry like no PMI required etc but comes at a cost...","Compared to other mortgage lenders the compensation is at the lowest when you compare to other lenders, the annual pay of $35K per year with occasional overtime pay.  You are given a company phone and have to be on call after hours until 9pm and have to be available from 9am to 9pm on weekends and holidays and there is a base pay of $1400 per year to be available which calculates to $1.63 per hour... There is no compensation for the first 7 loans closed.  Once you close between 8 to 10 loans you receive $50.  That's right $50 will be added to your check for closing a total of 10 mortgages, not $50 each loan. Its based on a tier chart were the next section up to 13 or so closed loans pay $100 and caps around $1000 at around 20 closed loans... The yearly bonus ranges between 1% to 6% based on company and individual performance.  With the good benefits and little perks, the overall revenue the loan officers generate does not justify the compensation.  Close 20 loans at any other lender and your making well over 6 figures per year...  The loan pipe line is so large that nobody can keep up and the staff is kept purposely understaffed because the management's monthly goal to meet is AVERAGE CLOSED LOANS PER LOAN OFFICER.  Meaning the behavior being driven is keep the staff as low as possible and load the employees with an unrealistic workload in which causes burnout and the employee resigns and they hire a fresh new employee and repeat the process.  They do not care about you or the members even though they claim too, if they did they would property staff the mortgage department and pay properly.  The processors are mostly temps and they hire and fire often, this caused us loan officers to do our own processing at times and closings to be delayed in which means we dealt with mostly upset members all day everyday being screamed at...  Not hiring enough people to keep up with the demand because of the company bottom line just shows that this company is not any better than the big commercial banks..."

Their motto is just ""get it done"" & could care less what the employees or members go through to get it done.  It is definitely all about the numbers.  Very bad micromanaging.  Make you feel like a child being constantly monitored even though we consistently break records from previous years.  If we get praise, it's immediately followed by ""but now we need this"".  Employees feel very unappreciated & morale is LOW.  Promotions are more of a popularity contest than based on skill & ability to manage.  We don't get paid enough for what we go through everyday."

You start off with a decent salary for the area and are guaranteed a cost of living raise every year on top of any raises or promotions you earned. The health insurance benefits are incomparable. They even offer tuition assistance, discounts with numerous companies including car rentals. There is plenty of room to move up and get promoted and you're eligible at the 6 month mark. The training program is fantastic. I did not feel like I was unprepared when I went on the phones. If you have a good supervisor they will work with you to get your stats where they need to be in order to get promoted. You have weekly meetings to keep everyone on the same page and monthly one-on-one meetings with your supervisor to go over how you're doing.","The push to be promoted makes everyone a little cut throat. It's hard to tell who your friends are and who's just trying to get on your good side so they can sabotage you. They promote being tattle tales and ratting out your co-workers to management, which many do in an effort to put themselves in a good light. Management is not consistent and neither are punishments for rule breaking. The company has taken it's focus off member service and are spending more time focusing on how to get more members, even if that means stressed out employees. The board of directors made bad decisions on the redesign of the website, launching it before it was ready, migrating users before major problems were solved, and not hiring anyone extra for Electronic Services though the call volume increased by at least 300%. Instead they recruited employees from other depts to pick up SOME skills to help with volume which led to more transfers higher wait times in other dept. The most frustrating thing is the lack of work/life balance that was promised. They are always needing people to work overtime. They are always needing people to work holidays. It's almost impossible to get time off, even for doctor's appt. I hadn't taken a vacation in over a year and worked every holiday AND overtime, but still got denied for the 4 days off I asked for 3 months ahead of time."

Even if you come in when your supposed to, provide excellent member service, and never call out you are expected to never to ask for time for yourself. Meaning if you have accrued time off and you ask to use it management looks at you and questions your devotion to the company. Excuse me if I have a life and I want to enjoy it.

Did I mention that if you are a branch employee expect to be treated like garbage from the corporate office and forced into slave labor 6 days a week?

Work requirements were usually fairly low, and business was good. This was generally a straightforward 9-5.","There seems to be a huge emphasis on seniority or conformity over excellence or competence. Management (especially upper management) seemed unusually out of touch and clueless, even by my low standards. Goals were often poorly defined and contradictory.

Most members were friendly and the branch was rather new with a huge employee lounge.","Sometimes goals were not attainable since managers didn't stick to rotation schedule.  Hard to meet loan goals when you were stuck at the teller line.  Also often short staffed, worked there 3  years, started with 35 hours and within 2 months the company only gave pt employees 20 hours per week. Also, in 3 years there was no opportunity to get more hours. if you're honest in your exit interview and say something that will make the manager look ""bad"" even though its true, she will hold a grudge and you will NEVER be rehired... even if your employee file says otherwise and you were a great employee."

The few majority retired admirals at the top of the company added 3 to 5 layers of minority V.P.s and managers beneath them to carry out their will on the remaining 10,000 employees.  Understand that this company is not a financial instituition.  It bears no resemblance even to an american enterprise.  How it received approval to operate as a Federal Credit Union, free of all taxation and DOD office space expense, is an atrocity. The layers of minority managers exclusively promote minorities from every nation on the earth (Philipino, Iranian, Indian, Japanese, Chinese, etc.).

I also found out about two months after I left that I was vested in a pension plan I had no idea about, so I received several thousand dollars from that, which was like a complimentary dessert to make up for a bad meal. I do believe Mr. Dawson is a good CEO, but improvements need to be made down the management chain.","While the insurance benefits are good, the actual pay is lackluster, and it seems almost impossible to get a decent raise as the branch managers will not give you anything more than a milquetoast annual review, no matter how hard you work and accurate you are. If you consider working in a branch office, think again. The only way to work for this company is to work at headquarters or one of the call centers. Branch Operations is the largest part of NFCU, and consequently the branches get dumped on an awful lot when call volumes exceed the call center capacities, or mortgage applications exceed capacity, etc. The trouble is the branches are woefully under-staffed. The management calls this ""right-sizing"" the branches. So, when HQ or the call centers start asking for help, branch staff members are expected (and browbeaten) to disappear into the back and get on the phone, leaving one or two branch staff in the lobby to help with the very demanding members. Then, when twelve members all walk in at once, everyone gets into a mad scramble to try and appease them since they are all in an enormous hurry. One very aggravating thing is how the branch management and visiting executives laugh so loudly and obnoxiously where members cannot help but hear them. This makes dealing with angry members very difficult, as they become even more belligerant when they feel business is not being taken seriously in the office. 

I started work with this company as a member services representative and was promoted after 2.5 years to branch supervisor. Nearly all of the branch managers I worked for and interacted with were narcissistic and bullying. They would hold threats over employees' heads, would twist words and gossip fiercely within their own little manager's ""club,"" and the first one I worked under tried to block my promotion for some unknown reason. That first branch manager of mine later got into trouble for not giving anyone at my first branch a raise in the first three years of being open, when the norm is six months, or at the very least one year. Nonetheless, the company does very little to get rid of bad managers, as that one remained a branch manager for quite a while afterward and is still employed in some equally high-paying position. I realize all of this sounds like normal workplace stuff, but when you also have federal regulations hanging over your head, are responsible for a half-million dollars or more in cash, another half-million in checks and other negotiable instruments, all while trying to stay accurate and watch out for scams while constantly exposed to the threat of someone coming in and robbing the place, it gets old. Or, at least, it got old to me after four years of nothing getting better."

If you worked at a busy branch that was productive you received a bonus every year.,"Part timers worked only 20 hrs/week. There should be more of a variety to the part time hours.

HR is super sensitive towards anything. anyone can go complain and HR will pat them on the back and say aww are you okay baby? there's just a lot of stupid people in the company. go into the cafeteria and it looks like a high school - the old people look nerdy like teachers and the young people looks like slobs. 100 greatest places to work for boring data entry careers and boring call/collection careers. the company is just basically basking in the new profits, no real plan or strategy. a bunch of people just waiting for the next PIP/Bonus payout. change is extremely slow  and management is super reactive and NEVER proactive. it's like everyone is sleeping until someone SVP or above wakes up and has a questions about something and it's a firedrill- completely asinine. typical silos and most senior executives that try to come together on something are polar opposites and nothing ever gets done. most databases are extremely immature compared to companies the same size - ISD is worthless, definitely not a good place to have an IT career or any career for that matter because it's so mind numbing and asinine watching stupid people push paper and provide no value to the company. we're all winners! career opportunities are limited. you basically have to suck it up and just have a positive attitude and go numb and brain dead about some of the major issues in your department. just ignore everything and smile."
1774,,Great company!,2012-08-27,5.0,Anonymous Employee,They give great benefits and salary.  Very community minded.  Most of the employees get along and are happy to be working there.,"Depending on the department you work, opportunities for advancement, training, and empowerment vary.  Sometimes they put technical managers in charge of people and that doesn't turn out well."
1775,,NFCU,2012-08-19,3.0,Business Analyst,Company treats employees fairly and not the worst place to work at but also not the best place either.  Salary qualifies you for low income housing.,"Very difficult to get promoted or move up within the organization.  When I started they used to promote from within but that has been going down recently as they look to hire people from the outside if the internal candidates aren't what they like.  Why would someone stay if they knew they had no chance for advancement?  There is high turnover within the company as people don't stay too long.  While at one time the company had good benefits those have been whittled down  or are in going away so you can see almost a two tiers of employees.  There are people who have a pension and been there for a number of years and then most everyone else has been there a few years.  The average employee stays under 5 years and there are thousands of employees.  There were some women in leadership roles who kind of treat the company as a sorority.  Once you get there you would understand.  Also, there is limit amount of minorities in leadership roles.  While much of the credit union are minorities at Headquarters only a limited amount have high ranking positions.  I cannot talk about Florida where many of the positions are going.  Also, if you work in Virginia there is a chance your position could go to Florida at sometime in the future.  Lastly, the company makes it out like they never lay people off but they do fire people.  It isn't too hard for them to ""find a reason"" to fire employees.  While I was there they did have departments that were eliminated and they moved the employees to different sections.  Overall not the worst place to work but don't get stuck there too long.  Probably a decent place to start for a first job but maybe not somewhere to spend your career."

1780,,Inconsistent schedule,2012-06-28,3.0,Member Service Representative,"Pay was great, people were great, loved the members.","NFCU insists on hiring part-time employees, which not only affects member service when there isn't enough people working, but also makes it very difficult to have a second job (which is needed, if you're supporting yourself) by only working with school schedules, not other employment. Shifts could range from 4 hours to 8 hours, sometimes you get a full lunch and sometimes you don't, and trying to hold down anything outside of work is next to impossible unless you consistently can work after 7 p.m. at your other job."

You can get pay increases but if in branch no other room for advancement unless you move. Always being watched and not allowed to talk with fellow coworkers, unless the manager wants to talk about herself then we can go on for hours. Manager will speak to you unprofessionally, degrading, nasty to get her point across. The camera's are always being watch because manager and assist manager have nothing better to do.  If platform side is busy they rather pull you off the teller line to take a mbr while they continues to find more issues to complain about.  They nit pick, people are only human, we can make mistakes, and don't even have to make a mistake to have them call you into office.  They will ask you questions to see how you answer so they can catch you doing something.  They will also tell you that you can never go anywhere else and make this kind of money, Navy Federal is the only place in the world that takes care of their employees, that why they came in 97 on Fortune 100 place to work.  There's 96 other place I can seek work, that appear better. And if you are part time and want full time just because you been there for a while they can choose someone who been there alot less time over you.  Its how they make you feel worthless."

Being on the phones for hours on end with nonstop calls is terrible. There is no time to think or catch a breath before that call has ended and a new one has arrived.
