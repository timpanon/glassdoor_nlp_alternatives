They have an ecosystem that works amazingly, if you are not part of that ecosystem you can not survive. They blatantly lie about the role - time and again- reduce a General Manager role as Excel Spreadsheet fill up, admin role and you understand when you land in the mess. Designations have no value at all, have left a much bigger role to join as they have lied time and again. Completely silos- people talks and communicate within their own ecosystem and groups.  No Strategy - opened a regional center in Bangkok and closed it within 4 years due to the poor strategy and possibly power game and it was a disaster.

604,,Review of NMUK and Nissan culture,2020-02-12,2.0,Mechanical Engineer,"NMUK salary is competitive, particularly for graduates, in the region.

There quite a few good eggs at NMUK that made the it just about bearable to work there.","The working and management culture is toxic from the top down. I was regularly talked down to and verbally bullied by my own management as well as from other departments. This is not a unique case - it is commonplace and expected.

On a working level the culture is generally okay, but my experience of (mis)management was consistently demotivating, demoralising and emotionally draining.

The term 'death by a thousand cuts' can be used to accurately describe working at NMUK. It is sometimes hard to put your finger on one reason why things are sub-par but there are many negative interactions, menial tasks, red tape and barriers of progress, that are not insignificant.

The office working environment needs to be updated. Improvements have been promised by management time and time again, but with no end product.
The production working environment is chaotic, noisy and embarrassingly old fashioned compared to many newer and more advanced facilities.

I have very little hope for the future direction of the company. The Ghosn scandal and imprisonment in Japan is embarrassing - Nissan is now a laughing stock on the global stage, and the stock price has tumbled. 
The new CEO (whoever it is..) has zero charisma or credibility as far as I'm concerned."

708,,Project Lead,2019-05-11,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"I moved to Nissan Digital from  Bangalore.  I was apprehensive at first about two things - one though Nissan is a known automobile brand, I was not sure about the  Technology Innovation at the place. One google search and the kind of industry leading Technology research they do convinced me on that front.  That Nissan Leaf sells more than Tesla Worldwide, is unheralded, yet true.  My second concern was regarding moving to Trivandrum, a place I  had never been to. However , coming here from Bangalore , just the relief from the traffic crawls at Bangalore is such a relief.  Low pollution , good clean city, good schools and hospitals. I know people taking just 20 minutes to drive 10 kilometers to office. 

Now coming to work. The center at Trivandrum is fast becoming a hub for cutting edge work in latest automobile software.  Already a number of exciting PoCs have been developed and showcased to business, and I was lucky to have been part of a couple of them. Even freshers straight out of college get to be part of exciting software development and work with the business. Many freshers have already traveled onsite too. 

The Management is refreshing and open to ideas. Even the junior most resources are given the opportunity to come up with ideas and drive them to completion. There is no micro management , at least within my team I haven't found any.  The top leadership is highly qualified and we have a number of leaders from leading Technology companies across the globe.","A couple of things i would like to comment here. One if you are a pub hopping, late nighter , then Trivandrum is not the place for you. It is a laid back city, but pollution free ,  clean, with all the facilities of a capital. Traffic is smooth compared to Bangalore, Chennai or Gurgaon. 

Secondly, since the company is still in its first year, the processes are still maturing. So some of the support systems might take some time to respond. But things have improved tremendously in the last 6 months I have been here, so there is much scope here."

No say or input into system architecture - prescribed by Renault - leaves little option to learn new technologies. Agile is employed but wrapped in waterfall gates and processes - makes it difficult to fully exploit the benefits. 

Upper management have restructured the department in Europe, only to have many new hires leave and the new organisation scrapped by global in favour of another structure. So much time and resource has been lost on consultants for nothing, when it could have been pumped into innovative projects or technical infrastructure.

Flexible working largely depends on your immediate manager. Not coming in at the official start time is largely a faux-pas, despite people routintely staying back or working through lunch. Isolated location. Poor annual pay increase based on performance. Management prescribed to follow bell-curve so everyone get's average reviews.

NEVOS/NEVLLS’s car scheme from £150 per month (no worry on tax or insurance as its covered) - however restricted to 12,000 or 18,000 miles per year before additional charges per mile (high cost for any repair though)

2 weeks off in july/august as part of factory shut down + 2 weeks off at end of december/january for christmas shut down
All bank holidays you get off
8 additional days holiday to take throughout the year (check out the cons for more on this)","You will get absolutely zero time to yourself as you will be working “mandatory” overtime every saturday on early shift (07:00-15:10), at end of a mid-shift you finish at 23:10 on friday but back in 20:45 sunday night, the only time you get 2 full days off is after a night shift week, however rumours are going around from management that they will be adding a friday night shift so you will be working sunday night until saturday morning then back in on monday morning,

Supervisors and team leaders have their favourites who get away with leaving stations empty from parts, cars not built at end of session time so when you go onto the station your first car is not built and at end of station,
You will be spoken to and treat like a child and scolded every chance you get,
According to supervisors and team leaders there is only operator error never a problem with how the car is built (bolt holes not lining up, harnesses knotted, parts not fitting etc)
You will be stuck doing the same job repeatedly for 8-10 hours per day with lack of rotation leading to injury to yourself (repetitiive strain injury etc)
You cant even phone in ill without been threatened to have to come in to see occupational health (glorified first aiders), even if OH say your not fit for work, nissan will try put you at refusal to work, they will not accept your dr’s/GP’s sick note if you take one in,
Supervisors will repeatedly drag you into personnel meetings to discuss performance issues when none are there (this goes on a record so it makes it easier to try sack you according to law.....not many are aware you can use thsi as constructive dismissal and take them to tribunal)
You get 8days annual leave to take when you want (or so the say) good luck in trying to get these, they always have a reason why you are unable to have a day off you request but will then in sept-nov tell you that you NEED to take all your hols in one go on this week or these days so they dont have to pay you your accrued hols,

If you have an employee car they will find anything to add a charge for repairs or over milage even when nothing is there,
Most staff dont have a lot of brain cells to rub together, always at each others neck, gather in clique’s,

This place will stress you out, drain you of your life,"

His lack of knowledge is notorious - and his strategy is to put departtments against each other to create confusion and hide the fact that he is unable to make good decisions that can benefit the business. Now teams survived day to day in a constant civil war, which is promoted by Management. Frustation is high and key employees have left the company since they couldnt cope with this blaming game. 

Worse - now promotions are given based on the sentimental status with Top Management. A person can get promoted from receptionist to a specialist, without career degree or skills, getting a big salary increase and company car against internal policy, all based on the affiliation with MD. Constant business trips for the two, paid by the company, without any benefit for the business. The mess is such that managers try hard to do what they could, but now morale is down to the lowest level. As a woman, it is so offensive to see how a promotion or a salary increase can be obtained."

Nissan Europe doesn't even meet the standards when it comes to basic workplace hygiene: Small insects are part of the ecosystem in restrooms and open spaces.

If you get a job at Nissan Europe the first thing you'll realize when HR escorts you to your desk is that nothing is ready to welcome you: No computer, dusty desk...

Monozukuri idea excels at teaching employees cross-functional problem solving.","Sometimes Japanese engineers are seen as ""Gurus"" just because a Japanese engineer said it, it is true, thus, trying to implement new ideas or patents as a non-Japanese is difficult since everything has to go through or from Japan. 
In Mexico, payment is Average not Top of the industry, so atrition will always be present if compensation benefits are not given.
The only way to go up on you carreer ladder is to do more than you are paid for, If an engineer only does what he is being paid for, he will not have a raise.
Home office is not accesible to Design Engineers since there are no Lap-Tops available.
Work-Life balance is non-existent. It is seen as ""bad"" to leave the office at the hour you are supposed to go.
Primarily employee dissatisfaction radicates on work-life balance, new generations require to have extra activities (football, swiming, dancing, playing videogames, etc) but management fails to see and sense this, thinking the new workforce has the same mindset as they do."

Nissan has given me every opportunity to afford everything I need to get stability in my life. 4 years later, I wish I could give it all back because they own me. You're treated like you're nothing to them. They expect you to put their needs before your own in all situations. If you're out of what little paid time you get, good luck being there for your children. They will have you're write up hot off the printer awaiting your return. I was literally given the ultimatum to choose which family member needed medical treatment more. They dont care about you or your family. They reallocate your pay to give the impression they're paying you competitively, ""profit"" share bonuses do not reflect the outcome of company performance, yet have the funds to drop tens of millions on a single advertising opportunity a week later. If you get hurt, they will find a way to push liability on you, even if it is just from wear and tear on your body. Take my advice, find something you're passionate about and roll with it. All this company can offer you is money and you will leave a lesser, more bitter person at the end of the day."

1051,,Injured on the job,2016-03-28,1.0,Technician,Nissan was a good company to work for fifteen years ago.,Good luck if you're ever hurt. They will  string you along until you're completely disabled and never get you the proper treatment.  They pay a lot more money out trying to keep from paying for proper treatment  than to fix the problem.  If you think they care about you. .. you really need to think again!  I would have retired from there but now I am barely able to walk. I would hear horror stories from other employees when I first started working there but I to was blinded and never believed the stories. I am now a firm believer until it happens to you it's hard to imagine the cruelty and inhumane way Nissan treats you. This company would  much rather see their name plastered on football stadiums and music venues than taking care of their employees.  Unfortunately Nissan can afford lobbyists and politicians in their back pockets that fight to change work comp laws to their advantage.  If you want proof look at all the laws changed in the last five years in Tennessee and see who paid the lobbyists. All I ever wanted was to be healed I didn't want any compensation I just wanted to be able to continue to work. Thanks Nissan for crippling me at the age of thirty three and not caring!! I understand I was just another number to you but I am so much more than that to my family. I am unable to play with my children and enjoy life the way I should but you will never steal my strong will to live!! I may not be able to enjoy a lot of things I once did due to your negligence but I be damned  if I will be your victim!  For eleven years I gave you my life and as soon as I was injured you wheeled me around to the line knowing you were breaking every Osha  violation there was. Your own doctors said I needed surgery asap but you would rather pay a doctor in California who has never seen me before to dispute the other seven doctors you made me go too. Wow what a waste of money!!!. I even tried to pay for treatment on my own but was told by medical and HR that to many people saw me get hurt that they had to be responsible for my treatment! All that being said Nissan is just another corporate monster who could care less about their employees.

1145,,"Great product, but could use some improvement.",2014-03-04,4.0,Sales Consultant,"I sold Nissans for 3 years, but I’ve been a fan of Nissan since I was child. My parents and I have been driving Nissan for 25 years we want to continue that legacy. Nissan offers an excellent product line up with innovating ideas which makes Nissan one of the leaders in foreign auto market. I believe in the product and drive what I sell.
It’s easy to get Nissan certified and the NNAnet.com site offers a lot of product knowledge for the sales consultant to accumulate to help become a better sales consultant.
Nissan offers a program to sales consultants during the football season called Sunday Night Rewards which sales consultant depending on which cars they sell during that week and pick the correct football team can accumulate points to which they can cash in for nice things such as Jewelry, gift cards, electronics, apparel, and the list goes on. Unfortunately, this is one of the only rewards/spiffs/spins that Nissan offers other than selling a Nissan Leaf and they discontinued it.","It’s hard to make money by selling new Nissans on top of your regular dealer pay. Nissan customers just like more foreign car buyers are educated buyers and pretty much know what they want and how much they are going to pay before they enter in the dealership. Nissan has an award of excellence program called Owner First which pays sales consultants based on selling minimum of 6 cars each month, meet NSSI survey minimum of 6, and having a 3 month rolling average score of 933. It’s hard to meet these requirements each month and just recently Nissan raised the requirements yet again to selling a minimum of 8 cars and having a rolling average score of 938.
Nissan doesn’t start paying the sales consultants until they met their requirements above. Some manufactures will pay their sales consultants extra money on top of their regular dealer pay without having a minimal numbers of cars sold like Kia Hyundai and GM. 

The Nissan survey is by far one of the biggest jokes. We cannot coach on the survey but every other manufacture allows it. If you are caught coaching on the survey and the customer indicates it on the survey, Nissan throws a fit at that particular dealership. Why should the sales consultant be penalized on the survey for what happens in finance, variety of inventory, appearance of facility, when it’s something that I have no control over? This is I think one of the main reasons why you do not see that many Nissan sales consultants staying with Nissan for a long period of time. It was one of the reasons why I left. A couple of weeks after I left Nissan, I received a survey in my email about my experience working with Nissan. I did take the time to fill out it and how I think Nissan could improve and keep their sales consultants happy. But I see after that they raised the bar yet again and never took my suggestions."
