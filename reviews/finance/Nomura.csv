Nomura's risk middle office at India is the global back office technically. All production support is managed in India leading to US/Europe/Japan workshifts. Most production teams are heavily understaffed with work load of 8-10hr per person per day. The team is supposed to work 365 days, with no consideration for Indian holidays (as there in no backup for India). This essentially leads to terrible work life balance, no mandatory holidays, no sick leaves especially for the analysts. 
2. The senior management at RMO has no vision for the well-being and aspirations of the India staff. All decision making happens outside India. The culture is to squeeze the max out of minimum number of guys. Management is totally unaware of the grassroot problems. 
3. Some people at senior level are straight off rude and into micro-micro management. No proper training of new hires. The culture is to get the new hires do all the manual dirty stuff, while the existing staff keeps the interesting/easy stuff.
4. Systems are outdated and IT support is negligent/irresponsible."

The workflow management tools should be improved and almost every process needs to be streamlined (since there are multiple systems and tools for a single product).

(Read the job title well before apply as even a master's degree could land a bachelor's level job)
3) Senior management: are reachable at all the times but not very supportive in providing with better career and growth opportunities, senior management members mostly have a bachelor's degree, not much involvement in resolving team issues.
4) Salary and incentives: Basic/Fixed salary component is very less and the variable part makes up for that, which clearly means that at the time of job switching, one will tend to get a raise on the basic salary. You take a leave and your variable component of salary hampers, less salary offered as per the competition.
5) Work life balance: Less team members and much work makes you sit for more hours everyday, the breaks are usually less or sometimes even no breaks for breakfast/lunch.
6) Poor management: team management is poor at times, hiring less even when work is more, overshooting project deadlines, senior management tend to involve less with team, overlook ongoing issues.
7) Constant automation of work: there's no stability while working
8) Dated IT infrastructure: Systems are very old and poor in performance resulting in breakdowns and downtime almost all the time. 
9) Poor HR representatives: does not respond well to your complaints or rather at all

Good Transport facilities","Very very old tech stack are used for most of the projects. In terms of technology immediately a hard working developer or BA will feel like going 15 years back

There are many managers/leads with limited technical knowledge who are working in Nomura Mumbai for more than 8-10 years. These managers are in their own comfort zones.
 
Nomura mumbai has almost 70% consultants to do all the hard working. These consultants are handled by those managers who are well occupied in their comfort zones.

If anything wrong goes in a project then all the blame is put on these hard working consultants by these managers. This is the reason why consultants are preferred because they are easily replaceable & are usually blamed for the mistakes of managers & management
In my own project I have seen 3 consultants immediately terminated & replaced by the other

Some of the project teams are feminized i.e. team leads, managers, VP, Executive Director,  VP Head all are somehow exclusively permanent female employees & they are very good in dirty politics & promote party culture every now & then. These people prefer one or two hard working male consultant employee. Once work is done then that male consultant is immediately replaced. This is very common thing in Nomura power location

In some teams managers will not allow consultants to use transport service saying there are some budget restrictions so consultants can't use transport service. This is true for some teams.

Overall Nomura powai is NOT a good place for sincere techies developers & BAs. Please don't work here as a CONSULTANT.

All these things hold true as of 2019 too. Kindly don't read 4 or 5 star reviews. Hit like for this review so that sincere persons will read this honest review."

1. People are understanding, ranging from an analyst to a VP/ED
2. Really liked the work culture
3. Easy to reach out to different teams and their EDs 
4. Less politics (at least in their core business divisions)
5. The subsidized food is seriously amazing (both cost and taste wise)
6. Free transport, to&fro (clean AC buses); Free cab facility post 9PM
7. Really cool interior design and state-of-the-art facilities in the building.","1. Pay gap: it's a serious issue. Since, most VPs/EDs are from BITS/IITs, so people joining from these schools get a very competitive pay, while people joining from non-target schools (even really smart people) get almost half of what target school joiners get. (Be it the internship stipend or the FT salary)
2. Recruits interns (who eventually get a PPO and become FT Analysts) based on their GPA, without conducting any interview or aptitude test. (To be more specific, I'm talking about interns from BITS, even from the new campuses which have no value).
3. Continued, so some people interns and FTs turn out to be really dumb, but the company still won't interview them.
4. People from non-target schools are at times looked down."

you are not allowed access to folders/files/reports of other departments due to office politics.
systems and technology used by everyone in compliance are old and not as per requirements of regulators.
advisory do not talk to the business and there are areas not visited by them for years.
monitoring/reviews team are totally ineffective with a methodology that is outdated and produce reports that do not correspond to the true circumstances of the business.
regulatory affairs are on their own planet and want to be left alone.
fin crime completely segregated.
control room and employee compliance the same.
surveillance do not have the headcount and technology to do their job properly.
front office supervision are difficult to contact and work with.
all compliance  heads and executive directors are not accessible and do not care about the development of their teams.

front office units do everything BAU and they do not have procedures and other business requirements to demonstrate they are aligned with the expectations of regulators.
compliance do nothing to change this and they all perpetuate this mess for years.

culture is the worst you will ever come across  in the city of london. 
high turnover of staff as people abandon ship quickly.
if you are a pregnant woman or have health problems they will get rid of you using lame excuses.
hr departments the worst in the market."

Getting paid salary on time","My story: 

Before joining, I worked in another company and got stable 3 month bonus for the past few years. The base was ok but I was aiming higher, so I was contacted and selected by recruiter.

Nomura offered me a slight higher base but discretionary bonus. I questioned them that the total package (assume 0 bonus) they offered was less than my previous company. HR told me bonus usually 2 month. So I joined the company. 

I joined in Dec and their year end review was in end March  every year. For that year, I had no bonus nor salary increment although HR confirmed me that I was eligible for salary/bonus increment that year. The magic word “discretionary” shut me up.

This year, Nomura is not performing well and lose billions of dollars. The company is undergoing huge revamp and a lot of my colleagues disappeared overnight. After full year service,  I was told my bonus is again 0 due to company performance. 

Right after bonus announcement day, I was called up for a meeting where I was told to go through informal  “performance improvement plan”. The purpose is to “help me familiarise with formal performance improvement plan”. I was shocked but still accepted the challenge trying to work my way out.

This performance plan lasted for only 2 weeks. I was told I failed this plan. It’s advisable for me to leave voluntarily before any “HR action” come in place. 

Am looking for new jobs now but I will never join Nomura, ever. 

For god sake, I was never put into performance improvement plan in my years of service. This company impressed me."

Imagine tech management keeping all the knowledge to oneself by letting you know as less as possible. When a question arises from the users, tech management don't know it, then asking you and telling that info to the users.


Imagine a place where ideas do not matter, only hierarchy matters.

Imagine a place where if you suggest an idea/plan then either being ignored or ridiculed. But if old-timer else does the exact same, then getting praised for it.

The pile of promotion candidates is massive - and its so dis-heartening to see your colleagues and juniors attaining senior positions in other firms, while you struggle to tackle the layers of one corporate position. So much for loyalty!

1. Chronic understaffing. This results in very long hours. A 12 hour day is normal, at least it is in ops.

2. The Antiquated systems are completely unsuitable for the volume of work.

3, Manual workarounds are standard, sometimes taking up multiple hours in a day.

4. A blame culture is prevalent.

5. The multiple manual processes lead to re-occurring control problems that are used as a threat to hold over analyst level staff. 

6. Senior and middle management are aggressive and bullying.

7. This aggressive and bullying behaviours also spills over into  lower  management levels.

8. Management, at all levels, are uninterested in tackling the root causes of staff concerns. Despite repeated raising of issues

9. Complete lack of willingness to invest in new systems or adapt current processes.

10. Amateur approach to projects. Late running, over budget, no engagement of a suitable project team. 

11. Lack of systematic approach to training.

Little to no respect for a work life balance.  I worked at Nomura for 16 years and each year I needed/ was expected to work longer hours. By the end, to run my business successfully, my usual day was between 12-14 hours, but often more and I often needed to work weekends too. No recognition for this, just redundancy.
I always accepted the fact that a thoroughly Japanese institution such as Nomura would consider the gaijin second class to Japanese, but really, one could quite easily argue Nomura is institutionally racist. To be fair, they did appoint one gaijin to The Board, to suggest that they weren't. However you would only need to look at the ratio of domestically employed Japanese staff members verses non Japanese (which incl non domestic Japanese) of redundancies made from those working in London since the take over of Lehman. It would read something close to zero: thousands. 
There are so many Cons, but to highlight just one more; the continued policy of rotating Japanese management every 2 to 3 years is seriously not conducive to progression at all.  Simply benefits the Japanese  individuals personal desire to tour around the world. I was constantly having to introduce new Japanese bods to clients. It doesn't go down well at all."
