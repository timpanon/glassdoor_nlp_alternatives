Learned a ton about market mechanics and individual investors (retail),It was a grind and kind of a one sided deal after about 6 months. The pay is insufficient and if you aren't seeing the career movement you are expecting after about 6-12 months its time to leave because it won't happen for you there.

People are great and company wants to do the right thing.,"Still not perfect for freedom of advise given, but again, other places are wayyy worse. Comp is funny. They penalized you if clients take money out even tho they grew it from the market. Never stop ending hustling. It's a good job, but not a long term career like RIA who can just wake up and keep the clients and get paid long term."

24,,Race to the bottom,2022-04-04,1.0,Director,The pay is not the worst in the industry.  The benefits are ok.,"Coming from a company that was acquired by Schwab, it has been a truly depressing experience.  I used to love my job and I actually looked forward to coming to work.   I was proud what we built and delivered.  I left work feeling satisfied almost every day.  Those feelings are gone now as Schwab completes its acquisition.  Against my better judgement, I’m waiting a little longer for positive change that will probably never come.  I will more than likely follow in the footsteps as my coworkers who have found more rewarding careers elsewhere.

It you are looking for any kind of personal or professional development, this company isn’t the place.  That is especially true as far as technology is concerned.  This company is stuck 20 years in the past and seems set on staying there.

The culture is horrible.  There is absolutely no empowerment for you to do anything.  No matter how small, every decision requires a managing directors approval.  Most of your job is spent waiting for that approval.

Schwab is the epitome of a bureaucracy.  You will spend more time navigating audit, risk, compliance, governance, review boards, and any other committee than you will spend actually engineering and building things.  Schwab loves to blame the Federal Reserve for all their problems, but in actuality it is the company culture.

Morale is low across the board and the disengagement is very high.  It’s difficult to be inspired by a bunch of people who are more focused on limiting how much impact the company has on their personal well-being than they are about their work product.

My advice to any engineer with an ounce of self respect that is considering an offer from Schwab is, don’t do it.  Spend a little extra time looking at other opportunities."

They do not listen to their employees, I don't think they ever followed through on anything they gave their word on, they are completely unwilling to change, and are very regressive/stuck in the past. Do not work here if you want growth, transparency, or empowerment. Plus, their benefits suck."

31,,Great Company - Limited Mobility,2022-03-30,4.0,Internal Audit Specialist,"- Company culture: It'd be tough to find a better group of people to work with, both inside of internal audit or within the business. Very diverse team of extremely competent folks, with a big focus on work-life balance.

- Reasonable workload: Very few instances of serious crunch below the manager level. I worked at Schwab for three years and can count the number of times I had to work significantly after hours on one hand.

- Breadth of experience: As a new auditor, you get the opportunity to touch a lot of different areas of the business and make a meaningful impact. Critical thinking is encouraged and audit managers are highly receptive to ideas coming from the Specialist/Sr. Specialist-level folks.","- Limited advancement/mobility opportunities: Raises are generally based on company performance rather than personal performance, and therefore are usually pretty small. Quarterly bonus payouts help, but don't make up for it when you're losing out to inflation. Additionally, the requirements for advancement aren't particularly clear. Having and continuing to acquire new certifications is the only way to gain any sort of chance at upward mobility, and while the company will reimburse you for the cost of exams/course materials, it's caused a lot of attrition."

You have to meet ridiculous call metrics but the company tries to make it seem like a client first job but wants you to get them off the phone if it over 9 minutes. Everything is heavily monitored, from your calls, your breaks, and lunches. Don’t even think about taking breaks in between calls it is almost prohibited. You get verbally abused by some clients and you can’t react or even hang up they just want you to sit there and take it and right back into another call. This job is mentally draining. I really can’t comprehend how it’s rated so high. It is temporarily remote but they are constantly pushing to get back in office. This job made me hate being in the comforts of my own home.

Products are competitive in a marketplace driven by fee compression
Tech is getting better","In my time at Schwab I worked at 3 different branch locations. Every branch felt like a different company though under the same leadership. Tenured FC’s would set rules and as a newer FC your weren’t suppose to question anything. As an FC you are at the mercy of branch support assigned to you. You are assigned a practice with hundreds of clients - if your CRS is not motivated to be an intergral part of sales and ops process and looks to just be there to collect a paycheck, eat company paid snacks and hide from any work and operate like this is Schwab of the 90’s ; it’s going to feel like quicksand and every year you sink even more! It’s pains me even more when I hear about FC’s getting support by younger more motivated CRSs out of call centers that want to move up in company and have a strong desire to be part of sales process. Branch leadership is missing in action/ has not clue about branch moral
At the moment. So much of the metrics don’t tell the complete story how some of the CRSs spend their time. We are small teams in the branch - one bad Apple can spoil and entire operating model. Managers need to find out who really wants to be there and who is just an actor"

Work life balance is pretty decent
The people are so nice and the ones that made it off the phones are all brilliant
Schwab is a wonderful “I am tired, I could use a very steady retirement job” with no real responsibility, accountability, or meaning","Expect things to take years to change, if you’re lucky. Expect a meeting for every possible thing - including what the next meeting will be about. Expect to sometimes have more meeting scheduled than you do hours you are expected to work (most of which you will not actually be required to be at)
Expect your management to not really know products 
Expect their management to not really seem to know much of anything except that they have somebody higher up than them who also doesn’t seem to know very much 
Expect ceremony and to be agile in name only. You can have 4 hour quarterly sprint planning meetings. You can have weekly PPI meetings. You can make up KPIs to your heart’s content! It doesn’t matter that they don’t really tell you anything, simply put it on the confluence site and attend the meeting, dutifully giving an update about this meaningless KPI.

Once I told somebody where I work. They asked me “don’t you want more than this?” - and the truth is that the bureaucracy and ceremony here will beat you into accepting mediocrity. It’s not terrible, it’s just the sound of slowly dying."

213,,Metrics,2022-01-29,1.0,Client Services Representative Charles Schwab,I can't think of any pros,They set up your metrics goals to purposefully make it difficult to get bonuses and they intentionally calculate the employees reviews to make it as difficult as possible to get a raise. It is practically sheer luck if you have good enough metrics to increase your salary. Everything is timed so don't expect any down time. Its just call after call of toxic customers who are upset because their card doesn't work or any number of things. These customers are angry by the time they are talking to you so prepare to be called some inappropriate names. They don't give people promotions based on merit. You will be on the phone constantly.

-Paid time off for license preparation (S7/63/66/etc.)
-Majority of managers are really solid individuals that care about you as a person. Honestly, I can't speak highly enough about my first manager.
-Decent benefits","Here is where things are going to get lengthy. First of all I want to start with some background...

I was a COVID-19 hire right out of college. Had no background in finance, but needed a job (when nothing else was available) so I applied at Schwab. Other reviews are exaggerating regarding the training process. There are 2 weeks of standard training, followed by 2 weeks of hybrid training/easy phone calls with clients (not just 1 single week like some people have mentioned). After that you are assigned to your team and thrown to the wolves. That is where I actually want to start this review.

People need to realize this is 100% a call center position. Schwab doesn't do a great job of explaining that to you during the interview process, or even on the application. I had numerous coworkers during my tenure that applied/accepted the position with no knowledge that they would be on the phones for 8 hours a day. Because of that, there are a lot of things you need to know going into the job. I will list some below.

-Your calls are HEAVILY monitored. You will have coaching once a week with your manager and you will basically randomly review calls with them. They can also pull calls at any time and listen in if they would like. Basically, whenever you are talking to a client, there is a chance someone in management is listening in the background.

-There are very strict metrics you MUST follow. You must hit your breaks on time. You must take a certain number of calls a day. You cannot take too long in between calls. There is a report sent out every morning that shows your specific metrics. They are not easy to hit and I saw numerous people (who I would consider bright) struggle to even hit the low end of the metrics.

-OSAT. Basically OSAT is the survey they send to clients regarding their phone call with you. They are absolute garbage. If a client gives you a 6 out of 7 on the survey, they counts as a ZERO. You must get a perfect 7 out of 7 in order for it to benefit you. Also, Schwab has a zero tolerance policy regarding these. I received a negative survey where the client had mistaken me for another rep (they had called in numerous times so it makes sense that they were confused as to who they had spoken with). That one ""fake"" survey is the reason why I missed a quarterly promotion (one of the final straws for me with Schwab). 

Now those things mentioned about aren't really ""complaints"". Pretty standard practice for a call center, but I think it's important for people to know what they are about to get themself into. Now let's talk about the real gripes I have with Schwab.

The pay is ATROCIOUS. After my first year with Schwab I had....

-Exceeded expectations every quarter
-Passed the SIE, S7, and S63 all on my first attempt
-Been nominated to the advisory counsel
-Taken zero sick/vacation days
-Was the highest performing individual on my team, even beating out tenured reps that had been there for decades.

At the end of my first year I was making $22 an hour. Absolutely ridiculous. I had friends teaching preschool making significantly more than me.

The time off process is a nightmare. Because it's a call center, they need a specific number of reps on the phone at all times. Goodluck getting off around the holiday season. You basically have to put in PTO requests months in advance. You're better off just taking sick days than dealing with their PTO system. Oh one more thing I almost forgot....you are required to work 2 holidays. Say goodbye to your labor day or memorial day weekend.

Their ""professional development"" plan is fine. They walk you through how it works from day 1, but actually moving up in the company is a nightmare. For the life of me I can't understand why there are individuals that have been there for more than a few years. Seriously, if you are a top performer and have been there for years, your pay will max out at around $30 an hour unless you go down the management route. If you think that you can ""work at Schwab for years and slowly make your way up into the 6 figures range"" that is NEVER going to happen.

Now for the big stuff. Their website and systems are TERRIBLE. Things break probably once a month, so when angry customers call in guess who has to deal with them......YOU! There was a period in 2021 where we had over 10,000 people on hold at once because our systems broke. People were waiting hours just to speak with a rep. It ruins the client experience, it makes the reps job basically impossible, and us call center reps were the ones who got penalized for that with all the terrible survey scores. There is nothing worse than hopping on the phones at 8AM only to see there were already 1000 calls on hold. I knew reps who literally broke down in tears on a call because they were so overworked. 

Finally, attrition and manager turnover is a nightmare. Within my first 3 months of working there every single person on my team had left and was replaced with new employees. During my tenure (of around 18 months) I saw probably 20 people come and go, just within my small team. The manager turnover is also insane. I had 6 different managers, some were great, some shouldn't be employed by Schwab. There is no consistency which makes the team dynamic really difficult.

Overall, if you are wanting to get into the financial services field I would recommend avoiding Schwab (or any big firm) like the plague. Go find a small advisory firm near you where they'll actually care about your growth and pay you an actual living wage. To Schwab you are just a number at a call center. They are constantly hiring for this position because people are constantly leaving."

324,,We're almost there,2021-12-02,4.0,Financial Consultant,"The company is here for clients, first and last. I feel empowered as a fiduciary on behalf of clients to be open and honest. I never feel like I'm selling to clients, or offering products/services they don't need.
Good benefits - insurance is decent, HSA is great, PTO/sick time and sabbatical every 5 years is wonderful. 
The collaborative environment is perfect to learn, grow, and develop your career. The options are almost limitless (for corporate). Once you get through your two years on the phones to doors are open to progress to wherever your ambition takes you.
Schwab offers $5k/yr reimbursement to complete your degree (undergrad or masters), or towards professional designations (CFP, CWS, etc.).
I am encouraged with the various Employee Resource Groups to actively volunteer in the local community (paid volunteer time!). The company as a whole is conservative corporate America, but I still feel seen and heard with the sponsored LGBTQ+ group and support from my coworkers and management. I'm proud to be a Schwabbie.","The FC comp structure is fairly standard but it still feels like I'm getting shortchanged. The inflation adjustment from 2021 to 2022 was minimal at best. 
The feeling of cranking the hamster wheel is real. If I'm not working I feel I am missing out on opportunities. Its part of the gig, doesn't make it any better though."

329,,Financial Crimes specialist,2021-11-30,1.0,Fraud Analyst,Pros: partnering business units are very helpful; workshops hosted for financial health; employees are nice/helpful (for the most part).,"Cons: training/on-boarding; career advancement seldom happens based on meritocracy; tied to your role for a year (unable to swap departments). 
Leadership strongly emphasizes hierarchical approach. Managers are unable to cover for their subordinates. Time off has a number of stipulations before you can actually get any time off. IT issues frequently, systems crash; play catch-up/fire drill."

They pay you the same as every other customer service rep even though you have more experience so you are grossly underpaid and they are profiting off of cheap educated professionals. The training is only 3 weeks and then they throw you in blind and its terrifying since you are moving a ton of money around and can easily mess it up. They don't tell you that you wont be working a 9-5, you work one of the schedules that's available, such as 4 days a week for 10 hours a day. It is so emotionally and physically draining, and they are always understaffed so you don't get breaks for your meetings like they say you will."

There are dozens of colleagues who are only willing to do the bare minimum, so management highly recognizes and rewards those individuals who go the extra mile. 

I entered the company as a Financial Service Professional (customer service line) with zero finance background and am now on the fast track to make an advisor role in their proprietary wealth management division.

The company will sponsor and pay for all materials for you to obtain security licenses. They even paid for my CFP education program at full reimbursement.","If you start off in the customer service line it can be very mundane and boring, but sticking it through pays dividends. 

Starting off pay initially is lower than competitors but in the long run Schwab does offer quarterly raises with no cap."

468,,"Unethical, Monopolistic Company with an Abrasive Culture. Absolutely avoid if you work in UX or technology",2021-09-21,1.0,User Experience Designer,"- Pay and benefits are higher than the industry average. Schwab has more revenue and capital than they know what to do with.
- Schwab is massive company and there are many benefits that come with that, including opportunities to collaborate and learn.","Schwab's MO is ""if we can't beat them, we'll buy them."" They've bought dozens of companies over the years. Even though they're experienced with acquisition, they are not fair to the employees of the companies they buy. They bought my company and then did not provide any communication about lay-offs for months. They were silent on basic questions. As the merge started, they walled my colleagues off from their digital tools and infrastructure even as they required us to take on work. At every turn during the acquisition, they were either silent and confusing. They didn't take feedback from their newly acquired employees even though my department and leaders were much more knowledgable than theirs.

Schwab has a culture of passive-aggressiveness that is so widely known within the company that it has a name: ""Schwab Nice."" This is when colleagues are polite to your face and provide vaguely positive feedback, and then later demean and criticize in closed doors. Direct, honest communication is discouraged which undermines collaboration and productivity. 

Schwab is obsessed with share-outs, presentations, and other forms of superficial collaboration. If you need to give a presentation, plan on giving it several times over the course of a week. It's tedious.

Schwab likes to pretend that it's a technology company but Schwab is a financial company first and foremost. Because their MO is to buy up companies and then ignore the acquired companies' expertise, they don't have a culture, vision, or knowledge on how to effectively build digital products. Their process is waterfall, tedious and slow. They're stodgy. If you work in technology, you will be very frustrated here. 

Schwab is a stuffy, boring, unethical, toxic monopoly. I would highly encourage you to work at their competitors, at least until Schwab buys them."

494,,Wonderful role for people who are sales focused,2021-09-11,3.0,Financial Consultant,"Working at Charles Schwab provides opportunities to grow, work alongside like-minded people, and be a part of something bigger than yourself. From the top-down, you can feel the dedication that everyone plays to always be better and hussle to provide the best client experience. 

As an employee, it is expected that you perform at the top of your game. With that comes many perks and awards for your achievement. Whether it's being acknowledged for a year-long excellent service award or be recognized for an exceptional client experience, Schwab does right at making sure we feel special. The culture and expectations are to always put the client first.

This is a sales role. If you like sales and getting paid for it, this is the perfect role for you.

The pay is about average in the industry. As a financial consultant, you get a base salary plus sales pay. The base salary stays the same or fluctuates depending upon your level. The company offers 401k, healthcare, discounted employee stock, and other perks.

Through the pandemic, the company was accommodating to changes at home and was gracious in making sure employees were taken care of. 

The company has a high growth projection over the next 10 years and is amazing to be a part of an organization that started as the ""small guy"" back in 1975.","A financial consultant is a sales role. Plain and simple... With the high pressure from the top, you are required to perform based upon new assets, advice enrollments, good survey responses from clients, and planning. With these expectations in mind, financial consultants are at the mercy of our internal partners to make it all happen. In order to be successful and be congratulated by the company, you have to transfer the ownership of being a financial advisor to others all while doing as little planning and service as possible. This is compounded by the fact that Schwab started out as a discount broker and every client expects their assigned financial consultant to provide them with top-tier service. Even if the self-directed clients in your practice ignore all your emails/phone calls. When these clients call the 800 service line and get a bad experience (which happens often with lots of employee turnover), you get hit hard when they reply to a survey badly which counts negatively towards your numbers. Overall, this role is a grind and requires a lot of mental juggling to prevent you from getting too angry or upset.

As a frontline worker, there is a lot that goes into keeping the employees informed. The problem is that management/corporate are very disconnected from the client at this time. I'm not sure what information corporate is getting or what branch managers are feeding to the top. There is a lot of negativity in the branch environment right now. With that, I often find myself confused on the corporate conference calls because it's often regurgitated material from the news and/or conferences in prior quarters. What is also infuriating is that the company spends a lot of time talking about how good the company is from a performance and financial perspective while folks are being laid off left and right.

Another thing is scale. Schwab is so focused on the scale right now I nauseate from the word as it's seeping into a toxic work environment. The expectation to grow is good however now it is coming at the expense of cutting the client experience away with their dedicated financial consultant and letting high performers cut corners. As a result, employees are treated unfairly by management when they do not perform. From a pay/promotion perspective, your growth as a Financial Consultant is subjective from the branch manager which is not easily defined.

The one main gripe I have about the company is financial planning. They have stripped everything from the financial consultant role down to talking to clients and documenting the conversation. It's like stripping a chef from his kitchen. Now I sit on the outside while silently looking at the cooks as they try to put together a meal. It's a disconnected process entirely that often leaves the client with a bad experience. This is incredibly infuriating as many clients start tasting the half-cooking plate of slop and immediately leave to walk down the street to a competitor. Financial Consultants are on the hook on this and are incredibly stressed.

One last thing I will say is the incredible pressure from management. If you cannot deal with an ounce of stress or anxiety, DO NOT GO INTO THIS ROLE. After your initial training, you better have a pipeline ready to go and click the mouse, or else you will be getting a call from the manager who.... looks at numbers and tells you what you probably already know... ""your numbers look bad, DO BETTER."" With that being said, there is a little coaching and too many managers who have no expertise or have little experience being an advisor themselves."

- Heavy reliance on contractors; on many projects you will be brought in after the contracted portion of the team has already defined the architecture, leaving you to either limp along with painful design choices or redesign from the ground up
- The shift to remote has not gone well. There have been several well-meaning attempts to reward employees for their loyalty to the company, but it seems like no one truly looked at the cultural impact of staff working from home to determine how it could be mitigated
- Your yearly raise and bonus are highly dependent on your relationship with your manager and director. If they like you, the raise/bonus will usually be good. If they don't, they won't fight for you in the roundtable discussions and your raise/bonus will suck"

The existing leadership is not capable of delivering that. They are 15-20 years or more behind industry peers maturity and capabilities and that is largely unacknowledged and unrecognized amongst leadership. There is a complete absence of engineering culture, product management, and leadership. There is a preference to reward firefighting and completely ignore fire prevention. Management culture also prefers to subjectively talk and PowerPoint problems to death instead of using data analysis to help drive faster decision making and movement toward resolution. Nothing Schwab is doing with technology is groundbreaking or innovative. The majority of the work is to address problems many other larger enterprises already solved 10-15 years ago. Schwab needs to learn how to listen to and use this experience and knowledge from the individual team members who bring much of this experience to the table.

I have worked with a truly stellar team of people that I would wholeheartedly endorse.","If not for others experiencing similar challenges, I might be questioning whether things really are so bad, but unfortunately, this has undeniably been among my worst experiences with an employer. The quote, “Culture eats strategy for breakfast,” rings true here.

I came to Schwab via its acquisition of TD Ameritrade, and what anyone might expect to be a challenging integration of two large companies was made so much worse than it should have been. In terms of the work itself, I was unable to garner the level of respectful engagement, active leadership support, or tangible resources within the organization to effectively do what I needed to get done – the work I’d been tasked to lead. There were a lot of jokes among Schwab veteran employees about how slowly things move – even adopting a new piece of software can take months or even upwards of a year. 

I communicated with my direct manager regularly about the persistent barriers my team was facing and the decline in morale that came with talented people not being able to make meaningful progress. The conclusion was that I, personally, was the problem, because they knew that I was not feeling a fit with the role and the organizational culture. This has been frustrating on a very personal level, and I have plenty of painful anecdotes I could share. But more importantly, in an organization facing a very high attrition rate overall, and with mental health of employees front-and-center as a major issue, having leadership say that the problem resides with individuals and not in the system strikes me as dangerous. In my final few weeks of working at the company, my manager talked both about promoting me and about potentially terminating me, which illustrates the lack of clarity about what the organization (or perhaps my manager) wants or needs – even when asked directly and repeatedly."

A good ole boy network with a belief they are fine doing what they are doing.
PM's do not drive anything; only report status; no ownership at all.
60% of my projects, where PM's are not allowed to manage the budget, were fiscally reckless by large magnitudes.
Only the chosen few get their bonus or get promoted.
Schwab boasts it will not tolerate retaliation, but if you speak the truth in a lessons learned session, retaliation will be real and imminent.
The VP's are a kind of a thug mafia, and their lack of competency is costing Schwab tens of millions of dollars every year - which could easily be avoided."

Offices are new with great amenities onsite. Certain technology teams (Cloud implementation, data science, data modeling, digital products) bring in great people and do great work with the best-in-class tools and mature delivery processes.","Many people management policies are antiquated and don't reflect the majority technology focus of the current organization (e.g., requiring everyone to work in the office even when the entire team was disbursed across time zones and would never be in the same space; offering very limited PTO except for a 6 week sabbatical every 5 years; rarely supporting continuing education and certifications). Quarterly layoffs following each merger and acquisition are demoralizing. Many critical technology functions are bogged down by middle management bloat and supervisors with more business than technical skill. Feedback from employees is collected often but not implemented. Management is rarely transparent about major changes within the organization and teams are often in a reactionary state to recover from impacts rather than being able to plan along to minimize disruptions."

Schwab demonstrates the best of what corporate America can be.","Schwab is working towards more diversity at the executive committee level, but, objectively, it's not there yet. I would love to see Schwab further commit to environmental responsibility--and demand it of vendors (like the Schwab Cafe). There is some good effort there, but this is an opportunity to lead that aligns with Schwab's orientation toward planning and preparing for the future. I would like to see only organic gardening practices on site (no damaging herbicides or pesticides), re-use of our own composting, reliance on reusing dishes and silverware (removal of plastic options), and investing in renewable energy infrastructure (solar, wind, geothermal) on campuses."

- Schwab is attempting to make a culture shift away from the financial services “boys club” at a grassroots level","- There is a deep lack of diversity on the board and C-suite so the decisions made typically cater to the male workforce who are not primary caretakers. The CEO regularly positions bettering our clients in opposition to bettering our workforce.
- If you are in a role that is client facing, you do not have the autonomy to disconnect a call if a client is being verbally abusive, including using racial slurs. Your metrics that your career progression is based will suffer if you have an accent or name that sounds foreign to a client because you are scored on what the client thinks of you and never an objective and educated reviewer, such as a manager.

578,,Politics run rampant... it's exhausting,2021-07-29,2.0,Anonymous Employee,Decent pay. Some really good people to roll through the punches with. Attempt to accommodate work-life balance for lower-level employees.,"Execs are extremely out of touch with the reality of their workforce. They don't have the time to address or consider lower level desires to be heard (unless of course it is a benefit of the client) 
The idea that a happy workforce will take better care of clients is completely lost here. 
Instead how ""Through the clients eyes"" is enforced is by a cutthroat political environment driven by titles and personal agendas. Progress is accomplished by enforcing fear of mistakes. 
If you don't have Managing Director or higher in your title, don't bother expressing an opinion or contributing in any meaningful way. (Also, if MD or or above is in your title, do not expect to ever unplug during time off. You WILL have to call in for important meetings). Instead put your head down, keep your mouth shut, and do what you're told. Straying from this will likely be a political misstep causing you to be blacklisted for eternity.
Oh and if you need something from a partner dept. be prepared to throw around an SVP's name to get any sort of response. 
The benefits and time off are also pretty terrible until you've spent 10 years at the company. Sabbaticals are the carrot dangled in front of your face as a reason to not improve, but by the time you get a sabbatical you are so beyond burnt out, that it is a saving grace to return your mental state to semi-coherent."

580,,A cult-like experience with many pleasant people,2021-07-28,2.0,Director,"The compensation is good. Many Schwab colleagues are very nice people. It can be a strange environment for outsiders and newcomers, but many Schwabbies have figured out that if you keep your head down and do your job, you can have a long, fruitful career here.

As long as the cultural issues don't collect on their debts, the company will likely continue to remain profitable.","This is an arrogant company that truly believes it is humble. A lot of people who work at Schwab have only ever worked at Schwab, and since they love Schwab and think it's the best company, they truly believe that everything Schwab is doing must therefore be perfect. Many Schwabbies have no outside experience against which to judge this assessment. I value continuous improvement and vigilance against stagnation, but I have been told many times that Schwabbies don't like to hear that they aren't the best, so be careful about implying things could be better. 

Meanwhile, there have been many new hires in the past year, plus thousands of people who came in from the TD Ameritrade and USAA acquisitions. So there are the career-long devotees and then more than 10,000 relatively new employees who don't understand the peculiar culture they've arrived in. There are significant cultural disconnects as a result.

Our employee technology is woefully inadequate, but since we have to pretend we are the best at everything, leaders tell us how great our tools are. If you have ever worked at another company, or have a spouse or friends who work at another company, or if you are even aware of other tools, you know this is not true. So which is it, are our leaders lying to us, or are they that out of touch that they believe they're telling the truth?

Looking outward to our clients, our technology and product offerings lag behind our competitors, yet we praise ourselves for being innovators and disruptors.

I don't know how this say-do gap changes. Middle-managers behave in a manner that suggests they are terrified of senior management. This is not a culture that tolerates managing up, because the most senior executives are perceived to be infallible. It is common for Executive and Senior VPs to not speak directly with employees below the VP level; those employees must go through a VP intermediary. Consequently, the middle layer is bogged down through relentless bureaucratic complexity and the illusion of collaboration and productivity.

Leadership comes across as very arrogant and out of touch, but they will constantly tell you how humble they are. They avoid direct interaction and stifle opportunities for direct feedback. Recently the company mechanism for asking questions of leadership was taken away because questions were perceived to be too negative."

664,,"Terrific people and culture, but not at the cutting edge of technology",2021-06-23,4.0,Security Analyst,"The work culture at this financial institution is comforting and just about everyone I've worked with wants to help and collaborate instead of fostering a competitive and selfish environment. There's a lot of ERGs that were actually nice to be a part of and there's a sense of community across several of the teams. In general, teams are laid back and work isn't stressful. Pay is decently competitive.",The lax working culture at Schwab comes with slower rollouts of breaking edge technology and platforms. Employees are on MS Teams and using agile but it's definitely a few years past it's due. Several of the internal applications and services haven't been updated in what feels like over a decade. Upper management pushes for newer working models but they are implemented much slower than they should.
665,,A large cargo ship made in the 1990s,2021-06-23,1.0,Director,"Competitive Pay - Salary and perks can be above average under the right conditions
Acceptable benefits - Average benefits compare to any B/C tier well-known companies but sits far behind from FANG
Time-off policy - time off balance builds up fast and you can cash out at departure. 30 day sabbatical for every 5 years(subject to change)

Overall, this is an old fashioned Fin(not FinTech, there is a difference) to stay and coast. You can comfortably sit and ride the wave for a long time. It is suitable for anyone that doesn't have a good amount of ambition or drive to change.","It's important to say this upfront: Schwab is extremely silo-ed by large business units. This means the head of the BU will directly impact the experience you are going to have with this company as a whole. Pay attention to what type of comments are left and their positions. There is an overwhelming amount of negative reviews from folks who worked in IT field, which I can personally attest to. 

keeping it real and simple:  Schwab IT brings you back to the 1990s and the management is proud of it. Senior management, middle management and so called ""tech leads"" are so busy keeping up with the image while simple tasks can't be executed smoothly. You will be stopped and challenged every step of the way for bringing in new ideas. The reason behind that is simple, fake image is more important than actual productivity. 
Not many of us wants to be a hero, I get it. This is a great place for anyone that just want to sit and chillax. Nobody does anything effectively anyways, and it's the norm."

And, yes, of course they are hiring (because if any company posts even just one job opening, then technically they are ""hiring"").","They keep swallowing other companies whole, to where it now feels like we are all bogged down by far too much. This is during unprecedented times of record market activity. Client accounts, assets, data centers, technologies, products = all need to be migrated over. They plan to accomplish this by way of: far too many meetings, and entirely too much bureaucracy, and review boards. Everything feels top down, with way too many layers of management. But seems they have a solution to too many people... so,

The worst part is they have been doing, and are committed to continue with: Quarterly cuts! - this is mostly to legacy TDA, but also legacy schwab staff as well, this will be for the next few years! They have repeatedly communicated that reductions will continue until a little after the TD Ameritrade conversion is completed. So, likely until ~ 2024! Really horrible atmosphere, and feeling overall. If you seek any sense of stability, or being valued by an employer as more than just some $$ number to them, then look elsewhere."

680,,Horrible management! Slow processes!,2021-06-16,1.0,Manager,You will get a paycheck,"I was working on building a product that they decided to de-prioritize. (Fair enough, it happens.) My team and I were moved into a new position with no discussion around our interest in the work or any overview of the scope or new expectation. It was clear that instead of treating us like individual we we’re just resources to the firm. The new product had 3 “owners”... getting alignment on the goal took 4 months! No work was done for month while management very slowly debated the politics of how this work would get accomplished. In the meantime about 8 of us sat around with no work. And when we asked how to be valuable we were told we were being too needy! When they finally decided to kick it off they assigned so many ppl to the team and several additional layers of management. Schwab loves process and hierarchy, but these teams are so bloated. I worked for a different financial services company previously doing the same work with half the ppl bc they actually empowered us to do our job. No one at Schwab is empowered to make decisions except leadership so it takes forever to get buy in. They’ll tell you it is because they are “nice” so they need to be “inclusive”. But you can be nice by being fair, trusting your team, and allowing them to efficiently do their work - none of this happens at Schwab.

I’d suggest anyone who is considering joining Schwab should interview the team to understand how decisions get made and what process you’ll be required to follow. If you are looking for a fast past exciting place to work this won’t be a good fit. If you want to put client needs first and think about innovation you’ll get frustrated quickly. Most of your time is spent in meetings telling ppl about the work you’re doing than actually doing any work."

- 401k matching. 
- HSA with health rewards/contributions
- Ability to opt into company stock plan","- If you’re not a kiss-up, you won’t be promoted.

- The organization's leadership has no grasp of work-life balance nor any real openness to true innovation. Whether it is as a broker, tech support, advisor services, SPS, global, operations, etc they burn everyone out to the point of quitting. There is spectacular mismangement and horrible non-existent planning on every level and in every department.

- Misogyny and double standards is very much alive here. Many women colleagues encountered sexual harassment here and had to file claims against these men. What I learned - HR is clearly there to protect the company and not the employees.

- The executives and ""leadership"" pretend to care about their employees, and it is shocking that any employee actually buys that BS. Schwab underpays compared to every other company whether you're in wealth management, information systems, product management, cyber security, etc.

- Weak, out-of-touch, cringey company who were one of the last financial companies to go remote when COVID hit. Constant emails ""regretfully"" telling all employees that they are expected to come into the offices despite Covid, because ""current technology can't support us all working from home at the same time"" - which of course was a lie. The following week everyone was working from home, because of the enormous uproar and pushback. They are itching to send the company back to the offices.

- The sales pitch often told is that ""there are SO MANY departments to advance into and Schwab will support your career pathing!"" Don't be fooled, career growth is met with so much resistance. You're expected to remain in a role for at least 1-2 years even if you express that the job is not a good fit and you're miserable. Expect to be pigeon-holed and not genuinely helped to move into a more suitable role. You will likely be stuck working on a team or product where you don’t get to use your full skillset and will stagnate.

- Cafe is expensive, parking sucks, out-dated systems and no autonomy. You are treated as a order taker, not as an adult with a brain. 

- The cheap chinese food, pizza and kid-sized candies are the common choice when trying to elevate the company's morale or to celebrate a massive achievement. We're not college students, put more thought behind your gifts and rewards. 

- No retention bonuses nor company profit-sharing bonsues."

Probably easier role in a metro market or near large employers with many employees. Pay is fair, not fantastic. 3-6% of ongoing revenue goes to FC. IE 6% of 71bps in management fees on $500k account or $213 per year for 1/2 million managed acct and $1k sales pay. At the time sales pay for new conversions was $2k per million in assets in managed accounts. For things that are more outsourced and lower FC time such as robo-advisor or 3rd party RIA it was 1/2 to 1/3rd of that for ongoing pay. Sales pay was the same assuming you correctly checked all the boxes to qualify. Definitely want emphasis on sales vs retention. Mostly variable Comp.

713,,Great place to grow.,2021-06-03,5.0,Senior Software Engineering Manager,"Sky is the limit when it comes to personal growth. If you put your best foot forward and you are serious about your own development you will have many opportunities to grow. WLB is great. Resources are available and at your disposal. I went from intern, developer, grew into a sr. engineer, technical lead and now I lead several teams.

 

Went through leadership program we offer among other trainings and it really helped me succeed in my current roles and future roles.

 

I recommend Schwab at any level in your career.",There can be some process overhead with the amount of red tape but we are working to improve and automate.
714,,Call center,2021-06-03,2.0,FC Academy,They pay to get you licensed,No development to be an FC. Inbound calls all day everyday. Do not prioritize employees.
715,,A place to call home,2021-06-03,5.0,Senior Team Manager,"- Flexible work schedules support work-life balance
- Telecommuting opportunities
- Great family-like culture, which is rare at a large Firm.
- Focuses a lot of time and energy on employee trainings and leadership development. 
- Several growth and development opportunities available.
- Spends a lot of time and money on their Diversity & Inclusion program.
- Employee Resource Groups make everyone feel like they belong.","- Vert conservative on outside business activities (i.e. employees are unable to hold a Real Estate license) 
- Not enough diversity at the Senior Leadership/Officer levels."
716,,Great Place to Work!,2021-06-03,5.0,"Senior Manager, Business Analysis","I love that there's so much potential for career growth and many different paths to choose from. Some examples include people management, project management, and technology among many others. At Schwab, you can chart your own career path based on the things that you're interested in. Leadership is always willing to help you towards your goals and provide their support.",I wish there was more flexibility in working from home.
717,,Great opportunities with supportive management,2021-06-03,5.0,Senior Manager,"Great culture, people here are smart, talented and take pride in what they do. I've enjoyed working here for 5+ years now. It's a growing company and opportunities are there for those who want and put in the work to advance. Really friendly and inclusive work environment.","Like any company this size, there are bad managers/people in every group. Certain organizations are better than others and your experience here will largely depend on which organization you are a part of."
718,,Prepare for some angry clients,2021-06-02,2.0,FCA Academy,"Experience speaking with clients, paid study time, training, support thru academy, direct path to becoming an FC, coaching, community, culture","Constant website malfunctions, often resulting clients to not having access to funds and volume spikes. The customer service line is understaffed, leading to long hold times and angry clients. Difficult to communicate with branches when clients want to make an appt. Performance based heavily on client rating, which is not in your control if they are frustrated with company. Timelines for testing and bonuses also delayed heavily. This job is incredibly taxing on mental health and only leads to one career at the company- being an FC."
719,,Not the right fit for the time,2021-06-02,1.0,Senior Specialist,Pay is great for the city.,"Management, I have never had such a bad experience with management."
720,,The worst financial services company I ever worked for,2021-06-01,1.0,Financial Representative,"You will get a paycheck, and there are benefits. However, if you are a single parent with young children, and high medical bills , think twice. The Medical Plan is an HSA with a high deductible. Schwab did contribute $1,000 / year, but that is still way below the out-of-pocket max ( $5,000+ for family) . I personally saw several single moms struggle because of this. However, for a person who wants to reduce their taxable income, and can afford to max out the annual contributions, the HSA would be attractive.","Ever since the present CEO took over, salaries , and benefits, have been under constant attack year after year. Don't be fooled by a seemingly decent starting salary, and talk about a big bonus. You will quickly find that no matter how strong your performance is, your raises will be below par, and you never get the max bonus that was mentioned during the interview process. It is a classic ""bait and switch strategy"". The only way to truly get ahead is to keep getting promoted to higher paying positions. To get a true perspective, read the negative reviews, and avoid the one or two sentence positive reviews, they are planted by management, and the talent acquisition people. They truly know how to work the ratings system, and make this horrible company seem appealing. BEWARE!"

727,,DON'T WORK HERE!!!!!,2021-05-28,2.0,Vice President Financial Consultant,Good benefits and pay similar to any big company.,"This is a micro-managed sales position and not a career. Branch Managers put immense pressure on reps to SELL to clients awful products, when the clients don't want it in the first place. Every day you have meetings to discuss how many contacts you made, how many buttons you clicked, etc. You are constantly in a negative environment and the Rep turnover his huge. One rep will be fired every year, and the rare 1% of reps that have been there more than 10 years are favored and fed the best leads.

You will be forced to SELL product to clients and not develop good relationships. Once you are FORCED out by branch managers you will have nowhere else to work because they have a strong legal team that comes after you. They care more about their Branch Managers and upper management than they do clients or their reps. 

You will likely not last more than 3-5 years and then you will have to start all over building your client base anyway. Just start somewhere else and never do business with Schwab."

I had high hopes for Schwab but all I witnessed in the last few months is that Schwab has immediately added a few additional layers of silos and and pointless Corporate rituals of importance to stroke the egos of the people above all while avoiding basic human decency.

Will go through layoffs fairly often, and they seem to always layoff some of the best team members when they do, while toxic ones linger or worse, climb the ladder. The company is also constantly waffling on how much development they want to be offshore, and often times the agile team structure breaks down due to missing support or a team that is simply too large."

Since I joined a year ago, we've lost at least 25-30% of our group. The culture is terrible. Something as simple as an database update takes 5-6 months because other groups within Schwab are incredibly slow and inefficient. The culture is so much a blame culture that it is sickening. There is no ownership, even among leadership. Everything is someone else's problem."
786,,Cisgender White Men are welcome to apply,2021-05-06,1.0,Registered Customer Service Representative,"Get your licenses, get something that looks impressive on a resume","This place is an HR nightmare. If you wear pants and you are a woman, you get reported. If you turn down someone's advances or report them to HR when they become extremely unprofessional, you get retaliated against. I was repeatedly sexually harassed by clients on a recorded line and nothing was done about it leading to more conversations in the future with that person. Women can only get so far before they are told they cannot advance because of their ""brand"". They hold you to impossible call center standards and push corporate BS like ""World Class Service"" down your throat. Abusive clients get to stay depending on how much money they brought in. Ever since budget cuts we saw hardworking, loyal coworkers get laid off and benefits/ treats in the office went away. They couldn't even afford to give out Chuck's book to everyone. WFH was a disaster and they gave you equipment that made it impossible to work, but you got reprimanded for not doing your job with said equipment. Forced OT, forced overnight and weekend shifts, forced working holidays. People are promoted to manager roles based on their personal relationships. If you speak up on something that is not right, you get retaliated against. I and several other people who have worked there are literally traumatized. They even pick and choose who to give 2 weeks pay to when you put in your notice. I was immediately let go without pay for that professional courtesy, and others in my exact position were let go with pay. They make it seem like if you are at the call center, you can advance to any department you like but the reality is that there are few departments hiring and they mostly pick internally. You don't get your own desk and have to compete with your coworkers to get a desk to work at. If you get sick for more than 3 consecutive days you have to file for short term disability with Sedgewick, who are highly unorganized. Programs are archaic and crash surprisingly often for such an established company. Most of your time at the job is helping the elderly work their computer. This is an actual high school. 100% don't recommend past getting your license and if you're desperate for money."

Work/life balance is also good.","The generally ""nice"" attitude has its drawbacks. People are often unwilling to give criticism when its most important -- whether it's on a tech project, an entire team, an operational process, etc. This makes us too slow in adapting to the changing business environment. On that note, the software is really poor. Whether it's internally made or externally bought, none of the applications are good (I mean that). Internal efforts to modernize are heinously slow, and the IT department's philosophy appears stuck in the stone age when they come to business users with ""solutions""."

Senior management uses a lot of buzz words - change, talent will win, associates matter. However, in practice, there is a lack of desire to have positive (or any) changes. The culture, especially as driven by VPs and above, is political and change agents are not appreciated. On top of legacy TDA associates, there has been additional attrition due to job satisfaction issues.

Managers provide a lot of feedback and keep communication open. I respect the company.",Working a call center job forces you to sacrifice your mental and sometimes physical health. Call coaches get switched so often that it makes it hard to build a relationship and make improvements. Metrics are very strict as well as adhering to your schedule. Positive feedback is rarely offered it’s almost always negative which is discouraging.

829,,Great place for entry-level,2021-04-20,4.0,Client Services Representative Charles Schwab,Great place to start your career in finance,More support to learn more about industry or jobs
830,,Great Employer,2021-04-19,5.0,Associate,"I work in the call center for help with 401k plans. Pros include:
-No prior experience required (truly none, I had zero experience with call centers or finance before being hired)
-Friendly Staff
-No pressure to make sales
-Generous bonuses
-Very little over time required (1-3hrs of OT is typically mandatory each year), but if you want more overtime, it’s available.
-Great career development opportunities (they prefer to promote from within and there’s a ton of departments you can jump to)
-Lots of work schedules to choose from (IE 4x10 shifts available, early morning teams, closing teams, normal 9-5 also available)
-Career stability (Schwab is a smart company, they manage their operations well. I am never worried over potential layoffs, even when the pandemic first hit).
-Corporate culture is the best I’ve ever experienced. Management is down-to-earth and realistic. Goals are never absurd. Communication is open. They actually make the improvements you recommend.
-If you’re not great at managing your finances now, you will be after working at Schwab for a few months. Financial literacy is a side effect of the job, which can put you in a much better place for your own retirement goals.","-There is a steep learning curve in the beginning. If you have prior experience with retirement plans or even call centers in general, you’ll likely adapt pretty quickly. For everyone else without this experience, expect a few difficult weeks as you take it all in. Initial training is around 4-6 weeks. They can’t cover everything that will come up, so after training, the first 4-8 weeks on the phones can be a bit stressful. Once you’ve acclimated to the environment, the job becomes pretty simple after that.
-Various technology systems need improvement, but they aren’t unmanageable.
-It’s a call center, so you’re busy most of the day. There are slow hours for early morning teams, and closing teams."

In part, because of a lack of leadership support, but also because they fear anything perceived slightly risky. And to make decisions they require consensus which slows any hope of progress down. Very few have autonomy to make decisions that will allow the team to move faster."

Great if you want to eventually become a financial consultant in a branch 
Opportunities for overtime
You never have to work beyond your scheduled hours on the phone, and if you do you get overtime.","In this role taking inbound calls, it can be very stressful and monotonous to just answer call after call
Way too strict about clocking in and out at times (taking your lunch from 12:06-12:38 instead of 12:00-12:30 is frowned upon)
Not a lot of upward opportunities if you don’t want to work in a branch

Provide programs to expand your knowledge and groups to associate your beliefs with. Prides itself on doing what is best for the customer and putting the customer first while maintaining high quality products and employees.,Processes can take some time to get approved in order to implement new ideas or improvements.

883,,Inefficient,2021-03-30,3.0,Licensed Financial Services Representative,Everything besides the efficiency of the CX side of Schwab,Calls aren't filtered by importance.

Since the minimum to open an account at Schwab is 0$. You will have clients calling in with 100$ screaming at you because they have a restriction on their account."
895,,Growth opportunities,2021-03-28,4.0,Financial Consultant,A great company to get started in the financial industry.,Limited choices of growth opportunities for seasoned advisors in the field. You either need to relocate to the hubs or be good at politics.
896,,Not for young professionals,2021-03-26,1.0,Information Technology,"- People are generally nice 
- Decent work life balance 
- Good place to be to retire","- Very outdated technology stack, decades behind, many legacy systems still around. No long term roadmaps to get on with the times, only band-aid solutions, reliant on many manual processes that should’ve been automated a decade ago.
- Old school culture with little flexibility and the leadership mindset is stuck in the 90s. 
- Poor PTO policy and a high deductible health plan 
- Limited opportunities for growth, difficult to move internally, switch teams or departments 
- Cheap company when it comes to everything including paying market wages.
- Constant layoffs and re-orgs. Once you settle into a new org, it’s time to change management again and re-prioritize everything, nothing gets done

-I have had the opportunity to grow industry and role knowledge while also receiving coaching to develop my brand and refine soft skills such as coaching and communication skills.
-A huge investments was made into me by having the opportunity to get my FINRA Series 7 and 66 licenses, and later the Series 9/10. 
-I was offered opportunities to refine my coaching skills, which peaked my interest in Schwab's Aspiring Leader Program (ALP).
-The ALP program helped me dive head-first into the philosophy and practice of service-oriented leadership.
-Shortly after being accepted into the program I was offered a leadership position in my department, and I frequently use the information I learned through ALP to drive strong results with my team.",This is not the company to apply to for people looking for a job that is laid-back with minimal role responsibilities.

-Most managers are very engaged and encouraging when it comes to career development
-The vast majority of people at Schwab are extremely nice, down to earth, and helpful people

-Since covid, there seems to be a very positive shift in the outlook for ongoing remote work opportunities","-Given the size of the firm and reluctance to take on risk, the company tends to move extremely slowly when it comes to enacting change.
-Difficult to get anything done without executive buy-in and project funding
-The company takes risk-aversion to another level, which makes it difficult to get things done
-Working in silos tends to be the norm
-In a zero-commission, zero interest rate environment, the company is extremely focused on expense management. Job security isn't what it once was.
-Very focused on managing quarterly earnings. Expense freezes pre-covid were commonplace (hiring freezes, travel freezes, etc.)
-The company is oftentimes penny-wise but pound-foolish"

Plenty of opportunity to contribute and make a difference within team and center, but it’s up to you to find the opportunity. There is a lot of overtime and incentives so you can work as much as you want. I have worked for several different finance firms and Schwab is the only one that is actually diverse.","It’s so busy with no signs of stopping or relenting and it is incredibly draining work. Upper management is slow to adopt changes and slow to hire additional reps. Often times it feels like they are just putting a band aid on a problem instead of fixing it. Schwab as a whole is very slow to adopt new tech or implement changes, and the clients/reps feel the brunt of that. Slow to update ridiculously outdated procedures. It’s pretty hard to move from CS&S to another group. Some groups within CS&S know much more than others, and chat reps are expected to have much more knowledge and be more adept for similar pay. Other brokerage firms offer much better benefits."

Schwab fails to understand the changes that need to be made for them to survive in this climate. Their turnover rate is incredibly high. I started less than a year ago, and I've seen over a dozen of my teammates either resign, or accept different positions.

1006,,Top-Down management means broken promises,2021-02-18,2.0,Financial Services Associate,"1) Good benefits 
2) Great co-workers 
3) Job security","1) Work style: nature of Financial Services means most available positions are front-end client facing: vast majority of positions are call-center focused as the industry evolved out of ""trading floor platform"". Promotions simply mean a fancier title and better pay: nature of the job largely remains the same
Roles are 70% Service -30% Finance: Does not recommend for those seeking a more research/analytical focused role 

2) Micro-Management: nothing you do is ever good enough, there exists performance metrics for almost everything, and your growth opportunities are heavily limited by client satisfaction, which often times have little to do with your own individual performance. In your daily work, it is up to you to find the perfect balance amongst the myriad of metrics given and do so consistently 

3) Rigid schedule: schedule is not flexible-even taking bathroom breaks at unscheduled times will have an effect on your metrics, see point #2

4) Pays below industry average (excluding paid training/benefits) and lackluster incentives: incentives often, if not always, fail basic cost-benefit analysis

5) Schwab currently faces a bottle-neck in its ops. Taking on too many clients with recent mergers (USAA, TD-Ameritrade, etc.) without enough trained professionals to resolve issues in multiple departments (Asset Transfers, Account Operations, Brokerage, etc.) resulting in incredibly high hold times for clients-employees alike, leading to massive degrees of inefficiencies and disillusioned clients--which directly impacts your performance metrics (see point #2)

6) Clients: you are guaranteed to encounter extremely rude/unprofessional ones and there's very little you can do about it: the ability to keep calm, have a high EQ often times will be more important than your financial expertise (refer to point #1)"

You will find that Directors were promoted because of their network and luck of being in the right place at the right time, not because they were prepared or qualified for the responsibility of leadership.

The phone time matrix is extremely tight and a few bathroom breaks with cause you to be out of adherence - which will cause you to lose your bonus.

I also love the fact that leadership includes women.","Pay is average, benefits are ok (can improve health insurance), PTO is average.

1048,,Great place to start,2021-02-03,4.0,Branch Network,"- Culture: if you’re sick you’re sick, there’s no need for you to worry about coverage (comparing to Jpm). If your relative passes away, the first words out of their mouths aren’t “When will you be back” but “I’m so sorry for your loss” (comparing to BofA).

- decent pay (mediocre raises, so negotiating your starting pay is important).

- decent benefits (the ability to invest in individual stocks or etfs/mutual funds outside your typical 401k but still part of your 401k (brokerage account) is not common and a huge plus, and to do so with Roth 401k or traditional 401k or a blend is even a bigger plus).

- sabbatical (every five years you earn a month (4 weeks) of paid time off in addition to PTO, which is only ok. Gets slightly better the more years you work there.

- Large company (billions in revenue) with a small company feel (you’re able to get exceptions if it makes business sense and actually chat with executive council).

- Mentorships

- Highly encouraging individuals to get more licenses, certifications like CFP, etc.

- Work life balance is stellar for the financial industry.","- Little to no training which leads to another con:

- Inconsistencies with their policies & procedures. You have reps who will state one thing when it’s another. You will also find yourself needing to rely on other reps to accomplish one piece of a much larger puzzle because of lack of training. And it’s not even you don’t know how. The company literally limits you to what you can do.

There are amazing individuals that work within the organization, however its: 50% wtf, 30% ok, 10% great and 10% amazing and hope they never quit despite average pay.

Often put in uncomfortable positions of walking the line of ethics. You get very little training if any. The approach is to watch a video on a topic and you are expected to be proficient. No investment in the personal and professional growth of employees. Schwab has seemingly bit off more then they can chew with recent business acquisitions(TD, USAA) as there have been significant technology deficiencies and poor service to clients.

1128,,Great career starting point,2021-01-06,5.0,Client Relationship Specialist,"Schwab is overall a great company to work for. You can really feel that leadership cares about their employees. One example is that they like to promote within (crucial). They are also constantly asking their employees how they can improve the company and the employee experience. Benefits are solid too. Some of the highlights would be immediate 401k vesting, stock options, HSA, as well as a sabbatical every 5 years (paid 1 whole month off on top of your vacation days). Leadership has a strategy not to micromanage, which actually works out pretty well. Employees don't feel pressurized, but instead motivated to do their role more effectively.

The CRS role is a great role at branch network that can open many opportunities. You will get licensed and learn a whole lot about industry. If you want, Schwab will even pay for your school/professional designations. I would certainly recommend this role.","Not really a con per se, but you kind of have to go for what you want. Nothing will be handed to you. If you are looking to advance your career within the company, you have to really show you are advancing. There's also many resources available for employees that are being taken advantage of simply because employees don't know about them."

The class composition from the get go concerned me - primarily very young fresh college grads, stay at home parents getting back into the workforce, and bitter retreads from local competitors and from other walks of life. 

The first days of training seemed like indoctrination into a cult. Hearing the continuous virtues of how ""incredibly awesome"" Schwab was further made me weary that they're trying to hide the truth about the company's true culture. The classroom training felt like I was back in high school - very immature and juvenile behavior (""If you're ""good,"" I'll let you leave 5 minutes early today!). 

I was told during the recruiting process that I would be allowed to immediately sit for SIE and Series 7 exams; however, two weeks into the new hire classroom training, we were told that we'd only be permitted to sit for exams once approved on a schedule by management and that could be four to six months later.  

The final straw for me was when new hires were told to sit with an experienced FSR for an hour. The kid I sat with totally botched every single call he took. It was clear he had zero understanding of his job or the financial services industry in general. 

I realized I was wasting my time here so I packed up, went home, and have never regretted leaving it since."

The company has many opportunities to network and grow as an individual as long as you are willing to put for the effort to do so. Pay is fair and the benefits package is better than most within the financial services industry,"little to no opportunity in the international realm

1155,,Great company culture with work life balance.,2020-12-25,5.0,Software Developer I,"Great culture, people care about you, work life balanced is promoted throughout teams. Management is great about letting your work time be work time and anything outside of that is your own personal time.","Although I love the company culture and the work that I get to do, there doesn't seem to be much opportunity for growth and promotion. Promotions process is difficult and company structure is top heavy right now so it is hard to move from a junior position. I think pay could be a little better too for entry level developers in Austin, TX, like 7k+ more a year."

I think this company is definitely good to get your foot in the door.,"Understaffed and each year the raises get smaller and smaller. Company cuts budgets across the entire organization and cannot manage to pay their employees a decent salary. You are just one person easily replaced. Too much competition to apply for other roles within the company. If you work hard, you’re more likely to get double the work from your team."

You are just a number, and they only care about the numbers to make their team look good

CALL CENTER ENVIRONMENT: every role is trust me.  The job was extremely misleading and the turnover is HIGH. One person left after two days! Many people do not last past 3-6 months 
Promised we would study for our licenses, everytime someone asked, the date would change. 
Training is not long enough, you will find yourself transferring to departments all day.

I’m a very happy Schwab client.,"While Schwab puts clients first, they put employees last. Salaries for experienced, licensed professionals are not even remotely competitive with similar roles at big banks or private wealth institutions (I know this from my own experience). 12 days accrued vacation a year plus 2 float days is sad. Schwab spends a great deal of effort telling employees and the community that Schwab is a great workplace in the hope that people who don’t know better will believe it."
1164,,Fat cats sitting back making the working folk work harder for same pay. Deceitful,2020-12-22,2.0,Branch Associate,The benefits are amazing.

1166,,A big business with principles,2020-12-21,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"I'm generally skeptical about corporate mission and values statements, but from what I've seen, Schwab actually lives theirs. They don't just talk about acting with integrity and putting others first--that's how the company seems to operate from the highest levels down. The culture is supportive and inclusive, and management really seems to care about employees' wellbeing.","The size of the company can make it difficult to feel plugged in and involved in the core of the business. As an employee, finding a smaller niche, like a business division or local team, is important."
1167,,Clients First!,2020-12-21,5.0,Vice President Branch Manager,Schwab put clients first - we see through clients eyes which drives everything we do. Schwab has an inclusive culture and provides so much support for career growth within the firm.,"Schwab is going through multiple acquisitions which is exciting, but it can bring a lot of uncertainty and change, but ultimately should bring even more opportunity, not only to our employees, but our clients too!"
1168,,Limited growth,2020-12-21,3.0,Finance Specialist,"The pay isn't the worst. You get a sabbatical after 5 years of service (paid time off about 28 days). If you are interested in getting your licensing, this place is for you. I will say it was a great place to work back in 2011. If you are willing to follow without question, adapt to changes on a regular basis, If you are a numbers person & competitive,this company is for you.","The technology is terrible & interrupts productivity which....you still get held accountable for. The training for the newer reps is a joke. They have this term called OJ L which is on-the-job learning, meaning they throw the newbies on the phone with little knowledge, these newbies call my department for help with training, however we are still held to keep our metrics and to serve our clients. Something is very wrong with that. For the hotline teams, management is out of touch & makes decisions that creates bigger issues for reps working on the front lines. Promotion seems to be based on what licenses you have and how long you been at the company, not if you are actually qualified/skilled for the job. If you are a creative, think for yourself, are not robot, this is not the place for you. Micromanaging, 30 minute lunches, having to fill out 2 reports daily on what you are doing any time you are not on the phones, being treated like a child. Passive aggressive expectations from our leaders, who want you to go above & beyond for clients, then caps you at 4 mins per call. 1 call could literally cover 11 different tasks, including trading. We are told to put the client first, but clearly it's the metrics that are first. Employees are clearly not happy but fill out surveys w/ fake positive feedback out of fear of losing their jobs. We are seen as numbers only , ""butts in seats"" as one of the directors used to say in regards to attendance. All work , no play & it IS a very dull environment. The most fun I have is with the clients, who mostly are great BTW. The overall morale in my department is at an all-time low even when we were in the office, it is a very stressful environment. Schwab used to treat employees so well, times have truly changed."

- Decent work-life balance keeps people at the firm for long tenures
- Team engagement activities and employee groups build a sense of community
- Good balance of stability and innovation as the company is an established firm that still launches new types of products/services
- Sabbaticals every 5 years (unless you're a VP or higher)
- Regular meetings with managers and leaders ensure objectives alignment and transparency of performance reviews","- Low number of company holidays, so you burn through more paid vacation (corporate remains open with markets and our branch offices)
- Not enough remote work flexibility (changing for the better during pandemic)
- Some benefits could be better (e.g. high-deductible health plan covers little until deductible is met)
- Not enough advancement opportunities to retain high performing talent"
1180,,Definitely better alternatives,2020-12-15,2.0,Financial Service Representative,"-5% 401K match and you can contribute up to 10% into the stock purchase plan (you buy shares 15% less what they closed at that day).
-New building in DFW is exciting.
-Could be a great place if you’re interested in working solely in customer service or becoming manager of a customer service team.","-Scarce opportunities outside of customer service.
-FCA is very much prioritized over you if you’d like to go the advice/sales route and nothing you do in CS&S will translate into roles not in customer service.
-It’s a call center.
-Micromanagement is an understatement. Metrics include taking your 15 min breaks and 30 min lunch on schedule, average duration of your calls, and how long you are not actively talking to someone else on the phone.
-Most people are actively looking for opportunities elsewhere.
-Pay isn’t too bad but slightly lower than other broker dealers."

1203,,Where Is Walt?,2020-11-29,1.0,Vice President Financial Consultant,Great exposure to the industry and a way to get an understanding of the industry.,Schwab is not a place to build a career. It is a great place to get started and gain experience by not a place to stay. FC comp is cut monthly to control the EPS of the company. Schwab is an expense controller to meet shareholder expectations. Marketing and reality do not align. Branch Lead flow has fallen to 0 as Schwab looks to maintain the revenue on clients. Any lead flow you may get will come with a potential risk and headache where a call center representative was worried about the risk of a client and decided to pass that risk to you. Financial consultants are micromanaged down to their every phone call and notes in the system. If your dashboard does not look right to them you will be told several times a week. I watched my predecessor get pushed out after dedicating over 20 years to the company and having clients who raved about them. There is zero loyalty to Financial Consultants. We continued to become less skilled at the FC position thus the errors are increasing rapidly on clients. There is no coaching or development you will have to do this on your own. Walt has been missing in action for over two years and I worry we are going fast down the wrong path and unfortunately it will be clients that suffer the most.
1204,,It's the people...,2020-11-27,5.0,Corporate,"I work with the best here... not only on expertise and client-centric focus, but because Schwabbies care about one another along with the client.","Collaborative environment, but that can sometimes lean into consensus-building which can slow progress."

The company pays for license registration which include insurance and FINRA license.,There is no additional compensation when you help Financial Consultants bring in new funds. You have to be willing to educate Financial Consultants on account maintenance procedures. You have to follow up on all documents submitted because client make mistakes on paper work.

They really care about self development, both personally and professionally. There are many opportunities offered to employees for career and self development, which you don't see often in big corporations. The company understands the important of creating work-life balance, which the management is so supportive to their employees.","Performance review metrics could be standardized to ensure consistency and fairness across the enterprise. Often time because the nature of the job is different within each team and each department, performance can be overlooked due to the different standards held within each organization."

There are some teams that are really cool and some really great people stuck in neutral.","It is a miserable place to work. It's a lot like a telco where people are promoted into positions they have no business being in. If there's an industry standard set of tools for your job, you wont be able to use them. They lock everything down and don't care what employees need to do their jobs. The employees are all conditioned not to think so they all just say we cant use that. They are the ones that stick around forever. All employees are distrusted, that seems to be a core tenet. They will use security as their reasoning but it's been a part of their culture for years. If you liked working in IT 15yrs ago and are afraid of change you're going to love it here!"

Seeing the world ""through clients eyes"" has shaped the trajectory of the firm. I have worked for several firms where they want a client, but only Schwab advocates for the client. 

The firm was very responsive during Covid, and has made every effort to make continuing business during these times as productive as possible. That meant taking a 95% onsite, in office, business and turning it into a 75% work from home environment. Providing subsidies for home technology and sending work kits to ensure people can work successfully.

Also during the pandemic, the firm has had one voice about self care, and work-life balance and providing additional resources related to physical and mental health. It is nice to know that a firm is concerned about its employee's well being as much as the bottom line. This has been very important during a time when so much uncertainty is surrounding us. If I were to separate from the firm, and the opportunity presented itself, I would absolutely choose to work with Schwab again.","No company is perfect. There could certainly be more diversity in management, but I see proactive efforts to change, which even if not immediate is better than no effort."
1237,,A refreshing place to work,2020-11-12,5.0,Director,"It's great to work for a company that actually believes in the core values that they advertise. Everything is done Through The Clients Eyes and to their benefit.

Lots of internal movement and opportunities

Great pay, benefits, and perks such as Employee Stock Purchase Program, stock grants, and annual bonuses.",Schwab's extremely polite culture can be challenging to navigate on the occasion when a more firm approach is needed.
1238,,"Huge Corporation But it Feels Like ""Family""",2020-11-12,5.0,Client Relationship Specialist,"Even though Schwab is a giant and continues to grow even bigger, three main PROS stick out for me: (1) the focus has always been and will always be on the client experience; (2) the focus is also on the employee experience; (3) the culture is inclusive, supportive, and collaborative. I have been with the company for just over a year, but have worked in the industry for many years. My experience at Schwab has been comparatively the most welcoming, genuine, supportive, and motivational. Not every day is perfect, but I feel respected and valued, supported and heard. That's pretty huge.","The ""general"" email load is crazy, with multiple communications daily from leadership and different departments. But then, there's a lot going on!"
1239,,Balancing Good with the Bad,2020-11-12,4.0,Senior Team Manager,"Who you work with matters, and culture is key to that, but culture is often a buzz word that most companies talk about. Schwab actually lives this in a way you can feel every day. There's a consistent focus on client experience, driving change at every turn and recruitment of decent talent to push it all forward. The day-to-day is appropriately challenging, and there's rarely pressure to work late or on weekends. It's very balanced, making Schwab particularly well-suited to working parents who don't want to compromise on professional development.","Schwab funds most of its activities on a project-by-project basis, so you not only spend significant time pitching instead of actually delivering, it also results in a lack of ""big picture"" thinking across the organization and spotty talent. Pick your team wisely!

Compensation and benefits are nothing to write home about; pretty middle-of-the way, and sometimes not competitive, but keep in mind that it's work/life balance that's the real reward."

-Work hours are extremely rigid 

-NO ONE cares if you get tested in 2 months or in 8 months

-NOTHING on the recruitment time line is solid. All if it can and WILL change for the worst

-4 years after taking the job could are still taking call center calls and it is up to YOU to find a job in a branch. A non FCA member could just as easily get your job at a branch because the FCA does NOT train you for anything valuable for life in or out of Schwab

1257,,Great experience for the education... if you thrive in conservative corporate America.,2020-10-31,3.0,Financial Consultant Academy,"If you have at least a Bachelor's degree and some service experience, Schwab will train you to be a licensed stockbroker and financial professional, and help you on the pathway to becoming a financial consultant. I was able to attain my Series 7 and 66 through them, and it was a great experience after overcoming some ridiculous oversights from their end.
1) They'll train you for any license you'll need (they determine if you need them)
2) The people who aren't corporatist boot lickers are incredibly talented and amazing to learn from (I still have several people I stay in touch with from there)
3) You learn how to quickly uncover a service need, and collaborate to solve it, which transfers to other professions (because after a few months of this role, you WILL want to leave, if you are able to do so)","The majority of Schwab jobs are service-related, which makes sense because they are a financial services firm. What they don't tell you is that the Academy is an excuse for Schwab to siphon bushy-tailed and bright-eyed energy from recent college graduates and career switchers in order to staff their call centers with high-level talent for 2 years. Don't believe me? Ask a recruiter.
1) They treat you like a line item in a spreadsheet or an input in a machine (metrics are used punitively instead of constructively: You can have a 98% Client Satisfaction Score and earn you no earnest recognition, but if you take 15 seconds longer per call than the average person in your department because of difficult clients/calls , you aren't promoted. 
2) ""Clients are prioritized"" in the sense that employees are treated like fast-food workers to ensure availability. (minimum legally-required break and lunch time, PTO, sick time. Blackout periods for time-off during half the year because of end of year and tax season volumes)
3) Terrible volume prediction for staffing resulting in canceled training classes, team meetings, and pressure to ""get them off the phone fast"" (They say they want to ""See through clients eyes"", but frontline workers are coached to get clients off the phone as quickly as possible, and limit real-time assistance, instead choosing to deflect service needs to online self-service options. This is not great for older clients who prefer phone-based walkthroughs, which is the majority of people who choose to call first before looking online)"

It's a call center, so you'll take calls all day long for 8 to 10 hrs per day depending on your shift. Systems are often down, and technology is unreliable which increases calls, which means more angry clients. There is no flexibility, meaning your vacation requests hardly ever get approved because call volumes are so high, they can't afford to have people off the phones. It's not easy to get a raise because it takes only ONE bad client survey over something completely out of your control to cause you to miss quarterly metrics, and sets you back. Turnover was high, even during COVID!"

1277,,Good Place To Start But Not A Place To Stay,2020-10-21,4.0,VP-Financial Consultant,"Schwab is a great place for a new advisor to gain experience. And if you can survive, you can make a good to great living. 

Essentially, they assign you a large book of clients and it is your job to service them and try to sell them Managed Money. You do get to work with a large group of sophisticated clients who have a lot of money. And you will get exposed to High Net Worth and Ultra High Net Worth Investment and planning topics.","I should note that, I worked in down town Boston office and the management style from office to office differs to some extent so this may not be applicable to Schwab as a whole but it was my experience. 

As an experienced Advior, I found it difficult to be micro managed. Essentially, you meet with management every 2 weeks for anywhere from 1/2 to 2 hours . The reviews could be quick or they could involve reviewing every single opportunity you created. As a Financial Consultant, my expectation going in, was that I was going to be tasked to help clients by utilizing the products and services on their platform. This was partially true but ultimately, it seemed to me that the ultimate goal of the role was to sell managed money. 

Turnover: Overall, except for a small group of long timers, the turnover was high. During my tenure the turnover was just over 50%. As a result, the long term compensation packages may not apply unless you are able to survive. Also, the Boston and surrounding offices seems to be all Male and very few minorities. During my tenure there was a good representation of women but they have all since left. 

With respect to goals: They were always much higher than the average (it seemed). It almost seemed that they took the performance of the top 1% and wanted everyone to perform at that level, regardless of tenure . Just keep in mind, when someone gives you a large group of clients, the demands are going to be high.

Ultimately Management has their agenda and you will be a cog in the wheel. Every 2 months there was a new focus, and the last topic of focus seemed to be forgotten."

It's an over-glorified call center position. It was never explained from the beginning there is different shifts. FCA use to have real priority until new management came in. Even though they give you a timeline - it's not set, meaning you do not know when your next rotation is and you do not know when you are studying. Some cohort starts studying 6 months in, some start 3 months. It's based on business needs (the calls). Executives make unreasonable decisions and it affects the employees in the call center negatively. It's mentally draining to take calls 7/8 hours. If you're not on the phone when your scheduled, it's hurts your performance which hurts your raises. Many employees place clients on hold to use the bathroom just to not hurt their performance. The metrics are ridiculous to meet and it's even harder during COVID. The pay is based on being a call center and not a development program and Schwab is known for low pay in the industry. If you decide you no longer want to be in FCA, they only give you two options: stay or quit. They are not a fan of having employees leave the academy to a different department besides the branch. Not only does the salary have a cap while in the program, it also has a maximum when you go to the branch for the first few years. Also the locations available at the end of the program are not ""ideal"" locations. Instead of Los Angels, NYC, Miami, etc. being on the list, it's MiddleofNowhere, USA.

Overall, nice people work here","The company culture promotes privilege and an overall elitist mindset. I've worked in three different departments in my time here and have seen the same behaviors in each one. People tattle on each other, make up lies, and try to stab you in the back to promote themselves and steer people away from their incompetence. Many people are bad at their jobs but get promoted or receive opportunities they're not qualified for because they've been there for so long. The Executives pretend to care about their employees, but they don't. We were one of the last companies to go remote when COVID hit. They were actually mandating that people keep coming in when other companies mandated you stay home. Yes, the CEO actually sent a firm wide email telling all employees that we needed to come in because technology couldn't support us all working from home at the same time. They also instituted COVID pay for the first two months of the pandemic which entitled you to paid time off (that didn't count against vacation or sick time) if you tested positive for COVID or came in contact with someone who did. But they cut this right before the cases spiked and numerous employees got sick. Did they reinstate it? No. Why not? Because it was all for show, like everything they do at this company. Fake it til you make it is the Charles Schwab way."

1. Meeting management here is horrible. This company is a meeting factory. Calendars are full of them. Meetings are not managed properly. Many meetings don't have clear agendas, they allow attendees to go off on tangents, they aren't held to their expected time frames, etc. I've been on meetings scheduled for 30 minutes, which turned into working sessions that lasted up to 2.5 hours. It's unprofessional to expect someone attending a scheduled 30-minute meeting to stay on for 2.5 hours. Chatty-Cathy's (those people who never shut up) are also a major issue during meetings. To learn, you must be willing to listen, and you need good meeting management in order to ensure meetings start/end on time, and cover the required information pertaining to the meeting.

2. Communication needs to be improved. Emails and Instant messages are not returned in a timely manner. I've waited 3 hours to 3 days for people to respond to an instant message. I've waited 3 weeks for people to respond to an email. Sometimes people never respond. Communication is essential, and non-communication kills productivity. 

3. Pushback on improvement. There's a sense of ""we've always done it this way"", which impairs the ability to innovate and improve. When improvements are offered, perspectives turn to why it can't be done, rather than looking at the value of the improvement and attempting to determine how it can be done. Unfortunately, some don't see the value of improvement even after it's demonstrated."

1463,,"Toxic environment, cultish culture, no accountability. (Broker Service Rep review)",2020-04-19,1.0,Financial Service Professional,"- Job security - no one ever gets fired unless you literally don’t show up to work
- Ethical - you never have to do anything shady to a client in order to be successful
- Random (discretionary) bonuses or extra pay throughout the year - though this has become far less common now that interest rates have been cut","- Corporate culture is very cultish. You’re constantly told about how happy everyone is to he there, how they never want to leave and have been there for a long time (10-20 years for some people, though notably these people are usually middle managers or salespeople and not phone reps), how Schwab somehow wins high employee satisfaction rewards, etc.

If this is true, then why is it you never seen anyone smile in the halls? Once management gets a whiff of dissent, their manners towards that employee completely shift. Four of my colleagues over the years were victims of this.

- You are not a broker. You are a service specialist. Majority of your calls are a skillset they push on you, such as “ID Theft” (unlocking online logins and enhanced verification when people forget security questions) or “Bank” (assisting with debit cards). You also frequently get tech support calls that you are expected to handle. Support departments often give you pushback and do not want to take the call.

The broker calls you do get are simply glorified order taking. You cannot give advice. Schwab’s website does not have any advice capabilities, so you are placed in an impossible situation of needing to “fulfill the client’s need” while not being able to actually fulfill this need. Of course, this is your fault. No accountability for others.

- Training is terrible. It mostly consists of you being given a new skillset, thrown on the phones, and hopefully figuring it out. If you mess up, again the blame is on you. No accountability for others.

- Lied to about opportunity. They tell you there are so many places to go and Schwab will support your career growth, but career growth is absolutely non-existent. It is not a meritocracy. It’s about who you know. And it’s a good ol boys club. Minorities and women need not apply to these higher positions. And if your director doesn’t like you, good luck doing anything but phone calls.

In my 2 years on a top-performing team metrics-wise, I had 5 managers, 2 people actually move on to a new role (1 was a lateral move), and 4 people leave the company. There was no accountability for the incompetence of management, or for their empty promises that were walked back for a previously undisclosed disqualifying reason, lack of support, etc.

- Management dodges accountability from top to bottom. There were always excuses for not getting basic things done like U4 paperwork to be able to sit for a FINRA exam, pay increases, reimbursement requests, etc. There were also excuses for not coaching, not educating reps, not communicate changes resulting in reps making errors, etc. Some managers were on top of this. The ones who weren’t shifted blame all around, but it always ultimately fell on the powerless rep who could not push the blame elsewhere. Directors supported this blame shifting because they themselves did it, and management culture always is learned from top down.

Excuses, excuses, excuses are all you ever hear from management. There is no accountability in this company whatsoever and, as a phone rep, there is not a single thing you can do about it.

This leads to a culture of dodging accountability firm-wide. Calls are blind transferred to you so people don’t have to deal with a difficult call, and you will do the same to others. After all, if you give wrong information, you will be “coached” or otherwise disciplined. If you pass the call off however, literally nothing happens to you.

- Frustrating new metrics. The metrics for 2020 are designed against you. A survey that is not a perfect 7 out of 7 counts as a 0. I have received “0’s” with comments full of thank you’s and appreciation. It doesn’t matter that it doesn’t add up. And thanks to the good ol boys culture of promotion that is rampant here, these metrics are often used to keep people on the phones and promote management’s favorites.

But they’ll tell you: “We don’t care about metrics.”

There are many many other things but hopefully this gives an idea of the disconnect between what you are told this job and company will be, and what this job and company actually are."

The worst part I've experienced so far is, Schwab does not appear to have many people who can properly perform meeting management (i.e. having an agenda, staying on it, and deferring tangent conversations offline). I have regularly been on calls that extend far beyond their scheduled time frames. I was on a recent call that was scheduled for 30 minutes, but it went 1 hr 45 minutes, on a Friday afternoon! This makes getting work done extremely frustrating.  Healthcare coverage is frustrating to move from one employer plan to another and discover certain medications are no longer covered and getting everyone (doctors, prescription benefit manager, etc.) on the same page is unnecessarily complicated and time-consuming. Additionally, I've been here over a year and still have no idea what the organization structure is regarding roles/titles/pay grades. I engage with people everyday and do not know where they are in the hierarchy based on their title, because there is no clear structure, and have no idea what my future opportunities/titles could be because I have no idea what the career path is here."

The Denver campus is great. Good cheap food options. Can be hard to get to in the snow however.","I cant emphasize enough that this is not a trading or broker job. It is basically a nursing job at this point. Schwab has scared away all of its real trading activity through a botched merger and refusal to fix the numerous issues on the site. Your job on a daily basis is mostly to hold hands with people who are some combination of helpless, lazy, entitled, incompetent, and/or incapacitated. Many are also mean. It is a miserable job that will break you and make you hate people. There are some nice clients you will help that occasionally feels good, but a majority of the work is soul-crushing. So many people you talk to arent suitable for trading but your're still supposed to take their money. 

You're rarely taking thlrade calls at this point anyway. The routing is a mess and you are expected to do the other department's jobs. Sometimes you'll try to transfer to the right desk and they'll refuse to take the call.

There are regularly issues with the system and sometimes you will spend your whole day as a punching bag for clients. Schwab will rarely fix anything because trading doesn't make money anymore. Your job will be to clean up Schwab's mess and get nothing back for it. When they horribly botched a merger recently, they would give you gifts like stress balls and forks (seriously) for the trouble.

Schwab recently installed metrics on the phone services that make your career prospects infuriating and close to a waste of time. Your career lives and dies by surveys. Schwab knows the surveys are often irrational (angry and/or elderly clients) but they dont care as its an easy way to not pay people and the people who came up with the system won't admit it's a mistake because they attached their name to it. 

Apparently, it's now gotten even worse as my friends still there tell me they installed some system that controls your bathroom breaks and they feel like they're in kindergarten again.

The red tape at the company is completely debilitating and nothing gets done because of it. It became a running joke that if something was announced to be fixed or released on a certain date, add six months.

A few weeks before I left, Schwab had mass layoffs because they bought a company with money they didnt have; this after having executive photo op meetings at all the offices where they would shove you into conference rooms so execs could read you a prepared script about how well Schwab was positioned for the future. That was kind of the last straw for me. It was insulting. 

They've done it before in the past only they have some event or celebration [they did this for the abomination of a merger with optionsXpress] and the phones are so backed up with pissed off clients mad about the exact thing they're celebrating that they tell the phone desks that they can't go.

Nobody outside of Schwab (probably even in Schwab) will take you seriously. They know what the job is. I had 2 recruiters roll their eyes at me when i tried to play this off as a trading job. I was extremely lucky and had to exhaust all my resources to get out when i did. 

Take this job as a last resort.

If you do, spend at most 2 years getting every license up to 66 then either move to sales/adviser/marketing/product side or just bounce."

Recovering from some really bad practices, such ""include precompiled binaries of the libraries we use"" instead of ""reference our internal package server.""  Which made my job of porting our code an absolute nightmare.

Cryptic and unflexible. When I was hired they did not tell me the location of the office (or any details at all, I had to reach out to find out when my first day was,) and I assumed it was at their campus. It was a branch building, where my commute was over 2 hours long each way (instead of the 7 minutes to their campus.) I asked and they explained that work from home was only available for medical reasons.
The first pay period I was dinged for having an inconsistent schedule, due to the effect of traffic on our bus routes.
The second pay period I was dinged for staying in the office too long, due our commuter bus schedule running 15 minutes later than the end of the day. I  was told I could take flex time and leave earlier on Friday to prevent from accruing overtime.
The third pay period I was dinged for not working enough hours on Friday, and was told they wouldn't pay me for the hour I owed (which was fine, as I was also dinged for working overtime on Monday through Friday, for which I was paid extra.)
I gave up after that.

For security reason the office internet is highly locked down, which make absolute sense. But there's also no guest network and no cell phone reception in their offices, which means you will slowly go insane at the lack of human communication.

While there they have a good 401k plan.","The health benefits are horrible some of the worst for a large company, once your in it's extremely hard to move up, it's all about who you know here and not what you know.  Most of the people here don't say good morning or even hold the door for you, it's a pretty toxic environment and feels a bit racist at times, upper management is very unprofessional, they talk crap about the employees i witness this as part of upper management.  Work life balance is ok depending on the department but you hardly get to take a lunch or breaks, unless your in customer service. I say get trained here and head for the door, their are better companies."

Think about it.  Schwab clients do not like paying fees, that's a big reason they come to Schwab.  Schwab FC's are tasked with moving those self directed clients to a fee based platform.  By the way, they are incredibly good at this!!!","It's like quicksand.  You feel like your slowly sinking every year.  Incredible complacency within the FC ranks.  A culture of  the Have's/Have's Not has been created within the FC ranks.  You feel stuck.  Sabbaticals are great but they always threaten to take them away.  Compensation is always changing.  If your here long enough, you become numb to all the changes.  FC Comp is our #1 expense.  Firm loves to spend money on initiates that have little to no impact (ie. UOP).  Leadership is always changing."

Everyone is very nice - in fact, everyone refers to the culture as ""Schwab-Nice"".","Yes, people are nice, but it definitely comes at the expense of getting things done.  It's an incredibly meeting heavy culture - mainly because people meet to talk instead of getting things done. Very few people take and distribute notes so there are often follow up meetings to discuss what occurred in previous meetings. If you're ambitious and like to get things done, ensure you go in as an MD or above. Senior Managers are not respected or given any authority.

It is also incredibly difficult to move around or get promoted, especially as a senior manager (which is the lowest level). So many people are vying for very very few positions on the Retail corporate side."

Some of the best teams I've worked with and everyone before the director level is very supportive.  Excellent benefits working at Schwab.,Corporate shake-up has moved the Schwab culture to being customer and employee focused to driving out the most knowledgeable and hard working employees.  Harassment from managing directors is brushed under the rug in hopes that the offending directors will bring lots of revenue or cost-savings.

The digital accelerators are largely a way for senior leadership to dial up the pressure to execute and deliver against arbitrary deadlines for an under-resource a tech team and call it agile startup.

No training. I was told by my manager that Charles Schwab was too big to train. Instead they have you read material that is not pertinent to what you need to do to be successful at your job. No one makes the time to actually manage.
My manager was not qualified with proper licenses to manage me.
The council that I was a part of had no direction. The Chair was not really interested in his position.
It is true what the Industry says about Schwab and their meetings. The managers were in meetings all day everyday. They never had time to actually manage and run their departments.
I was told by my manager that I could not speak to her or her boss because they were too busy.
Her boss met with us several times in my 5 months with the company. His only concern was his approval ratings from these surveys filled out by staff. The problem is that they know who you are and if you do not give the great marks then they know who you are and things will become difficult.
I was threatened by a manager that I would not be there for very long due to the fact that I was not his choice for the position. That threat was followed through with by my manager."

There are constant calls from advisors that are asking questions that require research consistently everyday and it just never stops.

They are afraid of looking incompetent and very good at self preservation,  spending a lot of time thrashing the work of  newcomers to discredit them.

- Lots of talk about transparency but it is anything but. The moral compass seem to be missing: it is not uncommon for leadership on Corporate Risk to outright steal your work and present it as their own."

-Cutthroat Culture. You can only pee on your break or it will screw up your metrics.

- People with no actual experience are put in charge , lots of politics, the ""Digital Transformation"" isnt really transforming anything its just a buzz word

Most departments have a generous bonus pool and the campus is very nice.","If finance is not your forte and you are just in Schwab for a job, its a grind.

This leads to a toxic environment where there are no promotions unless you're the favorite (even if you get glowing reviews).
*ERM in particular is led by clueless leadership and very different from industry peers. There are individuals that have great external experience and therefore give competent guidance, but the overall direction is creating additonal more overhead and pushing busy work on other groups.
*Audit does not understand the business (they are in-sourcing the function) and repeats exams continuously.
*Management horribly planned for a macroeconomic and rate environment without considering possible risks to that plan (ie., rate cuts).
*Cost cutting has put a damper on what was a good learning environment, if you don't need licensing for work, you are no longer are allowed to sign up for the review course and take the exam."

Many of the VPs and SVPs are very personable and willing to help. Problems start at the MD levels.","Old school company and slow to change. Promotions are usually done level by level and it is difficult to move up quickly. Much of middle management is only concerned about their own career growth and afraid to challenge the status quo.  There are certain areas of the company where sexism is rampant. Not a bad place to be early in your career, but not if you want to be in the fast lane for growth. Managers do not really care about your growth, so you have to be proactive about what you want, which can become exhausting. You'll find yourself asking for the same thing three or four times before there's any movement."

Even though your clients may want deep investment conversations regarding the market, management actually discourages this.  The culture has shifted away from investments  and more towards insurance and financial planning.  For large clients looking to navigate through the markets this focus away from investments can be a problem. Key metrics for your success are how many financial plans did you run and how did you score on client surveys."

- Nice and modern campus
- The company is growing 
- Decent vacation and sick package
- You get sabbatical 
- The pay is decent compared to most companies. 
- It is a good place to work if you are easily satisfied. For those who have a growth mindset will jump after a few years  for the reasons below in the “Cons” section.","This is based on my personal experience at the company in the STS organization.

- Make sure you negotiate your starting salary because it’s very hard to get a raise. Even if your manager rated you “exceed expectations” two years in a row for your annual review, it doesn’t matter. Upper mgmt will downgrade you to meeting expectations. 

- Promotion is not based on merit. It is based on available budget and relationships. Having a good manager matters.
If you take on more responsibilities and go beyond the scope of your role, it doesn’t mean you will get a raise or a promotion. Your manager can request for it but it goes up to VP/Sr VP for the decision. There are certain orgs you do not want to work in.

- Once you are an employee, internal transfer is not that easy to get. Hiring managers tend to hire external candidates. For internal jobs, it will be a lateral transfer. 

- It is not really an agile organization. The company wants to move in that direction but it’s very slow. Yes you have scrum teams but that is just a shell because mindset is not there yet. Management is resistant to making changes. They talk well BUT no actions.

- Based on who is your organization leader  is (ex VP, Sr VP, MD, etc) the culture can be very hierarchical, controlling and basically a lack of trust.

A great place to get licensed and start off in the financial services industry. Overall a solid culture and great benefits for the job you're working.,"Very little upward mobility in this role. Be prepared for long hours spent on a phone, and no amount of extra licensing or certification's will get you out of that role. The pay is below the requirements of the job.

In some teams, there is a supportive balanced atmosphere.   Employee Branch is great; advice on financial planning is super.","Schwab is a large company, with an even larger company culture.  Be careful which area and manager you chose.  Many groups are great, with happy people.  But many teams in STS (Technology) have issues.  The personality of the VP drives the culture: collaborative or controlling; hierarchical or agile; ideas are welcomed or  seen as challenging.   I recommend you try to find someone in the potential group and ask pointed questions.  

Salary is on the low side; it may start out at 40th percentile, but will quickly fall far behind market.   If you have skills that are highly in demand, you will eventually have to leave.  Don't think you can apply for another of the dozens of open positions in Schwab either: I applied for 4 internally posted jobs, for which I was qualified, and did not receive anything in response.

Lateral career moves that the the company tries to hype up to make it seem like you’re advancing in your career, when in reality you’re still stuck answering phones in a call center. A single bad survey from a client can ruin your chance to get a 2% semi-annual raise, even if the client has an open Schwab account that has never held a balance. Survey’s are non-appealable. Education is simply not valued, so be prepared to have someone who was an Art or English major as your manager. The clients can be very difficult and many threaten to “take their accounts elsewhere”, and rightfully so because Schwab is difficult to do business with and does not make things easy for clients, mainly because it is an over-the-top conservative firm. Other departments that you have to call out to for help with client issues are not helpful at all and will blow you off just so they won’t have to speak with the client themselves."

Compliance requirements for documenting has become a nightmare and a major headwind in productivity for business development.  Lots of duplicate note making and button clicking.

I had the worst manager of my career for my last year and a half there.  It's sad to the department that I helped build be destroyed.  People are leaving in droves.  They're promoting and hiring incompetent yes-men and passing over talented leaders.

Illegal discrimination is rampant in the technical leadership.

In retrospect I think I should have reported it, but HR was clearly there to protect the company and not the employees.

Micromanagement is the theme with Engineering leadership.  EVPs and SVPs are on tech-lines trying to control chaos instead of empowering teams to do good work and getting the systems to work for them instead of against them.  My leadership would hardly ever promote someone into management.  Would hire 10 new managers for every 1 they'd promote.

Hiring process is a joke anyway.  I was hired for a Sr. Manager role with a 2 hour interview and then a several week wait for the background check.  They don't know how to consistently hire good talent, so if you go there you'll be working with a mix of good people who got duped, incompetents who can't get a better job, and a ton of contractors from India.  Some of the contractors are really good, but they're typically looking for new jobs outside this drain-circling Titanic once they get to the US."

There are opportunities to learn about the industry and work with great clients and coworkers. The work life balance for most roles is great too.","If you are considering applying for the Financial Consultant Partner (FCP) role with the expectation that you will become a Financial Consultant (FC) you will most likely be disappointed. Of the many FCPs I know across the country, only 2-3 have made direct transitions to become Financial Consultants. This role has an obligatory 2 year commitment period as well. As the role is so varied in scope, there is often disparity between FC expectations and expectations of branch management which leads to inconsistent performance reviews, especially considering that these decisions don't involve input from your FC. I found myself ""stuck"" in this role with little upward mobility after my commitment period. If you are serious about working in the branch location and becoming an FC, you are much better off applying as an Associate Financial Consultant (AFC) at Schwab. As an AFC you received mentorship from your branch FCs, the Branch Manager & your AFC peers and typically progress to FC within 1-2 years.

2013,,Are you part of the IN crowd,2018-04-12,1.0,Anonymous Employee,None at all haven’t experienced one,"This place is worse than high school.  Treatment from management is based on your band level. This is not just your manager this treatment comes from other departments managers, directors as well as VPs and above. They act like you are not worth their time and look at you as though you don’t have a right to speak to them. 

Work life balance is a joke when it comes to lower band employees.  Never have I been able to utilize this so called balance. I feel sorry for anyone who wants to work here that has children. An employee Having children is more a burden to the company. 
Now th Insurance is great for those with higher bands and higher pay who can afford an office visit  based on their  salary.

Special treatment for the IN crowd, sure they can work from home, came in late and they can leave early.  Go to doctors appointments without using sick time, take 2 hours lunch’s and no one is to say a word. All you can do is sit and keep your mouth shut. They don’t want you talking about it. If you do be prepared to lose your job.

As said managers treatment is beyond micromanager.  I hope you can hold your pee for your next break.

Most calls are password resets or distributions. Schwab has a thing called AQ's. If you say the wrong thing you'll get an AQ. You can be spot on 99 out of 100 calls but if that 1 call you mess up it feels like the world is going to end. Even if it doesn't have any impact on the participants financial account. They are handed out for some of the most petty things. Your bonus is affected by AQ's.

Culture depends on location but is overall friendly and inclusive. For a finance/brokerage firm they are not as intense or confrontational as many other finance companies.","They used to have a saying that they were 'a technology company that happened to do finance'. For a long time they were at the head of the industry in terms of innovation. They are still at the top of the pack, but internally the mindset has definitely shifted to focusing on being a brokerage that uses technology efficiently. Which means outsourcing, offshoring, and moving many of the back office work to external vendors. This is just progress I guess but it was a lot more fun to work as a technologist there in the past.
It's also too bad they have mostly left the bay area where they were conceived. Working in San Francisco when they were one of the biggest employers in the city was pretty great -- you always ran into another Schwabbie in random places. Kind of like college. But SF and California have really forced employers to pay for the talent available here. Perhaps too much. So the past 4 years have been all about moving to non California locations (can anyone say Geo-Strat? ugh - if you don't know, this was the name of the long term strategy to leave CA). The new locations seem to be handing the company fine (stock has tripled in 3-4 years), but it's still sad to those of us who truly loved the camaraderie of the SF environment."

6- No work-life balance due to the way the personnel and work flow are set up. you wil definitely end up working OT, or you will be told you do not work quickly enough based upon ridiculous/unreliable measurement tools and data."
2095,,Good company but I don't see how advisors can retire here,2017-12-18,3.0,Financial Consultant,"There are lots of good here at Schwab.  Benefits are what I expects at a major company and it offers a base salary.  If you are new or have limited experiences in the financial industry, it's a great company to start your career. 

Here are a list of pros I can think of:
1. Base Income so you won't starve 
2. Good culture of helping investors
3. Lots of exposure to various solutions and ideas
4. Great client offerings
5. Pays for your CFP or other designations","With all companies, Schwab has it's cons. Rather or not you can live with it is up to the individual but I don't see how anyone can work here for the long term.  I think the management team knows and expects that.  The biggest issue here is compensation for FCs (or in branch advisors). They want you to work like a ML or independent advisor going out and get business.  However, they don't pay you like one.  The worse is that they are subsidizing the savings for investors on the back of advisors. So we see record earning and profit emails from corporate every quarter, but are told that our compensation is being reduced year over year.  The corporate bonus pool is funded at 120%, but we don't get that.  So investors get discounts in fees, executives/managers gets their bonuses, FCs gets a cut in income.  Ouch.

Second, not all FCs are the same.  Meaning that if you been with Schwab for over 10 years and had your pick of your BOB, you are likely have a solid income ($150k+). So I think Schwab management is trying to address this ""issue"" by tweeking FC comp.  However, it also hits new FCs so I don't see how or why I would want to stick it out.

Lastly, their bonus structure is a joke.  We all know that the name of the game is for assets and put them into management.  Charge backs are a part of that process. But Schwab took it to a new perverse level.  They require that all clients stay in the solution for 2 years or the entire bonus is paid back to Schwab, no proration.  So if someone stayed in a solution for 23 months, Schwab collected fees for 23 months, but you have pay back you ENTIRE bonus. What's worse is that it also counts gains. So in a year like 2017 where clients made 20% in the market and they decides to cash out that 20% and spent it, that 20% will count against your earnings.  Why would that make sense?"

Management literally run like chickens not knowing what to do there. The best part is that it's a compliance department but they have you under ""operations"" not under the AML umbrella which of course pays A LOT more, they do this to under pay there associates. Any other financial institution you would go to would pay (at least) 10-15k more!!!!! The managers love to play the ""favorite game"" and promote those they favor the most, or if your a good ""brown noser"" and don't work hard you'll defiantly be sure to get promoted."
2100,,Financial Consultant,2017-12-11,1.0,Senior Financial Consultant,Used to be a great place to work and maybe it will be again.  Nice pens in the branch.  The people in the branch want to care about clients.,"Upper management care very little about current clients.  Miss management from the very top down.  If Chuck only knew nothing is “from the client’s eyes” anymore he would be very upset.  UOP is a joke!  The structure for FCs is broken.  They don’t want you to care about current advised clients (clients paying a fee for management) and want you to focus on the next conversion into advice.  The compensation is a joke.  Constantly pulling dollars from you via a claw back on assets leaving whether you brought them in or not.  The client has had assets here for 20 years and if they are assigned to you and the client spends down their retirement dollars to live well then you have to pay the firm back and won’t get paid on any new assets you bring in until you do.  Advised dollars are the same way for up to 2 yrs in the solution.  Upper management mismanaged every thing when it comes to finances.  They probably can’t balance their own checkbook but are in control of a trillion dollar company.  So much micro-managing of our time we don’t have any time left for current clients.  Only time we have is to try and bring in new assets and check boxes for their spreadsheets.  Not enough time nor incentive for us to care about existing clients.  Our comp drives us not to care.  I have ZERO confidence in management.  The stock price is up and that’s all that’s important.  CPS (Client Promoter Score/satisfaction) will plummet in time.  Don’t think they care just as long as they promote something different through advertising then how things actually are, get them in and move on to the next client.  Drive that AUM men and women.  Don’t spend too much time on them (clients).  Only way you should work in the branch is if you are desperate.  Upper management made disastrous financial decisions and take it out on the only client facing employees they have.  Not smart.  I say all of this and we still had record earnings but that’s not the whole story.  Management made major errors with the rollout of SIP and SIA but blame the FCs not themselves.  Such a shame, used to be a great place.  Cash sweep?  If you are client ask your FC about that.  Taking money from clients because of management inadequacies. Great job out here in San Fran.  Stock price, stock price, stock price.  Sharpening up Resume as you read this."

You dont see that many males in the associate section as compared to females but there are plenty of males in management. Horrible CALL CENTER Place to work at. Pay is roughly at $11-$12 per hour although at 12 your at the high end. Also HR policies are a joke.

2155,,A gilded cage is still a cage,2017-10-06,3.0,Registered Representative,"The attitude here really feeds off the new-college-grad energy: bright-eyed, excited, and naïve. Most of the center tries to sell the ""you can do anything you put your mind to"" attitude. The majority of the people here are kind, motivated, and very young (average age is 23 in the call center).

Schwab tries to mitigate the crushing realization that this is a dead-end job by providing the potential for compensation growth. This comes in the form of overtime incentives, 2% raises for meeting certain criteria each quarter, and pay grade increases when certain hurdles are met over a 3 or 6 month period. 

The catch? Schwab will start you off at a salary that is in the lower 25th percentile of salaries for call-center brokers in the Austin area - maybe to leave room for growth? 

But the criteria for pay growth change constantly - often mid-quarter when there's no time left to course-correct if necessary. Coincidentally, these changes happen to leave many employees just short of meeting the requirements for their raises, meaning that they must start over with the next 3- or 6-month performance measuring term.","It's important to note that the average tenure here is 10 months; about how long it takes for the new hires to realize that this is not a career. This is a call center job with very little room for upward growth. 

The majority of hiring decisions to help someone get out of the call center are made before a job listing is posted. 90% of the time, if a job is posted internally it's because they've already found the person they'd like to fill it; posting the job listing and interviewing candidates is a technicality they must endure to finally hire the person they actually wanted prior to the whole charade. 

If by some miracle you're able to get promoted, Schwab reserves the right to DENY your promotion if they're unable to meet service levels (and are too cheap to hire someone else). So, you could get the promotion and be working your new job, then get pulled right back to the old one if the phones get too busy. Talk about whiplash. 

Management is not concerned with producing real change. In my short tenure, I have witnessed several attempts by go-getters and innovators to approach senior management with improvements for efficiency, employee engagement, attrition reduction, training efficacy, gender equality etc. Each time someone approaches management with a proposal for real change, they are assigned to a committee that literally plans ice cream socials. I wish I was kidding. 

Speaking of gender dynamics, prepare for an environment with an extreme split; there are about 1 or 2 women per 12-person team. These women (and anyone interested in participating with an employee resource group) are required to use vacation time to meet with groups that promote equality and diversity."

2172,,Schwab is amazing!,2017-09-19,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Benefits, support system, positive messages from leadership, commitment to excellence and the client experience. It is exciting to be part of a company on the cutting edge of the industry that holds the industry as a whole to a higher standard of providing value and excellent service to our clients.

Schwab listens to its employees as well. Sometimes new policy/strategy implementation takes time, but I have witnessed quick turnaround on matters we've made clear are important to us, such as cost of living salary adjustments for the same role in different markets. Schwab knows that there is room for improvement and voicing concerns in a tactful way has shown to be effective. If something can't change, they always explain why. They seek constant feedback from us and certainly give it to us as well. As someone who has no problem with voicing any concerns I have, I can confidently say that I have never felt ignored or disregarded.

Schwab is generous with its employees, allowing for more than enough attempts at passing licensing exams. I've found that superiors have been willing to work with their employees on improvement opportunities—one would have to consistently flout authority and their directives in order to have corrective action taken against them. 

Schwab places a strong priority in promoting from within, which further shows how they are committed to employees' ongoing personal and professional development.","Not a true con, but be aware that things are constantly changing (mostly for the better) so it behooves you to not get too settled in to a set way of doing things. If you thrive on change for the better, you will thrive here.

Before I came to the branch/when I was in a call center, it could be difficult to schedule vacation days off if too many people in the network requested off for that same day, which is something that happens often around major holidays. 

Additionally, they have a policy of firing individuals who can't pass their broker exams. They have been tending toward hiring lower-quality workers via temp agencies who aren't adequately trained to represent Schwab well. People with college degrees get turned away during the hiring process, but individuals with only high school diplomas can easily enter the company on a temp-to-hire path."

The industry and company are always stable, solid team players, and most employees are friendly and helpful. The company is eager to try and stay ahead of the times which makes them more willing to try new ideas from time to time. The financial industry is very slow to change in general, so this company does a pretty good job being as opened minded as possible. Great work life balance. Most people come in around 9:30am and leave around 4:30pm.","Because everyone works there for so many years there is very little availability to get promoted. The hierarchy of level seats is also very few- most people sit as Senior Manager for many years unless a Director or VP leave the company.

Don't be persuaded by the talk of ""great exposure to upper management"" as these were nothing but empty promises to keep the work horses going as long as possible. 

The bank burns through employees with no regard for them as human beings, and cares only about the bottom line on labor figures. This creates an unnecessarily stressful environment, and horrible client experience.

Honestly, if you're college educated and interested in finance then STAY AWAY. They sell the idea that you're ""starting a career in finance"" which is complete BS. More of a customer service call center type role. If you are looking to work as an analyst or any type of finance related role (outside of wealth management) then you're wasting your time with Schwab. If you're interested in wealth management you're probably better off starting at a wire house and then getting a job in a schwab branch as an FC (I only say this because you can make six figures working 40hr/week dealing with cheap clients). The Broker Trainee program is the pond scum role of schwab and not respected anywhere else in the company. No room for growth. They preach that you can move to another department after 18 months but no one is going to help you do that. Several colleagues of mine were interested in working towards their CFP and management tried to talk them out of it. They want you to stay in the  call center because they need people on the phones. The only people that like it there and/or stay have no other choice (i.e.kids to feed, mortgage, wife, etc.) or they have nothing else going for them (i.e. no college degree). They reward loyalty and tenure. The director I was under was there for about 17 years and had absolutely no leadership or social skills. He would micromanage through an employees direct supervisor. If you'd like to build your resume and get licensed then take the job and move on ASAP after passing. Have an exit strategy from day one or you're gonna get stuck  walking old people through the website and getting yelled at when clients are unhappy with their accounts. I just wish I came across this review when I interviewed. If you decide to pass on the opportunity then good luck with the job search!!"

In January 2017 the CVRC department only granted 60% of the dept a raise - 40% received 0% raise, and those were the ones who refused to work overtime without being paid. Considering Denver's rising cost of living that amounts to a salary decrease. 
Management was a constantly revolving door. So were coworkers. I worked there a year and a half and counted 17 different faces. Still nothing was done about the obvious problems. Managers freely discriminated and were the rudest, most uneducated people you'll meet outside of a Waffle House.

When a rep leaves the other reps pillage the book and replace each client with one of their own unengaged clients deep into retirement. The pay ranges from about 50k - 250k. The tenured reps have some type of secret agreement to sabatage​ the new reps making it very tough to succeed no matter what your skill set. I was in the Jax, FL branch and lasted 2 years before I through in the towel. Not all branches are like this. A good rule of thumb would be to stay away from branch jobs that have 3-4 tenured reps with 10+ years in the same role. Look for branches​ where the manager promotes reps to bigger and better roles.

Even after you get your license and become a ""broker"" plan on most of your calls being service calls such as password resets and questions about their accounts.  Only trades you take are unsolicited so don't plan on using any analytical skills to help the client pick an investment.

2325,,Glorified and spineless meeting schedulers wanted,2017-03-21,1.0,Senior Project Manager,"As a project manager at Charles Schwab you will get to work on a variety of projects and with many people across the organization. You shouldn't get bored. Having worked with a number of teams outside of the Project Services group, I observed a general culture/attitude amongst Schwabies - a proud, driven, team-spirited, get-things-done attitude. I've worked with some highly-driven individuals and learned things from them. Upper management, outside of Project Services, are generally very engaged, supportive and involved operationally.","My rating is based entirely on working as a Project Manager in Project Services at Charles Schwab. The upper management in this group consists mostly of individuals who have somehow made an entire career at Schwab and are now in a position of power. They're toward the end of their careers and care only about themselves, not the people working for them. They've created a toxic environment for those that care and take pride in what they do. The group is a body shop. They're interested in having the personnel so they can bill their clients. The capabilities of the people, the quality of work they deliver and how thinly resources are spread do not matter. It's a matrix organization structure where all the disadvantages of such a structure are playing out very well. The ineffective and poor management has you constantly being pulled in different directions leading to employee dissatisfaction, low morale and high employee turnover. In my experience, it was very difficult to maintain a good work-life balance. Project managers are often allocated multiple projects on the recommendation of project directors who will pull an allocation percentage from thin air, with little understanding or care of what is actually involved or stakeholder expectations. Don't ever question how they arrived at the allocation. The project manager also reports to a personnel manager and has regular waste-of-time one-to-ones with them. The personnel manager knows nothing about your day-to-day work, yet they do your annual performance review. They have no power or influence should you need their support. As a PM, you're also burdened with having to request regular feedback from stakeholders and project directors, something you would think the personnel manager could take on. Only the project director's feedback bears weight so be sure to get along with them. If you want to be a glorified meeting scheduler and don't mind being seen as just that by business partners, then hop on board. If you want to lead teams, add value and learn a thing or two steer clear as you'll be in conflict with Project Services leadership for being in the weeds."

2349,,Account Solutions,2017-02-17,1.0,Operations,The people you work with are great and the 401k match is fantastic. Management supports getting licensed.,"Licenses are limited to department need, so if you eventually will need a license to transfer to another department they will not allow you to sit for it, even if you pay.  OSAS is a joke. The entire management team is out for themselves and won't assist in growth unless they see it as convenient. The managers are constantly trying to meet nonsensical numbers and force their stress on their employees. Everything is about numbers and not quality of work or even client service. If you need time off and you're in a supervisory role, GOOD LUCK. You'll have a less stressful outcome if you just prepare yourself to call out. If you're pregnant, they want you to get on FMLA so that it will cut into your (already short) maternity leave. 

The pay is below industry standard and it is well known. They don't do anything to make up for that fact. Management announced that Schwab was the #1 publicly traded company and that same month lowered the quarterly team allotment for outings. That's the only extra incentive, too. The morale is low and the department is a sinking ship. 

Did you do everything they asked last year? Did you exceed everyone else's numbers but didn't do enough brown nosing? Then you're not getting a promotion or your bonus. There are very few people I know here who are happy with their job/career, and who want to stick around long term.

2.  The management does not value technical people.  If you are technical, you are treated as a second class citizen.  This is a money making financial business and always looks at the bottom line.
3.  Schwab has very questionable morals.  They encouraged their employees to vote for Trump.  They do not encrypt their customers information as they send it to India for example, and overall their marketing says one thing, and the management does another.  They gouge their customers any way they can.  They do not believe in building relationships.  
4.  There is conflict of interest in this company.   They offer financial advice that is borderline illegal because it is skewed towards their own financial products.  Of course they have an army of lawyers that makes sure all is covered in the small print.

The benefits are good, and there is a reasonable work-life balance, depending on your department and job role.","My department had a complete lack of vision and direction, which made for an extremely unstable work environment. Reorganizations happen at least once (sometimes twice) a year, and most come with layoffs or a noticeable volume of employee turnover. Managers are focused on their next ladder move and their ""likability,"" and tend to ignore important personnel and project issues. Trending business/industry models and theories are implemented, only to be disregarded within months when nothing immediately changes. There is little to no employee onboarding or additional training/development after you start, so new employees have to figure things out on their own or make up their own rules. The company places little value on technology, and is behind the curve in providing necessary software and data management tools.

- The facilities you physically work in are nice, in Lone Tree the campus is new so everything's in great shape - though bear in mind you will likely be in a 5'x 5' cubicle. 
- The ""Kool-Aid"" is great, when you first join you feel like you're working for the best company ever. 
- Fellow employees are, for the most part nice, it's hard to really get to know anyone because they push you to be productive like 95% of the time (there are even stats to measure it for you) so having genuine conversations is challenging. 
- If you're into investing they give good employee benefits specifically for that, if you're not...well, there's nice legal services available.","- It should be clarified that these are two separate companies, so be sure you know if you're working for Charles Schwab (brokerage) or Charles Schwab Bank (banking)
- The pay is a) below the industry average and b) not proportional to the cost of living increases 
- You will like be working in a glorified call center. 
- Heavily restricted cafeteria hours, even though MANY employees work non-traditional hours. 
- Moving up (or really at all, even laterally) is difficult, particularly if you start in Charles Schwab Bank - lets say you want to be licensed, you have to study on your own time (compared to the month an unlicensed broker is given to study off the phone) and then IF you pass the first time you get a $2,000.00 salary increase, even though an unlicensed broker likely already makes $6,000.00 more than you off the bat.
- This will become one of the most repetitive jobs you'll ever have, luckily you don't have to read from a script - but you do have many of the same conversations in one given day."

They speak to their offshore team in their own language, and the results are clearly visible in quality of apps in Schwab portfolio. My full timers are leaving because of this culture.

-Constant badge in and badge out. Core hours, no flexibility. Horrible policies to get anything done, zero access on work laptops. everything has to be approved at VP level.

Work environment sometimes promoted negative engagement rather than a positive one.
2538,,Here is an update on my employee experience,2016-07-30,1.0,Operations,"One of the very few pros is the opportunity to learn about the securities industry. This is a very difficult industry to get into and you cannot obtain a series 7 license without sponsorship from a broker dealer like Charles Schwab. 

The company will sponsor you to go through the series 7 program and pay for the books and exam provided you are meeting your productivity goals set in place.","Many employees complain about the pay being lower than what other companies pay for the same type of work. Even if you obtain your series 7 license, you cannot expect a raise in pay. To my understanding, you do get a raise if you also obtain your 9/10 license. However, working as a principle or supervisor role with your 9/10 license is very stressful because they have changed the productivity standard from 3 minutes per case, down to 2 minutes per case. This include reviewing complex account openings such as Trusts and Orgs, which are considered complex account openings. The 9/10 supervisor reps are normally stressed out. The reps who open accounts are also unhappy because of low wages compared to the work performed and the cost of living. 

The company is even too cheap to give overtime and when offered its for one day or a span of a couple of weeks. Then they cancel the overtime offering. This is a detractor because there are some who need to make extra money to save for a vacation, holidays, or all of the above. Charles Schwab should indeed offer overtime opportunities because they require you to submit any additional outside work to them for approval. So Schwab does not offer the overtime and then you have to get approval from them to take on a second job??? They deny you for the second job and then what? How are you going to pay your rent or mortgage or other expenses? So in other words, if you work for this firm, they will own you."

It was made clear early to watch my back and keep every email to cover my actions; trust is nonexistent.   Going in with a enthusiasm and ideas was immediately rejected.  I experienced leaders with a passive aggressive nature and an air of superiority that was sickening.  They treat direct reports and those under them with arrogance and disrespect.   Only caring about their direct bosses, no one pays attention or bothers to see what is really going on.  A majority of the staff is contractors, and they are  treated like outsiders.   Teamwork within the leadership team was nonexistent.   I never once heard a tenured employee say something positive about another department or person.  Sad.   Data is getting transferred from the SF site with little to no structure, and any attempt to fill in gaps is immediately rejected.   This has been the worst job experience I have ever experienced; the pay is not worth it."

Can-do attitude.",Compensation does not measure up to the investment management industry as a whole. Some key talent left recently. Small AUM declines could mean sharp cuts in bonus.

Benefits have progressively gotten worse. Cronyism is rampant in Investor Services.

Schwab Intelligent Portfolios is the best and most public example of the culture in decline. Schwab changed it's recommended allocations so that more client money would be in cash for the sole benefit of the share holders and company executives. Then Schwab forgot to budget the incentive cost for FCs to sell free advice resulting in massive budget cuts, hiring freezes and extremely understaffed conditions. This made a huge impact on clients and employees. Sr Leadership has disappeared during all of this and in many cases started to install scapegoats to buffer them from the fallout. Morale is at a ten year low by a wide margin. All of these budget cuts were again to support earnings and shareholder equity (few employees are shareholders any longer) of which Sr Leaders are the primary beneficiaries. We were told the cuts were to pay a full bonus (not much any way) but that didn't even happen last year. All of this is one example of profit at the expense of clients and low paid employees."

Like the stability with salaried + fee pay, it is also a con because you might have a great month in trading and new accounts that would warrant high commissions. Yet, you're stuck with salary.

The call center schedule is very strict, and may be subject to change to fit business needs, although there is plenty of time given for employees to plan around any changes.

If hired under COE (Condition of Employment) to pass the Series 7 and 66 exams, BE PREPARED to devote an incredible amount of your time and resources to pass these exams -especially if you have no previous finance experience.

I believe in time the new focus will show its inefficiencies and the previous management's focus will be brought back.  It could be great again.","The culture has changed!  The FCs are conflicted vs what the firm wants to ""sell"" to the public (wealth management) and what the role is really based upon (volume).  From this seasoned FC's humble opinion, you can't have it both ways.  We are held to tasks and box checking standards that do not coincide with true wealth management.  It seems the firm would welcome all 20 somethings to only focus on the next sale rather than maintaining the client relationship and to value the retention.  The compensation is geared toward the next sale and next dollar in.  That breeds a poor client relationship.  The culture has severely changed in the last few years.  FC morale is LOW and we don't feel like valued members of the firm.  The mentality from management is you are easily replaceable and the clients are not yours but belong to Schwab.  Do NOT wrap your arms around them as you only rent the compensation and the them until they leave the advised solution, spend their retirement money or perhaps move on to another advisor because you are not focused on them after they get into advice.  The compensation model is broken and it's not a concern.  If you want to work here prepare for the treadmill of ""what have you done for me today"" not even ""lately"".

It's a purpose-driven company which somewhat helps keep you grounded through what feels like constant change and downsizing in San Francisco.","I used to think I could do my best work at Schwab, then the downsizing in San Francisco began. There used to be 6,000 employees in San Francisco. When the current round of moves away from SF are completed, there will only be about 1,100. This is very unsettling for those staff members in San Francisco. The company feels like it's being managed from outside California (in many areas), even though the headquarters is still technically in SF. There are concerns about whether the number of positions in SF will continue to shrink over time.

It's a tough culture to be innovative and cutting-edge. Many talented staff members have left. It's the end of an era for Schwab in SF -- especially for those of us who knew it during it high points."

Nothing at CS moves fast. CS relies heavily on contract employees both onshore an offshore and this presents a challenge. The contract employees (mostly of Indian decent) have their own clique, they stay together and are rather secretive but in the chance they do share information it's rather hard to understand exactly what their saying. I also found that many of the contract employees don't understand investing thus they just go through the motions without real insight into the business to which they are writing code for, which presents a big problem. This is just my frustration and there have been many developers come in an do a great job without issues but then I've also seen top developers leave within a year because of the issues listed above."

Micro management is now on steroids as is check the box criteria that have zero beneficial results for the client but since the firm invested money in some technology it must be used extensively even if it is a waste of time and energy.

Used to have good culture, but no longer the case after Chuck retired.","Pressure cooker environment at branch offices.  Advisors are expected to bring in $5 million net new asset and enroll a couple million of these assets in fee-based platform every quarter, among numerous performance metrics they are expected to deliver.  Management literally treats advisors like little children and everyone is supposed to check-off a long-list of required activities.  Performance is assessed every quarter, and advisors are constantly fearful of losing their jobs if they somehow had a bad year.  The lofty goals ensures that advisors have little time to take care of existing clients, but they are expected to make up the difference if/when existing clients leave.  All the while the advisors are being paid peanuts compared to industry standards, while management continues to cut costs by cutting into advisor and branch manager compensation every single year.  Advisors are also under tremendous pressure to push proprietary investment products such as Windhaven, SMP, etc. that had been performing poorly.  Of the 1,200 or so advisors within the branch network, between 15-20% of the advisors have less than 1 year in tenure.  It is a revolving door and advisors who can't take the high-pressure and high target long-term will leave.  Those who stay are very unhappy but afraid to leave, because Schwab sues pretty much everyone that goes to a competitor.

If you make 100k-150k and do the work of three people Schwab makes out  vs. three people at 75k each. In order to manage it you end up doing what's easier for you vs. what's best for the clients. Attrition is very high for one of the better paying jobs in this location.
  
Ethics - They preach great ethics, the employees and lower managers practice great ethics and are very ethical. Upper management/founder, the San Francisco elite - no ethics or concern for anyone but themselves.

On-going training is always canceled if we have high call volume.  However, you are held responsible when you make a mistake due to the lack of training that was previous canceled, leaving you holding the bag.  That brings me to finger pointing.  Managers are extremely efficient at finger pointing and outsourcing the blame to their brokers who have not received the adequate training due to their poor planning.

2807,,Does not understand UI Engineering,2015-08-28,1.0,UI Engineer,Not many. Their lack of UI knowledge does not create much opportunity for constructive criticism.  Schwab's focus is on a dated hierarchical culture before working as a team to create better technology.,"They have adapted TypeScript and Angular as front end technology. On the surface, the code looks brilliant, well organized, and highly functional. As you peel back the layers, you see many anti-patterns, and a very unprofessional attitude among leads enforce these anti-patterns. Schwab has this hierarchy leadership culture that does not easily permit new knowledge and ideas, especially from contractors. It's a very dated mindset, where as open source technology facilitates communal contributions.

TypeScript is used as an excuse not to learn Angular properly. Inheritance is strongly favored over composition, with deep layers of super classes. This creates, ironically, very tight coupling to dead code and unused functionality, so refactoring and clean up is a major task that takes weeks. 

A lot of money is wasted working in poor architecture.

Angular controllers are +10k lines.

Overuse of Angular logic in html ( ng-if, ng-show, ng-init ), which are well documented anti-patterns. They have no clue how to create and use directives properly to fix these issues. 

Routes are used like services to re-use controllers, where services should be used. Hence the +10k lines in controllers. Where as routes should be used for deep linking, and not necessarily for state management. They have to use variable swaps to keep data ""organized"". Very fragile code. They clearly do not understand modularization and separation of concerns.

Use of TypeScript causes memory leaks and fragile functionality, where if they learn angular, this would not be an issue as much.

Worst of all, leadership blames ""inexperienced"" people of poorly written code and bugs, yet they approve every line committed via code reviews. They take no responsibility of work submitted. By this workflow, they should be accountable for everything. In other companies and industries, leadership takes full responsibility in a similar workflow. The lead architect and team leads facilitate this culture of non-collaboration, as if they will lose their job for fear of incompetence if they listen to other people objectively.

When presenting Angular Standards to leadership, you will hear excuses like ""all that javascript"", ""we need to do that in TypeScript"", The senior developers facilitate this attitude. If they would adopt angular standards more, and not typescript or outdated web standards, they could reduce their code base by 70% to have a more performant and secure architecture.

As a result, the bugs in their apps are infinite."

Company culture is a positive environment and one of the strongest assets in attracting talent.,"Company morale in SF is at an all time low since it has publicly disclosed a downsize presence in SF. Pay is average, however it cannot compete with other financial services firm and neighboring technology companies like Salesforce. There is no career growth and lack of internal promotion which causes employees to look for other opportunities.

2852,,Customer Service at Schwab,2015-07-13,4.0,Registed Representative II,Schwab gives very intense trainings.  Will give you training so that you can pass your Series 7 and 63 licensing. Environment is very positive and competitive.,Shifts. Most schedules are 10 hours shifts.  No direct way of getting a promotion unless trying to change positions. Works on team concept but you have no time to interact with co-workers unless thru instant message or outside of work.

2856,,Excellent Culture,2015-07-10,5.0,Talent Attraction Manager,"Schwab is a company that bends over backwards to empower their employees to delight clients and to allow their employees the opportunity to grow personally and professionally.  I've never seen an environment so dedicated to doing right by the customer before doing well financially, however I think that singular focus on the customer is what allows them to do well on the Street,","Well they spend a fortune on training, base salaries could be more competitive.

Good people were demoted or asked to leave. Company has become much more bureaucratic than it used to be. Death by meeting.
2860,,Manager,2015-07-06,4.0,Manager,Dynamic work environment.  They welcome creativity and your contribution.  Ethical foundation with clients best interest in mind.  Reward you for hard work and individual contributions.,Health coverage is very expensive.
2861,,Business Analyst,2015-07-06,5.0,Anonymous Employee,Flexible work environment and strong internal communication.,Salaries could be more competitive with similar job descriptions at other firms.
2862,,Take your talent elsewhere!!!,2015-07-05,1.0,Operations Associate,Pay and benefits in exchange for work performed. Some colleagues who have a very good attitude. Its actually my team members that have gotten me through this oppressive enviornment. Good teams but bad managers.,"As a few folks have stated the schedules ARE inflexible. I asked my manager for a more flexible schedule and was told no because only the favorites who have been with the company for years can choose the schedule they want. 

When I applied for the job, the job description advertised the bonus as between 2k and 5k per year. However, after I was hired, the offer letter said 2k to 4k per year (so they changed the top number after I was reeled in). In actuality its 500 per quarter less taxes, which comes out to 2k per year minus taxes. 

The productivity system they measure you by is not accurate and employees skew the numbers after learning how to manipulate the system. This causes the ones who are processing correctly to have to work even harder to make the numbers. The managers are aware of this but they ignore it. 

As some others have stated in their reviews, your success with this company and whether or not you like your job depends on if your manager likes you. If your manager does not like you, they are given the leeway to make your work life a living hell. 

During any one on one's with your manager the manager treats you like you are a patient and he or she is a Psychologist. Allow me to explain. The manager has a note pad and writes down any ambiguous statements that you make that can be taken negatively and then uses these statements against you. Furthermore, if you have any type of nervous physical habits they write that down on their pad and then ""provide feedback"" on this and classify it as negative behavior. Still further, management has a system where they even give you fake feedback to put you on the defense and then when you deny the behavior they say you are not accepting feedback. So its a lose lose situation for the employee. In a nutshell, management is given the leeway by the company to mistreat employees as I have described and the employees have no recourse. They have a human resources prop put in place but thats about it. So my advice is, if you do decide to work here, be phony to survive. Pretend to like your manager even if you don't. If one of your colleagues is not treating you right or is acting inappropriately - just ignore it. Otherwise, if you report it, it is used against you and they make you out to be the odd person out. Also, make sure you document every interaction from your one on ones with your manager and any incidents that take place. That way if you are thrown under the bus, you can at least try and cover your butt.

Management and upper-management all know each other very well and have worked together for years. This compromises any integrity, especially regarding employee treatment."

2868,,Top notch Company,2015-07-01,4.0,,Work Life balance. Competitive comp.,Health benefits significantly downgraded with only high deductible HSA plan available
2869,,Call center? Yes,2015-06-30,2.0,Broker,Colleagues all have the same outlook as me,"Where to start? You are micromanaged to the hilt.  Numbers numbers numbers are measured.  How long was your call (average handle time), how long was your wrap up of your calls, how many calls did you take, how closely did you adhere to your schedule,  how much time did you spend during the day not taking calls.  Don't even think about taking a call if it's going to go into your break or lunch as this will count against your adherencee.  Oh and if you want to really have good customer service and need to call a client back per their request you better make it a quick call because this will count against you as you are supposed to adhere to your schedule and an outbound call is the same as not being on the phones when you're supposed to  be.  You are on the phones all day long with one 30 minure team meeting a week.  We get training time scheduled every week but we never get to take it because we always get alerted out meaning there are too many calls waiting to be answered.  The job is grueling and tedious.  Call after call after call after call.  You can never take a breather otherwise your manager will bring it up in your team meeting going over PERF ( performance numbers).  My advice is if you don't want to be in a micromanaged environment where every thing you do is measured by some metric (metrics that your $500 quarterly bonus depends on) look somewhere else like the Gap or Taco Bell. And you're expected to put in leads for new assets that you uncover, leads that you have to hand off to the advice or sales teams that make over 6 figures simply by taking your leads and converting them.  Oh and leads are required.  The more you have the better living you make for the sales team.  You don't get paid squat on them even if you do all the leg work to uncover them.  Think twice about interviewing for a CSR role, it's not worth the agony"
2870,,Depends on what you are looking for,2015-06-30,2.0,Product Manager,"1. Great Work/Life balance
2. Good pay for workload","1. Like most young companies - big, but has a lot of growing up to do.
2. Very paternal management culture style.
3. Very little advancement opportunities - (good and bad of employees with long tenure). Bad being that senior positions are generally filled by employee attrition rather than talent.
4. Almost non-existent field training opportunities - management practically discourages.
5. Generally working remote is not an option.
6. Company is not as innovative as they market - a customer may get a cool new investment tool, but an employee is probably going to be running on an xp machine."
2871,,I'm Pretty Happy,2015-06-30,4.0,Financial Consultant,Wide range of jobs. Tons of areas for growth and advancement. The sky is the limit.,There is always going to be something to complain about. Schwab is a great company but you have to be ok with corporate America.
2872,,Terrible company,2015-06-29,1.0,Financial Services Professional,co workers are great to work with,Managers are cutthroat. You don't get paid nearly for all the work that you do. You have to ask to use the bathroom. 30 min lunch for 11 hour days
2873,,Senior Manager,2015-06-28,3.0,Senior Manager,"People are passionate about their work.  The company is genuine about helping clients succeed in their financial life.  Benefits are generally ok.  Pretty standard for a financial company.  Don't compare it to a tech start-up, you'll be disappointed.  The sabbatical is definitely a plus that you don't typically see elsewhere.  401k match is good.","Innovation is slow, especially around tech.  As much as the company would like to be innovative, changing priorities and management makes it difficult to move the needle.  If you don't like working in a geo-located matrix style team, then this is not the place for you.  Advancement is limited.  They encourage you to look lateral instead."
2874,,Profits Before People,2015-06-25,1.0,FTE,Has one of the best infrastructures in the business. The primary focus is on Security and the customer. Individual staff members are outstanding and very talented.,"One of the most uncomfortably restrictive environments that I have worked in. HR does not support staff, only management. Pay is low, benefits are mediocre at best. Reorganizations run rampant and are very disruptive. Too many contract and off-shore positions mean valuable and talented employees are overlooked and often have to leave in the middle of projects. Too many rules, regulations and policies in regards to staff are restrictive and devalue talented employees. People do not matter to this organization on any level."
2875,,Good but not great,2015-06-23,4.0,Anonymous Employee,This is a solid conservative company with great benefits.  Like any other large corporation your division and manager can make or break the experience. I found that most people in the company were willing to help you on projects even if they had never met you before. I was impressed with how well different divisions worked together considering how large the company is. I think it was as good as it could be given all of the unavoidable cons.,Like any corporation they are very process oriented and centralized. It can take a long time to get things done because of the bureaucracy to be dealt with. It can be difficult to break out of your current job role to try new things. Being a financial services company they are focused on security and they are highly regulated. This adds to the bureaucratic sluggishness.

That's a big problem for me. I'm making plans to leave the business altogether. Other negatives is you feel like a little cog in a wheel, a cog like any other..no individuality, no real freedom to advise clients how you see fit. Everyone looks the same, dresses the same, acts the same. BORING! High level of micromanaging and surveillance too."

However, the recent emphasis on shipping jobs out of San Francisco to save money sometimes pits employees in different locations against each other. Relocation packages are not as generous as they used to be. There are many talented people, often overworked. 401(k) match is excellent; health insurance is so-so. Great access to financial services through the employee branch. Work-life balance was fairly good. A person gets to develop some great working relationships, though that's harder now with so many people leaving or relocated.","There's a lot of bureaucracy and a lot of fear of regulators. Lawyers rule everything. The old culture of collaboration, cooperation, and innovation is dying, with its death hastened by moving as many jobs as possible out of San Francisco. If you're not in San Francisco, I could recommend the company. But I've given it a thumbs-down because San Francisco is no longer a good location.

The managers and directors should be straight out of Office Space.  They got an MBA somewhere along the way and they think they are god's gift and better than everybody.  Anybody that has any self-respect or has any ability to think outside the box should leave after 2 years tops.

Always barely qualified or underqualified females getting promoted over men with way better experience.

Clients compliment us for our openness and honesty, which helps with the feelings of job satisfaction. Health Plan was among the best until Obamacare forced the company to stop offering a ""Cadillac Plan"", but still provides good access to health care. Decent pay for a competent client phone services person. Four-week sabbatical every 5 years for employees is also an excellent benefit.","The company has gone way overboard with minutia thanks to ""Human Resources"" policy changes during past 10 or so years. One example is how they've crafted a mechanism by which they find ways to avoid paying bonuses to employees. It used to be that the company paid out a full bonus quarterly, depending upon the company's performance for the preceding business quarter. All employees were able to participate, and in a particularly good quarter, everybody felt a genuine feeling of achievement & reward for a job well done, which went light years towards fostering an environment that helped keep employee morale high. With the change fostered by the HR geniuses, the first three quarterly bonuses in the year are now considerably smaller amounts known as an ""advance""; the fourth, paid out during the first quarter of the following year, is now a rigidly calculated, employee-performance-based amount, which the average front-line employee may or may not receive, depending upon whether you're in good graces with your immediate manager. The emphasis of whether employees fully participate in a corporate bonus plan has shifted from the company's performance to that of the individual employee. What used to be a fairly quick, efficient and concise quarterly review process when bonuses were disclosed has evolved into a minutia-laden process that now requires a 16-page document to explain why you might or might not get an annual bonus. The longer that document gets, the smaller your annual bonus is likely to be.    

And get this - if you leave the company prior to that annual ""bonus"" calculation, you get nothing, in spite of the effort you put in during the previous 12 months. The changes in the bonus plan payout implemented by HR have been front-loaded in favor the company at the expense of employees. 

So it should come as no surprise that, thanks to the implementation of Obamacare. employees who used to benefit from an outstanding health care plan - most able to enjoy the convenience of small co-pay instead of much larger co-insurance costs - now face a much larger portion of those costs. To its credit, the company has contributed up to $1000 annually to Health Savings Accounts for employees; whether that contribution continues remains to be seen. But in describing the changes to the company's Health Plan, one of the company's HR higher-ups mentioned that some employees may have ""cash flow problems"" as a result of the changes. Obviously, a guy with a 6-figure income has a different definition of what constitutes a ""Cash Flow Problem"" than the average front-line employee. 

And don't get me started on the invasion of our privacy in the world of e-mail, IM, and even outside social media use. Forget about passing jokes along to co-workers, unless you like putting your bonus, or even your job, at risk.  HR-implemented policies in this regard will help keep employee morale in right in the toilet. Apparently, a sense of humor is not welcome in this type of HR-focused world. 

I'm baffled by a recent trend to hire managers for jobs in which they have no experience nor expertise. It gives off an appearance that higher-ups view managers as interchangeable pegs which they are then able to place in a variety of holes, whether appropriate or not. I see no benefit to employee morale from this type of policy. The team cohesiveness which once existed between team members and their manager - largely because the manager knew and understood every facet of the job faced by the front-line employee - is an important bond which helps keep an esprit de corps among the troops and has gone missing."

The company is moving from San Francisco to Denver, Phoenix and Austin in a cost cutting ploy.  

Most employees are just trying to hold onto their jobs and won't rock the boat even though the layoff cloud is hanging over everyone's head.

Overly bureaucratic organization.  Even simple changes require multiple levels of review and approval.  The work is stressful and deadlines are unrealistic.  

Over reliance on outsourcing for development work.  The in house technical leaders mainly write powerpoint presentations and are disconnected from the real work."

They also recognize that employee engagement is a big part of  creating a great experience and long lasting client relationships. 

Business plans are tied to company mission and focus on the client.

Benefits - they offer a one month fully paid sabbatical for every 5 years of service. This really is huge, as during that time employees get to really disconnect and recharge. It also helps with retention. Vacation accruals increase over time from 8 hrs to 13.3 per month. They also offer a 401k match.

Smart driven colleagues that also know how to make work fun.","Annual reorganizations - can be a make it challenging to keep project momentum up and are also tough for employees who end up with new management structures.  It requires flexibility and adaptability, as well as figuring out how to quickly get to know your new manager's work style and expectations.

Flat annual pay increases that necessarily keep up with inflation, also demotivating for employees. While the company does have a bonus program to provide differentiation and works to recognize performance, often the rewards for project management and marketing related roles rely on the luck of the draw and being on the most visible project for that year.

When I started, there were two layers of management between me and the branch network executive, now there are four.  There seems to be no real vision for Schwab that includes the development of its key branch network employees, except running them ragged and churning and burning.  Also, the regulatory environment is terrible and Schwab being a conservative company with antiquated computer systems makes managing compliance issues another part-time job in addition to your sales expectations.

Schwab lets you take the time to treat the client RIGHT and provides the infrastructure to do so. It is not perfect, but when you need help there is an SOS Team that you can call for ANY question on how to help the client and they will give you information on how to handle the call and help you find the correct procedure, department, etc. so that your learning and professionalism is supported at ALL times. I found the leaders to be inspirational and grounded - people who really care about the welfare of human beings. Our Executive VP in Denver (who has now left) knew every front line associate's name and knew something about their life. She knew ALL of the details about operations and set an amazing example- she would spend a certain number of hours every month taking client calls so that she had a clear understanding of the client experience - just like Chuck did when he started the company. Schwab also has a one month paid sabbatical for employees who work there for at least five years (you get one every five) on top of vacation. Benefits are very good, not great. Health Insurance, 401k, Life Insurance, etc. If you work hard and have a great attitude, you will have lots of opportunities to move up.","No raises for a very long time, and some support teams (which I worked for) are not as strongly recognized for their hard work due to the nature of their position and not having client contact."

Laid-back work environment. Good work/life balance.","Salary of a software engineer is below industry standard in the SF bay area. I guess it makes sense since it is a bank and not a software company. Software development is considered a cost center.
Yearly increase is very small even if your merit rating is very good.
Software engineering managers are a joke. Very few are technical. Most managers do not know how to program or do not have a computer science background."

3043,,Schwab continually receives lowest employee engagement results for a reason.,2014-11-12,1.0,Manager,Good trading technology for clients.,"HR is weak and will not support employees who have been a victim of harassment and discrimination.  External whistleblowing firm that they use is really a firm that collects information from employees to vet potential lawsuits for Schwab, it is not there to protect employees. When I started with the firm, I discovered an issue that would affect the financials of Schwab. I was never rewarded for my findings and in fact was grilled as to why I caused the issue (which wasn't the case since I was just hired and in my research the issue went back as far as 4 years prior to my employment!).  I was asked to fix it, which I gladly did - since it was the right thing to do, then was never asked about it again nor rewarded.  I saw several negative people (negative to the point of destroying things in the office or not wanting to do the work that the person was assigned to them) that were later promoted because ""it would cheer them up and make them better employees"".  I saw a negative employee who was jealous because he was not a manager and started secret coalitions with his coworkers to destroy their manager or setup ""traps"" to trip up the manager. This person was promoted to manager.  I saw another negative employee who had said racial slurs but was promoted because ""she worked hard"".  So you can be a racist and still get promoted? The one thing that connected these individuals was that they were all white.  TO GET PROMOTED: Have a temper tantrum all day, setup coups against your manager, say nasty things about your colleagues and your manager and, by all means, don't do the work that has been assigned to you.  The RPS office seems to be happy people. The Retirement institutional services people are the lowest on the totem pole of professional people.  Values and leadership are a mess at Schwab in Austin, TX."

Quality of life is also extremely important to management which means no late nights at the office unless it's absolutely necessary.,From a competitive salary/bonus perspective they could stand to do a better job.

Nice to work for an investment company that is truly transparent about its offerings and provides excellent customer service. Great work-life balance (almost too good--the work suffers because management is so supportive of people's ""issues"").","Systems, policies, and procedures reward mediocrity. Technology is restrictive and outdated. You'll spend most of your time navigating the bureaucracy instead of actually doing any real work. Untalented, problematic people get coddled. Good luck getting a promotion--Schwab doesn't understand how to reward, cultivate, or retain top talent. Shameful how much time and effort are spent on work that never sees the light of day, which isn't just frustrating: it costs investors money!"

Leadership is a job, won't talk to you at all and managers are forced to manage by stats...stats are huge. They dont care how many calls you take or what you go through to make clients happy...it's all about numbers. 

Applying for other jobs within is a joke, politics!! You can have the experience and all the qualifications but they'll hire someone that's been there a year  over tenure. You feel forced in your role and like there's no hope forcing you to find employment elsewhere. Salary and raises are a joke also. They have a pay grade system  and when I started  10 years ago you got pretty good raises now 2% annually not gonna cut it when rents at its all time high. Also new reps are starting out at what people are making that's been at the company for 5 plus years without no industry experience. They pay these reps to get license etc just to see them leave the firm, because they realize it's all a joke. It's a good starter firm, but don't waste years thinking Schwab will invest in you..."

3053,,Solid company with a great future,2014-10-12,5.0,Registered Representative,"For someone starting off in the financial sector (especially as a new career - my last career was in theatre), this is the perfect place to work. Schedules are fixed and predictable, with overtime available if you want the extra income. There's a great work/life balance and a family-first culture, so if you need that sick day (mental health day), then take it. Managers are available for questions, consistent feedback, 1-on-1's and general coaching. We're also getting a brand new office in SE Denver - career growth opportunities are many and varied. Strong company values and a client-first attitude lead to rewarding interactions (people actually like calling us). Oh, and the yearly bonus is great too.

PS - If you're driven and ambitious (you have to be both), there are great opportunities available. It is hard work, you start off in the call center and you'll be there for at LEAST two years. However, if you want to get into a branch as an AFC, you have to excel in your current role and network with other successful people.","The salary isn't great. Other firms pay nominally better and although I think the culture makes up for it, upper management needs to consider raising the base rate. Ten-hour shifts can be long and tax season is exhausting. The current training materials are inadequate and I wish we could move faster with website improvements (the password system - come on)."

People who have put in time and effort are often not promoted. It seems that there is no clear definition on who can be promoted and why.

Long time engineers here know their stuff and are always helpful towards new people.,"Experienced software engineers are underpaid by at least 50% when comparing against BLS data for the Bay Area (in 2010). Schwab management hierarchy is massive, the company puts an emphasis on the business side with engineers being seen as mere interchangeable assets. As a result of this bloated, top heavy management structure you will be required to attend many meetings throughout the day so that your most immediate 3-4 managers can report to their managers on how the work is going. Generally you might find 2 hours (3 hours if you work at your desk during lunch, a common practice at Schwab) between meetings to complete some actual work. 

The culture is corporate, stodgy and sterile with new policies designed to reign in the ""work/life"" balance by destroying telecommuting privileges and punishing those that challenge the status quo.

Free access to a Financial Consultant, discounts on trading fees, and a generous Employee Stock Purchase Plan. Honestly, the 401K isn’t bad either.  Match up to 5%, good funds to select from, and a discounted managed portfolio for those that want it.  Ok pay, ok salary increases (3% in 2014), ok profit sharing bonus.

Large and stable company that you know is going to be around for the long haul.","Frankly, I have to agree with most of the other comments I am seeing on here.  Schwab is a very conservative organization that is slow to change and improve.  Seriously, I am still using Windows XP and Office 2003.  

I also agree with the comments regarding management.  It appears to me that the people promoted to directors and VPs aren’t really the best candidates, but have been the ones that stayed around the longest.  Most don’t appear to have any new fresh ideas of how to improve the “client experience.”  They also aren’t very realistic on their expectations and timelines they set for the executives.  I saw one comment about how managers shield the executives from what is really going on and I could not agree more.  I will also add that the directors and VPs that really have fresh new ideas tend to get pushed out fairly quickly.  I think a lot of the VPs and even the managing directors really set up some of the employees for failure.

I also completely agree with the negative comments regarding the healthcare benefits.  I was very frustrated with this change and it has caused me to look for employment elsewhere.  I also completely agree with the feedback regarding the possible advancements.

It definitely appears to me that Schwab has implemented several tactics meant to keep employees even those that might want to leave, which I think leads to some of the negative comments about the workforce.  For example, Schwab doesn’t contribute to your 401K regularly it’s only once per year in February.  Also, the bonus (really more of a profit sharing bonus) is only paid annually in March.  The profit sharing bonus I get, but the 401K contributions really bother me.

I would also like to highlight one of the most confusing elements at Schwab.  I completely agree with the comments about Schwab being very client focused.  Seriously, they will bend over backwards and even provide client experience gestures (money) to people that complain.  However, the directors and VPs just don’t seem to even think about ways to improve the client experience in a practical sense.  I could list 20 or so things that as a client just drive me nuts that Schwab could fix really easily, but they don’t."

I am used to being given training packets that go over the big picture of any concept. We give easy to understand materials to clients, why not to reps?

- Lack of professionalism. I should not be able hear a QA rep critiquing each person on my team to my boss or overhear my coworkers selling their merits to my boss in hopes of moving up on a daily basis. Have basic business etiquette, take it to a conference room. 

-Rude helpline reps are not disciplined and continue the same behavior. This discourages us from calling the helpline.

- High stress - you constantly watch the #s you have to meet throughout the day. If you pause between phone calls you will hurt your metrics. You also always feel like someone's watching you or they might come up and ask you to stand on your head and do a performance for no reason. It just felt like a very aggressive culture. At first I didn't understand why there were so few women there, but after a while it made sense. 

-The manager did not typically lead the weekly meeting which made for a lot of uncomfortable situations. It seemed that after being on the phone for 9 hours we reps were expected to present material or lead discussion groups. This is seen as a way to set you apart. I was extremely uncomfortable with it as it was not included in the job description and the purpose was never explained. If you like controlling a room, giving a performance and being on stage - this is the place for you. If you want be overly expressive to try to win an Emmy every week in your one on one meeting with your manager - this is for you. Also many reps felt uncomfortable with a CSR leading the meeting when most reps were higher-ranked brokers. It just didn't make sense logically what we stood to gain from this. I would rather learn something market or trading-related by watching a video or reading an article during time off the phone, then feel like we are on a game show. I felt very poked and prodded. 

Work/Life Balance: 
-Hard to get specific Saturday vacation days. Most shifts involve working Saturdays. Many shifts are 10 hour days- that's a long time on the phone.
-Overtime was ""very strongly encouraged"" during tax season which was stressful."

3140,,Attitude is Everything,2014-05-14,5.0,Anonymous Employee,Great place to work. There are many different routes one could take in their career here. Leadership is more than willing to sit down and share their experiences with you and mentor you. If you are willing to do the footwork to advance your career you'll be happy here.,There are bad managers at Schwab that contribute to employee disengagement. These managers are throughout the organization.
3141,,Great if you drink the Kool-aid....,2014-05-12,1.0,Customer Service Representative,Benefits. The company offers a friendly and fun culture as a whole but for me this did not translate into a good working environment. I was constantly put on the spot and made to feel uncomfortable the entire time. Its like working in a fish bowl.  The micro management is severe.,"Constant black outs for vacations especially during the holidays and Saturdays.  Tax season is horrible. No vacation time allowed from Jan thru April. High turnover. There is not much room to move up in the Indianapolis site unless you want to remain on the phones. You have no say on your schedule. Yes you can bid, however, my options were :basically all the same schedule but at varying times of the day. For example, I could work Sun-Thurs 8-6:30 or  8:30-7 and so on. If I cant work Sun, this is no help! Dont be fooled! Unrealistic  expectations for being on the phones. I was afraid to go the bathroom as I knew it would count against my stats. Seriously! If you are loud, obnoxious and have a strong bladder, you will do just fine. However if you are a more reserved person who likes the liberty of not being chained to a desk, run..don't walk away from Schwab. They def have their favorites. You can tell by how the bonuses are paid. Not much room for growth in Indy unless you want to stay in a call center."
3142,,Be careful of which division you are looking at,2014-05-12,3.0,Anonymous Employee,"Overall it's a great organization, closely aligned with Chuck's values(pro-investor, anti-Wall Street/Bankster).  Fairly good comp, but frequently outbid for top talent(especially techies), including managerial/leadership talent.","Of course, every division will tell you the sky is the limit, everything is rosy, but just keep in mind that pension plans are rapidly disappearing, and record keeping is a race to the bottom......so corresponding divisions are very constrained for budgets, talent, development, etc. compared to the healthier margin areas.  Also, some managers/leaders are organizational/educational inbreeds, and lack the perspective, judgement, and skill that would be relevant to their elevated positions.  Along with budget constraints, this is why some areas are stuck in the dark ages and don't know it.  Many managers are spreadsheet and policy/procedures wizards but have an extreme lack of common sense and business sense.......pointy heads!"
3143,,Mixed,2014-05-07,2.0,,There are some very good managers.,Some of the managers are completely unqualified.

I have been fortunate to have managers and managing directors who have been supportive and encouraging of my career path. One month sabbatical every 5 years of employment.","In a sales role, you can burn out with monthly goals always resetting.

The founder's core value and vision are clear to the company.  The best perks are the sabbatical and access to complimentary financial planning.,"Over the years, the company decreases the benefits to all the employees but the bar keep going up.  They want the best people but don't compensate them with the best salaries or benefits.  People are dispensable as the company decided to move another 1000 jobs away from San Francisco, leaving only jobs related to the header quarter in SF.  This follows all the other jobs they moved outside of SF a few years ago."
3147,,Expected more,2014-04-24,1.0,Customer Service Representative,"Work with great people, sabbatical","Low pay, ridiculous raises,  no career growth mostly lateral moves.  Management has no backbone, they don't stand or help their staff."

3151,,Best of the brokerage firms.  Great company values.,2014-04-10,5.0,Investment Consultant,Schwab offers thorough training that prepares you to perform your duties confidently and professionally.  Employees are encouraged/required to get additional certifications.  The company is extremely ethical and   emphasizes the client's needs.,Company marketing initiatives and campaigns are constantly changing and rolled out too frequently.  The  compensation structure is complex and consists of too many variables/inputs.  Quarterly targets are often set too high with seemingly little regard for the demographics of the individual branches.
3152,,They are ok.,2014-04-10,3.0,Financial Consultant (BET),"As long as Chuck is alive and somewhat involved, the vision will be consistent.  
Health insurance benefits were once better but now about the same as everywhere else.  Every 5 years you get a 30 day paid sabbatical.  
Promotions are possible when you start in an entry-level position.","Compensation is decent but you will never get rich.  
Very few people ever start in an entry level position and get past low-level management/supervisor.  You get pigeon-holed and they believe you are the same as the day you started no matter what education level you achieve.
The culture is very cliquish.  As long as you can play the corporate politics game well you will be fine but if you can't or don't want to play the game you will not go very far.  It is VERY MUCH about the political game."
3153,,Ok to start your career,2014-04-10,3.0,Project Manager,"Great culture and nice people work here. Found some life-long career buddies here.  If you are looking for a firm that really believes that they help the public, then look no further. These guys invented it.",Bonus structure and abundance of mid-level managers offer a stagnant CYA corporate environment.  This is due to the size of the organization.

The people at Schwab are generally very good people and are willing to help get things accomplished.,It seems very difficult to move up the chain in the corporate office. A lot of jobs are being primarily backfilled at other locations.
3162,,Overall it was a good experience.,2014-03-27,4.0,Anonymous Employee,Good opportunities for those who work had and set goals and meet and exceed them.,"It is like any other big company, phone center, production based call center."

Great work life balance.","To conservative to execute on any meaninful action plan.  Calls themselves a challenger brand, that was a long time ago. Middle management is weak and detrimental to LOB.

3165,,Learned a lot...,2014-03-21,3.0,Regional Sales,"Schwab has great co-workers and great clients.   You can learn a lot from your peers (not necessarily management) if you advocate and network, and have results that earn you the opportunity to participate in professional development.","Sales leaders are better administrators than salespeople, yet they have a very high opinion of themselves.   Short term thinking on company priorities has negative impact on client relationships, and impacts your ability to achieve. Upward advancement in sales organization almost impossible, for internal candidates, unless you have earned the favor of the upper ranks, which doesn't necessarily have much to do with merit.   Management lacks diversity of thinking or perspective.  It is best to get your experience here, and move on to other opportunities where your skills are appreciated.  I saw many talented individuals, frustrated by lack of advancement, go on to achieve much better success once they left."

There's a reason everyone can go home at 5 p.m.","I joined Schwab almost two years ago and believed it would be a wonderful opportunity. However, if you're a Sr. Manager, you will be treated like an assistant. The lack of management capabilities, meaningful delegation and encouragement to make a contribution toward anyone below Director level is appalling for a company of this stature in the financial services industry."
3168,,Being a Schwabbie,2014-03-12,3.0,Relationship Specialist,"Company has good foundations, they offer a lot of employee reward programs, promote a team environment.",They don't necessarily advertise that some of their positions are essentially a call center (on top of a queue of work you're expected to process as well).

The benefits are okay.  The 401k matching is good.","The micromanagement is taken to extremes.  In order to get rated anything other than ""meets expectations"", you have to walk on water.  Management's decisions are so poor, you'll think they are bonused on how many employees they can get to quit each year."
3174,,Boring place to work with TERRIBLE benefits,2014-03-03,1.0,Finance Manager,"Central downtown location in SF, 9-5 type of job, requires no brain power. If you are looking for the type of job where you climb the ladder through networking, and not merits..then this is your type of job. Management takes a while to fire people so for non-performers this company provides job security. Average tenure is 10 yrs.","Terrible pay and terrible benefits. Company has kept their healthcare costs the same for the past 4 years which means year after year they have been passing these costs down to the employees. If you have a family, kids, and plan to attend the doctor's office, make sure you have savings because Schwab doesn't care."

If you're quiet and/or are not someone who enjoys getting involved with various projects, don't expect any recognition/promotions.",Very low starting pay. Raises are terrible. No financial incentive to do exceptional work. Advancement opportunity is not great either. Definitely try to negotiate higher starting salary because it won't go up much in the next 5-10 years.

3180,,Where is the Diversity at Schwab?,2014-02-25,3.0,Vice President,The company has a good work life balance and had a number of positions located in San Francisco until recently.,The company is not particularly diverse. There are very few woman and people of color in middle and senior management. Take a look at a photo of their management. This is particularly perplexing since the company is headquartered in San Francisco and operates in a global economy.

- an ever-changing compensation plan. You could never forecast your earnings and it was a way for the company to keep you working harder and harder without ever being able to hit a comfortable income level, then back off.
- a compensation software program that tracked revenue that did not work, senior   management acknowledged it, but everyone performance was still measured from it.
- a lot of vacation time, but do not take any. If you took time off your performance suffered and you would get put on a performance plan over 1 slow quarter.

The advertising claims that all their advice is unbiased and not commission based. That is not a true characterization of how the company rewards their consultants. Their are many incentives to steer clients into advice products that have higher payouts. Consultants are expected to constantly guide clients to fee based services and they have quotas that have to be met or they manage you out of the company. Management support is very minimal.

 If you're Series 7 licensed I recommend AVOIDING this position at all costs.

-It's all about the company. Not the employee. Youre just a robot/monkey here.

-Micro-managing at a level I've never seen. So many stats that you have to try to ""adhere"" to its unbelievable. Including one that requires you to hang up FIRST from every call you're on 80% of the time. If you're lacking in any stats believe me you will be spoken to. You'll feel like you're 12.

-The most unrealistic and quite frankly ridiculous  ""coaching"" from their people that monitor your phone calls. Some of which have never worked a customer service/phone job in their life.

-Every meeting was about something new you were going to have to start doing, or something they were taking away from you....or something the ""team"" needed to improve. Never was there anything that the company did for the employee during my time there. 

-Misleading interviews and training. You're told one thing, then when you get put on the job, you're suddenly notified that there's a whole other aspect you were never informed of (they call them ""opportunities"" but for the most part it's about bringing in new assets/sales, which you are not rewarded for as you would be at some other firms. They say it affects your bonus, but that's a whole other story.

-Red tape everywhere. Get a bad score from a client that was undeserved? Don't even think about getting it removed from your record. They'll say it has to go to this manager, then that manager, then get approved. It won't. I saw multiple cases.

Outdated systems, focus is more on getting everyone on the same page due to never ending changes (not for the better, simply for the sake of change in many cases). Once you are there for several months, it is near impossible to get promoted without playing office politics. Management acknowledges that this is the case by how they ""craft"" reviews, chairman's club, etc.

Front line employees well past understaffed for over 12 months. This is furthering the high turnover rate in many areas. Company decided to do away with annual employee appreciation week in 2013, but spent what was likely a lot of money to move around the country a virtual Charles Schwab life sized plasma display with motion sensors so that when you walked by it, he would tell you what his values are, as well as the history of the company. 

Company benefits (medical, dental, etc.) continue to become less and less usable, as the company moved away from a great co-pay to a PPO/HSA plan that no one understands, and everyone hears horror stories about an ER trip with this insurance plan that costs them $1k for a stomach bug. Schwab calls this ""allowing employees to have the chance to take a more active role in their health care"" (see cheaper for Schwab and much more expensive for staff).

Very muddled line of communication, seems like pulling teeth to get a yes or no answer from any management (and this is due to grey area data being where upper management likes to navigate, and then delegate down through the ranks) about anything related to bonuses, compensation, future direction of projects or departments, etc.

Recently, there has been a vacuum of talented long term staff, both licensed as well as non licensed, whom have been leaving in chunks. These roles are now being back-filled with under trained, under prepared, and in some case, under-qualified staff.

I found there to be a niche for everyone, whether you're a climber and a superstar or someone who just wants a steady 9-5, going above and beyond tends to get people rewarded and recognized (not sure about financially -- I was a 9-5er), but if you just get your job done, nobody is riding you to ""wear more pieces of flair"" if that's not your bag. Point is, if you want to throw yourself into your job, it won't go unnoticed.","Like most public companies, share value take priority over pushing projects to the next level, which is ultimately why I got laid off (but with an extremely fair severance).

Knowledgable about investing? Trading strategies? Have great ideas? Passionate about trading or economics? Tough luck. Your sole worth to the company (and a good portion of your compensation) depends on how often you can get clients to click on specific areas of the website or sign up for sup-par banking products. Your job will be a cross between low-level retail customer service, order taker, and tech support. 

Despite their emphasis on being a dynamic ""challenger brand"" and transparent firm, management could not possibly be more superficial or out of touch with reality. I understand it is a big company and the individual sometimes gets lost in the big picture, but in my experience it was a complete joke, in that over half of the management is totally unavailable or disinterested, direction would often change with little to no reason or explanation, and expectations were often vague and incomplete. Despite actively soliciting recommendations and responses from reps on the front line, I found that most of these, often simple and basic requests that even our competitors were able to offer, went overlooked or blatantly ignored. As such, be prepared to get a lot of push back from disgruntled clients because Schwab also follows an ultra-conservative and strict business model (such as hold times, clearing times, processing times, or enacting account restrictions/standards). 

Most jobs, even at the specialized level, are 100% phone based, so prepare to spend at least half of your days doing password resets, answering basic questions, or defusing disgruntled clients. Between December and April (tax time) this is even worse to the point of becoming mind numbing. 

Lastly, the compensation (at least in the Denver offices) is substantially below other similar competitors (Fidelity, E-trade, Merrill, etc.) and about $10,000 below the national average. Bonuses are laughable, and I would conservatively estimate (based on conversations with many peers) that less than 5% of employees get anywhere near the stated bonus potential. It is no wonder that Schwab's turnaround rate is extremely high. Since they will hire just about anyone with a pulse, they bring on new hire classes with over 2 dozen people every few weeks to replace outgoing staff. I was with the firm for a year and out of the 30 or so we had in my new hire class, there were only five (including myself) that were still there. 

Like I said, good place to come if you are just getting started, but as soon as you get your license, run! Not the worst place I have ever worked, but it is far from the best."

Clients for the most part are easy to deal with and love doing business with Schwab.  Generally speaking everybody at the company within all the different sectors of the business is friendly and easy to get along with.  In addition you get a great benefits package with quarterly bonus's dependent on performance.  Needless to say it's not a bad place to start your career.,"The first thing one has to realize about Charles Schwab is that they are inherently conservative about how they do business.  This is reflective in the conversations you have with clients and the slow pace of growth and innovation that goes along with those conservative values.  If you like change and a company that has a genuine thirst for innovating the client experience and staying on top of all the technological trends look elsewhere. I personally worked on the bank and was using about 8-10 different systems when you could easily (if Schwab was willing to invest in their IT infrastructure) about 1-3.  

Secondly, realize if you work in the Bank you are working as a customer service representative in a call center.  Don't let them fool you when you originally apply for the position. Every minute you are on the job you are being monitored whether that be the sneeze you make on the phone to the mouse-click you produce when servicing a clients account.  Management will pull the call and know exactly what you did or said wrong!  

You will be taking anywhere between 60-100 inbound calls a day.  During tax-season and high call volumes you will barely have enough time to take a breath between calls.  This can very taking and exhausting with little sympathy from upper-management for the effort you and your team are putting in to get past the high alert levels.  

The bank reps I worked with were very nice but in a team of 16 individuals I would bet to say maybe 5 of us had college degrees.  The remainder had only high-school diplomas and a number of them had, had numerous years of experience in call centers.  

As for the most disappointing aspect at Schwab which is there management and management structure.    My manager in particular made my shortly lived stint at Schwab a nightmare to live through on a daily basis.  More pre-occupied with serving themselves and the 3-5 pets on the team than having a general can-to attitude about the teams performance.  I don't think I ever heard my manager sing praises to our team or thanking us after a day in high call alerts.  It was presumed we had gotten through without any problem.  Fat Chance  

And on top of that we migrated to a new system that was supposed to be easier which in fact it was... but we only received 1 hour of training out of the 4 we were promised than threw us into the deep end and watched us try to keep our heads above water.

Beware as Schwab managers as they are micro-managers to the T and will find little mistakes that are more often than  not inconsequential to the client experience and make it seem like it will be the death of the firm due to to ""compliance"" reasons.  Management says they will assist you in anyway shape or form to advance your career and get you through a tough situation.  I can't count the number of times I had an escalation with a client and had my manager just rolled their eyes as the prospect of having to pick up the phone and do their job.  It was easier for them to say ""check the procedure"" than to take 2min to assist you.  My manager in particular was never available and always busy..apparently so busy that they couldn't say good morning or good bye to you as as you entered and left the office.  Plus my manager was inconsistent with their behavior and management styles amongst different employees.  In case Schwab didn't realize these things go noticed by other ""lesser""employees.


Overall the job was very mundane, I called it Groundhog day for a reason.   Your day is way too structured and to boot management was completely disconnected with the employees they were supposed to manage. Schwab has some bright people working for them but somehow don't use their best assets to their advantage.  Maybe move employees that show interest in other fields of finance into a better job where they can shine.  From what I could see around me many colleagues got their series 7/63 but somehow were glued to the bank for a further 6-12months after passing their exams.  How does this happens?

To say it in as few words as possible either you drink the kool-aide or you don't.  I would also suggest not applying unless your ok with sticking to rules and regulations that are their for audit purposes. I don't mean to rant too much (which I certainly have) but let this review be a fair warning to all those that are applying for a position on the bank.  With 20/20 hindsight I would have made the decision to either go straight to brokerage or just stayed away from this company completely.  Clients may ""own their future"" as per the TV commercials but you as a hard working representative certainly do not."

- great coworkers

- company invests heavily in continuing education/licensing","- lower than industry average pay/bonuses
- not much room for advancement
- not very innovative
- technology is beyond terrible


I read numerous reviews before being hired about the technology (or should I say lack thereof) but seeing is believing and it's every bit as bad as people said it was. It's demoralizing to say the least when you're constantly being compared to Fidelity or being asked by clients why your company can't innovate. They are lagging behind when it comes to technology not only for external clients but internally as well. Windows 2003? Come on, Schwab. I had such an old version of Excel that I couldn't even open some spreadsheets sent to me by clients. That's a MAJOR problem but Schwab's management doesn't seem too concerned.

The pay is also lower than the industry average but it's not terrible. The opportunities for advancement are more of a sore spot than the pay in my opinion. I was told BY MY MANAGER that promotions are given when it's cheaper for them to bump you up to the next pay grade than give you another raise. Did I mention that was told to me BY MY MANAGER?! Who says stuff like that to their employees??? There haven't been any openings in my department but I've noticed in other departments that there doesn't seem to be much promotion from within. There is not a lot of cultivating of internal talent and that has a huge effect on morale. 

It's not a horrible company by any means but it's definitely not a place to stay for 10 years either. My recommendation? Unless some things change around here, start your career here and leave once you've got the name on your resume."

3295,,I want to quit but where can you go in this job market!,2013-06-19,1.0,Operations Specialist,"It really depends on your manager if you like Schwab or not.  If you want to get anywhere in the company, you will need manager approval. If you have a cool manager, they can be straight with you on exactly what you need to get where you want to go and if you are meeting the requirements. If you are not, they can help you meet the requirements because they know it makes them look good too. 

You will know in the first 6 months if you will be successful or not. Don't let anyone fool you, all you need to do to succeed here is be good at sales. So, if you have never done sales before, as many have said you do not get commission meaning if you are bad at it, you will still get paid.  If your sales number are high, you may get lucky and get into a better role that is a based on commission. 

If you are not good at sales, you can get into an operations role and just stay there until the job market picks up and get experience you can put on your resume.

Series 7 & 63","There probably is no other job where you will work constantly. Schwab has a number for everything to maximize efficiency from each of its employees. The work load is unreal for the amount of time Schwab gives you to get everything done. There is absolutely no time off the phone now as they are keeping the staff low. I remember one time the manager wanted to give me my 6 month review, but there was not any time during the MONTH for me to get off the phone for a half hour, so I had to  me stay after work one day just to get my review. 

Schwab is busy all year for various reason. For example, tax time is from January to April so on one is allowed to do anything. I mean you cannot get a day off during these months so don't try. You are not allowed to make out bound calls because so many people are calling in and they need people on the phones. So, if you don't know the answer, too bad! You can't call the client back. Then, no one is allowed to do anything in the summer months because they have people off the phone( never you) getting mandatory training that no one wants to do in order to give you more skills to do more work at the same pay. Finally, it gets busy from October to December because all our clients are old and need to take out there required distribution and call in and you need to show them how to use a computer. Then, it starts all over the next year.

If you do get your 7 & 63, there is only one number the manager looks at and it is your business development (sales). If this number is low(all others are fine), they will not tell you until your year end review and not give you your $300 year end bonus and you are about to be fired if this continues. Just a word of caution.

The turn over is so high because of brokers who cannot do sales get fired, the brokers who can do sales quit to get paid more somewhere else, or people just get tired of the micro management and high work load and leave. They work you to death here. 

Eventually, you see all the people you hired in with leave the company, and it makes you wonder if something is wrong with you since you are still there and could not escape!"

Advisor Services is brutal. That place is a revolving door with mass departures after bonus time in mid-March. Anyone who has worked in a professional environment will die from the petty micro management. The directors are clueless. About 8 years ago Schwab was in a tough spot because they were treating clients terribly and it hurt the business. They learned their lesson and stopped treating clients terribly. Now they have a new strategy... treating employees terribly. They have slashed pay and benefits and yet demanded more and more work. This year, healthcare was slashed to being stuck with high deductible plans. United Healthcare who is Schwab's provider in Florida, will even tell you over the phone that they can't believe how badly Schwab employees got screwed by the plan change from 2012 to 2013. This little tidbit should be insightful in helping you determine how much senior management values employees: attrition was so bad over these past 6 months that the middle management had this genius idea of creating a ""Hire Ahead Program."" They literally hire people in advance in order to prepare for people constantly leaving. When somebody leaves they just throw the next warm body off the ""Hire Ahead Team,"" in the chair. Talk about a morale killer; they are effectively telling you that some guy off the street is just as valuable as your multi-year contributions to Schwab. Management believes you are so disposable that they would rather hire people with no experience in preparation for you to quit under the low pay and outrageous workload. That is how much they value you. Even crazier... If you get ""experience"" in the department (working more then 1 year is what they would call ""experience"") then you will get more ""special roles"" without a dime of extra pay. More work less pay. Hello! Pulling a page straight out of the Communist Manifesto. Lastly, say everyone on your team is responsible for three advisors, you all get paid the same. That is fine. But then let's say John Doe leaves your team and so his three advisors should be given to a new person. But no, John Doe's advisors want you. They want you because they think you are great. Schwab isn't going to tell a billion dollar advisor that they are stuck with the new person so they give you two of the three extra advisors from the person who just quit. You tell your manager, ""This is crazy, I need more money."" Nope! Now you have more advisors, plus your special roles and you make the same as the guy who takes half the phone calls as you and does half the work you do. Bottom Line... Less pay, falling pay scale, slashing benefits, understaffing, revolving door, so stressful that they would be wise to start mixing Xanax with the water. Stay Away."

Most significantly you will get a full month to study for your brokerage licenses.  If you have no experience in the financial industry this is a great way to get your feet wet.,"Entry level is the only thing Schwab is good for.  They hire young 20 somethings and pay them to get their licenses and then work them till they quit.  Overall salaries are pretty weak.  If you are anything except a recent college grad they will be low balling you.  God forbid you have a family to support, after the take 30% of your pay for insurance and retirement benefits you are going to be bringing home $2,000 a month as a broker.  Management makes a big deal about the ""opportunities"" for growth and advancement, but in reality it is just going to another phone department and doing your same job for a negligibly higher salary.  Actual career advancement occurs in two possible ways, either you go to a branch and try your hand as a financial consultant (don't let the name fool you, this is a sales position and has almost nothing to do with advising or consulting with clients), or you can become a team manager.  Both of these take upwards of five years to achieve.  After your first real promotion is when prospects start to look really hairy.  Schwab is a pretty flat organization (only 6 managers between me and the CEO) but that means that each successive level of responsibility is drastically smaller than the last.  Several hundred phone reps are competing for 2 dozen or so manager jobs, who in turn are competing for 4-5 director positions.  To make it even harder Schwab has a ridiculous habit of hiring upper-level managers from outside of the company.  Of the 5 directors in my section only one of them started their career at Schwab, and most have only been there for a few years.  When I look at my management chain I literally have to go all the way to Walt Bettinger before I find a boss that has been with the company for more than 7 years.  This is really disheartening to a lower level employee, considering that I do not see a single upper level manager that started in my shoes and made it to where they are now."

-upward mobility is easy if you are a longtime employee
-ergonomic setup is a great benefit","- I know call center folks have pay similar to other companies, which is a too low-end salary rate being that Schwab call center employees need to be certified with Series 7 etc.
- upward mobility is difficult in various departments if you are not a long time employee
- I work in a division with some long-time employees who are unprofessional and outright mean and vindictive to their fellow employees.I was surprised that they cannot be reasoned with and called out to speak and behave in reasonable tones. Because of their long-standing employment nothing serious is done about their behavior.
-as in any work environment, favoritism exists. Favorites, those with longer work relationships or friendships with upper management, get the better projects and the better opportunities. Some inexperienced people have been put in management or director positions. This has caused a lot of mistakes, resistance to process, improvements and stress overall. 
- Schwab's implementation of multi-geography workforce and the process of relocating SF employees, and letting go of SF-based positions and rehiring those positions in branches in smaller cities is difficult for SF employees. some long-time SF employees are threatened, who can blame them.   This has caused some friction in the ranks when old employees must work with new employees who have replaced their old colleagues.

- Good insurance (although apparently this has since been ruined...)
- The day you leave will bring about a wonderful feeling of freedom.","- Literally everything else.  Management does not care to assist you in your job or on the job learning, although most lack the skills to have the ability to help at all.  Compensation is poor for the tediousness of answering 70 - 80 phone calls a day (also, new hires will be paid more then you about a year after your hire.  Ask for an increase to just balance this out?  You will literally have your loyalty question or get fired).  Phone calls are the ENTIRE scope of your work (don't let HR lie to you, they purely get compensated for recruiting).  You will be judged entirely on having clients click in specific areas and selling less then helpful Schwab tools.  If you spend too long helping a client, no matter what wonderful thing you have done for them, you will have a conversation with your manager about call times and helping the client in the least amount of time possible.  In other words, get them to click somewhere, transfer money in and hang up immediately.

Even though there is no time for training, there are plenty of hours free for team meetings to share what your favorite restaurant is with the group!  Turnover is at about 30 - 40%, I literally saw my 12 person team go through about 10 people... in a year.

You will get licensed and Schwab will pay for it, but they will hold it over your head every time you are up for a performance review.  So, get excited for your possible 2% raise.  Bonuses were small during my time, but apparently are getting even worse.  They will be around $2,000 to maybe $3,000 a year (this includes $500 quarterly bonuses).  You will NEVER receive the ""possible"" $5,000 to $6,000 bonus.

IF YOU ARE CONSIDERING A JOB HERE: Read the reviews.  Pretty much every negative one is at least 90% truth.  Most positive ones were written by managers, I personally witnessed several."

They are afraid that if you promote someone, that others around them at their previous level wouldn't respect them.  So you have a bunch of qualified people already in house, but instead you go outside the company to find, excuse my language, idiots, that have no idea what they are doing.  I would say this wasn't the norm, but in my five years there I never saw anyone in the branches promoted, not anyone!  But I did see a high turnover of idiot managers they hired from the outside world.  
I left because I was sick or working for idiots that I can honestly say a trained monkey could do a better job.

-- Wellness reward ($250/yr)
-- Quarterly bonus","After working in corporate America for over decade, I'd have to say that some of the worst micromanaging occurs here.  If you're looking for a career where you work more autonomously, do not apply at Schwab.  Many of the managers here also see only one way of doing things.  I think this is why Schwab struggles so much with innovation.  If you don't do things your manager's way, it's wrong.

There's also a bullying culture at Schwab.  I've seen a number of other posts related to this on here.  VPs, Directors and even some Sr. Mgrs are bullies in the workplace, putting others down when they get the opportunity.  The sad part is even if you report them, nothing gets done.  I'm aware of two HR complaints filed against individuals for bullying and those two people have not been removed from the company or even demoted.  One manager who managed a bully even admitted he didn't know how to deal with his bullying report.  Because he didn't know how to handle the situation, nothing was done.

I would not recommend working for Schwab.  It has not been a good experience for me and a number of folks I know."

3358,,Absolute worst company to work for-read details below,2013-02-07,1.0,Director,Easy work hours.  A few smart people who care still around to make the company function.,"1.  The management pressures employees to vote Republican.  Fox new is blaring all the time in the cafeteria.
2.  No mentoring-no promotion path.  Company is very indifferent to its employees and managers manage up all the time.  SInce the company has continuous layoffs, there is no effort to mentor or move people up.  Lack of clear criteria for promotion means that ""self promoting"" individuals have a greater chance of moving up than people who work extremely hard.
3.  The company is deeply immoral and double faced about its approach to its customers.  Specifically outsourcing company employees can view customers social security numbers, addresses and all the private information about clients opening the door for all kinds of privacy violations.
4  Since we are on the immoral front, I used to work in an area where we were supposed to give objective advice to people about how to manage their wealth.  Against all ethical norms, we were instructed to ""float"" Schwab mutual funds to the top so clients would buy them, even though they substantially underperformed other mutual funds in the offering.
5.  Schwab equity ratings are rigged to perform well against Barron's valuation and any claims against performance are to say the least, marketing fluff.
6.  Technology is old and obsolete.  Do not expect Schwab to utilize new technologies.  They still have a mainframe, with technology typically five years behind.  To make things worse management has no interest in technology innovation-on the contrary if you are on the technology side you will constantly feel like a secondhand employee."

You will become sick of hearing the word innovative as you sit in your beige cube at your Formica desk with a Compaq. Your technical work skills will be guaranteed to erode. You will lose 1 to 2 hours work time per day due to IT issues. On the upside they give you nice leather bound paper notebooks so you can take notes. You you will need to have this as you will not be allowed portable technology at Schwab. Beware of the perks of getting to see a financial advisor. These guys will try to put you into Schwab's low earning funds. They have no grasp of emerging technologies or the landscape of the international economy.

Bank reps literally use 20 different systems, none of which communicate with each other, and they all do ONE single thing. The pay with Schwab Bank does not compensate for the verbal abuse that has to be tolerated by reps on a day to day basis. Clients are often EXTREMELY angry when they call in, usually because their debit card has been declined or blocked due to the conservative fraud monitoring system on the cards. The turnover with Schwab Bank is very high due to these and other frustrations, and the training is not long or thorough enough, so there are always new reps that are making grave mistakes and/ or giving out wrong information. You take call after call after call, with very structured and limited breaks. Also, Schwab Bank is an online bank, but they don't offer e-statements or e-transfers for savings accounts...

IT frequently has to meet target delivery dates which have been publicly announced by executives without sufficient analysis as to feasibility.

Even then, the largest incentive to move into management is removing yourself from the customer service and widgets you are gauged on.

The training is not consistent with real world applications and typically most of what you learn is from first hand experience of what not to do after you do it.

As part of said open door policy, when it comes to ""Employee Engagement"" Schwab seems to do a fair amount of listening, quite a large amount of talking - but very little action.","Average pay at best.

An example of the above:  One of the questions on the Employee Engagement Survey is something to the effect of having a ""Best Friend"" at work.

For a service based organization, this is sad.",2012-10-16,3.0,Anonymous Employee,"Charles Schwab provides an opportunity for exposure into several areas including customer service, audit, trading (stocks, bonds, mutual funds), sales, etc.  You can gain valuable experience in many of these areas, which is especially nice if you do not have a crystal clear path in mind.  Benefits are ok.  Health plans are shifting to HSA plans, but other benefits are still solid.","The company does not care to take care of their employees financially.  The recent trend is to push out seasoned employees in favor of less experienced or capable replacements to cut costs dramatically.  This is especially depressing since the company is so historically tied to WORLD CLASS customer service.  Schwab's promoter scores have declined in each of the past 5 years.  While part of this can certainly be attributed to market forces and the downturn, a large piece of the puzzle lies in the fact that the revolving door of less experienced line employees sacrifices customer service and client experience which the company was built on.

Also, the wage structure is absurd.  Everyone can complain about wages, i'm sure.  I for one am extremely happy to be employed.  However, I received a 5% raise this year (my first in 3 years) because I was well below the minimum salary range for my grade level and I had to be adjusted to meet that minimum.  In other words, my company is telling me that after 2 years of busting my ass and being a top performer in this current role, I am worth the bare minimum that can be payed to someone that fills that role.  

The other issue with this is that when people are hired, they are not placed at these minimums!  External hires to the company typically make well over the grade level minimums.  There are people brand new to the company that are a grade level below me, and make more than I do!  While I do understand that this is partly venting on my part, this does not exactly resonate with the employee base and get them fired up to come into work each day.

My last major issue with Charles Schwab is that office politics and chronyism run rampant throughout.  This is a factor at any major office building, but I can't help but to notice that roughly half of the external new hires to the company went to college with half of the current employees.  It seems to turn the office into a massive clique environment that is also not healthy for stability and growth.   To keep going, you must be well prepared to play office politics at ALL times."

This is a highly political company, where diversity exists mainly at the junior ranks. Minorities have a very difficult time here because you have to fit the mold even if you are highly talented and dedicated. Planning is poor at the VP/Director level. There is always a ""fire drill"" which places undue stress on junior employees who have to bend over backward and pick up the slack or risk losing their jobs."

Limited promotional opportunities - these are pooled as well - and if you try and move to a different department, they offer it as a lateral move, rather than recognize previous service and recognition and provide a raise.  

Communication is HORRIBLE.  Their idea of good communication is to send out an email, send out a correction, send out a retraction, and start the same process over.  This goes for internal policies and procedures, as well as to communications with clients and their advisors.  

While benefits are pretty great, compensation is not at all acceptable.  They admittedly pay less than the market average, and have no plans to change that.  They also try and tell you that there is no room for off cycle promotions or exceptional merit increases (rather than the standard 2%), yet you constantly hear about people who have been given both, and their work is substandard.

For example, employees have tremendous health insurance benefits, great 401k plan that is 100% vested from day one, sabbaticals of 4 weeks after 5 years service, time off for volunteer work, etc.  In addition, Schwab tries to provide a balance for all clients from free services to fee based services as well as one on one time with clients, and customizable solutions.",Sometimes there is too much focus on one area of opportunity or growth and other areas are neglected and/or seized upon by the competition.

- Great benefits and a company that goes out of their way to try and help their employee's fulfill  their financial and personal health goals.
- Overall company's objectives and goals are something I can get behind and feel good about.
- Company provides many in-house training opportunities.","- Lots of people who stay for a very long time, which can stagnate progress (resistance to change).
- Legally conservative company with lots of red tape that does a decent job to protect the brand but also slows progress and change
- Pay is average to below average compared to others in industry in area. HR is not very creative at coming up with ways to recognize employees for their contributions.
- To move up, you have to change departments. Difficult to grow within."

Good development programs.,"Performance rankings were clearly a forced bell curve.  In some BUs middle management is suspect.  It is bad when you speak with senior leaders more than you speak with your director or VP.  Unable to advance professionally in certain business units unless you move, even if the job could be done remotely.  Some middle management suffering from individual genius disease.  Some group think issues in middle management."

Cream rises to the top in a way that seems fair from my perspective (as someone who is in a fairly limited role in terms of mobility, by choice). Sabbatical every 5 years is the best benefit ever. You get out of the company as much as or as little as you give.","I understand call center jobs can be frustrating but I'm on the technology side.

The company has a desire to train, develop, and help employees to do their best.  The benefits are decent within this industry.  Work / life balance is good.  The additional compensation with annual bonuses and a sabbatical every 5 years is a great perk.","One can hit the growth ceiling pretty quickly.  Though there's opportunities for lateral moves, upward mobility is lacking...and not due to one's lack of drive or performance.  Also, reorgs are frequent (every couple of years), which slows down productivity."

-I think that management really cares about the employees. There is an Employee Appreciation Week. I've never heard of this anywhere else.
-Board members and upper management actually goes into the branches and call centers to see what's going on. I've actually met the Executive Vice President over my department.
-If you are willing to work hard and network and reach out to people that can help you, you can advance to higher positions. If you don't, then you will probably stay in the same position for years.","-Pay could be much better.
-Branch reps and FC's are not held to the same standards that brokers in the call centers are, yet are almost always paid more. It seems like I am often apologizing for an FC that doesn't return a phone call or processes a client's paperwork slowly. Most of the time brokers in the call centers place the FC's trades because we work on a recorded line. Therefore some FC's don't seem to know a lot about trading."

They have the technology for you to work from home if an emergency comes up although they prefer you to be in the office. Standard starting time for employees is between 8:30 and 9:00.,"The downside is that the pay is generally lower compared to the market. In order to make the money that you are use to making, shot for a higher titled position than normal.

3454,,Had a great time working with some very professional and nice people.,2012-04-25,5.0,Contractor,"I have been a technical contractor at Schwab in San Francisco several times over the years and have always (well, almost always) had a great time working with the staff and managers there.  think they must screen for ""nice"" in the hiring process.",As a contractor I had no complaints.  The employees sometimes grumble about the annual 2% pay raises.  You need to leave Schwab to get a raise they say.
3455,,Overall positive but advancement is frustrating,2012-04-20,4.0,Broker,They care about their employees,They disguise horizontal movement as advancement.
3456,,Great opportunity to Learn and Grow,2012-04-19,3.0,Senior Specialist,"Great culture and really feel like people care.  Things change often, so if you're unhappy with the current situation, sit tight because change is coming.  Training and career development is a top priority.  Very ethical and conservative when it comes to making business decisions. Opportunities to volunteer and give back to the community.  Stenghts based environment.",If you're not in the corporate office opportunities and compensation seem to be slow coming.  Schwab compensates outside applicants with less experience more than high performing tenured employees promoted internally.  There is a lot of talk about diversity and inclusion but it appears to be just that.  I don't see very many diverse employees in upper management or sales roles.  Some managers don't know how to manage employees and are not held accountable.
3457,,Great Place to Build the Foundation of a Successful Career,2012-04-18,5.0,Registered Representative,"I have been working at Schwab for a year now and I could not think of a better place to start in the financial world. They pay you to get your Series 7/63 licenses. Literally put you in a classroom and have you study for 5 weeks to get your licenses and they pay you for it. Advancement opportunities are everywhere. I don't know what these other people are talking about but since I started working there I have had the change to ghost with many other departments, which has opened up numerous doors for me. My manager has a one-on-one meeting with me at least once a month where we go over career pathing and things that I need to do my job better. The atmosphere is laid back, dress code is relaxed, and the salary is consistent = no stress to get commissions because we are not paid on commission. Everyday, I get into the office and look at the market and current events and have conversations with clients about whats driving the market and have conversations about investment strategy. Oh yeah, I also can place trades in my own account as long as I am not on the phone with a client. I'm looking to be able to advance into a Financial Consultant role in 3 years.","I can only think of two cons. 1) It is a call center so you do take inbound phone calls. However, I have never taken more than 90 calls in a day and when I became a Broker I take about 50 calls. 2) The salary is mediocre. With that said, where else are you going to get paid to learn about the industry in a laid back environment? I have looked elsewhere and am happy that I am at Schwab."

Pretty strong emphasis on training & equipping staff to handle wide variety of issues
For aggressive traders, learning Street Smart software was a great perk","Felt very micro-managed

3463,,So Much Opportunity,2012-03-26,5.0,Client Service Specialist,"Very laid back office atmosphere, relaxed dress code, flexible hours, intelligent management, career advancement opportunities, etc. The company also pays for pursuing industry designations and is great about making sure there are enough sponsored events to keep up with CE credit requirements for those designations. They are very good about keeping you informed of your progress and I've experienced a very ""open door"" type atmosphere.","Compared to the same position at other companies, the salary isn't the greatest but there are other things that make up for it in the benefits package. I did come from a much smaller company so the bureaucracy aspect took some getting use to. Even the slightest changes require a long time to implement and that can be frustrating; however, overall there isn't much negative I have to say about Schwab. I've been here for about a year and it's been fantastic."
3464,,"Great people, great hours, great place to work",2012-03-23,5.0,Digital Production Artist,I loved working at Charles Schwab. I had a great team to work with and they were all creative and fun.

Some of the work can be a little boring. 

You can definitely tell you work at a large corporation. Nothing is decided quickly or easily as it always has to go up the chain of command with all the appropriate protocols followed."
3465,,Great place to start out,2012-03-19,4.0,Registered Representative,"Great training and opportunities for career development. Most managers are very receptive to what you need in order to better do your job and genuinely want to see you succeed. There is a lot of transparency when it comes to performance - you will always know where you stand and what you could improve upon. Team environment allows you to utilize peers when you need help. The company is very focused on doing what is right for the client, and you don't feel pressured to get the client into unsuitable products. All in all a great place, especially to start out.",The pay is not the greatest in the industry. With the center being open 24/7/365 you may have to work some holidays or off hours.
3466,,Good,2012-03-14,4.0,Associate Financial Consultant,"Collegial work environment, standard benefits with a few extras (30 day paid sabbatical after 5 years), reasonably fair and capable management, opportunities for paid education and paid time off for charity work.","Distributed organization so types of jobs are limited in the field (headquarters in San Francisco with regional call centers/operations centers in Denver, Phoenix, Indianapolis, Orlando)."

Company is grabbing a large share of Financial Services business.,"Pay, pay, pay! Did I say pay? I can make more working 30 hours a week at a local steakhouse serving tables than using my multiple years experience answering a ton of calls chained to a desk with a bad backache everyday. Benefits are really expensive. No Christmas bonus ever. Not even a card. How cheap is that? Raises, even killing yourself, were stuck at a miserable 2% which got eaten up by higher costs for medical."
3470,,Company will do anything for its employees except pay them.,2012-02-23,3.0,"Trader, Equity",Good opportunity to learn the brokerage industry and do right by customers.  The firm will go to great lengths to preserve its brand in the face of retail customers.,"The firm is cheap, and pays its employees poorly overall.  Its also a large, rigid firm that is consistently a ""last mover"" when new opportunities arise."
3471,,Best company to work for in the financial industry,2012-02-15,5.0,"Vice President, Financial Consultant","The pay is good, the ethics and values how they want to work wiith clients are how I envision, and great tools in helping client!","Not enough training, and the work can be a little more on the service side than I would to do for clients"

I still think Schwab has some of the best financial services available to the public.  Essentially, I learned how to successfully invest and manage my own money during my employment with the firm.","The company is very slow to respond when it comes to updating technology within the enterprise.  Internal training programs for employees focus on business and banking skills and not on technology skills, so there is limited incentive for IT workers to stay.   Also, when key technology players leave the firm, there is no real plan in place to replace them.  This  means that the remaining staff end up inheriting more workload and stress, resulting in a domino effect as remaining employees become overwhelmed with the increased work load and  end up jumping ship as well."
3473,,"Settling with a mediocre salary, than this is the place for you!",2012-02-09,2.0,Analyst,Awesome enviornment and work-life balance. Offer work from home for mid to senior level employees and alternative schedules.,"Terrible ""total rewards"" pay structure, which limits employees to no more than a 2% raise annually. Schwab does not pay to retain talent, but creates a culture of ""turn and burn"" with their employees. Also, if you are promoted, which I have been 3 times and within 3 pay ranges, you will be paid 1% over the minimum salary range. No negiotiations or compromise by leadership on salaries. Again if you are looking to increase your salary by climbing the corporate ladder, please look else where."
3474,,Great company,2012-02-07,4.0,,Charles Schwab is a great company to work for. There are many avenues for growth and internal promotion. Senior leadership lives out the vision and values. They are fair.,"As Charles Schwab service centers are open 24/7/365, you are required to work some holidays throughout the year. There are many teams that work late evenings and/or weekends as well."

If you work on the bank side, it is a miserable place to work. The technology is in the dark ages, so are the services Schwab Bank offfers it's clients. The debit cards often don't work because of Schwab's conservative approach to risk management. Clients are always calling in because their debit cards don't work. Also, internal employees at Schwab always call bank for the wrong reasons. They act like Bank is the help desk if they don't know the answer to something related to their job. They never use internal resources such as the help desk for their department or the internal search engine. There is a ""when in doubt, call bank"" mentality. Also, the pay on the bank side is subpar for the work that is required of us and the more than 20 different systems we had to use."
3478,,The cleanest place in a dirty industry,2012-01-22,4.0,,"Company is committed to the client and to doing the right thing

Even then, anything you are ""selling"" is only if it is in the best interests of the client.","Unless you want to work in the branch, you are severely limited in locations you can live and work in"
3479,,"If you're not ready to settle for less, keep your resume handy.",2012-01-17,1.0,Manager,"- Good work life balance (you can almost get away with doing nothing)
- Good benefits
- Usually friendly people","- Compensation/Incentives package highly prohibitive (if you are towards the bottom of the pay range, you'll never catch your peers towards the upper end of the spectrum, regardless of how hard you work.  The program favors the company.)
- Promotions into management nearly impossible unless you are one of the chosen few.  Career paths have been defined and leadership development programs exist, but don't lead to growth opportunities.
- Middle management filled with yes men, don't expect your boss to set up to bat for you.
- Absence of mentoring and guidance to help individuals develop their skills and prepare for the next step of their career.  Classes offered by Schwab's training department, but again don't lead to positive outcomes for employees.
- Management prescribes to the philosophy that engaged and happy employees will work for lower pay because of high job satisfaction.  They forget a large number of employees are supporting families on less than $50K a year, which is pretty tough - I guess money isn't everything but it is pretty important when you practically live paycheck to paycheck.
- Not a growth company, resulting in limited growth opportunities and directions to move your career.
- Hiring managers are often unresponsive to internal applicant's request for informational interviews. 
- Knowledge, skill, and abilities, get you nowhere; to be successful you need to communicate with force, confidence, and the assumption you are right (it is more important to be right than to do the right thing).
- Schwab is a classic bureaucracy, very conservative and risk averse.
- Recognition and appreciation are trivial and on the verge of insulting, unless you are in second grade."

Really my peers were the best part of the job. Some people dont mind call center jobs, this on is probably better because of no outbound calls.",As Im sure you heard salary is ridiculously low and very little other incentitives. Its a promotion if you take a lateral move with no pay increase. Unhealthy static work environment as you are tied to your desk and phone for 98% of the day taking call after call . 30 min lunch. Expensive and nasty cafeteria. It's a cost/call center where efficincy is the priority. Pay will always be low and every ounce of producitvity will be squeezed from you.

3489,,"As a temp employee, I have greatly enjoyed my time here.",2011-11-29,4.0,Senior Business Continuity Consultant,"I like my supervisor and the people I work with and would like to stay; however, my temp assignement is ending at the end of December.  The company has provided me with a very good salary and working conditions are excellent.  The office/building are first rate, though a significant walk to BART.  I have been free to work my own hours, and my supervisor is not a micro-manager.  She is content to let me work on proejcts at my own speed in any manner I want.  All in all, it has been a pleaser to work here.","I have applied for several permanent jobs at Schwab, but, unfortunately, with no job offer coming.  It is very frustrating to read the job posting requirements, have the experience and the requirements they are looking for, and then not get the job.  I really feel like after three months here, I have learned the job, and I wish they could open a requisition and keep me.  Just as I am really beginning to learn the job's requirements and functions, I will be leaving.  Does not make sense to me."
