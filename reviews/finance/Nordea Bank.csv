Because all processes are so inefficient, that you need to wait months to get permission to start work on your tasks, or weeks to get requirements from the business department.
HR (or People Direct Portal ) never can help you...they lose your documents, forget to sent you tax declaration, make mistakes in your profile...Everything that can go wrong, would go wrong with them. 
Sometimes you have the impression that the main and only goal of the management - to prevent the IT department to make its job.

431,Nordea Bank,All was good enough till that last-minute and unfair decision,2020-06-02,2.0,IT Security Specialist,"-Modern Workplace
-Udemy for business access
-I had an understanding manager who never gave me hardtime for asking for flexibility on working hours.","I was very close to give a positive feedback for Nordea, in fact, Nordea would be my first company in Poland for that! However, everything went upside down after that unfair decision.

Throughout my employment, I have always shown my interest to get involved, got everything given to me done, never turned down any request for help, always asked for more involvement whenever appropriate, was mostly at top at various performance charts within the team (e.g. training completion) and even volunteered on additional things like giving security training to other employees. Furthermore, I had the most diverse background when it came to IT Security as I worked on various sub-fields of IT Security, which all of my teammates lacked. Yet, when the budget cut came and our team was made redundant, instead of focusing on the manager and Senior of the team who were the primary people responsible for everything, the local senior management in Poland decided to choose me to be laid off. That local management managed to arrange places for everyone in our dismissed team in other teams whereas when it came to me, despite the fact that I had the most diverse background (yes even more than the Senior of the team) and therefore would be much more useful in other teams for Nordea, they simply said unfortunately they had no place for me in other teams and I was the only non-polish person in the team, what a coincidence! 

Moreover, they announced it in a very disgraceful way, they did not mention anything about it beforehand at all, everything was conveyed to me at the last minute, right after which I handed over everything that belonged to me. If they had told me before, I could have searched harder for other internal opportunities and probably could have found something by myself in one of the other teams. An interesting point here is, despite all that confidentiality, I know that the manager and Senior of the team knew this beforehand, which implies to me that they were also involved in this unfair and suspicious decision. 


Another interesting anecdote on this switching teams thing is, I kind of felt something was coming, therefore, 1 month prior to this sudden announcement, I tried to get in touch with another local manager in whose team there was an internal availability which matched my background perfectly (it was related to Cyber Security Monitoring). Yet, that manager did not even bother to answer me, which makes no sense except for some reason she did not want me in her team at all (maybe due to my nationality?).  A similar thing happened when I pinged our more Senior Manager based in a Nordic Country and showed my interest to him for one of the topics he presented to us all,yet again, no answers came, this time probably due to fact that by the time I pinged him, he already had the decision on me due to unfair feedback he received from Polish management, interesting indeed!

As per our team, The teamwork and collaboration quality was low due to lack of attention of the manager and the Senior of the team, as those two always preferred to take care of important tasks by themselves, not even bothering to get the rest of the team involved and for this exclusion, they even tried to indirectly put the blame on the rest of team for ""not asking for getting involved"" all the time (not directly as this would look too ridiculous), which was far from truth anyway as everyone was showing his/her interest. In fact, it was the Senior of the team who was reluctant to accept this offer for help as that meant more responsibility and more teaching which he did not want to bother with, especially in English. Another excuse for not involving everyone was the fact that our team was scattered across different cities.

They additionally used the fact that I was not Polish and my Polish skills were limited as an excuse to slowly isolate me from the daily tasks and discussions.(official language was English by the way). They were all ready to speak in English in theory but in practice you had to ""remind"" your teammates about it every single time. Even one of the official trainings, which was paid by Nordea, was held in Polish as neither our manager nor the instructor himself knew enough English!

It was almost a sin to ask a question to learn something within the team. The first reaction you would get was ""this is written in this email/in this documentation, why are you asking this??"", sometimes even satires as ""are you sure you are working for Nordea?"" etc. This is actually a common problem of immature business cultures like Polish one, not necessarily only our team's issue."

The bank's IT is the middle of a transformation, but what it's transforming into is a mystery to all. Communication from any level of management is vague at best. Everyone seems to be afraid of making any firm decisions or setting a clear vision.

Agile implementation is a farce, It is a pretence. Most people here make a show of change, but there is no real impetus to change here, especially at the management level.

There appear to be no consequences for poor performing managers, despite the fact they’re a clear hinderance of their work force delivering anything of value.

No room for negotiating when making internal moves, even their internal recruitment is incompetent.

If you like to deliver nothing of value and close out tasks then this is the place for you, but if you’ve any serious technical ability or any knowledge I would skip this place. It’s not worth the aggravation."

Nordea really values what you do, not what sex you are or what is your skin color.","Highest management is living in their own vision, making decisions and changing strategic vision every other year, not realizing that those changes in course are never reaching the people who actually do the job.

The organizational structure is overwhelming, in other words, gap between production lines and management is way too big, filled with irrationally long list of different managers at different levels.

Nordea is VERY sales aggressive and will almost chase you to death with goals and sales fulfilment. They set goals that are laughable when you consider there is no bonus for reaching the goals - why should you bother? They offer a movie ticket for working your ass off, or similar childish bonuses. Everything is about sales results, at the expense of giving good help to customers"
779,Nordea Bank,Do not join in an operational role if you actually have an agenda to improve things,2008-08-20,3.0,"Senior Projects, IT and Risk Manager","Focusing on Markets only - business scope compared with other Nordic IBs, salary and bonus package, personal development opportunities","Focusing on Markets only - related to my responsibilities of operational and technology improvement, Nordea Markets are VERY poor at running projects and doing technology improvement. Furthermore, the technology and operational infrastructure is manifestly not aligned or fit for purpose, operations very often being held together by numerous unnecessary and obscure manual processes. 

This status is OK except for the fact that I am a highly experienced asset from industries that are incredibly more competent than the management, technology and operational people here. However, it appears that there is no desire to try and learn or improve, or examine my suggestions (numerous) on how to address glaring issues in process and technology - due to the wholly unfounded belief of the ones with the positional power that they are actually good at this stuff. 

There is also a load of power games getting in the way - FRC are the biggest culprits.

If you are given responsibility for a project, forget about having any control or directional authority. Everyone is an expert in everything (except, curiously, fail to identify in detail their needs when put under the spotlight), cannot distinguish process from solution, and will fail to be directed during a project.

Finally, everyone - I mean everyone (I wouldn't rule out cleaners and kitchen staff in this either!) - think solely in terms of IT and have absolutely no idea on how to separate the WHAT from the HOW, which somewhat hampers the making of right choices during significant change projects."
