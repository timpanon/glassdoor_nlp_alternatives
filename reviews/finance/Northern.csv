If someone takes a stand and points out the injustices taking place, their names are tarnished and the employee is literally portrayed as the enemy of the state, including their ratings and hikes getting sabotaged. I arrived at a situation where the management made it impossible to work peacefully with their dirty politics.

Plenty of leaves","Work life balance purely depends on which team you end up in. Stay away from the Data Management, Fund accounting & Pricing teams – horrible managers, training is inadequate and the staff is most likely to be burned out with the huge volumes. 
Escalations and erratic decision making: Most of senior management don’t understand the process they manage. The TL’s rarely know what is happening within their own team and yet they enforce standard operation procedures which they don’t fully understand. 
Lots of manual work. They implement controls and useless checks which only piles on the existing work pressure. 
Technology improvements are unprogressive. The applications used for business are outdated. Also, IT support is inadequate – they really don’t care about resolving IT issues are more concerned about cost cutting.
The pay is way below competitors. Hikes don’t even match the inflation rate of the economy. Poor bonus figures. 
You only get recognized/ promoted if you grease your way up the ladder. Internal mobility is just for name-sake. IJP interviews are just a façade for the managers who take the interview to show that they are open to diversity and change.
Utilize this platform to launch yourself to a better place - Don’t get too comfortable as it will be difficult when you switch and go to new company."

Poor investment in technology, falling behind to other competitors and are trying to play catch up. No respect for the work force. The culture is toxic, and lots of the seasoned people there are rude and have attitudes and are not willing to help. They just had a round of cuts, only to have management send out an email about their expensive workout equipment while people were left scrambling looking for another job. Completely tone def. All this was done to save costs not realizing the optics for the rest of the group which is already understaffed. Now they have tons of turnover and are posting all over linked in that they are hiring…with enthusiasm. Don’t be fooled. This is a very toxic workplace. You have been warned. Expectations will be similar to hedge fund, pay will be far less. They brag about internal mobility, which is non existent. During one of my interviews over Zoom, the COO was on her phone texting. Completely unprofessional. They also brag about D&I yet, when I reached out to the D&I group with suggestions on how to help the community around the Chicago area, it fell on deaf ears.

1. You might get a full night (graveyard shift) or if you are lucky you will get a good day shift. If you get in graveyard shift forget work-life balance you ll end up being a nocturnal animal.

2. Managers do not care for anything. I worked like a dog and my manager was busy on his phone with no work, playing games, taking long breaks and logging off on time while we the analysts extend work for 3 more hours ending up working for almost 14 hours a day

3. Dirty politics is very much present here. The team dose'nt treat everyone equally they just pay respect to your looks rather than skills and help is offered to the ones whom the seniors prefer while others rot in hell.

4. HR policies of having office relationships are a joke. The team in which I worked had 2 couples who were in a relationship the senior offered help to his partner when we all had to be treated equally as freshers.

5. Even if you die finish your work and die. No proper dinner breaks. You will be loaded with work and seniors will dump on you and relax.

6. Improper trainers will spoil your stay at office the assigning of buddy system is useless as your buddy himself will be busy. You are left all alone with no help here and join this firm only if you know to impress with looks and attire."

638,,Avoid at all costs,2021-07-18,1.0,Anonymous Employee,-You will get a paycheck,"I cannot even recommend staying here for even a year to get experience and then bouncing, your overall mood will take a dive even within that year. Save yourself the time and effort and apply elsewhere. Especially if you are young and right out of college, this place will leave a sour taste in your mouth. There are significantly better companies in the Chicagoland area that are way better.


-The pay is one of the lowest in the sector.

-They started cutting costs of living wage increases.

-You will work extremely long hours. And on weekends. If you don't, well you'll just find more work on your desk to make up for the time that you could have been working during your off hours.

-You will in essence be punished for taking time off as everything that happened during your time off is waiting for you. There is no well oiled machine that continues to function while you are gone. Unfortunately, I found this true for the multiple teams I was on.

-Technology is absolutely horrible. Insanely horrible. And very little is being done about it. Processes continue to be bogged down by infrastructure that fails very often.

-IT will not be able to help you, so you better brush up on your technology skills.

-You are set up to fail, not to succeed. If you succeed, good for you, you can overcome it.

-You will be treated like cattle. Management doesn't care what you think or how you feel.

-Your voice will not be heard, no matter how important it may be.

-Way too much bureaucratic hurdles. I've seen issues take hours to find the right person or team that is responsible for resolving an issue only for it to be resolved within 3 minutes after finding that person.

-The burnout is horrible, they will work you to the bone, then add more work on top of it.

-Good work ethic and positive attitude are only met with more work with no recognition for accomplishments. If you do work here, honestly, it would be better to do average or bare minimum.

-Too many bad apples that get power trips over a small manager position. This goes up the totem poll as well. Too many people are abusive and HR just buries their head in the sand. It's an HR nightmare here. I'm amazed more people have come forward and brought up more lawsuits.

-Office politics get in the way of a lot. So many people talk behind each other's backs and becomes very cliquey very fast.

-Not much room for advancement unless you know certain people who will push it through.

-All work regarding updated systems or projects is outsourced or push to contractors so it is difficult to get funding for fixing issues or pushing ahead on new projects.

-Massive push on cost cutting so any nice things that were once had are being cut.

-In short, it feels like you are being exploited. It is very much a ""Look out for yourself"" culture. Trusting people here opens up vulnerabilities to make your life harder.

-Benefits are fine but lacking when you look at other companies in the area.

-Due to the place being horrible to work at, turnover is high so workload is always high.

-They labeled water fountains as an amenity...that is the kind of ""amenities"" to except from them."

Integrating new team members into the team is non-existent. New employees are left to their own means, which hinders growth within the role. Micromanaging is prevalent. The team is constantly dealing with high turnover and insufficient number of people.  Good managers are leaving because of the bad ones and no one is doing anything to address the issue.

Growth Opportunities are virtually non existent
Pay is below industry average 
Top performers receive all of the work and none of the rewards
Bonuses are flat (I.E not tied to performance). Everyone gets roughly the same bonus target regardless of input.
Job growth is almost exclusively dictated by tenure. Older managers that have been grandfathered in may not actually have superb skills. (Example: a Senior Consultant once asked an analyst how to make a cell negative in excel.)
Conservative culture has draining office politics
All work is being moved to Tempe and India. There was more hiring and growth in India officially then in the U.S. for the past few years. 
This emphasis on cost cutting has made retaining decent talent impossible causing an attrition rate of roughly 33% yearly for the team. This has furthered a lack of social cohesion as most management doesn't even attempt to retain its workforce because they expect everyone to leave."

- Technology is woefully outdated and cannot keep up with the always increasing client-specific reporting

- Poorly performing analysts are allowed to remain simply because there aren't enough people staying aboard the ship

- Office politics. Some people have a monopoly on certain vacation windows because tradition is more important than equity. Also, some high-performing analysts are passed over for promotion for reasons unknown.

- Administrators do not care about the capabilities of the department. They just give the clients whatever they want and expect DV to figure it out for them.

822,,DO NOT WORK HERE ITS A WASTE OF YOUR TIME,2021-05-13,1.0,Senior Consultant Middle Office Trade Processing,"There are some pros to working at Northern. If you come in at a more senior level above vice president you're life is going to be fairly easy the organization is very top down so new initiatives end up on desk of entry level hires. While upper management is very removed from the process. 

Depending on which department you're in the hours can either be very reasonable or absolutely terrible.

You may qualify for a pension plan so if you end up in an easy role you can easily coast for a long time and you can retire with a nice pension.","YOU WILL NEVER RECEIVE YOUR FULL BONUS NO NO MATTER HOW HARD YOU WORK OR HOW WELL YOU PERFORM SO DO NOT WORK HERE

Rarely will you ever receive a raise outside of a cost of living adjustment, most of the time these cost of living adjustments don't keep pace with inflation

Benefits aren't great and are employee contributions are high.

little to no internal mobility

little to no career progression

high turnover

Most of the higher level people at northern trust are productivity predators. They know there is a constant cycle of new hires. They pawn off as much of their work on the new people who don't know yet that their hard work isn't rewarded, and they continue to coast. (See pro of coming into the company at a higher level above)

Jobs are very insulated rarely will you have contact outside of your team making internal mobility difficult.

People that work at northern are generally, lazy, unproductive, and unhelpful. There are a lot of people who have been working at NT for a long time and are just trying to ride it out until they can retire with their pension."

Nice coworkers
Work from home flexibility","Poor organisation of business processes in general - focus on producing work and not improving efficiency of processes.

Long hours - team members are frequently online until 7 and after that

Large workload - work is piled onto junior team members, often to make up for the inefficiency of others. Outdated systems make it so that it will take days to complete certain tasks

Very training in general - people are thrown into work they have no prior experience with and expected to produce results immediately. Attitude towards training from some people is incredibly casual

Very outdated software. Constant IT problems meaning you can't complete the already unfair workload.

No overtime, you are forced to complete your work in the 9-5 window which is often not possible."

I do not know where are all of these 5 star reviews come from, but do not seem truthful to me. This company underpays, outsources like crazy nowadays, and even if you want to move up in the company, you really have to know someone. You may get interviews, but do not get your hopes up if you do not know the ""right"" person in the department. So, unless you are desperate, look elsewhere; working here is not worth the mental stress of the low salary along with the uncertain outlook here.

You will be better off at almost any other company on earth than this one.  Asset Management plays favorites if you aren’t from the Chicago office or “one of the original employees” then you could create a way for the company to save millions and still never be looked at as intelligent.  Most employees that have been in this organization for years are at best seat warmers.  They do nothing but aren’t afraid to intimidate everyone to keep their perceived idea of power.  Turnover with brilliant new talent is the norm, no one smart enough to have another job stays longer than a couple of years.  The only skill you will learn here is that of 5th grade talent cutting and pasting and manually fixing bad numbers that the computer systems can’t seem to calculate correctly and if you miss a few bad numbers no big deal it goes to clients and no one cares.

Felt poorly treated daily.
Politics amongst management is the game.
Most of the team are often still working at 7pm regularly and later sometimes. 
Management heads home before COB even at months-end leaving all the work and ad-hoc issues to analysts.
Forward on from October 2019 to 9 months later, 80% of analysts on my team had departed, at least one with no alternative job to go to.
Need to be a self starter as there is a high chance you won't be trained fairly. If self-starter, go to big four for an accounting/graduate role and look at finance later in your career. 
No team building. No good mornings, no positive feedback, nothing like this existed on my team. No positivity period, from local management.

1514,,"Great place if you’re a heteronormative, entitled, white male; not so great otherwise.",2020-07-15,2.0,Anonymous Employee,"-	You will *not* work yourself to death there. In fact, you will most likely do rather little.
-	The money’s alright, particularly in light of the fact that you will not be doing very much.
-	It’s a great place if you’re a 35+ white male and you don’t have any particular ambitions – you just want a place to last at until retirement.
-	It may be dysfunctional and unpleasant, but it’s not an evil environment per se; not many psychopaths.","Northern Trust in 2020’s is what banks and asset managers must have been in the 1980’s / 1990’s. It is so culturally backwards it’s quite phenomenal. Progression is blocked for anyone who is not a white, heteronormative male (ideally with some old money lineage). It is not explicit discrimination of course, it’s just the long-established culture. Basically mediocre white guys with degrees in feeling good about themselves promoting others just like them. The levels of homophobia are well above average, though most of it is implicit. Many LGBT+ employees keep their orientation private in fear of their careers. That fear is well justified – any “other” has little future at NT: female, Asian, brown, olive, gay, trans, immigrant – they can all just forget it. The company is trying to project this image of “diversity by acquisition” through its non-executive directors. This is cynical and no one inside the company is buying it: non-execs can be minorities or female, but they have little to say in how the company is being run.

It is particularly unfortunate to see how NT works for women. Women have only got 2 choices at NT:
-	either to dumb themselves down, pretend to be warm, fuzzy, fluffy, and really stupid so as not to make the men feel threatened;
-	or to become absolute psycho-monsters, Glenn Close- / Rebecca DeMornay-type bunny boilers who out-evil the men at their own game.
I saw both in spades, and found it cringe-worthy. NT is no place for women – especially women of colour. They can forget about *any* development or career at NT. Sadly, this also applies to the Indian offices, where NT has some 3,000 back-office employees. Vast majority of management are male, and some of them are just *awful*. The kind of things they are allowed to get away with just because they are cheaper than their European counterparts is upsetting.

Managers routinely take all credit for their team’s work. At times it can be quite comical – they will take the report printout from their team and present it as their sole, own work in front of that very team. More often than not they will have never read that actual report – they’d scan it in a meeting for 3 minutes and base their teams’ annual reviews on it.
NT will also actively *discourage* professional growth and development. This will manifest itself not only through refusal of any monetary support or extra time off. Whenever possible, they will go an extra mile to derail it. NT is not a place where smarts count for very much.

Any thought leadership? Forget about it; NT is all about its 130+ years’ of heritage. There is *no* thought leadership at NT.
Technologically it’s the most backwards firm I’ve ever seen – it’s quite phenomenal it holds together (I doubt it will for very much longer). It’s a complete hodgepodge of jumbled systems and mainframes (sic!); hardly anyone knows how they run. Around 2010 the company spent close to USD 500mln on technological transformation – it ended up with hundreds of people hired to do no-one-knows-what, no actual deliverables, and a handful of sacked executives. That is very symptomatic of NT."

If you care about your career, please don't come here. The managers here are totally incompetent. I have never seen such a terrible workplace. The worst dept is Corporate Actions. Everyone I speak with is looking to quit. Bonuses and raises are way below average (and less than what they tell you in interviews) - this is why they pay bonuses in April - this way they force people to stay longer than they really wanted to. Outdated computer systems that always crash. No one is ever promoted. All managers come from outside - unless you've been with the company when they merged with a division from Citadel many years ago. 

Management is completely clueless as to the work. No idea how to lead a team. Revolving door of employees. Everyone is looking to quit.

Also, the managers lie about everything just for CYA purposes. The technology is the worst in the industry - old and in the 3+ years, I've been here, it has never been updated. Management doesn't do anything; however, if you make a mistake, this is an opportunity for them to actually do some work - which is to attack you. Prepare yourself for 200+ emails every single day - not a joke.

You don't have to believe me. Join the company and you will see for yourself. There are people who quit NT without a job because they are that miserable - I'm at that point now."

mistake by joining this company. Since then I'm
leading a miserable life. There is no work-life
balance here. You have to work each and
everyday for 10 to 12hrs like a donkey with all
that stress and hectic load. No time for your
family. Management is dead. they don't
understand the problem of employees. They
want to run the operations with minimum
resources. I literally work like a slave here.
Managers are like puppets and just behind the
targets. I don't get time to go for breakfast
lunch or dinner, most of the times I don't get up
to go for nature calls also. Just imagine the
level of stress imposed and working extra
houra everyday. Please join this company if you
want to go not reachable to your family, make
your life hell, put your career at risk because
once you join here, then there is no way you can
get out. 9hrs job is a big myth here. I'm now
thinking of resigning this company after 3 yrs
of my service. I don't have any offers currently,
but that's better than dying here. My body has
finally stopped supporting the stress level I was
taking here."

There is a push to move as many positions as posible to India. The majority of people in IT do not understand English very well, which makes it incredibly difficult to do complex, intricate IT work.

The  company is run very similarly to a kindergarten or preschool in regards to its training courses and messaging to employees, who are grown adults.

The company does not pay high enough salaries to attract or retain quality employees. 

In IT 70% of the staff is contractors. Most contractors are not based in the US and are new to the company. It typically takes 3 - 5 calls to the Help Desk to resolve any kind of technical issue. The bank outsources a lot. The companies that the bank outsources to do not have the capabilities to meet the bank's needs. 

The bank likes to implement as much burdensome process as possible vs. simplifying and removing administrative overhead. The amount of time I spend doing real, value-add work during any given day is probably under 30%."

A lot of time is spent by managers impressing higher management and being a yes man or pulling other people down. Managers lack skills overall in being a mentor and come through the rank internally and have a set mindset and don't want to change.

Work life balance doesn't exist and it's a bad trend people follow looking at their managers who spend 13-14 hrs a day and also being in the night shift. In the long run affects the health.

Trainings are not effective to build skills. If you have more aspirations then you are better off using this as a start. Nothing against the company just the Indian management fails to ignite creativity and really stomp authority nipping all the creative people in the bud."

1976,,Rewarding Place to Start a Career in Finance,2018-12-16,4.0,"Technical Coordinator, Alternatives Client Audit","1) Opportunity  for Learning and Growth

Working on the client audit team provides tremendous experience for someone early in their career. Client Audit sits at the end of the custody reporting process within Alternatives at Northern Trust. The team is responsible for gathering and auditing the work of several other teams within the department before signing off on monthly reporting. This gives client audit exposure into what the other teams do and what the clients are looking for from a custodian. There is great opportunity for someone who is willing to work hard and learn the process. It also provides insight into an asset class that is becoming more and more popular with investors.

2) Supportive Management and Team Culture

I had a very good manager during my time with the Client Audit Team. I felt that she was always trying to help me advance my career and grow as an employee. I was able to learn a lot about banking operations and people management in my time with the team.  Overall, I think the leadership group does a great job with the team.

The culture of Client Audit is also very strong.  The team is big (20+ total) but very supportive to new employees. Team members are always willing to help when one person may be struggling. It's a great group of people to work with every day.

3) Solid, Respected Company

Northern Trust is a good company to work for. The culture is extremely friendly and supportive. There is tremendous opportunity to grow within your own department or with other groups. Senior management is very accessible. I think this is why you see so many people staying with NT for such a long time.","The main downside of working on the Alts Client Audit Team is the overtime required during the first 2 weeks of each month. 

Client Audit's main responsibility is to collect information from investment managers and signoff on monthly custody reporting.  The issue is that all of the information is made available at the same time, and all clients seem to want reporting on the same day each month. This leads to Client Audit working a significant amount of overtime early in the month. This is paid overtime, but the days can be long, particularly when the same cycle happens every 4 weeks."

Overall working at Northern is what you make of it. If you are in the Asset Management or Wealth Management side of the bank you will have a great job, decent pay, and good work-life balance.  Operations side is a different story, but that's the case industry wide. As a company, particularly as a bank, Northern has to keep their operating costs low and unfortunately the roles in operations are the biggest money draining roles in the company. The good part is that Northern promotes from within, and if you have the drive and work ethic you can manage to shift to a WM or AM role.",Relatively low pay.

The company has a great reputation and a unique client base. They have wonderful (and generous) programs in place for the communities where the NT offices are located.

Seem to be hiring a lot of Millennials.","Although some areas of NT are more innovative in their thinking (50 South Capital, CX Lab, FlexShares, etc.), I found my experience to differ.  Wealth Management moves very slowly and quite frugal when it comes to resources for ""high value"" employees (software applications , training & leadership, cross channel relationship building, networking events, advancing career paths, etc.).  

It can take up to a year to complete a 10 page sales presentation because there is not a clear owner (and the stakeholders can't come to an agreement on the content or look and feel).

The culture takes a bit of getting used to. From my POV, I could see a defined hierarchy and a true chain of command in place throughout the organization. For example, I once had a manager try to deter me from introducing myself to a presenter after an internal 'town hall'  meeting. I'm a polished professional and just wanted to tell them ""thank you"" for covering the topic and to volunteer my time outside of my role to assist with the initiative.  Also, it was frowned upon to directly send an email to a senior partner or executive without getting buy in or permission from your manager. Weird.

Our team was consistently being pulled aside to address ""emergency"" situations which would lead to other priority projects being late (change in leadership, regulatory situations, economic disruption, a SME needed a paper produced in three days, etc.). 

They seem to be hiring a lot of Millennials.  It's obvious that partners who have had family members work here (during or prior to joining), are exposed to more career opportunities or coddled a bit more."

You make an immediate impact which affects clients, projects, or other teams. Exposure to this is beneficial to your early career.
Top top HFS management know what they are doing. This helps drive future business.
Good work/life balance. You should be able to get away with working 8 hours a day.

Good amount of vacation days, typical medical/dental/vision benefits.
You won't get fired. Unless you're extremely bad at your job.","Training was abysmal. I left after a few years and it never got better. Nothing is centralized and knowledge is lost when people leave. You will learn by sitting at someone's desk and jotting notes on paper. Complete joke.
Technology is sourced from Citadel. When you leave HFS, all that knowledge disappears and cannot be carried to other companies.
A lot of management and senior management is ex-Citadel. Impossible to move up. Certainly a lot of these people are 'lifers'. During my time, I don't believe I saw anyone replace their manager. Only way is to transition to another team (don't do this, you will make more $ by leaving)
A lot of incompetent managers/older employees with no technology/Excel skills. They will find young talent and pawn off majority of the work on them. My experience was I had no choice and had to complete the work under constant monitoring. Google 'fear-based leader'.
They've opened up a Tempe, AZ office which will definitely be replacing new jobs located in Chicago. May affect raises, offers, bonus, etc....
Pay increases were a complete joke. You have to fight for it, be super aggressive, and threaten to get big bumps. They will never hand out big pay increases based on your actual value.
I never got my total bonus target. You will likely receive 66% of the 'target %'.

2105,,Alts Analyst,2018-07-03,1.0,Analyst,"Benefits aren't the worst- not great medical, but not terrible. OK 401k. A lot of people stick around for the pension which you are eligible for after 3 years.","I made this review because I noticed a lot of highly positive reviews as of late- this is because management of many of the teams held meetings and asked employees to leave positive reviews due to the negative reviews posted at the time, but I don't feel these accurately represent working at Northern Trust.
*HIGHLIGHTS: Poor salary, culture clash, no advancement, poor management*
So where to start...firstly, salary. Salary is low for the industry average, but pretty on par for the local area. Companies know they have a pipeline of new talent from ASU grads, and a lot of finance firms have operations offices in the Phoenix area, so while you won't get paid much, you won't get much higher unless you work in actual finance. The bonuses are SMALL. Even for employees rated as high performers, who only receive a fraction of a percentage higher than those who aren't.
Which brings me to the second area of discussion- the work itself. Don't be fooled by the recruiters or interviewers- all jobs in the Tempe office are Operations. During my time, I've seen a lot of people join the team (myself included) with the understanding that the job was completely different than what it was due to the interview tactics. Some people were straight up lied to about the job. They'll say anything to get you in the door. Why? The training is minimal. They don't have formal trainers, and most teams don't have formal training plans. It's a game of 'who has time to sit with the noob(s).' Because they don't invest in the training of their employees, they don't invest in retaining their employees because there is little value there. In periods of high turnover on the team, they simply put the extra work on other employees. And when employees take on more work, many teams decide to cap overtime hours in a comical lapse in judgement.
It's choices like these that reflect the management at Northern Trust. In alts, and in every department I have encountered. Management itself sees a high rate of turnover, but the constant seems to be managers that are controlling, ill-trained, and don't value employees (exceptions to this are rare). Any pitch of 'work/life balance' is because they don't want to pay you overtime. In reality, work life balance is hard to attain because getting time off can be difficult. Only a certain amount of people can be out on a team on any given day, and you're only expected to take time off when you have down time or no deadlines. 
Thirdly- the culture. I mentioned the pension in the Pros section. This is a great aspect of the company until it isn't. This means a lot of people are there to coast for as long as they can to get their pension. It makes it harder for people who want to actually come in and do good work to work with other teams and people. An older Glassdoor review said NT cuture is ""Be seen and not heard."" I think this is the most accurate thing I've read on here. Managers encourage innovation but don't want actual change, and see suggestions as complaints. There is also a HUGE culture clash with the Arizona natives vs. Chicago transplants. Chicago people are often viewed as 'elite' even though these will almost without fail be 1) the same people whos teams were moved to AZ because of poor performance and 2) are there to coast for their pension. Another fun twist to the culture is the fact that managers are brought in from India, and no matter what team you're on, somewhere down the line the Bangalore or other non-US team is handling your assets/accounts/clients/etc. This creates a huge opportunity for clashes in communication, culture, sense of urgency, etc.
In terms of career growth, this really varies by team. If you're on a team with a high rate of turnover and constant vacancies, chances are you'll be made senior after your first year but then stagnate in your career. Other than this, there may be some lateral growth but nothing outstanding."

This creates debilitating issues in regards to morale and training.  Most critically, for example, the team I started on had five managers quit in 1.5 years.
* They never meet their bonus targets (e.g., up to 5% for Senior Analyst or up to 7% for Consultant).  My first year at NT, they informed us that salary increases were on hold indefinitely and hiring was frozen indefinitely (even as people were leaving voluntarily, their roles were not filled).  For bonuses, despite having an above-average review, I got a 1% bonus (I was eligible up to 5%); my second year, despite a promotion in title, I got a 1.8% bonus (I was eligible up to 7%).
* If you have an issue with a manager, HR is NOT on your side.  I filed a hostile work environment complaint against my direct manager, HR told my manager that I complained about him, and then I experienced extreme retaliation.  My manager denied any wrongdoing and I was verbatim told that they were taking his word as truth over mine because he is a manager.

Also, NT has invested in their Tech infrastructure, and most functions are automated, so your main responsibility will be data validation/analysis. At, a department level, the only pro is  working shoulder to shoulder with the other accountants is really what make this job and department tolerable.","The only cons  at a company level, that I experienced, was dealing with HR.  They may be great at recruiting (although the pay is below market), but their ability to handle complaints is virtually non existent.  
At the department level, there were many factors that made the job intolerable, such as poor leadership with the section managers, the mandatory overtime, lack of account ownership/accountability within the department, communication between teams (grouped by section managers), lack of universal training.  Also, lack of advancement within the department was a major con.  
If you are young, I would highly recommend you not interview/accept the offer, because you will stunt your professional growth, as the process is so automated, you will not learn technical/profession skills.  This is also a large company, therefore you will often time be ignored/invisible to upper management.  The base pay is not competitive, and not an ideal scenario when you are trying to get established. This company/department would be an ideal workplace if you are close to retirement and want to enjoy the benefits (retirement, pension, flexible work hours etc). Also a good option, if you choose to be a ""lifer"" at a younger  age.  

For the record, I am basing the above on my experience at Northern Trust, and how I rate them relative to other companies that I have worked. I was content while working at NT, and stayed with the department for 4-7 years.  During that time, we had high turnover in staff and management, and overall restructuring of the client servicing department that was newly forming.   It has been awhile since I last worked there, but I keep in touch with several of the current accountants, and it doesn't seem like the root problem with the department has been addressed/solved.   They are still dealing with high turnover.   
 In conclusion,  I would recommend the company to a friend, but not the Fund Reporting Department. Job satisfaction really depends on what department you are placed, and not uniform across offices."

2616,,Internship Program,2016-10-15,1.0,,People within the organization are often willing to take the time to speak with you and give you guidance. Very open door culture in that regard.,"-I was never given any work to do and often sat there bored, when I asked for more work my emails/Instant messages were ignored. 
-Very few interns actually turn the internship into full-time work. We had a class of 45 interns or so and only 6 back office full time positions were posted online and they were all back office accounting positions. They tried to sell the Rotational Development Program (RDP) and many of us applied, however the tracks within the program that are even somewhat sought after, the Credit and Investments track, were filled by first and second year individuals who were already employed full-time at the firm. Barely any of us got a shot to learn a lot and to turn this into a full-time position. Correct me if I am wrong, but isn't that the point of an internship? 
-If you applied to multiple positions they will put you wherever you best fit their needs, not according to your performance or your preference. No consideration for the employee. 
-Very unorganized internship program
-Pay is not competitive to other organizations in financial services or public accounting
- Never really gave us any benefits or perks, I know other companies often provide lunch, t shirts, and other things to appreciate interns. We got like one lunch and a cheap coffee mug that broke before the end of the internship program. 
-Very high turnover rate, which is totally understandable. I interned there over the summer, (2 months ago) in my time there & via notifications on LinkedIn, i saw more than five employees already leave within the department I interned in. 
-There were so many students coming from top universities (Duke, Notre Dame, University of Chicago, Northwestern, Dartmouth, University of Michigan) and many of them in Asset Management and Wealth Management but they were no full-time positions for them. They were pretty much used for the sole purpose of cheap labor.
-A month after the program ended and I did not go for a full-time position, I got a call from a recruiter asking if I would like to apply for some of the roles that they did not fill. once again, USING PEOPLE FOR THEIR OWN BENEFITS."

There are some genuine moments of comedy - such as project managers deciding that the best approach to testing is to get the new test team to author the functional specs, whilst the BAs author the test scripts from them and do the testing....","Company motto should be ""If nothing else works, a total pig-headed unwillingness to look facts in the face will see us through"".

Technologically and ideologically incompetent.  Most of the permanent staff are lifers and have never worked anywhere else, and have therefore no idea about other ways of working - and are too scared to try something different.

Useless at project management as an organisation.  The project managers are more concerned with their own inter-company 'networks' than actually delivering anything of quality.
No inclination to ever change their failing processes, even when clients are warning them that another occurrence of having to send the code back (when it won't execute, because they don't understand the concept of testing) to NT will result in loss of client.  A lot of this is born out of ignorance and arrogance.

There is a culture of blame.  Various teams are constantly at loggerheads over whose fault it is for either developing a system without first having the requirements, or waiting until a project is going critical and they 'borrow' resource from other teams in a desperate attempt to meet deadlines.

It's like the old Jasper Carrot joke about anthrax in pick 'n mix at Woolworths, in the respect that people are only bothered with their own job, and just ensuring that they pass their task on to the next person in the chain, regardless of the quality.

Avoid like the plague - there is nothing to enhance your career by working there.  You'll wonder how a large organisation can survive whilst being so inept at delivering IT, until you see the sheer volume of live defects and the very large off-shore team devoted to operating manual workarounds in live."

Basics of the job aren't tremendously difficult to master; sometimes there are more intricate issues, depending on the clients you're on (pretty standard). Totally decent work-life balance outside of busy season, which goes from January to mid-March. If you're counting at home, that's a full month less than a tax busy season... so, there's that!","Relatively flat org structure offers less in terms of titled progression, if that's your thing.

This surge of the company toward becoming a global leader in fund administration and custodial services has resulted in a work environment that offers employees a great opportunity for internal movement.  A rotation around the many segments of Northern Trust's fund servicing sectors will lead you to learn volumes about different types of fund structures, investment trends, reporting and disclosure requirements, etc.  In summary, there is a lot to know in the world of Northern Trust fund accounting and it does take time and motivation to develop; nonetheless, a genuine dedication to your career and to your company will pay dividends at place like NT, which fuels itself off of a very strong internal network.","The nature of a fund accounting job consists of a great deal of independent work.

Heaven help you if you utter a word about statement errors, pricing errors, lack of accessible information.  If one does so, they ate instantly branded a trouble maker.  We are required and heavily invented to push expensive proprietary investments even though all of them have underperformed their benchmarks for years.

It's a great place to go if you're trying to work in financial services but not have to put in long hours. If you're at the end of your career and just trying to collect a paycheck this is a safe bet.,The place thrives on mediocrity.  Politics control promotion and upward mobility.  Nobody leaves because people are well compensated compared to industry counterparts. Northern Trust is still run like a mom and pop bank.  The back-end IT infrastructure is somewhat antiquated and nobody is in a hurry to do anything.

3054,,Private Equity Operations,2015-05-11,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"Good Vacation Time
Steadily busy throughout the workday
Decent/Good transportation throughout the city (only until 6:30pm)","Most of the positive reviews were made by employees in other countries (IE: Bangalore), but I can honestly say the environment and moral of the Chicago offices is not a healthy one. 

Low salaries compared to industry standards. Bonuses are few and far between - as are raises. 

The employees are all in a rutt because of the current environment in which the company finds itself. The canal location is called ""Canalcatraz"" by the employees who work there because of it's likeness to a prison. The employees also have a prisoner mentality.

Culture of finger pointing and blame game among employees and management. Everyone is constantly trying to save their own behinds because of the cost cutting environment. 

Due to cost cutting environment people are fearful of making mistakes. Management is pressured to find more efficient and less costly ways to do things so employees are vulnerable to being let go. Because of this, employees are often on edge. Employee reviews are often done in a way as to not credit the employee enough so that they can be compensated better. 

They are in a cost cutting mode, and have been for the last 4 years. This means 0 raises for those in Operations or the other entry level areas. Bonuses are often just $500 - hey better than nothing, right?

Hardly any room for growth, and even if there is a position available the compensation is hardly any better. 

Because they are in a cost cutting mode, there are hardly any amenities. The company nickel and dimes their employees. The gym costs $40/month, which is more expensive than most of the other gyms in the area. Often times a company's gym is free to their employees. Sometimes employees health care costs are lessened if they use the company gym. Not at Northern. It costs $40/month.

Must pay for coffee as well (i realize this really isn't a con) but the fact that employees are sometimes discouraged/questioned when getting coffee. The coffee is stationed on 1 floor, and people are often questioned as to why they are always leaving to go get it.  

There is lots of turnover among employees. Employees try to leave their position after a year is up because they find themselves doing something they hate - or at least working in an environment that they hate.

People constantly going to HR. IMPORTANT: HR is always there to protect the company - not the employee. Wrongful terminations. One guy was fired because his manager in Private Equity Operations did not like him or his attitude of just showing up to do his work and not make friends with manager or most of employees. Guy wasn't a bad guy, just had his friends and made it a point to be standoffish to others. 

High turnover among management. 4 different managers same department n(actually in several depts) in last 4 years. 

Favoritism among managers and employees of same race. Obviously this is a pretty serious allegation, and it is just that. It's very hard to be proven so you would just have to take a stranger's word for it on the internet. Many employees would complain about how managers of certain colors allow the employees of those colors to get away with being unprofessional or other things.  

Employees are over worked, and everyone has a miserable attitude because of it. Constantly putting more work on employees and not compensating them for it. 

The IT systems are outdated and constantly crashing. This makes for a more stressful day for some because time frames and cut off times are in place and the work needs to be done using manual systems or far outdated systems. If the work is needed by another department whose systems are working fine there is added pressure. When this happens every other week and improvements aren't made by higher ups, this is an issue. Employees end up in more of a rut."
3055,,Product Manager,2015-05-11,4.0,Product Developer,"All in all a good experience.  Some areas are great to work in while others are not, so it is all about finding your niche.  There is opportunity for advancement if you seek it and work hard.  Most coworkers are friendly.  Upper management is fairly accessible if you are in Chicago. 4 weeks paid vacation.  Decent benefits.  Most areas you can wfh two days a month or so.",Pay is not great.  Since the crash it has been about efficiency/productivity so work loads have increased and staff levels have reduced which has made morale a little lower.  Some areas are not as nice to work in as others.  Almost like working for a different company.

3062,,Personal Banking Investigator (Auditor),2015-05-04,1.0,Anonymous Employee,I really enjoy the people I worked with. I had an awesome partner and met some really nice people in other departments that were helpful and knowledgeable.,The pay is way below what it should be for the workload and responsibilities. The management also treats those who are not at management level as less than and with blatant disrespect. Countless incidents of being spoken down too even when I was right. It is also very hard to move around in the company without heavy networking. Promotions are based on who you know rather than what you know.
3063,,"Dissapointing Experience this company is way over rated, no thanks, pass that kool aid to the next cult member",2015-05-03,1.0,Manager Fund Accounting,"NONE. If you are lazy and lack technical skills, this place is for you. Full of silly politics from non talented individuals who think they are stars. Form over substance types apply here you will do well, actual proven stars need not waste their time here, if you don't conform to your boss's inefficient ways, they will retaliate with termination or if your lucky a demotion. I ran out of space on Cons, so for the reader, a bit of clarification. Pros for lazy untalented individuals who want to get by with only knowing the right people. Forget about having communication or public speaking skills, or real accounting tech skills or knowledge, no just show up if you already know somebody here, and you can coast and be a yes man , you will get a promotion. If you have no clue about fund accounting, have no fear, your free pass is automatic here as long as you know the right people, and I am not exaggerating here. They like to terminate people for no reason before  6 months ,who they may not like due to people trying to make things more efficient, no do not do that here, you must drink the kool aid and be a total follower of mediocrity. If you think a Credit Default Swap only has one leg, just because its more convenient to just reflect the Periodic fixed premium stream that the Buyer Leg pays for protection to the Seller Leg ( since the Seller leg only pays out in the event of a credit event or default of the underlying fixed income security , and its easier to not represent a contingent payout event in the system) instead of the correct answer two legs, simply because every swap has two legs Swap 101 basics,  then you belong here. If you do not understand how to be efficient with using sunguard macros in conjunction with red flag exception systems and the accounting system, then you belong here. If you think doing recons on micro soft excel spreadsheets are faster than one click macro oles that can be set up via Sunguard connections, and help you with a real time analysis, then you belong here. It perplexed me that they would prefer slower methods of getting work done when the fund accounting environment is always loaded with various deadlines daily, so fast is essential.","I went to a managers meeting at Northern Trust my first month there, and I must say it actually felt like I stepped into some ""CULT"" like pass me the kool aid event where some lady from HR was at the podium in some Preachy style of presentation to the crowd of managers from various different lines of business. I also observed the culture there more in depth where the ""suits"" from the other office would have these presentations that sounded more like info mercials of motivation. Bottomline, this place wreaks of Form over Substance, if you are lazy , and like to talk a good talk, and rely on keep your job via knowing the right people as opposed to performance on the job and team collaboration, this place is for you. There is a trend here of others pointing out that hey so and so is a ""superstar"" too frequently without that so called super star actually proving that are the real deal. As I said form over substance, its a clique thing purely here, and if you are an outsider, no matter how experienced or good you are , they will not give you credt. They will only prop up their happy hour buddies or weekend buddies from work as ""superstars"". Its amusing, seeing people proclaim others or themselves as ""stars"" before actually proving it via performance. Finally, if you come from a collaborative environment where ideas and input are welcome from all team members without worrying about retaliation, well this place is not that. You have to conform to a cult like fashion, and if you variate or try to help with a more efficient way of doing things, they retaliate with politics, to demotions, to even termination without a reason. Not a healthy place for true superstars to contribute to the team goals, it's all conformity here. They like talking a good talk here, but execution is not efficient, and they do not grasp being efficient or working smarter instead of mediocre harder methods."

While in a low, tight interest rate environment, Northern placed, and rightly so, a very high priority on reducing costs.

This is very frustrating as it does not help encourage a partner to feel appreciated and want to give their all. I've been told that my salary is indeed below market value and my manager would try to request some form of increase but not to get my hopes up. Hearing your manager acknowledge you're being undervalued and unappreciated but telling you that there may not be anything we can do about it is very frustrating."

3201,,"Nice people, conservative bank, good place to work",2014-07-24,3.0,Anonymous Employee,"Colleagues were very approachable and helpful; I still keep in touch with some.
Good experience working with large clients.
Ability to find other opportunities within the firm is good.","Pay is not commensurate with work.
It is difficult to be removed from your position; and some should. This created an attitude of complacency among some employees and the quality of work suffered."
3202,,Highly Underappreciated and Severely Underpaid Employees,2014-07-24,1.0,Second Vice President Tax,- 4 weeks of vacation,"- Accountants are pushed to a building on the South side of the Loop and are not in banking buildings. Not a ""One"" group feel.
- Cheap on pay with it's ""Partners"" - well below industry standards
- VPs are removed from the work their staff and seniors are performing and unrealistic about time lines internal due dates.
- Salaried individuals are not given any recognition when overtime is put in and it's excessive during busy periods. 
-  VPs unable to think outside the box and do not meet industry standard practices
- Lack of a sense of teaming due  to the VP frowning on communication- people do not talk to each other even though they are working in the same group and on the same project people. 
- Company Policies are not followed in each department and apply to ONLY certain.
- Unreasonable expectations and lack of resources creates unnecessary overtime for all 
- Redundancy in the work to create job security as I quote direct from the VP
- Lack of effective work-life balance despite the fact that Northern says they promote the issue.
- Cheap budget meaning the resources you do have are inefficient and dated for tax return preparation and tax research.
- Preferential treatment provided to certain individuals who have been with the department longer. 
-Expectations that if you are the new person you are given the shaft when it comes to office coverage and pto during holidays and during non-busy season.
- Honesty in this department is not a given.
- Professionalism is not a priority within the group I was in and really was almost embarrassing to clients.
-Low budget so raises are not within industry standards and limit earning potential. This also translates into no holiday parties or company outings. 
- Lack of communication from top down approach - ie 400 people will be let go in 2014 and 2015 was announced in Crain's Mag before even being communicating it to their own employees.
Overall the group I worked in I felt was less than acceptable when it came to professionalism which really in the end created a hostile working environment. I would say that anyone considering working for this company take a serious look elsewhere before signing any employment contract with them."

The insurance benefits are decent but still run $500 for family BCBS.  Training is available, if you ever have a desire to spend time at work beyond the 10-12 hour work days.  Good opportunity if you're looking to add a high volume administrator to your professional experience.","Hedge Fund Services has carried on Citadel's work culture.   If you're not Citadel / Omnium legacy, your chances of inner-department promotion are low.    Management does not care about your home work life balance.  You will work 10-12 hours a day in this group without blinking. The department is full of 20somethings that live walking distance to the office, and drink away their troubles together late into the night.   If you have a family or do not live in the city, you should think twice about taking a role in this department.  You will not get home before 8pm most nights.  There are very few actual perks to this job. The office is sparsely appointed for employee comfort.   Promotional opportunities usually require a transfer to a different group.   100% Silo work.  Extremely high turnover, and you will be expected to pick up the slack."

Salaries are lower than other companies, and raises are meted out in pennies.  Politics is ridiculously out of control, and the only criteria for advancement.     Diversity is a catch phrase, but the reality is a work environment that is highly discriminatory and condescending in Northern's treatment of lower level women, older people.  Token diversity is rampant, which is just as insulting as overt racism.  The atmosphere is cold, stiff, intolerant, and non-inclusive.  Lots of blame throwing.  Life long employees are celebrated dead weight who spend more time working the system than adding productive value or ideas.  People do not smile much in this region."

3235,,Great Institution but headed in the wrong direction,2014-04-23,3.0,Anonymous Employee,Northern Trust was built on their service and commitment to their clients.   For many years they were at the top of their game but are vulnerable now to some of the larger players particularly in the personal side of their business.   To their credit they are trying to innovate however they've lost significant talent over the past 5 years.,Generally they do not have a leadership position in the market with their product and service offerings.   Very slow to adapt and initiatives take too long to complete.
3236,,"People-Centric Work Environment, but Ongoing Challenges to Transform",2014-04-19,4.0,Consultant,"The company prides itself in being people-centric (strong benefits package), both in its fiduciary relationship with clients as well as with its employees, or partners, internally.  Most managers are comfortable providing flexible work options, depending on team deliverables.  Several avenues for networking and career development, but only for those who can establish the right network.  Internal mobility is common and widely supported by managers who have themselves benefited from working across functional areas.","Similar to the rest of the industry Northern Trust has been pushing large change initiatives to reduce expenses and raise revenues.  Lack of funding in budgets has limited opportunities for internal mobility and flatlined growth in most partners salary despite increased responsibilities and volume.  Change provides opportunities for individuals eager to enhance the company, but challenges the status quo that many partners benefit from due to skills or networks they've developed over 20+ years in the company.  Many decisions get made (or swayed) by personality or relationship of senior stakeholders despite effort put into group analysis and discussion."

Old School.
MANY people are there to finish up their pension time and retire.  Veterans spend more time insulating themselves and consolidating their position than they do working.  Often spending cycles doing CYA rather than something productive.
Meetings drag as people seem more concerned about filling the time than getting something done
Mid level managers can take WEEKS to reply to an email just to display their power even if it is costing the company thousands of dollars a day.  Not an open door environment
Bottom Line: Management could be in a coma for three weeks before anyone would notice."
3239,,"""Old School"" Firm",2014-04-11,2.0,Vice President,Culture that built a great reputation serving clients well and supports work/life balance.  Senior management is extremely accessible and promotes internal networking.,Slow moving; not receptive to change.  Overweighted with middle management that is out of touch with what is going on in the field.  Lack of accountability.
3240,,Networking is crucial here,2014-04-10,3.0,Officer,A good place to start your career.  People are intelligent and know the business well.  If you are excellent at networking you will have more opportunities for career advancement.,Advancement can be slow and it's more political (hence the networking above) and less of a meritocracy.  There are also a lot of inefficient HR or administrative processes that they are working to improve upon.
3241,,Overall positive experience.,2014-04-10,4.0,Anonymous Employee,The people are great -  friendly and supportive.  Salary is fair.  Work balance is very good.,Business is very siloed and as a result not always very efficient.

3253,,Overall good company to work for but management is hit or miss.,2014-03-19,3.0,Vice President,"This is a good place to start your career. You are encouraged to learn and grow within the company. It is also a great place to work if you really want stability and longevity with a company. Northern has an excellent reputation in the industry and the name carries weight. The opportunities to move around are tremendous and allows you to gain experience across many different areas. Depending on the area you work in, flex-time, work from home are options. The benefits, 401k, pension, vacation package is generous. There is a really friendly culture there is a sense of people working together as a team to get things done. The people make this a very enjoyable place to work.","While the benefits package are generous, the salaries are not competitive. There is a feeling that you are not there because of the money. The salary increases are also quite low and bonuses are discretionary so the feeling is that those who are management's favorites get the most.
Despite the fact that there are lay-offs, the rate is much lower than other banks in the financial industry. Overall there is a sense that once you are at the company you can build a career and have a stability. This can be positive and makes for very happy dedicated employee, however, unfortunately this also results in poor performing employees and managers remaining in their positions without consequences. This can be very frustrating when this is a manager because rather than address the problem employees will just move to another area because of the mobility within the company."

Fun, interesting company events.","Old Outdated systems, need for efficient, functional technological systems for clients and employees. Lots of passing the buck, with retail offices, when dealing with the call center. Many transferred calls with confused clients, who are upset they have to re-explain their issue to you.

You will work with management or Sr. management on a daily/weekly basis.,Norther Trust has a very conservative nature which shows in the very dated systems that are used. I believe that NT is behind the curve on their technology which creates a very difficult work environment. Any technology advances involve using system patching through macros. NT does not have the reputation of very high compensation. Through my research I would say most other financial institutions have better compensation packages.

I couldn't believe I was paid to train for a month and when I was finally assigned to my team, I was told by everyone on the team to forget what I learned. Northern prides its self in being conservative, but I believe there is a difference between being conservative and being old fashioned. They need to get with the times.  I'll finish by saying again that their pay is terrible which is why they can't retain any talent."

Upper management brought in from the outside are concerned for their own jobs and not the jobs of the employees.

I'm sure this place has been good to them. However, in the U.S. it's a totally different experience and it is a negative one.

1. Benefits have been drastically cut in the past two years.
2. Low pay, minimal raises, and low bonuses (if any).
3. Antiquated technology. Poor internal systems.
4. Management asks you to ""do more with less"", but refuses to compensate you for all the extra work you take on.
5. No team environment. It's every man for himself. And if something should go wrong, the finger pointing begins.
6. Very difficult to get ahead in the organization, unless you are a management favorite. A smart, go-getter can easily get surpassed by a management favorite, who just does the minimum to get  by.
7. Senior management is so out of touch, they have no idea what it takes just to get the simplest task done.
8. There is a lot of reorganization. I have had six bosses in five years.
9/. Expenses have been cut to the bone; no technology upgrades, no coffee, no plastic utensils, no team outings. However, the company signs a multi-million, multi-year deal to sponsor the Northern Trust open. It seems senior management's love of golfing in Southern California in February is more important than doing what's right for the business and it's employees."

Not too busy depending on ur team.","Too many managers that dont do much and there is constant under currents between teams because of bad management from top level. Because top level managers all old and all soon to be retired, they care less and less the closer to their retirement year.
Current ceo like the rest only care about feeding himself the big $ and dont care about company.  
I met old ceo when I joined and he was much nicer person and dedicated person and to be respected.
HR dept is just an insect attached to the company they only protect managers not the rest people."

Now, no ESOP, no profit sharing, 401(k) matching has been decreased, pension has been decreased and still low pay.

3494,,Worst place I have ever worked,2012-03-30,1.0,,There are no good things about working for Northern Trust.  Worked for many years and have never worked at a place where I could not find a single good quality about the place.,"The absolute worst working enviorment in my career.  Do not trust management, HR, or the Human Relations Department they do not protect the employees they will back managment only.  Stay clear of the Fund Administration Department.  The Head of the Fund Admin change about 2 years ago department went downhill from there.  Without a doubt the current head only manages his mangers and is clueless as to what goes on in his department.  He stays in his office with his door shut and has no interaction with anyone but managers.  The manager I reported to has absolutely no managment skills, and without a doubt a big zero when it comes to people skills.  She lacks interaction with her team much like her direct report plops in her chair and does not converse with her team at all.  Holds useless meetings not a very well liked individual.  They work you like a dog too many hours too little pay.  Pay is terrible raises what raises.  Bonus are really not existent if you want to call what they give a bonus. My advice stay as far away from Northern Trust as you can no job is better than working at Northern Trust."

Employees lacked many of the credentials found in competitors (substandard). Bonuses were weak during my time there and from what my former colleagues told me, bonus target rates that were stated at the beginning of the year where never reached by anyone (essentially the average bonus rate quoted was really the ""top"" bonus. And no one hit it). Bonus was very subjective, goals were not clearly and quantitatively measured so it was often hard to disagree with your bonus)."
