- Takes innovation really seriously
- Amazing place to contribute through projects and to learn fast","- Middle management is poorly prepared and mostly comes from other banks with very different culture
- Lack of career opportunities
- Diversity only happens on low level hierarchy"
4,Nubank,Very fast paced environment,2022-02-28,3.0,Customer Experience Coordinator,You can develop yourself very quickly having many people from different departments working together. You can also work on various projects.,"With a lot of things going on simultaneously, you usually have to work too many hours a day (much more than 8h), and it isn't easy to focus as you are working on many projects at the same time."
5,Nubank,Nubank,2022-02-23,3.0,Senior Business Analyst,"Multilngual company, workers with high quality",Compensation is not a transparent process. Transparency is definitely thing that lacks the most in this process. Has a lot of managers from other countries who have completely different ranges of salary for the same functions.

- Trusting environment: confidential information is shared first-hand with most employees.","- Deferred compensation in the form of restricted share units (RSUs) leaves little room for portfolio diversification. It also breeds a number of workers to stay only to accrue the time-deferred benefits.
- The increased size and public opening have led to a significant increase in bureaucracy and decrease in transparency."
10,Nubank,"Great culture, poor coaching",2021-12-19,4.0,Learning Partner,"Great culture, exposure to hypergrowth environment, demanding atmosphere.",The definition for my role changed drastically and I received precious little coaching to get me ready for this challenge.

19,Nubank,"At the head of the spear of technology, good place to learn, but still has many issues with management.",2021-10-29,3.0,Business Analyst,"The company is very tech oriented. Offers an experience not very often seen, with the sheer amount of data and big data processing it is possible to be extremely data driven, and make very accurate decisions. Has a decent career plan, but with every year that passes promotions become more difficult, which may be a good thing (for the reason pontes below). Has a competitive fixed compensation","Heterogeneity in management. Some areas have very competent people, but others have really inexperienced managers, which hugely deteriorates the life of ICs in general, and reduces the learning curve. Also, some areas have the expected nubank culture, but others seem more like a consultant firm than a startup. The variable compensation in stocks (at least the way it is today) will be mediocre in the coming future. With the company size now it would make more sense to give other types of bonuses. Also the benefits are lagging behind, at least for BAs."
20,Nubank,Great company,2021-10-27,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Plenty opportunities inside the company, no matter your position.",Teams always overloaded due to the high pace the company is growing.

Some recent leadership hires are not a great cultural fit and they come from traditional backgrounds therefore they promote hierarchy within the teams, don’t like receiving push back or being challenged, some of them become defensive and start avoiding you or stop inviting you to meetings. Pressure to get results is increasing and some of these leaders threaten you with nice words. Also salaries are below market for tech, they changed my role and responsibility many times and still do but I’m still getting paid as if I had a lower responsibility. When you speak up the usual response is “it is what it is” and they protect this negative leaders because they are giving good results or they don’t want to go through a scandal."
33,Nubank,High Growth & Great People,2021-06-04,5.0,Anonymous Employee,diverse workforce and incredibly talented people,more resources to balance workloads

48,Nubank,A truly deceiving job/work environment.,2021-01-10,2.0,Customer Excellence Analyst,"Home office, good hardware, young work environment.","This is first and foremost, a customer service-oriented call-center type of job. Be prepared for the 24/7 disapproval of your managers for not doing so well on their metrics. Also, based on the fact that it's barely entering the Mexican market, it's really hard to move up the ladder. On top of that, the worst part about it is the salary, there are better paid customer service roles out there, I can guarantee you. I feel I was truly mislead by all of Nu's recruiting campaigns, selling themselves as the Google of fintech. But once you make it into the purple world, you realize it's all a façade. Needless to say, I'm truly disappointed."

Lots of challenges 
Great apparel for working (MacBook/ergonomics/etc)
Good benefits 
Smart people to work with","The purple journey is not always what it seems, at times the message is being reinforced so many times that feels overwhelming and brain washing.

There’s no such thing as transparency and meritocracy in the company, very unclear and subjective evaluation on performance. In the meantime, there’s a clear preference on those who are close to leadership being promoted. 

Unprepared people managers, and taking advantage over their team efforts as they were the only shining star 

Huge communication misalignment at all levels 

No one ever spoke about the lay-off that happened at Nubank and would contradict Exame news of “hiring during the pandemic”, we made sure this was done in a very discrete way

No long term view, one of many examples is that After the layoff in July, the same roles that were dismissed re-opened in November

Many people have burnouts across different levels and chapters 

Diversity only kicked off after the noise in the media at Roda Viva, therefore, it was a topic being raised for a very long time, but  no one ever bothered to put it forward"

And don't worry, the company will be sure to tell you that you're not delivering enough, regardless if you just went through a mental breakdown because of a year-long burnout coupled with your chronic depression!

And don't worry, they pay more than most companies in São Paulo, but they will expect you to be a international level engineer (pro tip: you can have a salary at least twice of what nubank pays if you work remotely for a foreign company)"

86,Nubank,A young environment for learning,2018-11-16,4.0,Customer Experience Analyst,"The best point of Nubank is the informal and relaxed atmosphere, being able to be who you are, leaving your beard, wearing shorts and slippers, painting your nails in a strange way, shaving your head and doing some dreads is normal here, in all positions. All of us here are between 20 and 30 years old, which is very good for making new friends and meeting people from all over Brazil. The central location on Rebouças Avenue and the easy access to the region is also a differential. The salary of the Customer Service can vary from 2400 to 2800 reais depending on the overtime you work. In addition, there is a VR (30 reais/day), a Medical and Odonto Health Plan and some internal benefits related to the credit card and a network of legal support, Psychology, etc. The structure of the building is great, you have everything you need to hold meetings and events. The teams are also always ready to help and provide solutions.","All the positive points end up being muffled by the workload as a customer analyst (processes changes all the time and you need to be aware of any change). You have amazing colleagues but you'll never have a free time to socialize with them. When they offer you the job they give you a fixed schedule and days, when you sign the contract you find that you are forced to do shifts on your days off. These shifts are advertised month by month, so you can forget about your social life or plan that graduation/marriage/family event in the summer or at the end of the year, because you don't know if you will have to work on this day (there is no chance of negotiating a day off, a license that is not medical, etc.). Although there is a strong culture of teamwork, of talking about what we think to contribute to the growth of the company and always being authentic, the reality is different. Things hardly change with your opinion (unless it generates profit or benefit for the company) and the system systematically prunes the free expression of ideas until everyone prefers to be quiet and keeping their own opinion. The accelerated growth of the company does not follow the career plan of all employees, you can spend a lot of time doing the same job and in the same function until you become a robot pressing buttons. If you don't tolerate sudden changes, processes that change or lose your co-workers overnight, this is no place for sensitive minds or hearts."
