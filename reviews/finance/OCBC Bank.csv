768,OCBC Bank,A review with good intentions,2021-01-08,2.0,Assistant Vice President,"1)	Stable job and good absolute pay. Management is compassionate enough to retain those who are lagging in performance.
2)	Colleagues can become friends. These include people who would weather the storm as a team.
3)	Compensation and benefits are competitive if there is time to make claims.
4)	Mr Tsien is a very personable CEO with an eye for business growth. He works harder and longer hours than many others.","1)	Organizational restructuring plans dished out with no clear focus communicated to employees. 
2)	Suggestion to middle management to pull their socks up. Knee jerk reactions to customer and user issues usually result in after office hours investigations and team discussions circling around with minimal progression. More focus should be placed on long term sustainability plans but this has been neglected due to day-to-day fire-fighting and limited resources.
3)	Heavy reliance on a few key employees has resulted in an imbalance of workload.
4)	Employees’ mental wellbeing taking a hit. Long hours (minimum 12 hours a day plus some weekends) are causing a toll on some employees and their families. There should be focus to improve the organizational culture after attempts to investigate and pinpoint to individual troubled employees.
5)	Department that is supposed to be at the forefront of technology has problem even obtaining basic working resources - laptop speed could be improved and delays in getting replacements when laptop has reached end of life. Hot desking concept implemented for a department for which people are expected to work quite frequently from office due to security and information access. Pen must be self-funded if needed."

Also, have to work weekends. You won’t see your family much. Your BM can also be extremely micro-managing. Customers are mad, sending in complaints that contain lies about you just because they are mad that they can’t get their problem resolved at their definition of quickest time possible (everything takes time and the staff here are already doing their best), and the management sides with the customer, EVEN when you can prove otherwise.

870,OCBC Bank,I hope everyone reads this before joining,2020-09-01,1.0,Associate,The salary and benefits are average. A good retirement ground (OCBC does not fire employees) - which leads to many people doing their minimal trying to past each day and things move very slowly.,"1. This place is a top-down dictatorship and at the end of the day, the person at the top decides it all.

2. The top person puts numbers in front of its employees - Which explains the high turnover in the department (average of 5 to 6 staff tenders in the period of 6 to 8 months as an executive role, multiply that by 2 to 4 times for sales staff) Every employee is seen as a number not human. You’re expected to sell your life to the company and work even after 12 am into the weekends and even on your leave. What’s the point of giving you so many benefits when you don’t have the life to use it?

3. No foresight (Root of all evil) The management here has no foresight and constantly wants to be first in everything, which is good but what’s the point if you don’t maintain your first-mover advantage and launch a product which is flawed? Agile means launching a product with it’s essential/critical features are ready and not launching a broken product and fixing it AFTER it is launched. That is why there is so much firefighting over here and it is honestly a vicious cycle. You’re just firefighting because of the flawed process/product you have designed/launch initially which made the workload heavier instead of lessening the burden. (Then you blame your people for not hitting the KPI). As much as the acquisition is important, do allocate some money for your retention team and don't expect solutions to be free - What's the point of having a good striker if your goalkeeper allows the other team to keep scoring? 

4. Listen to your experts – SCRUM Team is a team formed by specialists who are seasoned in their respective fields. You don’t design an entire system without input from any specialist but just a product manager just because you “Like/Trust” the PM and think that what you designed is what the customer wants with different officers calling you every day. Honestly, if I were a customer and you called me every single day just to ask me to accept your loan offer, I would go to a competitor bank with a more efficient service, better rates, and less irritating and seamless process. (Feels like I’m being nagged at by different teachers for the same homework every day) 

5. Honestly, this is one of the companies that still practice discriminatory hiring – E.g Why does a First-Class Honours Graduate and 2nd Upper get paid differently when other banks have already scrapped this practice? (FYI, Diversity is not included in its core values) 

Overall, I cannot express how disappointed I am with this company. When you work here, it just feels like everything is way behind time"

Limited budget for implementation and very bureaucratic process of identifying problems and rolling out changes or updates. There is always a continual pressure on sales staff to value add to a sometimes uncompetitive product and pricing: this in turn causes fatigue in the long run.

Direct superior tends to micro manage and have apparent biases among subordinates. It felt like I am back in my primary school day where I are supposed to report every single movement.

Vulgarities were used on subordinates as and when the superior thinks it is necessary. Such as late reply to superior after working hours.

Double standard can be seen between top management and middle management. Subordinates like me, had to adhere to middle management (cutting corners and meeting KPIs) while lying to top management that we are adhering to theirs (delivering quality to consumers).

Feedback to the top management is equally controlled. Subordinates have to go through with their direct superiors what they are going to say and what is allowed.
