2,,"Great company, horrible management",2022-04-08,4.0,Senior Personal Loan Specialist,"The company itself is fantastic. Great benefits, up to date with the times, they promote a lot of great causes, they support employees really well. Honestly one of the best companies I've been with.","Micro-managing from a certain district manager, to the point it almost makes you paranoid to work there. At one point me and my coworkers were almost certain that our office was bugged with a camera/audio device somewhere because there were a few incidents we would be discussing a situation and immediately get a phone call or instant message about that situation. Insanely intrusive questions were asked about personal situations. Pressure to work off of the clock (not allowed ANY overtime but made to feel like a bad employee if you didn't stay 30 minutes late or arrive 30 minutes early.) 
I honestly would have loved to stay with the company but I was not able to switch district's. 
There were several great people who I personally have known to leave the company because of this person, and the ones who stay, are miserable in this district. Other district managers thought this person's managing style was extreme."
3,,Good Benefits,2022-04-08,3.0,Senior Loan Officer,Good benefits and pto plan,Crazy policies and lots of drama
4,,Great Benefits,2022-04-03,2.0,Branch Manager,Vacation Time and Benefits are good.,Lack of branch control over the quality of loans that are booked in the branch and yet the branch is 100% responsible for the collections of those loans. Most of variable comp(commissions) are based collections.
5,,Good people,2022-04-03,4.0,Senior Quantitative Analyst (Risk Management),"Everyone I met while working their genuinely desired to make the company a great place to work, ensure that customers had the best possible experience, and ensure that business was conducted in a way that exceeded industry standards & expectations for ethics and performance.","Two things.

First: This was diminishing before I left. And the expectations varied, depending on which area you worked in. But there was still a significant unwritten expectation among many of the most influential senior leaders, and their direct reports, that if you weren't working extra hours, late nights, & actively engaged with your team(s) & projects during leave & holidays.... You were ""slacking"", and ""disengaged"". And if you held health boundaries about these things, it had direct impacts on your ability to advance your career, or even land a job on certain teams, where these unwritten expectations were the norm. If you asked folks in these areas about this directly, they'd find some other reasons to cite, and give lip service to supporting folks in keeping healthy work-life boundaries. But healthy work-life boundaries were definitely not the norm. The company tended to attract members to leadership roles, who were workaholics (in very unhealthy ways), and people who simply enjoy and dedicate their life to working, and don't really understand people that don't feel the same way.

Second: During my time there, the company was in a stage of significant growth. And the environment was beginning to shift from a fast, nimble, large start-up environment, with a lot of the amenities that keep the culture open, friendly, and enjoyable to a more corporate feel, where employees increasingly feel like they're just a number."

I worked on the Marketing team and originally joined as a contractor, but was fortunate enough to convert to a full-time role. What's incredibly exciting about OMF is that it's a company with a long successful history that is always striving to remain innovate, so there's no shortage of exciting work to do. It's also a very data-driven company, so if you're someone who is technical, you will thrive here. In addition, this company has some of the best leaders I've ever had the pleasure of working with in my career. They genuinely care about their team members and do everything they can to make sure that you feel empowered and supported in your role. The only reason why I left was because I needed to remain remote for personal/family reasons, but I strongly recommend this organization to anyone who is interested in joining an incredible team and amazing culture.","My only con is flexibility, however, I did hear that after I left, they announced that people can submit a request to remain remote, so this may not be an issue anymore."

37,,Think twice if you want a long career here,2022-02-25,1.0,Branch Manager,They have average or decent benefits.,High pressure from upper management that themself can not perform your job. Hours can fluctuate depending on how customers make payments but you are ultimately responsible for them not paying. No upper movement within the company due to constant restructuring reducing of senior management positions. Your district manager or regional manager will constantly change. This company will pay new hires more money than current team members that have been with the company for years. That alone should show you what they think of their people.

Company will pay for insurance licensing that you can go elsewhere with.,"Horrible with raises/salary increases (never offered cost of living increase in 10 years),employee appreciation has halted all together,  growing a company is one thing but leaving your employees out to dry is another. Branches/districts do not work as a team any longer.  I used to be so happy at Onemain for YEARS.. now unfortunately I'm going to look elsewhere.  Sadly, also 95% of my long time coworkers (10+ years of service w the company) have done the same!"
86,,Isn’t progressing with the times,2022-01-08,2.0,Senior Loan Specialist,"Great small office environment, stability.",Refuses to grow with the times for employees. We have continued to work in the office despite covid. No raise since 2016. Medical insurance costs increase yearly. No way to get promoted unless you have your life insurance license (even though we are a loan company not a life insurance company). Sales goals continue to go up every year making it increasingly hard to hit target so you can get a small bonus. Delinquency targets are hard to hit with no tools to help customers other than a deferment for which they have to pay half of payment for. They don’t want anyone working from home even though we close majority of loans online now. Work life balance is awful. I’ve been here over 10 years now and decided it’s now time to pursue other companies that are more conducive to work life balance needed with good raises given yearly and affordable health insurance.
87,,Good Entry level into Finance,2022-01-07,3.0,Senior Personal Loan Specialist,"Vacation, 401k match, & company stock discount,",Expect to work most Saturday Morning and late night without prior notice
88,,Consumer Loan Sales Specialist,2022-01-06,1.0,Consumer Loan Sales Specialist (),Federal paid holidays off. Location was near my home.,"Run the other way! Their interdepartmental communication is the worst I have ever experience in my professional career. I was sent home on my first day of work, MY START DATE, due to their negligence in their onboarding process. They had not conducted my background check in the two weeks they had after I accepted my offer up until my start date. Needless to say, I was sent home after being there almost 2 hours until my clueless Branch Manager could get in contact with my recruiter, who was in another region of the States. Their excuse was that they “have a lot of new hires in HR and they somehow overlooked my new hire prerequisites.” My start date was pushed back as they “expedited” my background/criminal/employment checks. I was told I was never cleared to start prior to my showing up on day one. 

The next issue was that it normally takes their IT department 2 weeks to get all “new users” in the system with employee ID numbers, etc. I was asked to return 5 days after and was a sitting duck doing absolutely nothing my first 3 days. I was asked to not really ask questions because that would slow down the other Consumer Loan Specialists and just observe. Once I was able to sign in and gain access to their 6 week online self-paced training modules I was yet again slowed down because the Manager didn’t have the time to meet me to do our end of week debriefs in a timely manner. I felt like I was being pushed to the back burner because the entire team was totally stressed out due to excessive delinquent accounts and the Manager consistently demanding that she needs XYZ number of loans before the end of day. The seasoned Loan officers were expected to bring in roughly $220,000 in new loans a month to get any incentive. They expect their Loan officers to perform at 150% to goal for the month. What is very discouraging to the seasoned Loan officers, from what they told me, is that they don’t get any incentive if the branch as a whole doesn’t meet the delinquent accounts quota. For example, a $2,000 incentive was reduced to $200 for not meeting the DQ requirements for maximum incentive. The whole company is a joke and their leadership (Managers, District managers and HR) do not communicate well. 

And lastly, their lending practices are shady. The Loan officers are trained to quote customers and persuade them to accept a secured loan, title loan, over an unsecured loan. It’s just bad business. If a customer has a loan at XYZ bank, the loan officer will see it on their credit report. A customer may only need a $3,000 loan but they will quote them a $20,000 loan and try to payoff their existing auto loan at XYZ bank and put a lien against their title. It’s just unethical and I personally would NEVER get a loan from OneMain Financial. They really pry on financially uneducated consumers and try to make a gain on it. 

Would not refer anyone I loved to this company for a penny….or a job."

You do have to work extra sometimes but it’s mostly your standards 9-5:30 mon-fri which was cool. My branch often bought lunch for us which was also nice.","Management is the biggest con here, now I’m sure this is a case by case depending on what branch you end up working in, but atleast with me my manager would expect too much from someone who was new, I caught covid my first week working there so I fell behind on things when I got back we were extremely short staffed. Manager often times would not let me study for my insurance exam saying there was work that needed to be done even though they pride themselves on giving you a good amount of time each day to do this. Instead I was told to maybe study at home unpaid. I won’t lie I sometimes asked a lot of questions but that is mainly because I was still new and wanted to make sure I wasn’t messing anything up or creating a negative client experience. Sometimes when asking a question my manager would make me feel stupid that I asked that as if I should have already knew everything in the books being there under 3 months. Management would also expect too much from you telling me I had a full months goal after I was sick from covid and out of the office for over two weeks, I was then also penalized for not meeting the unrealistic goal.

Another big issue I had was when said management would “underwrite” my loan by telling me there was a missing item and to call the customer. Okay that’s fine, but when I get the said document back the manager would then tell me there was something else missing. It would have been much more efficient and convenient for everyone involved to have just complied a list of missing items rather then pause when one thing is missing then go back and fourth. This happened time and time again and often I was the one who was blamed for the loan taking long to close.

My manager also would talk behind other employees backs sometimes granted it was never anything too bad or something I would classify as bullying, but as a manager you should be setting higher standards for your employees especially newer ones.

Lastly almost everyone on my team was constantly stressed and has expressed some sort of frustration to my manager both new and senior staff. The job is very high stress.

I would not recommend working at OneMain unless you maybe have a friend at a branch who can vouch for that manager."

I got Covid from work, and they were not happy about allowing me to be out for over a month. I got paid disability through the state. The amount that you have to pay for medical benefits including a $1500 deductible gets higher and higher every year. They choose cheaper plans every year. After you pay your deductible,You still have to pay 20% of all medical care. Increasingly higher goals every month which stresses team members to the brim. I could go on but I need to move on.

After coming from multiple companies that were poorly structured, OneMain has helped me see the big picture and what can be for my career moving forward. Management is always there to help, the training is thorough and off the charts not to mention the helping hand that your teammates lend you should you need assistance - truly feels like a family instead of a 9 to 5. The work to life balance is never an issue. Once you're in, you're in and once you're out, you're out. The culture is very much work hard play hard and you see the benefits of working hard on your pay check - when we play, we PLAY. The compensation makes the experience of being employed here that much better!","While in training it can seem a bit overwhelming because you're being fed a lot of information that may not make sense due to not being too familiar with the trade however once it clicks, it sticks and the sky is the limit. Training can feel like a long time especially without the opportunity to make commission right away but once you hit the ground running and are eligible for commission you truly start to see that you can make a phenomenal living for yourself.

There is a lot of push back from other departments when they are needed for certain things or if they are not doing their part up to par. The blame game is played a lot.

The customer is not required to take any optional insurance however when you don't sell enough to their standards they want a 3 page essay explaining why you couldn't sell the insurance and what you're going to do to basically make them take it. I've heard almost every single day the 4 years I've worked there ""There are usually 6 products you offer a customer. You can't tell me they didn't see a benefit in at least one."" If you do not meet your delinquency target they take 60%-70% of your bonus you worked very hard for. Collection practices are a joke and then wonder why you can't always hit delinquency targets. They treat new hires better than the people who have invested several years in their company. They didn't do enough for the customer during Covid. No room for advancement!

Training is required by the company but not by your manager.  The manager won't let you read the Training they just want you to sign off because you have work to do. You will not be able to build rapport with your customers because the co-workers will tell you not to have conversations with your customers.

 DQ not being a completely separate bonus from new money... so you work hard all month on new money and then it is gone because people won’t answer the phone…

 

 RD and DM not knowing 100% how apps are split among branches and them not being divided up among branches fairly.


 

 Always what you do wrong and not enough of what you do right.


 

 Call out employees in group emails(for example call tracking-if call tracking is low...speak to them individually).


 

 Short term memory loss- consistency doesn’t mean they get off your back about numbers if your low one month.

 

 A lot of BMs and DMs do not lead by example.


 

 Management doesn’t read notes....and therefore management makes mistakes constantly…but our notes have to be spot on or you are spoken too.

 

 Having good numbers to be promoted to DM or BM doesn’t mean you know how to manage.

 

 Pocket policies galore....and not consistent from district to district (I’ve been here 3 years and I am not allowed to second verify or approve loans since a new DM has been hired).


 

 Management constantly looking at numbers not the full situation…for example APP flow.


 

 Policies constantly change and typically make the job more difficult for a simple task and harder to hit your numbers.

It has somewhat of the bankers hours with some late nights and saturdays depending on how ambitious your branch or manager may be.,"Very political if you are wanting to be promoted. I have seen promotions based on how much management may like you. Education and experience does not matter much. 

It is a sales driven environment and under my prior management team, I have witnessed and endured unfair treatment if you are not performing well. I have also witnessed people being ridiculed by management. It's a very stressful environment at times and after my seven year tenure did not realize how much it took a tole on me mentally and physically. I performed well overall but was still under constant stress for more sales and collection efforts. This is due to the lack of great leadership and selfishness.

Pay is really competitive.,"In my few years of service, it becomes less and less about the people and more and more about making the company more profitable, including using Covid as an excuse to dramatically reduce the workforce, and then forcing our extremely short staffed branches to continue to meet regular goals as if nothing had ever happened."
433,,A Great Place to Work,2020-12-11,5.0,Branch Manager,"I have been with the company for over 11 years now and have worked in the states of Hawaii, California, Tennessee and Florida all the while supporting my husband's military career and the company has allowed me to transfer and keep stability and maintain my career while supporting his. With over 1500 branches in 44 states the company can allow stability for those in situations like mine or give you the opportunity to move and advance around the US with the company. I have met some great people while working for the company and each branch I've worked in feels like a little family.  Benefits are also very good. Vacation time is also very generous. New hires get a lot of time off the bat and tenured employees max out at 27 PTO days plus sick time. Full Health Insurance offered. 401K% Matching. The Variable Incentive Plan is also very generous for those willing to work hard and meet and exceed the monthly targets the company sets. While it's largely a sales gig there is a good base salary set  plus the monthly commissions that can be earned. The work life balance is also very good as work hours are only Monday-Friday with just some occasional Saturday work.",It's a production based environment so it can be stressful to meet goals at times but with every job or endeavor those things worth it do take a lot of hard work and dedication.
434,,Good company to work for.,2020-12-11,5.0,Branch Manager,If you have a strong work ethic and goal oriented this is the job for you. My manager is great. Solid bonuses.,"Occasionally, last of the month to help with month end numbers."

Having worked in finance for over 15 years I have held positions with a couple other finance companies and OneMain is the best by far. I have been with the company for a little over 4 years and have absolutely NO complaints. Management is trained to encourage work/life balance and does not make you feel as if you have to choose between your family and a successful career. Goals are set monthly, but very attainable if you are willing to put in the work. The benefits, paid time off, and compensation opportunities cannot be matched. OneMain is a huge company, but upper management always finds a way to make everyone feel important and appreciated.",I can’t think of any!

The company has always tried to react in a proactive manner. Putting customer’s and employees needs first, especially during this recent pandemic. The benefits and vacation time is great.

445,,Great Company,2020-12-08,5.0,Personal Loan Specialist,"There are numerous pros to working for OneMain. It’s a smaller environment, so one on one time is daily. I see this as a positive because it keeps me on track to get my job done. It helps with any questions I may have because I know I am not going to get lost in a “pile of people”; there’s always someone there to support me. On the same note, it also means that I have more independence to get my job done because any questions I have are answered quickly and I can move on. 

The benefits the company provides are absolutely amazing. They offer numerous benefit packages for health insurance and it doesn’t stop there! They have you covered for whatever may come along in your life from humans to pets! Vacation time is provided right away, there is also personal and sick days. When you pick your health insurance package you can choose something that fits your budget. It’s not “one size fits all”.

The incentive structure is placed fairly. Do your job, get rewarded. It’s that simple, and that easy to achieve.

There are set schedules for employees, but at the same time they offer flexibility. There is a very good work/life balance. I have to get an allergy shot every 3 weeks and I am always allowed the time to go get it no matter when I have to schedule it. (That’s just one example) They have also adjusted the hours of operations where needed to allow for adjustments for parents and school schedules during the pandemic. 

Communication between the “higher ups” and “regular employees” is great! With all the changes that we had to go through during the pandemic, we were never left in the dark. The company is very good with transparency.

For a company that is so big, they never treat you like just a number. They understand that we are individuals with families and if treated as such we will continue to do our jobs and keep the company growing.","One of the down sides is when you’re short handed because of the small environment, it can be overwhelming. I’m also not saying that my job is perfect. It’s hard and sometimes exhausting. No job is perfect, but you only get out if it what you put in, and I choose to work hard for me and for my family,"

I have worked for another finance company who really made you feel like the bottom of the totem poll and didn't appreciate all the hard work you put in.

474,,THIS PLACE IS AWESOME!,2020-12-01,5.0,Branch Manager,"This company has been amazing to work for. I am 24 years old who has become a Branch Manager within 3 years. I was hired on as a centralized call-center employee in London, KY, then moved to Michigan where I was transferred into a personal loan specialist position in the branches. When I moved back to Kentucky, I received a promotion to a District Loan Specialist where I was able to travel, meet people, and help out branches in need. Now, I am a Branch Manager with my own team to work with! Here is a list of pros!
- No matter what position you start in, there is ALWAYS competitive pay!
-This company is ever growing and has been in business since 1912! This is why I was able to transfer from Kentucky to Michigan with ease, because they care about their employees and are willing to work with them and keep them no matter where they move to!
-On top of competitive pay, we get bonuses! The company gives us a set of goals to hit and once we hit our targets, we get extra money just for doing our job! This is also paid monthly! You decide what your bonus is because the higher you hit above your targets, the more money you get!
-Vacation days, personal days, AND sick days EVERY YEAR! The longer you are with the company, the MORE YOU GET! Starting off, you get 15 vacation days, 2 personal days, and 5 sick days a year. THESE ARE ALL PAID! They also reset every year! No to mention, we get all major Holidays off and the company always does random competitions to get extra incentives where you can earn prizes, lunch, or even points to buy ANYTHING you'd like. I bought a 60 in TV- and all I did was hit my goals. 
I have been all over with this company. They have worked with me and shown me they ACTUALLY care about us, and I have not had that at any other workplace. 
We get benefits- Life insurance, Health insurance, Vision insurance, etc; .If you are a student, we have tuition reimbursement programs and discounts on colleges. ALSO! We are deemed essential, meaning we can remain open during anything that we may face!
Use this job as a stepping stool or a career. Either way, this is a great TEAM to be a part of. I don't regret the decision to join this team at all!
Look forward to working with you all!","No Major Cons. Work hours are 8:30-5:30 M,W,TR,F. Tuesdays we are open from 8:30-7 which could conflict with some people's schedule. HOWEVER; Managers can work with you if given advanced knowledge."

They do provide quite a bit of training for every position, and they seem to set their employees up for success.","While I am not technically a telemarketer, I would describe my job as a glorified telemarketer. It can be difficult hearing the stories of what people are going through during the collection calls. While OneMain does provide options to help its customers out, there does come a point where we cannot help them, which can be tough each day. It is an office job, so sitting all day is a part of life. We do get to walk back and forth when we have instore loan closings, but if you want to get your steps in for the day, you'll need to be active outside of work."

Management is also super intense about selling selling selling insurance insurance and more insurance. Sometimes targets are outrageously unattainable but they don’t care because if you don’t meet the target you don’t get a bonus. The company also has a sleezy feel to it with some of its practices.

 health or that of my family, commission drops every year, harder each year to hit sales/delinq target, since Springleaf took over, it has continued to get worse, year after year.

They are REFUSING remote access for employees to work from home. They want us to risk our lives to come into work. I spoke to HR, she said they are “waiting to implement remote access in a worst case scenario” 

What is a worst case scenario?? This company is literally waiting for its employees to die or for the government to physically shut them down before they will allow remote access.

The lack of humanity and compassion is appalling and disgusting.
I am currently using all my sick days to stay home. They said I could apply for “unpaid personal leave”  they said I could apply for “short-term disability”. 
My doctor told them I was a high-risk, and still they don’t care. They just keep making me jump through hoops and nothing is getting done. SHUT IT DOWN."

Base pay is very low for the industry. Quotas that they expect you to reach in order to receive any bonus/commission are extremely high, and are chopped up to 75% based on collections, leaving many employees to rely solely on base wages. Very little upward mobility within the company. 

With everything going on with Coronavirus, OneMain is further revealing their true colors. They are doing very little to protect the health of their employees, requiring everyone to come in despite there being a system in place to work from home. We are still dealing with customers face to face, exposing us employees and our families to potential carriers. The ones on the front lines are the ones carrying all the risk and the company is doing far far less than other financial institutions when it comes to employee safety."

Might as well not have policies/code of conduct. You can be a top performer your entire career and get NO WHERE because 1 person doesn’t like you or envies your success. Management can continuously disrespect you and treat you like crap but you can’t respond once in a negative manner or you get written up. Tenured employees are praised for their time with the company even when they can’t perform their daily job functions like properly collecting a delinquent account and rarely hit their targets. Individual bonuses rely on the branch delinquency so it is taken away when these said employees are repeatedly praised for showing up every day and not doing their job. Fellow employees can cuss you out and call you names and claim your racist but complaining to HR gets you in trouble instead of protected. They will promote who they like and not who deserves the position. Customers are not happy with the structure lately and you can’t be honest with them or your job is in jeopardy. Too much drama and lack of integrity by those who just show up versus those who double and triple their numbers. No respect for the CEO or Chief of HR. They are all a joke! Had to file FMLA to go to my daughters doctors appointment, btw she’s not old enough to drive. The list is too long.

639,,That as good as they make it sound.,2019-12-20,1.0,Loan Officer,You start with two weeks vacation and five sick days.,"When doing the interview the branch manager and the district manager paint a pretty picture of how much money you can make in bonuses and how easy the job is. You soon fine out it is a lie. They fail to mention that more then 75 percent of your bonus can be deducted, and in most cases a portion will. Most of the customers are really nasty, and you can often find yourself in a hostile environment.

Your bonuses are partially based on your ability to  handle the branch delinquency as a whole. The company is know for handing out high risk loans to customers with bad credit, meaning they're likely not to pay. This leads to an very stressful end of the month where everyone is trying to get delinquency under control. Your bonuses could be deducted by up to 75 percent based on branch delinquency.

The sales goals are ridiculous and everyone in your district has the same sale goal regardless of branch application volume. You are at the mercy of what branch your located in, how many other loan officer are in your branch that you have to share incoming loan applications with, and marketing. Many times nearing the second half of the month marketing would cut back making it impossible to hit your sales goal. Also you are required to hit a unit target, if you can't your bonues will also be deducted on top of the deduction from the branch delinquency. For example, your unit target is 30 for the month of June, that means you have to close 30 loans before the end of the month. If there are 5 loan officers in total in your branch and only 4 applications come in a day, your fighting with your co-workers for who gets an application. Keep in mind not every application that comes in qualifies, and will not count towards your sale goal. Many times I was in a situation where a bunch of application came in and not 1 would qualified based on customer income, ability to provide collateral etc. This leads to a very stressful and hostile work environment

You are also required to make collection calls. Customer are usually approve for interest rates between 27 an 30%. Often I have found myself on the phone with an upset customer in regards to the loan terms they signed for. Some customer are willing to lie and try to get you fire if it means they can save a dollar or skip a months payment. The company usually does not back you in these situation leaving you on your own to try to collect the money while simultaneously hoping that the customer does not lie when they  send up a complaint.  

When it comes to company work life balance the company is awful. The hours are 8:30 to 5:30 but you might be working  until 7 on Tuesday and/or Thursday based on what branch your in.  Also depending where the branch delinquency is you might be expected to work Saturday mornings making collection calls. They only provide 5 paid holidays. You will find yourself getting home just to wake up and come back to work the next day.

There is really no room for advancement. If your a loan officer, the only promotion that is available to you is that of branch manager.  Branch manager get paid salary and work long hours. The managers in my district would often be force to come in at 8 and leave pass 7, mostly because of branch delinquency. Several of my coworkers have turn down the promotion due to this one of many factors. 
While working there, no one in my branch liked it there. Most employees hate working there, but will not voice there disdain for the company past there branch manager. Sometimes it feel like the company is working against you to get out of paying bonuses to their employees."

648,,Don’t waste your time,2019-10-26,1.0,Personal Loan Specialist,PTO just don’t try to take any time off the last week of the month.,"You literally do the job of 5 people.  You spend your day harassing potential customers.  Online applications have to be called 3X a day for 3 days.  You also have walk in clients to deal with.  One of the questions asked is “How many autos do you have in your name” and “what kind of payment are you looking for”. These 2 questions will determine so much of the type of lob you are offered.  You are pushed to take a vehicle as collateral even if the client qualifies for an unsecured loan.  You basically tank the client in a loan and when they vehicle breaks down.  Clients are stuck because we have the title and unless you pay the loan off., you aren’t getting it back.  The asking of payment amount client feels comfortable with is used against them later to pack on insurances.  When client objects, you use their own words against them saying “you said  you wanted this payment and you have insurance coverages”.  In order to hit goal, you have to do 3 direct autos a month.  This is basically tanking people in loans.   We pay off current lien holder and give you extra thousands on top of that.  Don’t try and trade out of your car.  Nobody will pay it off.  We will rewrite your loan at a way higher rate and tell you how much we are saving you money by adding years onto your loans.  Twice a year we “skip a payment” by taking the first payment out 45 days, costing you fees and more interest.  You aren’t saving anything. You are restarting your loan. Customers are given a 10 day period after due date before a late fee is charges.  They have you calling clients ONE day after the payment is due to collect.  You take applications. Work them.  Sell the loan.  Do all verification and paperwork for the loan.  Close the loan.  Sell sell sell insurances.  Collect the accounts.  Solicit customers.  Run payments.  If you are lucky enough to hit goal you might get a bonus bit it’s almost impossible because your bonus gets cut if office delinquency isn’t in line.  Late nights and Saturdays are a given and you cannot take off work the last week of the month.  Save yourself a lot of stress and headaches.  Look elsewhere.  This place is lightweight predatory lending."

650,,"Great people, bad employer.",2019-10-14,2.0,Loan Officer,"Moderate health Benefits, great staff.","Unachievable bonus structure, expecting you to sell a majority of all unsecured loans written at state maximum. They dock your bonus for being more than one loan unit off the ridiculous goals, they also take even more away when customers who historically don’t pay, don’t pay. You work two weekends each month, and three or more in November, and June. You have no approval authority and no autonomy. The management structure allows for minimal advancement- there are no sidesteps to corporate or remote offices unless you live near a call center, or corporate HQ.  In the grand scheme of things you aren’t a person, you are your numbers. They structure the approval process in a deceptive way- and make bonuses emphasize secured loans- only offering secured products to a large percentage of customers- typically doubling their payment and rate. And they expect you to sell it.  They talk work life balance, but it’s all just talk."

If you are right out of college without a lot of options, I would recommend this job. Do not stay longer than a year or two, at which point in time you have the requisite experience to find a better paying position. Everything is becoming centralized and standardized.

697,,"Do you want to earn, or do you want a 9-5?",2019-05-24,2.0,Personal Loan Specialist,"The employer paid benefits are pretty good if you like that sort of thing. Medical, dental, vision, 401k with 6% match, paid time off. Hourly pay, banker's hours. Every once in a while, if you break company records for sales, you can wear jeans to work for a day.","The incentive pay is pitiful. If you make 150% of your goal, you might clear $200 as a bonus, and that's only if you manage to meet your branch's collections deadlines. Your Branch Manager, District Manager, and Regional Director will tell you that you have ""Unlimited earning potential. You control how much you make!"", but that couldn't be further from the truth.

You will be responsible for your branch's collections efforts, so you will not have a lot of time to cold call for solicitation. If you spend too much time on solicitation, your branch might not meet the collections goal, withholding up to 75% of the award you've earned.

Your collections targets are based on loans you did not write. If someone else in your branch wrote a bad loan so they can get an approval, it is your responsibility to make sure that customer makes their payments. I've never been a fan of stressing over someone else's mistakes.

Your incentive pay kicks in once you reach 100% of your sales target. The incentives team will set your goals too high, you will work hard, because you are charismatic and stress over deadlines and goals, and get paid crumbs for it.
If you want to have actual control over how much you earn, look at some of these other big companies, otherwise, just settle for your hourly.

No one communicates changes or expectations to you, or if they do, it's going to be generic and confusing with no follow up. All of that stuff should be covered in one-on-one training, but you'll be given a list of self directed online training sessions. 

If you don't already have modern sales skills, you're not going to learn them here. You could pick up the lessons they teach you on customer interaction in a book on selling used cars from the early 80's. The managers are actually proud of these outdated ideas and become very defensive if you suggest change despite proven performance. I would say there's definitely a boiler room mindset among them. This is true of everyone from the branch level, all the way to the top."
698,,"Great Job, if you are at the right location!",2019-05-24,3.0,Branch Manager,You will learn every facet of consumer lending - from underwriting to risk analysis.  Some of the people here are great to work with.,"Despite what the company says about training, facilitating a culture of teamwork  and providing an outstanding customer experience, the fact remains that this is a SALES job through and through. If you do not hit your minimum targets, you do not pass GO! You do not collect $200! You get no brownie points for doing your best, sharpening your skills, or even learning new ones. It is all about the numbers. If you cannot hit your targets, you are pretty much in career purgatory until you quit or you are fired. Of course, that is to be expected with any job. The difference at OneMain is that some employees excel, not because of their skills, but because of where they are located. If you are fortunate enough to work at a branch in an area with a favorable customer demographic that is conducive to OneMain's business model, you'll flourish and quickly move up the ranks into management."

What happened to let’s actually help the customer out.  But from a Business point of view I get it the recession is coming again . Having leverage for dq is important .

It’s ALMOST like your forced to  mislead the customer, but they say it’s your selling skills if you didn’t. “You didn’t sell it right”.
*They are a very cheap company when it comes to celebrating their employees. We are the front line fighters and deserve more than lunch and pizza. 
*The DMs have personal agenda. Terminate you existence or help you move up. If you’re not a favorite believe the worst is going to happen.
*Your opinion doesn’t matter and there’s not an open door policy. They says it does and they do, but it will come back at you.

Branch level employees will have a bleak future at this company in its current form. The CEO stated that he would address the high turn over at the branch level, this resulted in virtually everyone not getting a salary increase for 2019, despite inflation and the state getting a $ .50 minimum wage increase.

758,,Good starting point,2019-01-16,3.0,Personal Loan Specialist,"Depending on who is at your branch, it can be a really fun atmosphere. The job is fairly intuitive and asking how to do certain tasks is not a big deal. Learning how to navigate the loan origination/account system is fairly straightforward. Overall the job is something that you won't need much experience to perform well. Customer service is an area in which you'll be able to improve if you don't already have much of it.","The work-life balance can be trying at times. Recently the company has put more stress on delinquency than loan production. This involves making several calls to customers a day, even if they are only one day past due and still within their grace periods. The shift in focus means that loan specialists have to spend more time on making collection calls than working on loan applications. This in turn can bring on scrutiny from higher up where you are under constant pressure to perform better. Obviously if the emails from management are always telling employees that they are not doing well enough, then morale will continue to drop. 
Monthly bonuses are based on delinquency so even if you hit your new money goals then up to 75% of your bonus can be taken away. This is supposed to be an incentive to collect more payments. Being told the average bonus for a particular region is around $10,000-$13,000 annually and then only making a couple hundred a month is somewhat deceptive. 
Sometimes the management can be breathing down your neck but will not offer the correct assistance to help you perform better. It is also difficult to move upward in the company."

- Benefits were ok
- Monday through Friday","I knew 2 weeks in that I had made a mistake accepting this job offer. OneMain is a mess of a company in which sexism and favoritism runs rampant, something that branch-level employees of both genders will attest to. The company takes pride in their ""diversity"" and their ""management training program"" for branch members, and backs those claims by filling that program with white men who, more often than not, are relatives or acquaintances of someone higher up in the company. Interesting how that works. Sales goals are constantly made harder and harder to achieve, accompanied by an ever-lurking feeling of anxiety and stress as your job is consistently threatened each month by management. Commission checks are directly affected by the number of delinquent accounts in your branch, so even if sales goals are achieved you will lose up to 75% of that bonus if customers are not making payments on their loans. Don't worry though! Someone who is making 6-figures will hold a conference call to explain to you why you should be ok with losing money, all while none of their pay is being docked. Speaking of delinquent customers, each branch member is given a list of delinquent customers and is expected to call each of these customers (anywhere up to 50 of them) 5 to 7 times A DAY until they answer. OneMain claims to care about work-life balance for branch employees but continues to add more days that employees are expected to work late and more Saturdays that they're expected to spend away from their families. To top it all off, the computer system manages to go down almost weekly. This is not a company that you want to work for. In the words of Admiral Ackbar, ""it's a trap!"""

Work life balance here is a myth- pressure to collect on delinquent accounts -plan on even less balance and last minute weekends!"
773,,Shadow first!,2018-11-06,1.0,Personal Lending Specialist,Job responsibilities were pretty straight forward.,"I was told when I interviewed they are open late Tuesdays and occasionally would have to work a couple of hours on Saturdays. Once I started, I found there were also occasional Thursday late nights and the last day of the month the whole office stays late. It made the schedule more unpredictable in that it wasn't the same week to week. The BIGGEST con is after I left, I found out your health insurance is cut off the day you no longer work there which was never once mentioned to me while employed, when I put in my notice, or in the two weeks that I continued to work after giving my formal notice. Thos caused an issue with billing since everywhere I have ever worked kept benefits active through the end of the working month. When speaking with HR and Benefits, I was told this is just their policy and the info was available on their intranet and there was nothing I could do. Also, after starting work I spoke to people in two separate offices and everyone outside of management hated it there. I recommend speaking with employees at the location you will be working with prior to joining."

786,,"Needs Serious Guidance, and an Audit!",2018-09-23,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"absolutely zero pros, see below as to why","1) no work-life balance; there are multiple late nights each and every month and don't think you get free weekends, because you work Saturdays too... and neither one of these is truly beneficial to keep you from kids and family but the company couldn't care less
2) Goals are absurd; it is one thing to have goals, but God forbid you work your butt off and come a little short one month and all of the sudden, you're in the ""hot seat"". Goals should be a stretch but attainable, not the company standard
3) The goals put so much pressure on branches that district managers say it's okay to work in the ""grey area"" even though some things are clearly against policy, but since its SO important to meet the goals, people do it any way.
4) ZERO JOB SECURITY, no, I did not get fired by any means, I was actually rather successful, but as stated earlier, no matter how good you are, you are not valued by any way shape or form.

787,,Pays Well But Not Worth It,2018-09-07,1.0,Branch Manager,"They pay a very competitive wage when including potential bonus and commissions, especially at the Branch Manager Level.","Everything else.  High pressure sales environment.  High pressure collections.  They pretend you shouldn't pressure the customer into insurance sales in addition the the loan products,, but that is what was actually expected.  

Every day is a new day, every month is a new month.  It doesn't matter how well today went, when you walk in the door the following day you are back to zero and have to do it all over again.  And if you don't, you are harped on repeatedly.  Finish with a great month?  Well on the 1st of the following month the counter resets to zero and you have to do it all over again or you are barked at repeatedly.  Nothing is ever good enough, they are always pointing out your deficiencies to offset any positive results you may have achieved.   

To make matters worse, the system never works.  Literally daily.  Whether it be the intranet, the customer account system, email, phones, etc.  Something ALWAYS didn't work.  And at the worst time.  High pressure collections at month end - not a big deal if our phones quit working for half the day.  Bonus is tied to collections and loan performance, so when you can't perform either one of those activities effectively it affects your pay.  

Changes were also a constant.  It was under the guise they were trying to improve the system/processes, but after any system update either 1) the update didn't work right, 2) the update caused some other function not to work right, or most frequently 3) both 1 and 2 occurred simultaneously.  It was near impossible to stay up to date on current policies and procedures as they would change daily, and often times different departments would operate under different sets of guidelines.  Making navigating your day in and day out activities a challenge because at any point you could be told you were doing something wrong, when the change was never actually communicated to you.

Terrible work life balance.  As a manager you were expected to essentially live there."
788,,Good Start Job,2018-08-29,4.0,Loan Specialist,work/life balance is great. I see so many people on this site complaining about it. The maximum you can work is 44 hours per week.

789,,"Excellent compensation, benefits and opportunity for growth",2018-08-27,4.0,Branch Manager,"over the years I saw this company go through a lot of changes, but they never lost focus of what was important, their team members or customers. No one was ever treated as a number and they looked for ways to give back to the community.  It was not a job, it was a family. Compensation and Benefits were excellent and the incentive based program gave the team members the potential to earn  more by simply meeting their monthly goals. Upper management dedicated a lot of time and effort in order to improve the communication with the branches so that everyone could be informed of all the changes taking place.","After the companies merged, policy changes happened on a weekly basis, work life balance became almost non-existent ,  working late nights and Saturdays became the norm . Your job was threatened if your goal was not met, Upper management lost track of how the team members  were treated within the branches.  The environment  went from a family atmosphere to total chaos. Team members would be reprimanded for spending time getting to know their customers and were considered ""time wasters"".  It became a goal oriented company that the only thing that mattered were results and not the behavior  and attitudes of the people working there.  The turnover became the highest I saw in the 10 years working there, 6 out of 10 managers in my district alone were gone  by the time I left, making me #7."

I felt Jay and Brad saved the company and then I just felt totally let down when OM was put in charge."

Fair 401k match.,"Onemain used to be the best employer I have ever worked for.  NOT anymore. Since the merger with Springleaf, the direction of the company is in absolute chaos.  Lower management has no idea what direction they are going to be pulled next, and are of zero help with the new policies and constant changes.  
Helping customers used to be the trade off for the absurd interest rate.  But with the pressure to push customers into high interest vehicle loans, even if they are adamant that they are not interested in an auto loan, the best interest of the customer has been absolutely abandoned.  This company is officially into predatory lending.  Employees are threatened with job loss if they tell management that refinancing a customers 3% auto loan into a 24% auto loan feels slimy.  
They have also removed free deferments as an option to help the customer that some of our accounts have been accustomed to for the last decade.  No one at corporate will take a customer call about this though, it's all on the branch staff to be abused. 
As an employee, the worst part has been the ambiguity of what portion of policy is being enforced and what isn't.  When you finally find something in one of the various overlapping and conflicting policy manuals they have, you soon learn that you aren't doing it right because that policy has been changed but not updated, or is just being ignored across the company.
Health insurance is horrible.  They have mandated a freeze on overtime- but are still expecting the same amount of work completed (with vague orders like, ""whatever it takes"").   
The incentive structure has been tweaked to encourage dishonesty.
There is zero consistency in underwriting guidelines across the same city, let alone the company.

1013,,Senior Personal Loan Specialist,2017-04-07,1.0,Senior Personal Loan Specialist,Hardly any. Jeans on Fridays. Good amount of vacation/sick time. 401k matching dollar for dollar. Birthday gifts. Profit sharing bonus.,"Let's start with work/life balance:

- In your job interview, they tell you only the last Saturday is required to work....but EVERY SINGLE SATURDAY is threatened to work if delinquency targets are not met. You'll never know about the Saturday work until 530pm on Friday. 

- Late nights until 7pm every Tuesday & mandatory early morning Thursday meetings. 

- Even though the hours of operations say 530pm is when you leave, it almost never happens. Your manager will threaten if you aren't through delinquency lists or not enough loans are closed to stay late. 

- The overtime that you will get WILL be limited and cut back. You will have to compensate overtime by coming in LATE, never by getting to go home early. 

- When I started employment, I had my mortgage loan closing scheduled for the last day of July.....the district manager told me to call my mortgage lender to reschedule my loan closing.....

- I'm getting married in November, which is Customer Appreciation Days (our biggest push of the year). In order to get just 5 days off in that month, it had to be approved by the district manager. I am unable to take a honeymoon after my wedding because of this...meanwhile other employees in my office received 2 FULL WEEKS OFF in other months without question or push back. 

Next is compensation:

- Pay is worthless. You are asked to do more than you are compensated for & management counters your arguments with ""bonus & commission"" comments. The bonus structure is flawed because your full bonus is cut my 50% if delinquency standards are not met. Which in the 3 years I've been employed has never ever happened. I've never received a full bonus.

- Until this year, you were able to earn commissions on EVERY non-credit insurance policy you sold. Now, you have a MINIMUM $15k threshold that must be met before they pay you on your commissions BUT....management doesn't have that same threshold. Your manager & upper management gets paid on YOUR INSURANCE SALES but you don't. 

- If you miss one month's goal, you might as well kiss your chance at a raise and promotion good bye. They will ask you to go to other branches to help out, train new employees, and various other tasks that will deter you from meeting your goals but will not take that into consideration. 

- I was sent to Lawton for 3 months to train employees. Sent to Bartlesville for 2 months to help fill in  for a sick manager and when it came time for my review, I was told you need to improve my numbers. When standing up for myself and saying that I've done what you asked of me and still hit my numbers an adequate amount of times, I was told then maybe you shouldn't have travelled.....

- You can only make up 2 hours of sick time per week, so heaven forbid something drastic happen to you. Don't plan on being able to save your sick time. 

Let's move to potential of growth:

- I was transferred to Edmond to train a new manager that was hired off the street for 5 months, then transferred to OKC to be interim-manager for 4 months while their manager was on maternity leave, and was sent to Lawton for 3 months to train a 4 month old employee, who eventually got the manager position there. When I asked upper management why I haven't been promoted, I was told ""i wasn't quite ready yet..."". How can you be ready to TRAIN NEW MANAGERS, FILL IN FOR MANAGERS, and TRAIN NEW EMPLOYEES THAT BECOME MANAGER, but not ready to be one yourself?!

- The raise I received for 2017 was $370 ANNUAL RAISE. This is the year we've worked the most hours, been asked to do the most, and I was slapped in the face with a $0.15 cent raise....

Those are just three of the most important categories that I care to speak about."

When you tell management in advance you have military orders to be somewhere, they do not work with you to approve an extra day off. They throw HR lingo in your face when in reality they are being petty and want to flex their power. If they really care to retain employees this would not have even been a discussion. However, They will actually proceed to interrogate you about what you are doing (all via text message I might add, they refuse to call you for anything important) and then they think that they can tell you how to go about YOUR time off. That was a real treat. The hiring process sucks. You have no employee access to anything for over a week. So no access to your work email, time click nothing until you (yes your yourself) have to blow up the IT department only for them to give some shady internet link to some how get you to where you need to be. Not to mention to find out their ""top or more veteran employees"" have not even gone to be certified to sell insurance, the most top paying product to sell. So you can imagine to my surprise that this so called sales based company doesn't encourage or empower their current employees to go and get the bigger bucks. Just an all around joke."

They wanted a temp but wanted somebody with more experience than a typical temp.  So they hired me, got me to do what they needed, and then immediately got rid of me again.  I've been paying attention, they're not even trying to fill that position again.  It's crazy.

This place used the heck out of me and now I'm scrapping by, trying to find another job, when I could still have been back at my old job and doing fine.  I can't imagine a worse possible job experience than this.

I was recruited by OneMain to be a Branch Account Manager, and I had anticipated a long and successful career with this my 4th employer. During the first couple of months of full-time employment I was trained and permitted to do very very little -- primarily processing monthly payments, completing credit  financing applications, and otherwise phoning late payers every day, day after day. That was all I was permitted or trained to do. After almost three months of full-time employment I was told I was not a good fit for the company and was summarily fired. While I consider my entire experience a learning experience, I feel that otherwise it was a HUGE waste of my time.

If your in the club, you could do whatever you wanted, if not ?? Look out. Management was not very helpful either. I had a situation where I needed a manager. The only one I found advised me that they were at lunch and couldnt assist me. In over 30 years in the business (25 as a manager) I've NEVER heard a response like that. There is a strict cell phone policy, which I understand and agree with, however dont deliver that message to your group as your cell phone is going off with text after text and excusing yourself from the reprimand to answer those texts. Also, the leadership at OneMain seems to think the workplace is some sort of dating service and will show you pictures of your female peers in compromising positions. This isnt a call center, it's a joke. As they take advantage of their customers that have little to no income, find themselves in desperate situations, and have no business taking a loan with 40% interest, they also do that with the people they hire. Desperate out of job people who are under qualified. They know like they do with their customers, they can write off their employees as well. Sad but true"

You do well one month, not so well the next month and they have you wondering if you still have a job. If you don't reach your goal, be it daily or weekly you are punished by having to work late (7pm) or even come in Saturdays to make collection calls. Being new is a huge disadvantage. The older workers have most of the good businesses set up already and most long term customers only want to talk to them. Then management looks at you and asks why you can't produce loans!"

I can't remember how many times I was told not to do a loan less than  $1500, because it wasn't worth it to the company. I wasn't even allowed to take an application if it was only for $500.Even tho sometimes that is all the customer could afford to pay back.

Read the review regarding being a horrible place for women, it's totally true, women are just notches on the bedpost for a select group of male employees.

My manager made it abundantly clear that it doesn't really matter, its great for them because they get to come in later and they're still salary so we'll figure it out. The loan do not help most customers, they are ""sold"" to customers who are already into debt a ridiculous amount.  Another way we ""sell"" loans is by ""refi and cash out"" aka giving more money to people who are behind to catch their current account up, boost our sales, and then restart their interest.  The customers have NO idea what pre computed means, even after its explained, they don't realize that their initial payments mostly go to interest, so paying it off in half the time doesn't save them as much as they would think. The insurance products we sell are a SCAM.  Someone who does not have a car on their loan and is the only person on the loan, does not need 2k in credit life insurance on a 5k loan.  This is ridiculous.  They are financing credit insurance products that sometimes double the amount of their loan... thats just dumb. On to the managers, they do whatever they feel they want to do.  My manager personally has her spouse call several times a day, to the point i have their phone number memorized.  My manager would have their phone out the entire day, but forbid us from even checking our phone throughout the day.  My manager was constantly texting or on the phone with friends, other managers, spouse, etc. UNLESS someone like our DM, ADO or anyone from corporate was there.  Also, the micromanaging is intolerable.  I still do not know how to do somethings in CLASS due to my manager just doing it for me, yet getting angry when I do not know how to do it.  Favoritism is shown the entire time, to a point someone left our office with that being the reason.  I can't really complain about this I was one of the ""favorites"" so I exceeded my goals each and every month.  You have to work Saturdays, but to ensure you do not get over 37 hours, you will have to ""comp out time"" and come in late just so that they do not have to pay you overtime.  This is just an overall avoid if you can at all. If you cannot avoid, you will wear many hats.  Some of those include:  Lendor, Insurance agent, Debt Collector, Counselor, Bounty Hunter (you will work up repos), make all of your files, Cold Call, etc.  Just be prepared for your day to be hectic and you will not get everything done.

My manager at one point knocked on a full-time employees bathroom door wondering where she was. I also saw this manager heckle and put down all of the employees and always being disappointed in performance when there was nothing other employees could have done. 
Just recently I put in my two weeks because I received a better job.

Human resources is centralized so there is little to none ability to state your case for a raise.  This job really doesn't allow for raises, the only way to increase your salary is to pursue a management position.  Also, most of the in-branch human underwriting aspect of the job, which is enjoyable is being overtaken by computer based determinations which are flawed and are based off of percentage generalities.

For one, it is low-budget and outdated on technology. Maybe the result of being in Citi Holdings for the last several years? It is also extremely disorganized. Too many different tasks are assigned to each individual, making it difficult to have any clear idea of what specifically one's job is. Each branch account executive/ branch account manager/ branch manager trainee is expected to not only issue personal loans to customers, but also spend half of their day making collection calls to delinquent customers that they issued the loans to. On top of that, you're expected to perform office administrative tasks. I've never seen a company structured this way. There should be a much clearer division of labor; i.e. appointing all of these unrelated, time-consuming tasks to different job positions. The most surprising task is managing the cash drawer. In this day and age with all of the electronic methods of payments available it's shocking that a lending institution with the customer-base as large as OneMain's would expect employees to stop everything they're doing every time a customer walks into the office to make a cash payment. Being on the cash drawer alone can take up more than half of one's day which leaves little or no time for the other mandatory tasks that management insists get done. It could have possibly been a workable system if each branch were actually a bank branch with tellers alongside loan officers.  Similarly, the system of collections on delinquent accounts could have possibly been a sensible one if there were a separate collection department. However, the company would clearly rather cut costs on labor than hire enough people to evenly distribute the workload. Hopefully the structure of the business will undergo much necessary changes over time with the current merger with SpringLeaf. But as of now, I wouldn’t recommend employment there."

Citi main goal and focus is to invest a lot in their training and development team, which helps with personal growth and career development.","A typical day at work includes constant reminders that you are expendable and can be replaced.
What I learned is that I cannot work for Citi because of their low compensation rates. The company has a severe lack of real talent mostly because they refuse to compensate employees with market rates. So people move on to other jobs that pay them what they are worth.

The goals are constantly changing as management keeps increasing them to meet business profitability requirements. The Feds keep a tight leash on this industry because of questionable business practices. They have received many fines over the years for packing loans with unneeded credit insurance and other products. The Feds should leave the Finance Companies alone because nobody else will give these losers a loan.

After having enough, I consulted with my District Manager and informed him of all issues, he basically just fed me the typical lie of ""I'll look into it"" and that was that. Even while my DM was in our office the AM & BM would be doing exactly what I explained to him they were doing and he would not notice it(ignore it).  Understand that this company has multiple internal audits done in their branches, therefore, if your branch or co-workers are not following the rules and get caught, they then fail the audit and if your branch fails an audit you go 6 months without bonuses!!! Basically if your co-workers or managers choose to break the rules YOUR salary will pay the price!

I have witnessed both AM & BM talk to our customers in the most condescending manor, ridiculing them, and basically strong arming them to do things that they shouldn't in order to make a loan, or collect an account. IE: telling customers to not pay certain bills to pay us, telling customers that they will not work with them because the customer didn't answer our calls, screaming at customers, cursing at customers, speaking inappropriately about co workers to the customers, slamming phones on the table if a customer cant hear them clearly, or having customers fax documentation, identification, pay stubs, proof of housing etc, days after closing the loan(you have to verify this info BEFORE closing the loan). 

As for work flow, I was progressively given more administrative tasks(paper work) and virtually no time at all to solicit new customers. I spent the majority of my day making collections calls and be advised that you will not see ""collections"" listed as part of the job duties on their employment ads. 

As for the pay, a bill collector makes on average $15/hour with a Loan Officer making about he same. You can go do those jobs and only have to do those jobs individually, or you can work for OneMain Financial, do BOTH of those jobs daily, and get paid anywhere from $1-$3/hour less.....that's 2 jobs for less pay than 1.  

At the end of the day I was let go due to my ""sales numbers"" I guess anybody can be the judge and see if it was the employee not doing their job, or maybe it was the environment, constant beat downs, abusive attitudes, or poor delegation of work that essentially sets someone up for failure by having them file files, or do paper work, or account maintenance all day instead of soliciting, or making them feel as if they're walking into an execution as soon as they walk into the office to begin their day."

1383,,Branch Account Representative,2015-02-19,1.0,Branch Account Executive II,People I worked with every day were great.,No ability to move up.  The benefits and compensation are a joke.  Management did several things that were illegal and blamed people blow them.  But they lost their jobs.  Company is out of touch with its customers and its employees.  All they car about is the money you put in their pocket.  It is a bad place to work and I would not recommend them to anyone.
1384,,Good Management Experience,2015-02-19,2.0,Anonymous Employee,The Management Training Program was good for someone early in their career.  Advancement opportunities are plentiful and it can be a fun team environment.,Upper Management was sometimes out of touch with what is going on in the current economy.  Sometimes the loan goals were not realistic because we couldn't get approval for the core candidates that we marketed to.
1385,,Good place to work,2015-02-11,4.0,Personal Loan Specialist,"Good incentive programs, relaxed environment, good vacation perks, management is considerate","Some office policies are time consuming that are out dated and not needed, base pay is not on par with other similar titles, the job is more like 3 job titles in one and do more work for less pay"

You cannot have an opinion that differs because you'll be told you're wrong and don't know how to do your job. I repeatedly tried to make my supervisor aware of situations,  but was told that I overreact,  am too hard on my employees, etc, all while they were doing things they should not have been, but I wasn't allowed to ever express any dissatisfaction with other employees. 

You will be told to do something, but if it doesn't turn out right, your boss will deny he ever told you to do that. Even if others have heard the same conversation and verify you are right, you will be told you're wrong, insulted, and made to feel worthless.

I have been told that I had the mentality of a sixth grader for not wanting to break policy. To the point where I have been forced onto a conference call with a customer completely in the wrong, and then not supported my management because they're so afraid of getting a complaint, regardless of how wrong the customer is. Makes you feel like an idiot. I've been told to give a customer whatever they want to go away. 

I was continually asked if I wanted more kids while I was pregnant, then on my second day upon return from leave, was told by my direct supervisor that if I didn't request a demotion,  he would have me fired because I was unable to manage with two kids, and a husband to take care of. I tried to fight back but was basically told there was no use, then forced to quit within the month. 

He accused me of things I did not do, said he had evidence but I was never allowed to know what it was. Because in reality he made it all up.

I don't know why they have policies in place because you're forced to break them.  You're protected if you're higher management regardless of the number of times you just illegally harass or discriminate.

Oh, and I can't even tell you the number of candidates that were turned down for their age. I had a VERY highly qualified candidate who was in his 50's and was told that I had to turn him down because he was too old and we just don't hire that type of person (""type"" meaning over 25). I was only allowed to hire young, fresh out of college kids who had no work ethic, rather than someone with 10 years experience. 

Twice I know of people who were told they had positions only to have the offer pulled because the DM just changed his mind after they'd turned in 2 week notices at their other jobs."

Top producers can be achieving all their personal goals and still be forced to work overtime, come in early, work late and forced to work weekends due to other employees lack of production which causes ""branch numbers"" to fall behind. Requesting a day off is like asking for a raise. They prefer you request time off 3 months in advance, told you are not allowed off end of month and around holidays ""due to business needs"" yet branch managers and positions higher always seem to get that privilege. The work/life balance the company promotes is a crock. Your children's graduations whether it be kindergarten or High school, your wedding anniversary, birthdays,  trips out of town, well, you better work that around one main financial's schedule. One of my parents passed away while I've been employed here and my manager was asked by higher ups if I planned on taking full week allowed off or if I was coming back early and If I was required to stay any longer before my maternuty leave, I would have given birth right there at my desk I'm sure."

It was very rewarding to help those in need.,"Charging extremely high interest rates (i.e. 36% apr on $1000 loan) was different to present to potential customers.

Additionally, I was pushed to push products on customers who didn't want the products, even if you offer the product in a great way, and the customer says ""No Thank you"" I was taught to keep pushing the matter. They teach you to cross the line. Additionally, in my interview I was just told about giving loans to customers, not about constantly calling people who have not paid their bill."
1418,,Horrible Company to work for,2014-09-15,1.0,Branch Account Manager,The only pro is that you have employment and are earning an hourly wage.  You get full benefits that are too expensive but cover what they should.,"I will first start with MONEY.  I will give a specific example:  I worked very hard and closed $106,305 in loans for one month.  I earned a bonus of $315 for all that hard work.  Do the math...that means I earned 0.29% commission on loans closed.  ALMOST three tenths of one percent.  That is rotten.

MANAGEMENT - ""I am a salaried employee so I don't have to work a full 40 hours per week.""  Verbatim what my manager told me.  She would show up 2 hours late and leave early every Friday and take 2-3 hour lunches.  The managers sales quota is much smaller because they have to do other ""business related tasks.""  Salaried positions are not designed to work 30 hours per week, more like 50+.  That would be the idea behind being a salaried employee.  Not here.

DISTRICT MANAGERS AND HR - Do not trust these people.  They will stab you in the back as soon as they can.  Employees such as myself, I was a branch account manager (BAM) are expendable and they will do what ever they can to bail out the Branch Managers.  

THE JOB ITSELF - After stepping off my soap box I will give you an idea of what you are actually doing.  The job itself is horrible.  You are forced to solicit the same group of people every month.  So if you have a loan with OneMain Financial, you will get called 2-3 times per month and asked if you need more money.  So you have to basically call the same group of people every month and see if something has gone bad in their lives so they need to borrow more money.  

You are doing loans for people between 25% - 28%.  If you borrow $6,000 the customer will pay back about $11,500.  Do you feel good about yourself doing loan for someone at that rate who is on a fixed income?  Someone is getting rich and it isn't you.

My advice, look for a better job with a more ethical company.  They (CITI)  has been trying to sell the company for the last 6+ years.  It will come and you will lose your job."

Well...monthly goals are set so high that it's nearly impossible to reach them. Even after I met them, my bonus came to be $14 after taxes!

Very repetitive- each day can be the same routine again and again. Every day, first thing you hear is ""make sure you get on those calls!"" I don't know about you, but if I was a customer, I wouldn't want to get a call at 8:30 in the morning asking if I need more money. 

No focus on ""what's best for the customer"". It's just ""upsell them & get those insurances!""

Management lacks leadership skills and changes their ideas/standards a lot. One month you'll have to keep a list of past due accounts you've collected. After month's end, they decided they ""didn't need it"". Well, thanks for wasting my time. Next month, we'll have to try something else that isn't going to work. 

Poor training- 2 weeks of training in a different office, watching what they do, and reading the online manual just doesn't cut it.

Too much pressure to sell the insurances. It's not that I don't have ""enough experience"" in sales (after working over 7 years in it), it's the fact that the insurances can add up to $90 on your monthly payment, so if I was the customer, I wouldn't take them either.

You are penalized for taking vacation time as it has a direct impact on your goals and bonuses. Most employees lack respect for their customers and can be down right rude.  Favoritism has a great presence in the company and morale is terrible. The work is a joke and underwriting is inconsistent. Bad loans are made to reach goals and you spend the next 8+ months trying to collect delinquent accounts.  It is a poor business model. Lend money and when the customer doesn't pay, offer to lend them more money. There is no room to bring new ideas in.

Credit insurance is overpriced and over-pushed. There are company policies in place to keep customers from completely being taken advantage of regarding the insurance, but a lot of time is spent teaching you how to work around those rules at the local level.

Where to start. You need a degree for a rep position, but it's completely unnecessary. A monkey could do the work. The work is just taking applications over the phone and in person. If you don't have an application, you are supposed to call people who are late paying or call current and former customers to try to get them to borrow more money - repeatedly. Needless to say, most people don't appreciate constantly getting phone calls, even after telling the company no - but if you stop calling you get in trouble.  And you get ridden constantly on your lending and delinquency numbers.

District managers don't care.  I know of a DM who literally screamed at a coworker in the middle of the office because she took a week off to be with her daughter in the hospital and didn't hit her loan goal because of that. They will move an employees home office without any notice, and they don't care about the distance. And most don't even know how to take a loan application.
Managers don't have to do anything except hang around long enough to get their positions - that means they don't have to be intelligent, friendly, qualified to manage others. Being a manager does not mean much though; you do the same work but just have to make sure that 2-4 others do theirs. And even then the pay is not great. Coworkers are alright, but that varies from location to location. In my experience most employees do not like the job at all, but can't find a local job they want to switch to. Sadly, if you're with the company too long you're basically stuck.

Career opportunities are basically non existent. You can move from financial rep to manager after 2 years IF another manager leaves (usually at least 8-12 people waiting for that one opening) and managers basically have to wait for a dm to retire to hope to be promoted (again probably 8-12 within any given area just waiting for that one spot to open). No corporate opportunities either.

And don't expect a raise - the company eliminated those a year ago, even though current salaries are very mediocre. There are some reward programs if you do enough new money volume for the month, but it's not any amount that's significant. Bosses will tell you if you want a raise, you need to sell ancillary products on top of loans (overpriced, low value term life insurance and auto plans similar to AAA), for which you get an average of $10 for each one sold. Again, nothing significant.

Finally, the company is archaic, especially technologically. They only have internal email. There isn't any internet access except for switchboard.com. Not able to process payment by credit or check card. No voicemail, not even any hold music. I'm surprised they don't still make employees use type writers."

opportunity to make a lot of money on commissions
generally easy job
generous with time off","collections
employees held responsible for circumstances out of control
too much favoritism
upper management will tell employees what they want to hear with no intention of following through
unrealistic goals
little opportunity for advancement unless you stay there for 15+ years or get promoted to Manager in training and agree to relocate to one of 3 districts
