Maybe it looks good on your resume?,"Just google “PIMCO news” and you’ll see discrimination lawsuits, sketchy foreign investments, toxic work culture, etc. The place will implode soon simply because they can’t hire people at the rate they’re losing people.

40,,Toxic culture- bait and switch to relocate-  not worth it.,2021-12-22,1.0,Vice President,"They make an effort to hire smart, motivated people…","I mean they really, really make an effort. I think they put so much $$$$$ into hiring new talent from anywhere that isn’t Newport Beach that they must have forgotten about developing or compensating their own. 
Once someone steps inside PIMCO, especially in Newport Beach, it’s a toxic environment unlike any you’ve ever experienced before. It’s poison. No matter how hard-working or how driven you arrived, you realize you must earn your keep now. The team knows you were an expensive hire and you’re going to pay for it. The inefficient systems and practices begin to take a toll on anyone not wired to push paper in a tie for 10-12 hours a day without actually accomplishing too much of anything at all. But that FaceTime is what mid-management loves to see. 

There is no accountability, no ramifications for ineffective leadership, no team building. Managing people isn’t valued it’s dealt with. Innovation comes to die where there’s a lag in technology and a constant deficit in staff. There is no career development. Management can’t be bothered to think strategically for a year, let alone a quarter or even a month! 

Attrition is astounding and I think it will continue until there’s some accountability and perhaps a place other than Glassdoor to provide feedback to the person who’s responsible for your success at this firm. The person who’s supposed to be leading this team."

Work-Life balance is great, as I do not work after hours, especially due to overtime being monitored very strictly.","Beware of nepotism within the client billing department. Management will never care enough to listen to lower-level employees' concerns regarding management. Management can dish criticism and harm your reputation within the firm, which stonewalls you from advancement, without ever knowing the intricacies of the work you do and come to find out they cannot even reproduce our work themselves. They refuse to take criticism back and will retaliate against you if you speak up against them. They are still living in the 2000s era and have not been able to adapt to a work-from-home environment. Anxiety-driven continuous micromanagement throughout the COVID Pandemic has caused me and others to feel bombarded with more and more work without any hands-on help from managers, resulting in many talented employees leaving the firm. After the spring cleaning where multiple managers and employees were fired when PIMCO took over, management started looking out for themselves and their own friends in management to save face and will quickly throw a lower-level employee under the bus. Nepotism."

Contractors are treated as subhumans and get parking spots that are way off the PIMCO campus and require taking a shuttle to get to and from the main building.

top line management is essentially deaf to the needs, no matter how basic, of anyone below them. compensation is so significantly lower than the market rate it's a bit laughable.

The firm runs so unbelievably lean that everyone is overworked, understaffed, and underpaid by wide margins. Turnover is insane but nothing changes to address any of the issues that are raised - a strategy that is sure to fail much sooner rather than later. Also, PMs and EVPs are treated like gods so if you're not there, expect little to no attention from management."

It is awkward to even talk to the person sitting next to you. They place too high a value on an MBA.

PIMCO is a great name on your resume and people who know anything about finance will be impressed you work here.,"Long hours and poor work-life balance. Cutthroat culture and political work environment. Co-workers can't be trusted and the floor is not a very friendly environment. The onboarding process is a joke. Nearly impossible to transfer internally to another department or to be promoted to PM. Portfolio Managers are treated like gods and anyone below them aren't treated very well. Co-workers aren't interested in helping you learn and you practically have to beg for their time to teach you things. Part of the reason for this is because the firm is too lean and turnover is so high. If PIMCO did a better job onboarding employees and providing better career growth, the other ""seasoned"" employees wouldn't be so stretched thin since people wouldn't leave. I wouldn't recommend working here unless your a PM."

Great exposure given the firm runs so lean, although this is a double edged sword. If you're a star and your boss/upper management likes you, not too difficult to move up with time. Tuition reimbursement and solid 401k. You can leverage the name for a better, more well paying job elsewhere which is what most people do.  This is probably the best part of PIMCO.","The compensation is laughable. If you look at competing firms for the same role, they pay significantly more, in some cases double. Even if you get promoted to VP, which they make more difficult than it has to be to obtain, it's a small bump in overall pay and not up to par vs the rest of the industry. So you end up having a bunch of talented people who are overworked, understaffed, and underpaid which leads to very high turnover. Executives at the firm don't get this so they deal with the turnover, which is probably more expensive than just paying their employees well. Pretty horrendous strategy IMO.  Every year there is a new excuse as to why comp is flat or below. Also a very top heavy organization where PM's are treated like gods.  Technology is also behind rest of the industry although they are making a sizeable investment to turn that around."

208,,Don't come here if you're coming out of undergrad,2020-06-06,2.0,Associate,"People might be impressed if you say you work here. But I assume if you can get a job here, you already have a recognizable school/previous job experiences on your resume. Also, the name recognition is pretty confined to circles within finance, and if you are not 100% sure on being in finance, you are probably better served going to a big bank/other institution.

There are very smart people here. There is good job security, and the pay is industry standard starting out (you'll quickly get outstripped by peers the longer you stay). You won't get better WLB anywhere else.","It's probably as dead end of a job as you can get from a reputable company. There are three reasons for this: 

1. There is little growth in your role.
2. There are few opportunities for lateral movements within the company. 
3. You gain very few transferrable or useful skills from what you do.

I think (1) and (2) are pretty common pain points for large institutions. (3) is what I would call out if you are just starting out your career, since middle management doesn't really know what they need their analysts/associates to do and for the most part aren't particularly interested in figuring it out (there are a handful of exceptions). So you will most likely be doing a lot of random things that don't add much to your development, and then they'll ship you off to b-school. In my opinion this is a result of the org being both lean (not many resources to develop you) and hierarchical (few opportunities). That's a deadly combo!"

Challenging and interesting work in the trading floor 
High profile organisation","Lots of politics, negativity, no collaboration as culture is every man for himself. Treated as a commodity and no career advancement unless you’re one of the favoured few noticed by the CIOs. They put people and teams purposely in conflict to see who comes out on top. As a result, there is a lot of backstabbing. Even if management like you, if they’re an MD they are tied to the profits of the business so will never rock the boat as it might impact their share in the distribution of the bonus. While I met some great people while working there, generally the trading floor is a very unfriendly place, no one speaks to each other, everyone is competing and backstabbing to get their next promotion or bonus.

It is a part of the company culture to get together and spend hours volunteering.  Some of the most meaningful experiences I have had in my life are a result of these volunteer experiences.

Some good managerial training how to treat people will do her some good. 

There is a lot of drama with in the teams and management. No one has your back or have a spine to defend you. I have seen the admin supervisors and managers go behind closed doors and talk for lengthy time. They are usually gossiping about all the admins. 

They love push overs and door mats and someone who is coy and subservient to do their work with out asking questions. 

Poor training also with no real examples.

1. Extremely management focused.
2. All you need to do is please your managers, if you disagree with them or give your suggestions you are questioned.
3. Keep following what you manager wants you to do for peaceful life
4. They lack highly in Methodology. Their sdlc release cycle is totally in mess. There's no monitoring whatever. Anybody can release whene'er they feel like. You can ECR approval easily. Lack of documentation. Poor code review. No team coordination. They should learn how other companies are thorough in all these practices
5. Also, there are no one on ones with manager. (Very team specific) but you don't know where are you heading since there's no clarity.
6. I would never recommend this place for the fresher's because they have always hired experience people and they basically don't have any course plan out for them. They will not like it. Not a fun place to work for.
7. Location is fantastic but one gets bored of beaches after a point.

-Employees don't talk to each other much, which creates an 'every man for himself' environment. Mistakes are called out and frowned upon, with little training in place to get you up to speed. I found it to be a bad place for juniors, especially the more social/friendly types who see the bigger picture and want to collaborate

-People are treated as disposable and kicked to the curb unless they uphold rigid, hierarchical business practices (i.e. sticking to 'this is how it's done here, no questions allowed' mentality)

This has been made possible by the firm's belief to invest in Technology, a culture that strives for excellence and a very competitive set of Engineers working at the firm.

Recently the firm started a Tech innovation center in Austin. The hiring process for new Engineers has thorough scrutiny to ensure that only the best developers make it into the firm. In addition, the firm is making strides at interfacing with CS departments at Universities to ensure a great pipe of young Engineers continue to join the firm.

The firm is also putting a lot of emphasis in creating a diverse workforce. Lot of time and money is going in participating at events such as Grace Hopper and organizations that encourage participation of women in Technology. 

The above goes to show that PIMCO is a great place to work for Engineers who are passionate about Technology and want to grow their career by working in a thriving work environment. Opportunities in learning via pluralsight, safari books, linked in learning and offsite and onsite courses, are provided by the firm.

The professionals here are among the very brightest in the industry and some of the nicest investment professionals I've had the pleasure of working with (20+ years in asset management).  

PIMCO is lean shop so employees have a high degree of responsibility and there is ample opportunity to take on additional projects to broaden one's experience.    Being lean also provides opportunity to have one's work be visible (great for those who want visibility and to be recognized). 

There is a new CTO so there a healthy emphasis on technology.  Growth in technology goes beyond quant and data science (every asset manager growing on these fronts) and includes technology infrastructure which is unique relative to PIMCOs competitors.",The downside of being lean can mean for some longer than normal hours.

-No loyalty -- Example 1.When Gross left, employees internally found out from external news sources..maybe naive of me to think that you'd give a heads up to your own people first..right?
Example 2.It doesn't matter if you graduated from the top undergraduate program, came from a respected firm, have given several great trades ideas that the Portfolio Managers/traders have executed, PIMCO will almost never promote you as an Associate (even if you bust your butt to get the CFA while working or if you finish your part time MBA/Masters) -> Associates are looked down upon in this firm for some weird reason..

-Lack of mobility (Aversion towards progress): Essentially no mobility at any level except for MBA hires at first (rotation program) or if you are a shrewd political player

PIMCO is a place where you are continuously challenged and driven to do better.  The people you work with are hard working and intelligent.

The brand still carries a fair amount of weight despite the Gross departure, and you will learn a tremendous if you wish during your tenure.","•  Nepotism
•  Hostile work environment
•  Tremendous political undertone

The firm is wrought with cronyism that starts in the three big departments (Portfolio management, Product Management, and Account Management).  If you are not part of those departments, you are a peasant.  The arrogance exudes even from those in the elevators.  Appearance is everything as is your school brand.  If you are brought in on the correct nepotistic path (generally MBA from top 5), you will have guaranteed promotions to VP and SVP on a certain time frame regardless of your overall contributions or often times lack thereof real investment experience.

For those departments outside of the trinity (PM, PdM, and AM), you have a series of middle to senior managers that are holding on to the cash cow while trying to hold back younger employees who are looking to advance.  Managers in non-anointed departments have been there for 10+ years and desire to only keep the relatively high paying checks rolling in.  This means anyone that threatens the system by improving it or trying to advance (changing departments or getting promoted) is discarded or cast aside.  Managers use fear tactics to keep you in line via mind games and the collective attitude that you ""owe"" them for allowing you to work there."

479,,VP,2013-10-08,4.0,,"Industry leader (looks great on CV), some of the smartest people you will ever meet, great learning opportunities.",Promotion prospects can vary; lot of politics; aggressive culture.
480,,BIG EGOs,2013-08-08,2.0,Marketing Project Manager,"Benefits and occasional bonuses are great. You can make it long-term if you fly under the radar. As a company they're successful. They have the right ""big"" heads.","If you're not a fund manager you're basically a peon and you're there to do the bidding of the fund managers. They hire pedigrees and the egos that go with it. There is no employee advocacy and no respect for middle or lower tiers of employment. They will and can let you go if someone with the right pedigree doesn't like you or if you don't fit their ""head down, fly low"" mentality. Don't expect career opportunities unless you have the right mentor. Kiss ass and you'll be fine. Don't complain or try to be innovative."
481,,Underwhelming,2013-07-30,3.0,Anonymous Employee,"Smart people, high intensity, good compensation (for some)",YOu are only as good as your last [whatever].  Consistent stellar performance doesn't matter if at the end of the year there is a mistake or error.
482,,Great resume builder and that's about it.,2013-06-26,2.0,Compliance Analyst,You will have the opportunity to rub elbows with some of the smartest people in the industry.  Definitely a place that is challenging and one where you will learn an enormous amount.,Horrible/incompetent management and zero visibility in terms of growth prospects.  It is extremely difficult to move  within the firm and roles have become extremely specialized and focused on specific tasks.  Very fast paced with long hours and very little work/life balance and not so great compensation.  Politics will take you places while playing a team sport will only work against you.  A very high stress environment leading to constant nightmares.  EVERYONE is replaceable.  Management will over promise and rarely deliver.
483,,Poor management leads to loss of morale,2013-06-26,2.0,Anonymous Employee,PIMCO has big reputation in the Finance Industry (asset management) and the name looks good on a resume. You're mostly surrounded by very intelligent people and know what they're doing.,Poor management often led to loss of morale on teams. Pay is also low compared with market and other asset management firms. Lot's a red tape to get things done often slowed projects down to the point of stagnation.
484,,Great place but lacks life/work balance,2013-05-31,1.0,Product Management Senior Vice President,Among the smartest people I have ever met. Clients are indeed the focus of the firm.  Newport Beach and SoCal are great.,Poor work life balance. In product management you get blamed for anything that goes wrong regardless of whether you were involved in the issue or not. Too much effort is expended on face time.
485,,Horrible trade floor for new MBAs,2013-05-27,1.0,Portfolio Manager,"Prestige name brand.
open office","Having to be at the office at 4am every day.
Politics
Difficult to move up unless you are really good at politics
Not a performance based culture unless you are very senior
Very stressful.
long and unproductive hours. I could easily do my work in less than half the time, but I cant be seen leaving the office, even for lunch.
have to whisper all the time and can't be seen smiling or joking for fear of looking unproductive.
very stressful and unnecessarily so. 
lot of posturing for airtime
difficult to find another job post pimco which is why few people leave."
486,,"Not worth it, left company after 3 months",2013-05-02,1.0,Vice President,"nothing comes to my mind, except great starbucks coffee machine","so many of them, almost all the bad things said in other reviews are true. the whole company rips advantage of name and fame PIMCO total return fund. this $280B behmoth if some day vanishes the whole company will come crashing down."
487,,"Amazing company ideals, brilliant colleagues, Lean teams often lead to long hours.",2013-04-14,4.0,Anonymous Employee,PIMCO will take care of you if you can put in the hard work and long hours. They are the best of the best and this is reflected in their expectations.,"Inter-team dependencies and inefficient means of communication can cause projects to have insufficient time and resources. Long hours and lots of stress, not sure if Newport Beach is worth it."
488,,Incredibly fast-paced work environment.,2013-04-03,3.0,Associate,"Some of the nicest, most genuine people you will ever meet. Employees really do go out of their way to teach and help you with problems you encounter while on the job.","Lean organization leads to an additional workload. If you're not looking for a fast-paced environment, PIMCO is not the place for you. I think a lot of employees tried to put on their ""work face"" and look like they loved working at PIMCO when the opposite may very well have been true if you talked candidly with anyone."
489,,Great company but not yet a global player culture-wise,2013-04-01,4.0,Manager,Best bond house in the world in terms of 1st year learning process (especially on the macro front) and brand recognition. Very flat hierarchy structure with some entrepreneurial possibilities. Very slim structure (similar to Morgan Stanley) which allows for significant exposure to investors/consultants,"Geographical mobility is near-absent, internal politics and nationality seems to matter a lot more than skills, HR is very disorganized. Too much US-focused"
490,,Too much hard work for little to no pay,2013-03-19,3.0,Analyst,Competitive environment and a lot of fixed income knowledge to soak in.,There is a lack of work life balance.
491,,Avoid the PIMCO technology debacle,2013-03-13,2.0,Senior Software Engineer,Complete job stability.  Great California weather.,"PIMCO technology is engaged in a costly effort using 1990s technology to support 2013 trading volumes. Management has no or severely outdated technical skills which has lead to several negative trends becoming entrenched:
- developers are uniformly incorrectly incentivised on the speed in which work is completed, software quality is completely ignored
- your boss won't understand or be able to value your work so promotions are all done mafia style based on your perceived & demonstrated loyalty to your boss and your penchant for politics
- As technology fails to deliver on a project, an elaborate charade of pretending to do everything possible demands very long hours which management regards highly.
- Great software is written by great teams and no teams are functioning well at this place, while good employees plot their departures or remain disgruntled, those with outdated skills are the only ones who are not planning on going anywhere since they are so over-paid."
492,,Intense place,2013-02-08,3.0,Marketing Manager,"Good benefits, lots of travel, populated by smart people",Absolutely no respect for work-life balance

California is a decent location if you don't want the city life","No place to go afterward that has upward mobility. 
This place really will suck your soul. 
Very hierchical.
If you are in your 20s or early 30s, this is a horrible place to waste away your life. Don't be sucked in.
The money/comp isnt as great as they make it out to be, or what you would expect from a firm like PIMCO"
494,,"5 YEARS OF HARD WORK, ZERO PERCENT YIELD",2013-02-03,1.0,Analyst,"Prestigious name on your resume but thats about it. Plus if they think they can suck you up for knowledge, they wil throw you lots of money & throw you out like yesterday's garbage.","This is a very toxic environment, popularity contest, senior managers with NO idea on how to run a department, ego-driven, mostly greedy individuals you will ever meet in your life. This place will suck you dry. The people are very mean & cruel, all they do is fight & stick each other in the back. 
They have the worst corporate culture on Wall Street, more horrific than Goldman, Merrill or Morgan. Maybe this firm will fall harder than any of these firms because this is the most Brutal, Toxic, Cruel & Mean Place.  
It has a Superiority Complex.  They always tell everyone, if you don't work here, we will replace you in a hearbeat, tons of people waiting on line for your job.  
Also, they have the worst technology & operations dept in the industry.  If you are in IT, don't work here, the management sucks, they spend lots of money for very little results. They have the highest expense on consultant fees with very little delivery."
495,,Benefits are great...that is all,2013-01-28,3.0,,The benefits here are great,This place will suck your soul. Avoid at all costs unless you have an outer-exterior made of teflon

498,,Optimistic to work for company but became disillusioned by not having opportunity to grow professionally.,2012-12-18,2.0,Specialist,Great reputable company and experience to have on your resume.,"Lack of support and leadership from superiors, lack of responsibility and ownership by superiors, little to no career growth and non existent mentoring. Understaffed, overworked with no support. Job description was misrepresented to actual duties performed."
499,,Not a good company for work / life balance,2012-12-12,1.0,,"Great medical benefits and 401k plan.
Nice location.
You work with many smart, talented, and driven people.","No work life balance.
Company will work you to the bone.
Taking a lunch break is discouraged.
Being promoted from within is very difficult if not impossible.
Conformist thinking
People have been there so long, they lose perspective and think Pimco is the only option for a career."
500,,Terrible environment that good employees should avoid at all costs,2012-10-21,1.0,Portfolio Manager,"The company has name recognition in the industry. It has created a sophisticated conveyer belt where job functions are highly specific creating a machine where nobody is required to think broadly, but the machine can run relatively smoothly nevertheless.","I have come across some of the most morally corrupt people ever in this place. The culture is one of individualism at all costs. A large portion of employees are motivated solely by personal interests,  at the expense of co-workers, subordinates and even clients.

The business model includes hiring from outside at all costs rather than promoting from within. The growth of the firm is telegraphed to incoming employees as being a huge opportunity to grow, however the marketing message associated with hiring from outside trumps all. ""Look how strong we are - we are always hiring"". Meanwhile that is made possible because of heavy turnover resulting from frustrated employees leaving.

This firm really has become more of a marketing firm than a legitimate investment business."
501,,Serious Investment Professionals,2012-09-28,4.0,,They take investment management more seriously than any other firm on the street.  Provide a great  deal of education to make you better at your job.,Still trying to figure out how to manage the former Allianz employees.  Need a CFA and MBA from top school to get ahead.
502,,Eat you up and spit you out,2012-08-28,1.0,Investment Professional,Carefully constructed reputation in the industry,"Culture is terrible. Management creates a class warfare culture where subordinates have little opportunity to grow. 
Employees are treated like commodities - initially promised the world but upon delivery by the employee - the company renegs on its promises.
Resulting employee turnover seems completely expected, with an attitude that there is a line of people outside the door waiting to replace the poor used up souls."
503,,Almost impossible to go from Portfolio Associate to Portfolio Manager.,2012-08-10,3.0,Portfolio Associate,"Will work directly with PM, but nothing to do with trade idea formation. Suggested trades will be to comply with fund guidelines or limitations. You do have the opportunity to step outside of the box and create trade write ups which they most likely will read. These must be exhaustive and foolproof - like all of the other PM's trade ideas.","You will be close to PM's but definitely have segregated feeling. Have to do things on your own to break out - this is hard. You basically have to make money, before being able to make money."
504,,Can't see the bigger picture,2012-08-04,2.0,,"Smart people
Fast paced and stressful (for those who strive in that environment) 
If you perform, you are richly rewarded. If you are a ""b"" player you won't be happy. 
Flat organization. The best ideas get heard despite if they come from an associate or an MD.","Morale is in the toilet and management doesnt care. 
If you don't fall in the ""a"" player camp then you don't get paid well. 
There is no work life balance. If you ask the question (even coyly) then you will not move forward to an offer."

506,,Pretty Solid one star rating,2012-06-18,1.0,Software Engineer,Good reputation in financial industry,"Plain bad culture at the technology group. 
Sacrifice of personal life earns you good impression and promotion - incapable managers and weak employees stay in office 12 hours a day staring at screens trying to reach 7pm... dressed up 'professionals' must eat lunch at desks even there's nothing to work on. All you need to do is to show how much you sacrifice yourself to earn good impression. 
If you do great job but need to work from home or leave early for family issues, you are a plain bad employee. 
Managers have no experience managing large scale infrastructure.
Entry managers can't stand talent employees' great work and think that's threat to their positions.
The general culture is 'Stay in office from 6am to 7pm for years and you will  eventually get there. '"
507,,6 Years of Sacrifice Yields 0.00% Total Return,2012-06-05,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"Job stability seems given, good resume building based on the name recognition, decent benefits package, the new office space in NY offers 360 spectacular views.","Favoritism rules supreme, honest and professional work ethic alone is not recognized, highly questionable management decisions, internal cliques can determine your professional fate, support staff are treated as third-class citizens."

Hours can be flexible if necessary.",The company is spread thin so there is a lot to do and flexible hours can be an illusion more than anything.

A great company to have on your resume
Great events and incentives.","Will pay for your education, yet won't necessarily promote you.  If you are liked in the right clique, then maybe.  It was like high school in that regard.

Benefits are great and if people like you they are willing to help.,"The running theme is that teams are run too thin, company is very lean and doesnt pay well, at all. Very difficult to advance even when well liked becuase you don't learn very much outside of the scope of your role, sometimes even if you ask. Frequently, employees quit and get training elsewhere and then comeback or go to MBA school and then come back."
