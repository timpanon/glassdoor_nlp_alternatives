The bare minimum to cover your human existence.,"When I interviewed for this position, the recruiter asked me my salary expecations. I said it's too soon in the process to discuss, this, what is your budget. They retorted some excuse and I asked for 50K, they said that was on the high end and had to review it and get back to me. They offered just under it with 48K. After starting the role I noticed the total compensation band for this role. The minimum is around 35K and the max is 85K. The target salary range is 45K to 61K. The point is, the recruiter is not your ally in the hiring process, they are legit trying to devalue your worth to save money. I was fair and initially asked for a salary in the middle. Which is completely fair and they shortchanged me. Shady. Also, you have to stay in a position for a year before you can apply elsewhere in the company. Also, your sick pay is lumped into ""Occasional Absences"" which are at the discretion of your manager."

You are expected to be the answer so you can end up on a call for an hour just trying to figure something out. Days are very unpredictable and if you work until the call center closes (10pm est) you can not log out until the last customer is taken care of. WFH creates a stressful environment. You can not just walk away and collect your thoughts if you have a bad customer or day. You have to sit there and fake your way through it.

Most HIPOs are developed and rewarded.,"This is not a company for experienced HR professional. If you're, you may be wasting your time here. You will never be promoted or developed. So if you're good with cruising, it's a good option because of benefits. You'll never be an insider. The higher level jobs don't get posted, unlike the rest of the company.

- Weak leadership that doesn't value transparency or feedback for their performance,
- Racial politics are everywhere - Retaining/promoting black employees only is what DEI means at PNC and PNC legal. The leadership goes out of its way to keep black employees happy, but if you are hispanic, Asian, LGBTQ, veteran, or anything else, you don't count and are basically ignored,
- mediocrity and keeping your head down wins the day,
- no matter how hard you work, what a great job you do, you are paid the same, stay in the same position and do the same job, which can be especially aggravating when the leadership constantly talks about how much they care about talent,
- Nice people who care about others don't get promoted. People who are good at kissing up, who have loud opinions or of a certain demographic do.
- The Leadership loves to talk about DEI, which means race and blackness. But there are no racial minorities at the c-suite level."

93,,The best of the banks,2022-03-29,4.0,Bank Teller,"PNC handled the pandemic fairly well for it's employees. there was a period at the beginning where we worked in cohorts. the branches were closed inside to anything but appointments and we got a solid boost to our pay for three months. 
The company is very diverse, especially compared to it's peers.
The benefits are stellar, from 401(k) with company match, to a pension, education assistance and reimbursement, and even adoption assistance.
There's a good amount of autonomy to the individual employee's position and growth in the company.","It's a bank. it favors big numbers for the CEO and shareholders over the salaries of it's employees.
The company has been known to buy out other banks during times of it's own prosperity instead of raising salaries for it's workers.
The bonus system is archaic and purposefully obfuscated, in order to make it hard for the average employee to 1. ever get a bonus despite a constant level of production, and 2. fully understand the ratio of bonus to revenue made for the company.

122,,great environment,2022-03-22,4.0,Financial Analyst,Everyone I worked with was nice and a pleasure to work with.,Lack of promotion from within
123,,Not A First Choice,2022-03-22,4.0,Teller Lead,The teammates are incredible to work with and the company has a lot of resources.,Consistently and intentionally under staffed. Lots of late hours at the Branches. Never any time to improve or use any of PNC's resources that they boast of.
124,,Great company,2022-03-22,5.0,Investment Banking Analyst,"Amazing experience with the bank, definitely would recommend. Good culture and hours for the industry and interesting enough work",Sometimes the compensation could be more in line with street although it’s reasonable
125,,Great company to work for and environment,2022-03-22,4.0,Bank Teller,"I enjoyed my time as  a part-time teller, it wasn't a difficult job and the management was great. I enjoyed working with my coworkers, and I loved that we had holiday dinners/parties and team building events.","The only thing I would say is they wanted to keep you at the banking center longer, so they would give you longer lunches. So what should have felt like a short week actually could end up being a long week with over hour breaks each day."
126,,"Pay Below Market Value, Laughable Raises",2022-03-22,2.0,Software Developer,"Good benefits compared to most US companies
Diverse and inclusive environment
Collaborative and welcoming work culture
Most people are respectful towards you
Health rewards program allows you to redeem free money into your HSA
Retirement match and stock purchase discount
Spotlight program gives you the opportunity to recognize and be recognized by coworkers and redeem points for items","Health insurance is high deductible, high premium
Your sick days can only be used as sick days and are forfeited at the end of the year
Pay is well below market value, with few opportunities for growth
Everyone is basically in competition with each other for who gets a semi-decent raise
Promotions seem to favor people who work a lot of overtime, moving them into a title that does not pay for overtime
Lack of transparency in job descriptions, basically tricking software developers into testing
Development team and product owners do not respect QA
Some people can really be dismissive whether it's because you're in QA, a woman, or you just call them out on their own bs
Teams either have barely any work at all or completely unrealistic deadlines
Meetings, meetings, meetings
QA gets blamed for everything that goes wrong
Can get tricked into taking on a ""stretch assignment"", which is basically just higher level work that isn't relevant to your current skillset with no title change nor additional pay under the hope that it will work in your favor come year end reviews, even though you most likely would already get a raise/promotion anyway if you were in consideration for a stretch assignment at all
People will fewer qualifications and less experience will be making more money than you
Compensation is only reassessed once (rarely twice) a year and you're not guaranteed anything to offset inflation or cost of living
Can be stuck with an entry level title and salary for years
Management frequently makes false promises
Managers who actually do work towards moving testers into development, which is what they though they would be doing from the beginning, will only move them internally within the quality engineering department
Everything is drowning in processes
They keep flirting with the idea of moving back into the office, only to backtrack whenever a massive amount of people resign in response, just to repeat the cycle again
Management will try to manipulate you into doing what they want by giving you the false hope of it working in your favor during the performance reviews (such as having cameras on during meetings and going in person into the office)
Promotions and raises go towards whomever upper management knows and likes better and are not actually merit or skill based
You're more likely to make more money as a new hire than to get a noticeable raise as a current employee. It's not uncommon to be making less money than the people you're managing
Will stagnate your career as a software developer, as you'll be spending months or years doing only testing, possibly doing solely manual testing depending on the team
Understaffed teams means existing staff has to take on extra work for no additional pay
Management makes compensation recommendations before you even submit your self-assessment for the performance review"

Not shown merely via words, but actions as well. Doing everything in their power to resolve and dig up solutions to my issues. Moreover, my fellow QEs regularly bend-over backwards to help each other. Whether it be with a failing test, an aloof manager, or team members that aren't following PNC own rules/guidelines when it comes to QEs. Each time, higher up managers quickly got involved and ""threw their weight around"" in a beneficial way.","Despite what the title of this position suggests, it's the role of a Quality Engineer. You use Java and Gherkin to write tests with Selenium and Karate. Not actually development the various pieces of software PNC has. Many other QE, myself included, did feel a bit bamboozled. 

The upper-most of management can, and has, been out of touch with some of it's company wide decisions. For example, a recent migration from an antiquated test tracking system, to Jira Xray. The process of moving our 100s of entries over, was well documented and there were numerous office hours meetings for it. On the contrary, actually using Xray, for left for us QEs to figure out. Moreover, the software that would automatically upload the results of our test to Xray was broken. A fellow QE had to fix it on their own. It was later integrated with our internal software, eventually."

- Never approve my education refund. Total lies. 
- They will not honor STD (Short Term Disability) I worked with 4 banks in the past, PNC is the only company that didn't approve my disability.
- Very Very long hours.
- The Underwriters have no idea what they are doing. Will takes 90 + days to approve a loan. 
- No training at all, no one knows how to run the system, especially Edge (SalesForce). System constantly breaks down, coders are totally incompetent.

Broad remote work policies even pre-pandemic Solid benefits with well-controlled costs year to year. Generous paid time off policies.,Pay is uninspiring. Raises within roles are rare and insultingly low. Promotions occur only when there is a vacancy to ascend to. Cronyism is rampant and leads to a lot of unqualified people in jobs that they very obviously aren’t equipped to perform. The company pats itself on the back a lot more often than anyone else does. Executive pay outpaces all other pay by a wide margin.

178,,Long Hours and No Pay,2022-03-12,1.0,Anonymous Employee,There are no benefits to working at PNC that aren’t offered elsewhere.,"I’ve spent several years underpaid. For five years I’ve been given promises that “it will get better soon.” Or “we are actively making changes.” I have not seen any positive change in almost 10 years. The main purpose of management seems to be to gaslight their employees. If you go to your manager or even HR and tell them you need something, wether it be a physical object or computer program, they will tell you you already have everything you need and treat you as a inconvenience for daring to ask. I was to be issued a newer company laptop as per company policy. Instead of proving me with a new laptop, they told me I would have to provide “medical documentation” that the new laptop would be needed. This is something that is done for every employee after a certain period of time. They say their doors are open to talk if you have complaints or suggestions. Unfortunately, I thought that was true and offered my opinion. Retaliation is real and there is no recourse. They say they raised their minimum wage to $18 an hour. I’m salary and work 60-80 hours a week. When you consider my salary against a 60 hour work week, I make $15 an hour. When I first interviewed here several years ago, I was told I would not have time for anything other than work. It’s very rare to see a 40 hour work week. Multiple women have been told things like “should you choose to have a family, you will not see them” and are flat out not considered for certain positions if it’s found out they have young children at home. There is no work life balance. The health insurance options are not great with high deductibles. Another thing you are told you are “entitled” to are 40 hours of volunteer work annually where the company pays for your time. I tried to do this twice. Each time I was told I wasn’t permitted due to a “business need”. If you need a stepping stone and really want to get experience in your field on what not to do, this is the place for you."

Heavy contractor and offshore engineering workforce. This leads to teams focusing on “tasks” over meaningful “feature” work. Scrum masters only care about how many story points are completed, not whether code is actually pushed to prod. 

Internal frameworks are garbage. Architecture team pushes multiple application breaking updates 6-7 times a year, then is slow as molasses to provide support when upgrading versions.

They want above-average work but supply cheap slow, and poorly performing laptops. If you travel, they do not pay for breakfast or lunch, only dinner. Any unused vacation from the previous year has to be taken in Q1 of the next year. They only allow you to roll over three days at that—the whole place to locked down by process on top of the process. You can’t get anything real done. The pay is lower than other banks. Benefits are subpar, but they are super proud of them. And tell you all the time how great they are. For now, a top-five bank they have so much to catch up on… the simple basic steps to a good product are ignored. Confirmation bias is enormous here. They just make up what they think users want. No data, no research.

Heck, I work there and can not stomach being a customer and bank somewhere else.

For over 2 months clients weren't able to access their own accounts online. We're able to see other clients' accounts that had no relations with, and the list could go on. Which caused so much hassle for the employees that worked in the branch. We were constantly yelled at about everything that the client was having to deal with. Which they have every right to be upset. When the higher up management would finally address the issues, they were on the same page. One person would tell us to do something. Then in a week we would be told to do something totally different. Which caused chaos and made fixing the problems that more difficult."

This company has such a high turnover of employees, it is ridiculous. There is a third party investigating the company due to the high turnover. Communication is nonexistential. I have worked in many financial institutes and I have never had a company that failed in so many things, not to mention the outdated technology and servers it uses. The hours are also horrible from 10-7pm and many locations are understaffed.

Some days can be exhausting with staff shortages, angry customers yelling at the inconvenient waits and that fact that staffing is very poor. Part is due to COVID illness, yet this staff shortage and turn-over is not new. only new employees are guaranteed the new minimum raise of $18 or more as a starting base, whereas many loyal long-time employees did not receive this. We are told we have to wait to see if we qualify for a raise if and when our next reviews come. Many of us have not gotten raises for 2-3 years now, not even to compensate for the extra work and business merging from BBVA, The company allocates many large amounts of money to charities and political causes, yet cannot take care of their employees by compensating them to have proper living wages during a time when inflation is affecting everyone. This have left MANY of us employees feeling very under -appreciated, under-valued, over-worked and questioning our future loyalty to this employer. On top of this, they tend to hire external individuals over promoting internal employees. An exception to this is higher management roles. Employees travel around to help other PNC banks as needed, mostly short notice, to cover for lunches and then go back to their main branch or asked to stay remained of the day to help.

Work life balance is good (If you find the right group).","PNC re-vamped their compensation bands a few years back which made a complete mess of things. Most of the time your 1% annual raise is keeping you at the minimum of your pay range despite how long you've been in the role and your skill level. You're rarely being compensated for your performance so there is little incentive to exceed expectations.
There is little room for advancement after a certain point, they've started cutting down on the higher individual contributor paygrades leaving really only a handful of ""levels"". So if you change jobs and you're moving to a job that's in the same level, it's very difficult to get any additional comp (sometimes). 
I would recommend negotiating a higher salary when coming into the bank and only staying for a few years. They have a lot more flexibility negotiating salaries for external candidates.
Managers can be hit or miss here, I've hand great ones and awful ones. So it all depends on the group you get in to."

During the holidays so my child will not have a Merry Christmas unless they send the payment which they just say oh it’ll be before the end of the year.

In situations where a few employees are out of the office all at once (for example, if one person is on vacation, one person is too sick to come in, and another is on maternity leave or leave for surgery (and I'm using this as an example because things like this have happened during my time at PNC, especially during covid)), the lack of staffing in branches causes complete chaos, and there's never enough coverage from floats to back us up because no one likes being a float and those employees never end up staying in the position for long. I know people across different branches in both models and have yet to find a PNC employee who likes the modern model. The modern branches also have a new design, and I imagine it's expensive for PNC to flip branches like that. I wish they would use that money to provide more staffing for branches instead. They're filling branches at the bare minimum to save money."

They literally dig in their heels and refuse to advance you no matter how many courses you complete and how many certificates you get they refuse. It seems like the only chance to get ahead is if they personally like you. Even if you are top in sales they still have a hard time to advance you and try to find any possible way to get out of advancing you. I applied for a position at PNC that I got certificates on and taken many courses on and got denied outright. I applied for the same position at another bank and got accepted. So after 6 years of employment, why is PNC denying me a position that another bank feels I am qualified for?
They expect more out of you year after year and do not compensate for it. They have you do more and more work and make your position more demanding and they keep your pay the same. 
They used to have a work life balance but not anymore. Recently, they changed their hours to closing at 6 from 5 So if you have a child in daycare and need to get them at 5, you no longer can. They made this change with complete disregard of their employees and their personal lives. 
They also required all employees in the district to work 6 days a week, no exceptions and our district manager usha did not plan to revise this 6 day work week schedule even after the bbva conversion.

With the merger from BBVA to PNC we were told many things we later found out were lies after lies… Products are horrible and not competitive with other lenders. Underwriting turn times for initial review is weeks or longer. Manager’s are inexperienced , not knowledgeable and more worried about having pointless team meetings. Even the trainers said on our training calls they were mortgage officers but it was a horrible role so they all became trainers to get out of sales.

They match 4% but most banks do 6% and up.

The new $15 hr minimum wage a lot of businesses are doing for no skill blue collar jobs makes PNC pay not competitive at all, which is a slap in the face to people who worked really hard to put a gap between blue and white collar work. Why would anyone in their right mind get paid the same or just a couple dollars more an hour for a job with much more responsibility, strict government guidelines and procedures to remember and all in a really highly professional environment. 

Workloads are increasing, including sales goals they are pushing. Not to mention all referral bonuses were removed during COVID. I repeat, there are NO MORE BONUSES!

1292,,Great benefits!,2021-05-26,4.0,Anonymous Employee,The benefits are great. PNC offers a company matching 401k and a pension.,The training is not great. The universal bank model makes it difficult to be an effective banker. It can be difficult to meet goals when you are caught running teller transactions all day.
1293,,Not as advertised,2021-05-25,2.0,Bank Teller,"Good pay, good benefits, room to grow","Training not long enough - kind of thrown to the wolves. I specifically asked if I was going to have to meet any sales goals and was told I would not. Turned out not to be accurate as every day we started the day with how many referrals we made and pressured to make those numbers even higher. I often felt like I was doing a disservice to our customers with the constant pushiness. Stressful environment in that because it can be small space to work in, every word you speak is closely monitored and gossip was intense."

If that counts as a ""pro""...","Management has zero clue what they want to do - from the Program Director downward. Compensation is atrocious. Do NOT expect a single cent that is not clearing noted in your job offer. Management say whatever it takes to attract/retain talent. You will not be bonus-ed well, especially when compared to the amount of money you will make your financial advisors. You will be asked to discuss and push sophisticated investment products that you may have been zero training nor licensing on. Turnover is through the stratosphere...not positive attrition, people leave PNC to escape this role."

1299,,Great Management,2021-05-25,5.0,Internal Auditor,I’m very pleased with PNC. My management team (including senior management) has been very supportive of my career goals as well as allowing a very flexible work schedule.,The culture at PNC is very much a “pull” culture. There isn’t much of an orientation to help new employees understand how to navigate the resources on the intranet. You definitely need to be a self starter here.
1300,,Great company overall,2021-05-25,5.0,Customer Service Representative,"Great benefits, easy to move up in",Hard to change schedule hours

1303,,A Valued Company with Values,2021-05-24,5.0,PNC Bank Virtual Customer Service and Support Representative,"PNC Bank's CEO Bill Dempchak has incredible values for social reform, justice, and helping his employees establish a work/home balance. It carries over into how he leads his company. Everyone has the ability to quickly rise in the company after 6 months of excellent performance. They train for each position and provide excellent benefits (dental, vision, medical, employer match 401K). If you are a minority of any group, PNC is a place where you will feel like you have a chance to grow with the company.","It can get busy at times...extremely busy. Back-to-back calls can create fast burnout, especially in a role such as CSR where part of the job includes demanding customers on occasion."

1308,,PNC Bank,2021-05-23,4.0,Business Development Officer,Good internal training and development program. They try to allow the employee to direct their development and guide them through the process.,Too many moving components to the bonus plan that seems to create a forced limit on the bonus a person is eligible for. There is a 10% internal cap to a person's salary when moving to a different position (or they will place you at the base rate for that position). People coming in from the outside are able negotiate higher salaries than loyal employees that are seeking upward mobility.
1309,,Place is a joke!,2021-05-22,1.0,Customer Service Representative,A paycheck that is it. Outside of leaving for the day.,"High turnover 
Zero work/life balance
Lots of micromanagement
Zero transparency 

This company does not care about you. Your are just a number to them. They do not care if you have an emergency or cannot come in to work due to inclement weather. A team lead asked me if I was going to attend training during a middle of a snowstorm where I had also lost power moments before she contacted me.

Their leaders are morally bankrupt. When it comes to following their own values, they have a “Do as I say, not as I do” mentality. Most of the trainers and managers are unhelpful. The helpful and competent ones always leave due to the toxic atmosphere.

Training is non-existent and a complete joke! Their form of “training” consists of modules that you access on your own. The modules are useless as they do not help once you are out on the floor taking calls. The trainers sit at their desks most of the time doing nothing and are essentially useless. If you ask a question you will either receive incorrect information or not receive a response to your question. The trainers do not show you how to navigate the systems used to take calls or allow you to learn the systems yourself. You must look at videos to learn about the systems. The trainers will falsify complaints to team leads if they dislike you. My trainer reported me to my team lead for not participating despite me actively participating. Why? Because he thought that I was not participating enough to his liking, even though I participated from the beginning of training. I was even threatened with termination on my second day of training by my team lead due to the trainer's made up complaint. The trainers will say that you have plenty of time to catch up on the assignments if you fall behind. Do not believe this. They do not care if you have legitimate reasons for falling behind, such as internet issues, power outages, and system issues. My trainer said for people not to worry and then said to move on to the other modules and did not provide any downtime to catch up. If you fall behind, you will be threatened with termination by your team lead.

Bait and switch. They force you to make sales despite saying that they do not focus on sales. The recruiter told me that the work schedule would be a set time. Which was also on my offer letter. However, once training began my class was told by our team lead that our work schedules would not be fixed time. Our training class was also informed by the trainer that there would be nine weeks of training. Five weeks of learning and then four weeks of nesting. What they do not tell you is that training is only for thirty days. You begin to take calls during your second or third week of training. There is zero support from the team leads, managers, and trainers when you begin taking calls. The trainers and team leads will tell you to use your resources when you reach out for help. You are on your own. Calls are back-to-back, with no breathing time. You will mostly speak to irate and abusive customers and you cannot hang up. Team leads will refuse to take escalations leaving you to deal with the abusive customers on your own. If you cannot receive any assistance, it is deemed as your fault. Instead of helping, the team leads will focus on what YOU did wrong every single day. 

If you speak up or disagree with something you will have a target on your back. Managers and team leads will retaliate and manage you out. They will also try to manage you out if they do not like you for whatever reason.

Lots of micromanagement. You are required to dress business casual or professionally every day during your shift even though you are working from home. You must upload a picture of yourself. The reason that they want you to feel like “family”. They only want a picture to see who you are to discriminate against you. A webcam is also mandatory which is used to monitor your every movement as well as view your surroundings. They also track your movements on your computer when you begin taking calls. In training, team leads will appear randomly into the training meetings to “monitor” you. 

They do not compensate you for internet services. They require that you buy separate internet and phone services. It can be very expensive if you are paying for two separate phone lines and two separate internet services.  

They will cancel the medical benefits a day after you leave the company, unlike most companies that cancel the benefits at the end of the month."

1619,,"Micromanagment, Underpaid, Never receive a raise, Overworked",2021-03-11,1.0,Sales,you get to go home,"Micro management- they will squeeze every possible legal minute out of you and are able to track every second you spend on the phone. They legally have to give you 2 15 minute breaks and 1 30 lunch...but if you are on the phone with a customer during your breaks and lunches, then they will not credit you back your time. You have a strict schedule each day that is assigned to you. For example, I may have my lunch scheduled from 1:30-2:00pm on monday, yet on tuesday it is scheduled from 12:30-1:00pm. Calls are back to back , so if someone calls me 5-10 minutes BEFORE my lunch and the phone call takes 30 minutes....then I will miss my lunch. PNC will NOT reschedule my lunch. Legally I have to take the 30 minute lunch...but will eventually get fired for it. I can explain why: PNC has something very strict called ""adherence"". Adherence is the measurement of how many minutes out of an 8 hour shift were you on the phone. PNC expects 92 percent of 8 hours (MINUS your 30 min lunch and 2 15 min breaks) to be on the phone. So 8 hours = 480 minutes. 480 - 60 mins = 420 mintues. Each day , for 420 mins- You need to be on the phone for 92 percent or better. It gets more complicated because I usually have a 15/30 min meeting almost every day, or occasionally a training, that deducts from the total time. For example- lets say that 3 days a week i have a 30 min meeting. For that day, it would be 420- 30=390. 92 percent of 390 is only 31 minutes of ""wiggle room"". That means that if i have to get up out of my chair to go to the bathroom, or if i MISS my 15 minute break ...or if I MISS my 30 min lunch....that those minutes DEDUCT from the 31 minutes of ""error"". If I were to miss my lunch and break every day (which totals 60 mins of error) then after one month of this occuring, I would be written up, then next month probation with no commission, and then third month- FIRED. PNC constantly fires many people and there is a HIGH turn over rate because of this. The people who survive are the people who RUSH customers off the phone or TRANSFER calls because they are DESPERATE to take their break because they have to pee, or DESPERATE to take a lunch because they are hungry or thirsty. PNC should and probably will be SUED for ABUSING their employees and for letting their MISSED breaks and lunches COUNT AGAINST THEM. THAT SHOULD BE ILLEGAL TO PENALIZE EMPLOYEES FOR MISSING THEIR SCHEDULED LUNCHES DUE TO BEING ON THE PHONE/BEING ON AN IMPORTANT PHONE CALL WITH A CUSTOMER WHO IS IN NEED OF TIME AND ATTENTION REGARDING THIER FINANCES!

no raises----After 5 years with PNC...I still only make base rate of 15.25 an hour. My boss explained to me years ago that she is only able to give out ONE raise a year to ONE employee. She has 12 employees on her team....and she can pick the same person each year too.

 underpaid. My job role is sales for personal deposit accounts, home equity loans, personal loans, auto loans, and credit cards. 5 years ago when I first got hired into this department- the goal was to SELL these products and also occasionally take customer service calls and try to turn a service call into a SALES opportunity. As a sales representative I have sales QUOTA. HOWEVER , each YEAR they change the commision payouts. Each year they have LOWERED the commission pay out dollar amount that we can receive...and have also RAISED THE BAR in order to receive a payout. By raising the bar I mean that they have made a minimum amount of products that you have to sell each month in order to get paid even a single penny on any of your hard work. They raised the bar very high back in 2019. 

To make things Way worse- they have forced us sales representative to TRAIN and QUALIFY for our loan servicing department AS WELL AS our online banking department. WITHOUT A CHOICE- we have been forced to go through the training of TWO DIFFERENT DEPARTMENTS and to add on those skill sets in order to take a MIXTURE of sales calls, online banking calls, and loan servicing calls. There is a lot of knowledge we must retain and systems we must use, plus passwords to remember in order to play the role of THREE DIFFERENT DEPARTMENTS. NOT ONLY WERE WE NOT GIVEN A CHOICE IN THE MATTER, BUT WE ALSO WERE NOT GIVEN ANY TYPE OF SALARY OR WAGE INCREASE, NO BONUS FOR OUR TROUBLES, NO COMMISION CHANGE EITHER. We still need to keep up with our sales quota, regardless of the fact that we INEVITABLY take less sales call within an 8 hour day now. SO we are expected to do more, for less. It is harder to meet ends meet with sales quota and harder to make the same amount of money we used to be able to make...if not IMPOSSIBLE. 

will make less money each year. In 2018 I made gross 48K . That was my base pay + comission. In 2019 I made 35k gross. That is base pay (15.25 hrly) plus some commission. It became harder to make the same amount of commission and money even though I had maintained or improved my Sales numbers. In 2020 I left for military deployment. Now, in 2021, I am projected to make just 29K dollars this year being that I am paid 15.25 for 40 hours a week full time. 

I am an economics student (I go to school online) and I am aware of the fact that 15.25 (the wage i began with in 2016) has LESS BUYING power than it does now in 2021. I have made less and less money each year with the same, if not MORE amount of work and effort ! So therefore I have become more POOR and more OVERWORKED. 

PNC must be stopped or sued for this abuse they are getting away with. If not sued for penalizing employees missed lunches and breaks, then the word should get out that people should NOT work for PNC at least in the call centers. The call center is just basically one big sweat shop."

You’re expected to give your vacation time for the whole year by March, and by then, so many days and weeks are blocked off you can’t even take off when you want. It’s like working in a factory except you get to sit down. The culture of the AML department is non-existent. We barely got “Thank you for your work” emails, much less any real enrichment. My company now is an absolute dream, I had PTSD for about 3 months and everyone else I knew from PNC said it was really hard for them to feel normal at their new place of employment (and there are a LOT of people quitting). They need to hire more people but I think all of the AML money is bottle-necked at the top, where they have four individuals at the top doing who knows what. Wouldn’t wish this place on anyone"

1762,,"Avoid. Micromanagement, turning into a Wells Fargo and unpleasant work environment",2021-02-11,1.0,Branch Banker,Benefits are ok but I have nothing else positive to say. Benefits could be better.,"When PNC hired me, I was told I would work 5 days per week and 2 saturdays a month. This wasn’t true - I worked 6 days every week. I had to beg for Saturday’s off if I needed one and for a large period, we didn’t even have another branch banker. No one was ever there and my manager only showed up to work when they felt like it but never came on saturdays. Not fair.

HR is a nightmare. Nothing but ISSUES. I had put in so many requests that just didn’t go through until my 5th try because the phone representatives at PNC fail to communicate and it’s very clear how lazy they are. 

Slow about responses. Very slow.

Company preaches unbiased work place. This is not true. They hire minorities for the job they believe is good for the minorities to be considered “exclusive” yet I watched a foreign young lady be denied a position she was fully qualified for because of her accent. Favoritism shows. Drama everywhere. Watched age discrimination as well. 

This is what really got me. The company fails to take proper precautions during COVID . They closed the lobby but allowed us to take appointments (even walk ins and would take EVERYONE even people that looked sick) and we opened all lobbies in October right before the second wave got bad again. No plans to take any cautions while second wave is happening. All other banks have had their lobbies closed. Not only that but the bankers are expected to cold call customers and try to get as many people in the branch as possible to get sales. Constant pressure to get sales, constant hassling customers to get every product we offer PNC preaches to offer every product for every customer. Regional and managers would be hounding down on us for sales slowing down and people refusing appointments. Would be constantly told offering every product is “what’s right for the customer, we’re not selling we are providing “solutions” that is exactly what Wells Fargo said during the scandal. Expect bankers to be incredibly scripted with calls and sales. Doesn’t like taking no for an answer from customers. Constant pressure for sales. Then would be consistently reminded we are not a “non profit we are a business”. PNC is turning into Wells Fargo. They are greedy and do not care about employees or customers, they just want money and miserable workers.

AVOID

First, my biggest issue, upper management is out of touch no matter what position you have. Since reopening fully from COVID restrictions it’s has been nothing but sales goals talk and business as usual, despite these being far from normal times. We are also constantly asked to take on new responsibility but no pay increases. Add to it that with COVID sales which you get incentive from have plummeted in the bank proper and we are going to be making less money and there is zero talk of pay restructuring despite consistently great financials for the bank.

The healthcare plan is abysmal. A high deductible plan that essentially leaves you paying out of pocket up to 2500 or 5k. A large medical expense would have crippled me financially. 

CEO is also out of touch. The issue of compensation came up last year, when employees weren’t even receiving cost of living raises despite record profits...the CEO literally said in a blog if you want a raise you need to get a promotion. That is great to say in theory, but when you have a pay scale that caps raises when you move internally and 50 people applying to every job it is unrealistic.

All these reasons are why I recently left for a competitor bank. I got a larger raise than I would have anywhere in PNC, they have better healthcare, and they are actively evaluating how they pay employees in light of COVID."

2178,,Great for first two years but now uneasiness and dread,2020-10-08,2.0,Branch Banker Associate,"Good folks to work with, product benefits for employees, health insurance and other tools provided for financial and physical well-being. When I first began working at PNC, I felt like I was valued and that there was a structure in place to help me succeed not only in my position, but within the company as a whole.","PNC has changed since I first began working here. Earlier this year it was announced they would be removing the incentive for Branch Banker Associates (formerly BSSR and otherwise known as a universal banker) and it really crushed  the upward mobility of the position. While any incentive bonus I had received was added to my yearly salary, going forward I can do the same tasks as a Banker but I will not receive any incentive. The role of a universal banker has great utility but at PNC this change has translated into an environment where I feel less valued than Bankers and, additionally, I no longer have a system or any concrete numbers I can point to should I seek promotion or employment elsewhere. Additionally, I have seen PNC engage in some really harmful practices that hurt the core workforce - most noticeably, sudden announcements which seems to suggest that folks in different departments or lines of business are being laid off with little to no warning. I have also felt that PNC’s  response to a COVID diagnosis in my branch was absolutely lacking in structure or transparency. While my manager did their best to field questions and provide information, they were not given clear next steps to keep us informed, safe, or assured - multiple coworkers and I found out that it would be a struggle to quarantine due to possible exposure. While the general guideline from health officials at the time has been to quarantine for two weeks, we were left confused as to whether or not we would have to use vacation time or risk a cut to our pay in order to stay safe."

- Awesome Employee benefits with pension plan.","- Compensation plan is horrible. 
Base salary is painful. You get Bps deduction for everything possible even for operational errors.
-PNC does not support its loan officers. As a loan officer, you will spend more time as a liaison between the operation/processing departments than getting more loans. Processors does not call clients or share with loan officers any timely updates. You can count on one hand the good processors the company has. Let’s blame the “bad apples”.
- Poor operational/processing system.
Great for jumbo loans (nerd wallet) or the wealthy clientele. Especially if you earn a high income and substantial account balance or retirement account in the millions usually that you can transfer to PNC.
- Loans never closes on time.
Usually take 90 days for a refinance, even before the pandemic. Every realtor you come in contact with will let you know this “PNC = Purchase Never Close”.

This is easily one of the worst companies I have worked for. I am appalled by the lack of vision and direction of this company. If there is a company which appears messy, that is bad, but worse than that is a company which pretends and puts up window-dressing that it is one of the best, etc.
I will NOT recommend even my enemy to this company.
Leaders (Managers, Directors, CIOs as well) are rude and openly violate the basic courtesy rules and policies of PNC (CARES and iLEAD policies of PNC). To add to the mess are dinosaurs who are with the bank for decades and who think they are the kings and queens.

It is expected for employees work late nights, weekends, and over vacations in order to get work done. Management barks orders and doesn’t consider the full extent of the requests that are cascaded to the employees. Decisions are rushed and there is no compensation for the extra work that is put into the job by good employees. The company does nothing to make employees feel valued."
2399,,Not worth it,2020-07-14,1.0,Solutions Consultant,Maybe the pay and bonuses? It’s miserable work for the salary though,"I moved over from a traditional banking role to explore the expansion market PNC put in KC. Unless you’re incredibly comfortable with door knocking on new businesses every day, don’t even consider it. You will start and end your day telling management what you did every second of the day, making the micromanagement unbearable. And as the cherry on top, you have no career opportunities unless you want to move to the East Coast, or move to a loan servicing institution they hold.

2435,,"I was going to stay quiet until I saw that PNC put out a ""diversity"" statement on racism, which is BEYOND LAUGHABLE.",2020-06-15,1.0,Detection and Investigations Associate,You get paid on time,"AML Operations is the Perfect Example of a TOXIC Work Environment

You haven't lived until you've received, in February 2019, an invitation from a senior manager for a process improvement meeting called ""Make AML Great Again"". And senior management ran the department just like the current occupant of the White House. Yes, you read that correctly, and of course this happened during Black History Month. 

Senior management is clueless, and are only interested in hearing from ""yes men"" who blindly agree with management's ideas. If you ask for clarification on something, you are marked as ""difficult"" and will be targeted accordingly, a process referred to by AML senior management and team leads as being ""managed out of PNC"". The team leads/managers that distribute the work do so in a bullying fashion at the direction of senior management, by assigning employees that are not viewed in a favorable light by management an abundance of cases with ""expedited due dates"", or an abundance of ""high risk"" cases involving more thorough reviews, or assigning in such a way that all cases for that week are due on Mondays, combined with revoking teleworking privileges while also limiting building access hours. After asking a valid question about case assignments during a ""questions"" portion of a meeting about case assignments, one of the bullying team leads took my manager aside and told them to ""get me under control"". Meanwhile, this female team lead was doing the work of a male direct report for him after hours.

Also, there are a little over 20 Quality Analysts that review the work of the Investigators. Once senior management decided to target me, I had the same 3-4 Quality Analysts over the next 3 years, although they are supposedly randomly assigned. The Quality Analysts assigned to me combed through my work with a fine-toothed comb, looking for any reason to reject it. Senior management went outside of our clearly written procedures TWICE, just to reject my work. I documented the actual procedures in their respective cases to show the departure from the procedures. Each team was required to have daily morning meetings where we would discuss our work and its progress. It became glaringly obvious to my team that my work was held to a much higher standard than the rest of my team.

I have witnessed an employee actually stay in the building overnight due to trying to meet deadlines due to intentional case overloads while dealing with building access that is cut off earlier for them than the rest of the employees. That employee was fired upon returning to work the following morning after going home to take a shower.

The fact that INTEGRITY is one of PNC's core values is laughable in AML Operations. Employee Relations/Human Resources is just an extension of AML Operation's discriminatory actions, and only serve to identify employees for retaliation including being interrogated and falsely accused by a VP from HR interrogate about a disability for which PNC already had the required documentation. HR operates however they want to with absolutely no regard for the law, demanding that employees use personal phones for communication with them so that the conversation does not occur on a recorded line. If everything that PNC's HR department does is supposed to be above board, why the secrecy and demands that a non-official means of communication be used?

*There is supporting documentation available for every statement made in this review*"
2436,,Not A Positive Work or Professional Company,2020-06-13,1.0,Retail Employee,Decent benefit plan (although only medical options are High Deductible w/ HSA); some decent retirement benefits; telecommute options available,"The cons definitely outweigh the pro's of this company. The company has little to no regard for their employee's well-being. Salary & Wages are below market in many areas of the company; they emphasize customer service via NPS Scores from customer surveys (but really want you to cross-sale and sell their useless Virtual Wallet Checking account so the customer has three accounts to manage & thet can collect more fees); they have use COVID19 as a rational to completely shut down their branch lobby's to force customers to buy into their ""digital bank"" concept, while customer's sit for hours at drive-thru's to conduct their banking from their car; customer service call center reps are all virtual with little to no support from useless group & team leads who refuse to take customer escalation calls; and force their consultants to either hang up on the abusive customer or ""wear the customer down"" to the point they finally give up, resulting in them calling back even more irate. Their website and mobile banking platform is atrocious and pre-1990 along with their computer/phone systems. Customers repeatedly are disconnected on by their phone IVRU or while on hold because their phone system cannot handle load & employees are virtual with various ISP and connections involved. Customer's get locked out of their OLB freuquenty; debit card declines for ""suspicious activity"" and do not leave messages or allow customers to reply via text to red flag alerts confirming debit card activity. Lastly, they treat their employees as disposable. I resigned my position, notified my manager (via email because due to the pandemic; I was working from home). No acknowledgment, no phone call, but she sure had my network access terminated. Thankfully, I had already took a distribution from my 401(k) and rolled it over to my IRA before they shut off my access (i.e. I knew they would do something like this to hold up my money and final paycheck, so I called up HR several weeks before turning in my notice, told them to process a full distribution for COVID19 hardship & rolled it over into my IRA BEFORE turning in my resignation). Very bad company & very bad top management."

They strongly support movement up within the company, to the point of offering paid shadowing opportunities in whichever position you would like. They also offer bonuses for meeting specs. They are also very charity oriented and allow employees to participate in their charity events, sometimes paid.","Part-time employees are taken advantage of, being regularly scheduled 32-39.9 hours and only receiving half of the benefits of full-time employees. Also, it is still 5-6 days a week, just for an hour or  less a day. You are also made to work 2 Saturdays every month, at the nearest bank open on Saturdays. At the branch level, the employees are very competitive and vindictive in order to get promoted within the branch or to make themselves look better.  I learned this the hard way, not expecting that level of despicable behavior.
Customer surveys are very heavily relied on for bonuses and can effect your bonus even if it had nothing to do with you. Its all about the stars you receive. Meeting metrics, even as a teller, can be tied to your pay. They turn you into a sales person. Pay is low compared to the market, however, if you factor in the full-time employee benefits, it could be a win for you depending on your needs."

Managers ridicule the employees asking for an action or guideline during this phase of health epidemic. Employee will be held responsible for contracting the virus cause he might have gone to do grocery or have met/living with any friends/family.

-Three weeks of vacation is nice, but they dictate when you are allowed to take it, and will readily turn down vacation requests. 
-Touts  work/ life balance, then puts you on the schedule 6 days a week..... EVERY WEEK. 
- severely understaffed branches with severely overworked employees
- will move you to a new location without even giving you a say, even if that new location is a 2 hour one way commute... they don't care about employees! 
- if you want to be a banker this is not the place for you. At PNC you are a sales rep, and SALES are the only thing they care about. They expect you to push products, even if they are not in the clients best interest.. TOTALLY UNETHICAL! 
- the pay is absolute garbage for the industry
- very high employee turnover. I only worked there a little over a year and cycled through 4 different managers... IN A YEAR! 
- there is zero constancy in anything since employees and management are constantly leaving
- will make you drive during a blizzard because management threatend termination for calling out during a snow storm. The real kicker here is that once everyone risked their lives getting to the branch,  we finally got the call that they were indeed closing for the day,  so everyone got to risk their lives again navigating in the storm home. 
- let me reiterate: PNC does not care about employees. Take your hard work and dedication and bring it to a company that will actually appreciate it."

Coworkers while lacking in ability are generally nice people and lower mgmt does seem to care as much as they're allowed to.,"Incompetent coworkers EVERYWHERE. Lack of training in cross depts leaves a qualified few to pick up the pieces of everyone else mistakes. To the point you wonder how this bank keeps any customers. High turn over of employees. Very few opportunities to advance beyond a notch or two above a normal consultant. Benefits dont cover any costs with insurance. The upper management decisions and goals are set clearly by people who dont know the jobs being performed and has been steadily growing more and more away from employee friendly policies constantly squeezing more out of you while never paying you a penny more for it. Communication of important information and changes typically comes far too late. Directly witnessed failure of upper management to follow thru on promises of pay and incentives and no one seemed to care,  border line wage theft. This might be a good place to get your foot in the door in your first career or so but most dont stay longer than 2 years or so for good reason. By then the company doesnt care to promote you or train you more than necessary. Your just a number to them."

Super thin staffing for what's expected and more asked for each day. Endless Skype meetings to justify a non customer facing employee's existence.

They want top performance from people that are brand new to banking, banker pay is worse than the teller pay at our competitors, and the bank pretends to be a culture driven bank. I think it's very hard for anywhere to be low paying & demand top performance, while claiming to being employee focused. Better to just admit what you are. Examples: BoA, bad culture - high performance requirements - but well paid. First Citizens - low pay, low/medium performance expectations, good culture.

ALSO, the computers constantly crash on you and the internet goes down during important tasks. the tech and hr do not care. then you are rated on how you perform by the client. if they give you less then 10/10 then everyone gets mad at you. even if they get the low score, they still get mad at the new person and blame it on them because there has been a ""change"". its just bullying at it's finest. overall, it is a hostile environment that pays the bills."

As a result, the general work environment is based on fear, no work/life balance and employee burn out. The company supposedly embraces work/balance, but senior management doesn't seem to question why employees quit often, many times just by walking out. The work itself is interesting, but divide between the teams (which in some instances is borderline bullying), excessive workload, the unreasonable expectations which change and increase often, the outdated systems that break frequently and management's unwillingness to even listen to employee's recommendations for improvement, fosters a very toxic working environment. As a result of these issues, employees have to work very long hours for weeks on end. Even taking vacation time or getting sick is a cause of major stress, because of the amount of hours we have to work to make sure the work is done on time, so basically, the paid time off is paid back. There is no communication. The QA group has more power on investigators' performance ratings than their managers, who are afraid to challenge QA management."

Some departments offer work from home ability.","The longer you are in a department the more vulnerable you become. I have been in this department for three years and the roster has gone from 30 employees to 10 with no new hires. You will get a 1% raise whether you cure cancer or just do the minimum. If you are promoted, it takes two years before your pay is bumped up into the target range and that is if you’re performance jives with middle management’s agenda. If you do have the ambition to rise to the top, you are told you must move from department to department, or in some cases to other companies, before you be considered for a promotion. 

Pay is below industry standard and a badge of honor for upper management. Those higher up consistently advise lower employees with designs on moving through the company of they want more pay, they’re better off somewhere else. 

Department managers are mandated what rankings they can give their employees, including being forced to rank at least one employee as unsatisfactory even if they are adequate. 

Middle management is not well-versed in the departments they run but use the basic knowledge they have to stall departmental developments with petty discussions about procedures that have been altered several times over, in a calendar year. 

Computer/based trainings that are broad-stroke, press release material are passed to all employees no matter how little they may relate to their job function. Middle management then gets bonuses based on lower level employees completing the training timely, meaning middle management ensures top priority is placed on the computer-based training and not the actual job functions assigned to each employee. 

Middle management is constantly monitoring department managers, on the look out for any wrongdoing that they can throw in their faces. In my specific department, three years ago, there were three department managers. Middle management has trimmed that to one, making sure that department manager shoulders all three of the former managers’ responsibilities, plus departmental audits, and then slaps that manager with an unsatisfactory rating ensuring they will not have to give that manager a raise. Middle management is constantly loading up the department manager with meetings so that the department manager is rarely available to help employees, or complete their own individual assignments, and then gets docked for not completing certain tasks.

There is a general aura of anxiety once you walk in the door as you await your department’s inevitable deletion."

Goals are relatively nonexistent ... given the high level business model tends to change every two years and the organization Always seems to be in a “figuring it out” mode. 

Product set within the asset management group is solid but far behind the curve of other competitors and big names. 

Mentality tends to be one that employees should be grateful to be employed and to be allowed to do business on behalf of PNC. 

Bonuses and raises are subject to whoever your manager is at the time and if they are new to their role expect upper management to give minimal dollars so they can afford to pay those who are at risk of leaving due to chronic under-compensation and appreciation."

My peers are great.","Technology is HORRIBLE. Why anyone banks with PNC is beyond me. 

Middle managers think they know everything, they don’t listen to opposing or new  points of view.   Any attempt at innovation is looked at with contempt. Frequent turnover from the top down in Comms. Great colleagues are chased away by paranoid middle managers who pick favorites and dump 
on everyone else. I’ve seen people nearly get fired because a manager messes up, and she blames someone on her team. (All the managers are women, so I’m not calling out a specific person.)

Middle managers don’t seem to actually get any work done, not unless you consider scheming  against their own peers work. They produce NOTHING! They spend their time micromanaging  and “sitting in” on meetings they don’t need to attend. They are supposed to be developing their teams, but “just don’t have the time” to do any real coaching. 

  We have managers who report to other managers and people with the title of manager who don’t manage anyone.  When eNPS scores come in low, we do a lot of talking but nothing changes. People won’t speak up because they fear retaliation. 

HR, employee relations and upper management talk a whole lot about creating a great place to work. I haven’t seen a single positive change. Things just get progressively worse. 

Also, healthcare benefits have gotten lousy."

Training isn’t too bad, but they throw you to the wolves to answer calls before you’re even finished training. You will get calls about things you haven’t learned yet and have to place clients on hold to reach out to a mentor for help.  But at the same time they don’t want you to place people on hold long or have long phone calls. They micromanage everything you do. They monitor your computer at all times & if they ‘think’ you’re not paying attention or taking too long to read a training module, they will ask you what you’re doing. They have 3 quality calls a month, which isn’t too bad. But even when you have good ones, they find something to pick apart that seems like they’re just reaching for something to complain about.  They are very strict about schedule adherence, which can be difficult if you have an elderly client having issues with OLB. They want to make sure you have great first call resolution, but don’t want you to completely help someone walk through the issue they’re having. When I was in training & transition over half of our class had quit (went from 17 teammates to 8) because the company just has horrible training, transition and procedures"

Not allowed certain promotions if you are not a designated lender (6 home lending apps in a rolling 6 month period), but if you apply from outside of PNC it's not like they know how many apps you have, so how is that fair to existing employees. The raises amount to almost nothing. The salary is not competitive at all. The pressure at this company for production helps me understand why some people at wells fargo did what they did. I don't even know 1 branch that's not short staffed. I had 14 customer engagement surveys with 12/14 perfect scores, 1 was negative because the client loved me but had an ongoing banking issue, the other was average.

If you leave PNC, health insurance ends on your last day of employment. Several reviews were posted about PNC Capital Advisors, but they have been wiped out from Glassdoor.

The turnover rate is ridiculous, and it takes anywhere from 4-12 months to hire anyone new. You’re constantly doing another positions job without the pay. If upper management comes to visit a branch, they never correct you on issues then and there. Instead, you’ll get a mile long email about what went wrong.

The  business is stable and the bonuses are very high for this part of APM (nearly 20%).  That said, not all groups within APM get this much bonus.  The company is very spread out, so you interact with people all over the country.  Some might not like that, but I did.  Having strong understanding of SAS, Tableau, and Python will help a lot.  Company culture is really strong too.  Lots of employee groups for minorities.  Ample training and management is willing to spend to improve it.","The base salary only increases <1%.  The healthcare benefits are mediocre.  Highly recommend you meet the extra health fitness goals to add more money into your HSA.  The technology is changing rapidly, but there aren't enough resources (both $$$ for equipment and manpower).  It seems like people come and go in waves every 2-4 years.

Branch manager was a hard person to reach out for help and didn't make anything personable..Didn't help when short staffed. If mistakes were made, you just get asked what you did wrong rather than actually thoroughly explaining and reviewing it again so I make sure I have it correct.  And just get told ""do you have any questions?"" There is no ""team work"" at the branch i worked at. Very two faced enviroment. Everyone is in it to further themselves & they will do ANYTHING for a promotion or advancement. Felt like you couldn't have small talk with coworkers when nobody was in the branch. Nobody is helpful. If you ask a question for reassurance, you get in trouble(I asked occasionally) but if you made a mistake because you didn't ask, you'd get in trouble. Even if you know your customers that come in you have to follow script & say ""welcome to PNC, how can i assist you today?"" Thats annoying to some that come in often. I had words put in my mouth because ""someone"" told a ""coworker"" I bad mouthed PNC. I didnt talk to anyone about work, ever. It was definitely held against me the whole 2 3/4 months I was employed there because it was mentioned on 3 different occasions. I felt like I was walking on egg shells towards the end even though I was confident when I 1st started. Because I felt like my job security was threatened I started making minor mistakes on transactions. I started to get nervous & double thinking things because I didn't want to be terminated. I honestly felt like I was set up to fail. I didn't ""fit"" in at the branch so I felt like they found every reason to get rid of me. i wouldn't recommend a job here to anyone. They let me work a entire day & take a lunch before they terminated me!!!! 2 hours before my shift was over. Many customers have a problem at this branch as well.

Many who are promoted do not have any people skills especially the young Team Leaders. It's bad enough you get crappy abusive customers, but the pressure during your shift to meet metrics from your Team Leader adds to the misery. It is like they are whipping you constantly. And if a customer is abusive toward you, it's your fault.  You are just a work horse. There are so many phony rah rah kiss your behind people it's sickening. Try to get a Team Ieader to do a call takeover, they won't do it. You are left scrambling to get help on a call and if you can't get it, tough, it's your own fault. Plus your AHT is screwed. The work at home option is the only good part about working here, and even with that, it's not really worth the abuse heaped on you every day."

2912,,In-Store: Chaotic and Unprofessional,2019-05-09,1.0,Branch Sales and Service Associate,"Good for people new to banking, but don't plan to stay here long","PNC currently has a 61% turnover rate which means that employees are constantly leaving the company before ever acquiring the skills to actually do the job well. Due to this, you're left with unprofessional, inexperienced employees who don't know what they're doing. This causes unnecessary stress to both the clients and the more tenured employees who pick up the slack.

Due to this, experienced employees are expected to take on additional work and responsibilities for no extra pay with the idea that in the future this will help them with advancement opportunities that never actually become available. PNC doesn't care about how much you do to maintain the work environment or assist customers with complaints, even though these things take time and are an integral part of the job. They only care about sales. 

While this is understandable for a sales position, the degree to which PNC pressures their employees is unreasonable. They also tend to hold certain employees to a higher standard than others. Even those employees that don't pull their weight or hardly show up to work as assigned are rarely punished in the same capacity as a generally reliable employee who fails to meet their sales goals by a miniscule amount.

In the in-store environment, you are expected to have the same high quality conversations as a stand alone branch banker is capable of without the same perks. You are constantly expected to interrupt your conversation with a client in order to assist with the teller line which limits your sales productivity exponentially. 

Since you don't have your own space to conduct your work and everyone is capable of overhearing your conversations with others, clients are reluctant to have in-depth financial conversations due to privacy concerns (when those conversations aren't inevitably interrupted as mentioned earlier).

In-store is expected to have activities going constantly to attract clients,  but are given a miniscule budget with which to do so. This is on top of going into the aisles to gain potential clients which makes us look like used car salesmen in lunch lady smocks that work for the grocery store and not a reputable bank that can do more than just cash out checks. Trying to gain the respect of clients as ""financial consultants"" amidst the inexperience of your colleagues in such an environment is laughable at best."

2920,,State of Confusion,2019-05-05,1.0,Senior Applications Developer,The company is financially stable.,"Their have been major changes in the IT departments during the last 5 years under the 'VISION 13' program.

There has been a rush to agile and  the creation of Change the Bank teams for development work and Run the Bank teams for day to day support work.

The company is trying to transition from waterfall to agile for all application no matter what the attributes of the application are.

Not all applications work well with agile.

The back end mainframe applications that  execute ALL of the business logic for the bank and contain the applications that are the system of record were not meant for agile.   

 These application are under a ton of government regulation (after all every bank has to pay FDIC deposit insurance) and quick on the fly decisions by an agile crew does not work.  

One of the big problems is how to incorporate legal into the agile crews.

In addition, the company had to hire a ton of Agile Scrum master and agile coaches.

It seems that none of these people know banking.

  Also it is almost impossible to work on a change that does not impact other applications or other projects.  

What makes matters worse the QA testing is the worst I have ever seen in my entire IT career.

The QA testing teams are made up of a strange mix of contractors, off shore
contractors and maybe a few FTE employees.

They seem to have very little knowledge about the applications they test and it seems like the developers have to write the test scripts for them and execute most of the testing and then all the testers do is file the information in the repository that stores QA test results. 

The technology executives seem to know nothing about banking and seem to exist in their own elitist culture and they do not value the employees at all.

At the moment, the applications are very unstable.

The change management process seems to change almost weekly.

Most of the developers are not happy and the application managers are not happy.

The atmosphere at work is very negative and almost toxic.

Management wants no production problems but they keep making decisions that creates more production problems.

One of the biggest problems is the lack of application SMEs.

The scrum masters want to assign work to anyone on their crew but many times
nobody on the crew has worked in the application they want to change.

Changes move to production and production issues are created.

There are not enough SMEs on both the Change Bank Side and the Run the bank side to mentor the non lead developers.

It will be interesting to see if the current state of affairs can be corrected.

As far as benefits are concerned, the health insurance plans offered are very high
deductible health insurance plans.

These are not very employee friendly."
2921,,Horrible,2019-05-04,1.0,Personal Banker,Nice branch feels like a modern home,Everything you have a cash box as a banker
2922,,"A bureaucrats dream company, tons of paperwork and unwieldy processes",2019-05-03,2.0,Software Engineer Lead,"Most IT people are very nice, and helpful.  Remote work is nice.  They say work/life balance, and sometimes it works out, and many times it doesn't.","Executive IT managements solutions to any application failures is a punishing amount of documentation and excessive paranoia.    And because of recent release failures, even more documentation and draconian release policies are coming.  For example, in the past for a typical release, you could have 1 Change Request in ServiceNow, and list all your changes.  Now, the desired practice is 1 CR for each change.  Which means, you can easily have 12 to 20 CR's to manage.  You would think there is any easy to manage them, open/close them, etc.  But you would be mistaken.   If you are in Production Support, then at least 50% of your time will be spent in needless paperwork.  The real point of all the separate CR's is to game the system, since upper IT executives only see the CR level detail, so it's better to have an application fail 1 CR out of 20, than to fail 1 of 20 tasks in 1 CR, since 1 task failure fails the entire CR.   This is because apps are required to have a 99% success release rate.   And even if the issues during the release aren't your fault, but say the DB or server teams, your CR will still fail, and your team will bear the brunt of the excessive paperwork.  The other teams won't do anything.  Most of the shared services teams are very good at passing the buck back to you.  

Upper IT Management is now pushing Agile/Devops as the lastest buzzword, as if that will solve all the problems (perhaps it will solve their bonus problem).  They are at least 10 years late to Agile/Scrum, with many companies beginning to abandon Scrum specifically as a flawed process in general, treating developers like interchangeable cogs, which they aren't.  There's usually 1 developer on a team who is more productive than most of the others combined, but sure let's just keep thinking all are equal in ability and skill.  

They have also been touting DevOps as the saving process for Production support, and claim reduction in paperwork & easy standup of new environments, etc.  But they've been pushing DevOps for 2 years, and instead, paperwork and need for approvals has increased.  It still takes months to move into a new environment due to excessive paperwork and approvals.  

  An example of PNC's fine management process is their Firewall process, they have 2 separate systems to enter FW requests (yes one is going away, but both have coexisted for almost a year now).  And if you don't want to wait well over 2 weeks to get your request done, you must escalate through a designated person, who then must add it to a Sharepoint site, to escalate a SN request.  You would think with the whole DevOps strategy, they would've already enabled all FW request management within SN.  But apparently they can't even keep 1 SN developer on board since in the past year we've gone through a few.  

  Then let's talk about the really well planned Agile patching process (sarcasm). You get to pick what dates you wish to get your apps environments patched.   But they commonly overrule what is best for your app, and schedule a different day.    

  On top of that, the Microsoft IIS team must hire people who have no experience, since they commonly have no idea how to encrypt connection strings, and forgot to enable settings.  What should be done in 30 minutes can take a couple hours when a IIS person come on.   Then often you ask them for control and do what needs done, since they give up, and realize they don't know what they are doing."

Especially when it means you save them money, create money for them, and help them build a financial future.","As time wore on and my direct manager who promoted me was promoted, unfortunately a company so focused on diversity hired someone who was not capable of leading an award winning branch. He only stood in the shadows of his predispose position and predecessor.  The company thinks that if all employees follow a certain # of objectives, then all branch's will have as much success as its most successful branch. While it does help the few, it does not help the many, but instead lead to low motivation and lack of enjoyment in any and all outcomes.

I will be making less than what was in the offer letter but still be doing the same job. With the shift I work I was suppose to receive shift differential for the full 8 hours I work each day. Now you will only get the shift differential if you work past 5pm and weekends. That means I will be making hundreds less every month!"
2933,,They changed our compensation package while we were in training,2019-04-26,3.0,Remote Core Consultant,"Work from home
They treat you like royalty for the first month and not so nice treatment thereafter.","The terms of the offer letter of employment were changed after we settled in to our roles (the announcement was made while in training). We were told the shift differential would no longer be paid out for the entirety of 2nd shift even though the offer letter stated we would be paid shift diff for the full shift. Now for 2nd shift workers, the shift diff only applies for the hours that fall after 5pm EST. That turns out to be a difference of a few hundred dollars a month.

When our offers of employment were provided, I am pretty sure they knew they were planning to change it. So why would you do that to your workers and trick them into accepting something that you were planning to do away with?

You are on the phones for the entire day after one month of training. They do have coaches to help assist you with locating procedures. A few of the coaches are friendly. Few opportunities to talk with your manager are provided. 

The calls are literally back to back for the entirety of the shift. The longest lull between calls has been about 2-3 seconds and that was only a few times. 

Considering how their approach to servicing customers needs tremendous work, they find a way to make their lack of forethought and planning your fault. There are many errors with the systems. 

Personally, I feel like I am being taken advantage of."

The best thing could be that you work with great people, and that’s entirely dependent on location.","The pay is the lowest in the industry. Worse yet, this company is not the best at anything they do. High fees for basic banking, I would rather bank at Huntington or Key bank  if I needed a low/NO fee account. If I needed investments I’d go through fidelity or Charles Schwab. For business solutions I’d go through Huntington. If I needed a loan I’d go through a credit union, century federal credit union probably. Extremely limited lending options... If I wanted a bank with the best technology I’d go through Chase bank which I do. If I want a premier bank I’d go through Chase, almost every bank has better credit cards than PNC.  They are slow and ossifying and averse to adapting... this is a disappointing company, they think and act like they are much larger than they are.

When serious conflicts between managers and employees arise, human resources and employee relations stand firmly on the side of the manager. The best an employee can do in his or her own defense is to hire a lawyer... or have friends in high places. 

The bank has a poor technology infrastructure and for some reason, in spite of throwing millions of dollars to build new systems and fix problems, nothing seems to improve. 

PNC is well behind its peers in terms of products and services, but they have great plans for catching up.

Opening, closing accounts without explaining the benefits, fees properly, even witnessed where accounts were closed without a client present.

2977,,Oppressive security restrictions,2019-03-31,3.0,Software Engineer,After reading some of the other reviews for similar positions I think I'm working in a bubble.  In my bubble there is really strong technical manager/leader.  From what I can tell work-from-home is the  norm instead of the exception.  I consider this a huge benefit that offsets the lower than industry pay.  Medical benefit is not cheap it's not out of line with what is the norm these days.  Overall employee benefits are very comprehensive.  The company web site is better than anything I've ever seen with portals to just about anything you can think of for training and benefits easily available.   PNC pays for my Pluralsight subscription so I have unlimited access to this excellent training source.   There are allot of people who have been with PNC (or what was National City) for most of their career so that tells you something positive about what kind of place this is.,The software and network security restrictions are oppressive and big obstacles in getting the technical work done.  I've found my hands tied time and time again because I 1) have no access to articles and videos I need to do research (due to the extreme search engine restrictions imposed by the corporate VPN)  or 2) my machine has limited abilities due to the many layers of security restrictions.   One of reasons for needing to work from home is so you can have your own machine connected to your own unrestricted internet.  That gives you a tool to finally to the information you need to help you do your job.  Of course PNC is a bank and security is terribly important and I guess more important then high price being paid  in lost productivity and employee morale.   It seems that EVERYTHING technical need to be accomplished by filling out a form in one of several different workflow portals.   Generally there is no such thing as calling up someone who you know who works in another area and asking him/her for a favor to help you get things done.   Instead you fill out a form and eventually hear back from some 'resource' who will attempt to help you with your technical request.    d

Extremely poor compensation for promoted employees 10% just doesn’t always cut it. This shows the best employees are not valued and don’t have a future.

They say that being a universal banker makes it easier for the client but it’s just a way for the bank to save money. I asked whose in charge of operations and I was told “we all are”.

Somewhat okay health insurance plans that are inclusive with dental and vision with optional HSA. 

401K options are actually pretty good, employer match.

Co-workers tend to be friendly and just as lost as you by the sheer magnitude of vague or difficult-to-come-by knowledge to do the job- GREAT BONDING EXPERIENCE!","The word ""con"" is apt to describe PNC. I've worked here for over two years and was lured in based on my customer service and small-peas management experience with the promise of health insurance and a steady paycheck in return for giving the customer what amounts to completely inexperienced financial advice and a difficult time at the teller line- which will likely be understaffed or moving slowly because we need to relay “insights” to customers during their transaction. You might be told to “hold the receipt hostage” depending on how desperate the branch manager is to keep up with goals.

You will get approximately 2 weeks of training, after which you will be responsible for recognizing literally any and all of the thousand  red-flags of potential fraudulent transactions as well as little to no help from the giant pile of garbage that is their 'intranet'. It’s hilarious; they literally have an entire department devoted to searching their own intranet when you call for help because you can't find a procedure or guide for your particular situation; what they email you is 50% likely to even remotely answer the question. 

There are also too many internal departments to name. I have a cheat sheet currently in my desk that is two pages, 12-font Times New Roman of contact info.  Your best hope is to be working with someone who's been there long enough to compile a working folder of internal contact numbers or email addresses to use... which, depending on which way the breeze blows, could arbitrarily be of no use because human logic doesn't necessarily flow alongside PNC logic. Be prepared for a customer’s request for service to somehow take 4 hours out of your day just to find out how to do a thing the way PNC wants it to be done.

They don’t want the customer in the branch so they can cut costs but then they realized that by pushing customers out that they were missing out on investment and credit card opportunities so now their business model of branch employee sales is more brutal and unrealistic with PNC reaping all the reward and none of the risk. On the flipside, the branch employee’s reward is $6 for the sale and the risk of any and all legal, ethical or dubious policy ramifications.

The ""financial well-being"" cult vibe is a bit surreal. They will attempt to force-feed you a strange new PNC language and actually admit to employing psychological tactics that they contract outside companies to tailor to the PNC brand and model as a way to brainwash you into thinking it’s acceptable for PNC to thrust any and all risk onto your shoulders and want you to be glad for it when you should run screaming. They want you to sell but they tell you to use different phrases so they don't get in hot water with consumer watch-dog groups. You'll be tasked with cold-calling people but they will dub it ""multi-channel calls"" and (though they hand you a script and say ""this is only what you're allowed to say” for legal coverage) you'll be under immense pressure by all forms of management to deviate from script to get people in your office... to sell them anything and everything regardless of what reasoning you tell your customer they need to come in. If you are not a sociopath, desperate or even if you just desire to FOLLOW WHAT THEY THEMSELVES SAY ABOUT ETHICAL SALES…you will likely show up on multiple naughty reports that get forwarded in vast email chains to your (as well as your co-worker's) embarrassment -usually highlighted in a bright Disappointment-Red. I roughly receive 6 emails a day about the double-digit regional credit card goals, where we are with it and chain-email demands of almost every employee in the region cc’d to make the goal. Goal Goal GOAL GOAL GOAL CREDIT CARD credit card CREDIT CARD EVERYBODY NEEDS A CREDIT CARD even if they don’t know it yet, etc.

When you take this job you just have to make an important decision: Which way do you prefer to fail? If your wish was to excel in honest customer service then you’ll likely be disappointed because you actually don’t have any authority to take ownership of a problem 90% of the time. If you wish to excel in sales then good luck having the time in the day, an appropriately staffed branch and using multiple software programs they require you to input every action you’ve taken per customer (you’d get alcohol poisoning if you drank every time you had to document the same information). If you wish to not get fired for violating one of many policy, fraud, loss prevention or ethical sales practice rules then-I’m just kidding! There isn’t a real choice in that scenario because if you work there long enough you’re getting fired because you’ll have violated something you were unaware of or you will accidently have missed that a check you deposited for someone was in some way fraudulent or you should have known that a customer had fallen victim to a scam or (in a co-worker’s case) you didn’t click a box in the service browser that the entire branch staff was unaware was a requirement since we didn’t have a manager for several months  to hover over our every waking breath."

- Vacation days. New employees get 15 vacations + 5 sick days + 1 personal day = 21 paid days off. Like the pay it can only go up
- Hours. I worked Mon- Wed 9-5. Thursday and Friday 9-6. Saturday 9-1. Sunday bank is closed. If I worked a Saturday, management would try to schedule me to go home 1-2 hr(s) early on Friday and I had a half day of my choosing Mon-Wed
- PNC offers 401k's. I personally didn't have one set up but my coworkers always asked me why because I guess PNC matched well. It's a pro because they at least offer one.","Now for the cons
- If you've never worked retail and can't handle customers freaking out. DO NOT work here or any other financial institution. Everybody has probably seen a person freak out at a store. Now imagine that but their money situation got messed up.
- If you don't like making sales probably not for you. The bank doesn't magically make money. It makes money through interest rates on credit cards and loans and people have to sell them. 
- Management. I know it's in the pros. I was fortunate enough to have good management but like I said it's dependent on branch and region.
I put those cons just for people that have never worked for banks
Now for the real con
- The only real con I could think of is cold calling. Now personally hated cold calling because I hate getting cold called. Usually people don't like cold calls and freak out when banks call them because its usually not good news."
3064,,"Hawthorn, PNC",2019-02-05,1.0,Senior Advisor,"Based on experience with other corporations, I see no pros for PNC that you wouldn’t find anywhere.  Nothing outstanding or unique.",Employee Relations are abominable.  They will lie for the protection of management.  Senior management in Hawthorn is inexperienced with no prior corporate working experience and it is evident. Watch EEOC violations.
3065,,Dont waste your time,2019-02-05,1.0,"Vice President, Wealth Management","Good for breaking into the industry and getting exposure. The work is super easy, but time consuming because of all the internal red type.","The company is based on lies. Clients do not come first at the institution. PNC can talks a big game to prospective clients about how we will service, how good we are etc, but once they are in the door, PNC forgets about them until they want to leave. PNC also has a ton of management turnover. Its not uncommon to see a regional manager change 3 times in a year. 
Employees paid based on sales commision are not compensated fairly. Over the years, PNC has found more ways to pay their employees less while requiring more work. Management will lie to your face in every all hands meeting, town hall meeting, quarterly meeting etc. Its a real insult to the employees because it implies we are too dumb to see through it.  
All honesty, they are getting away with theft from their employees. Majority of them are over qualified and under paid. Discretionary Bonus's do not reflect performance. You can beat all expectations and generate $100M in revenue and still get paid nothing. Promotions do not mean higher pay either. You can go from level 1 to SR VP and only get a raise of $7,500 total over the course of 5-10 years.  Do not work here if you have self respect."

Upper Management is absolutely clueless and retaliates if they revive push back or constructive criticism.  Those that do question the actions of management are labeled as someone playing the victim and/or ""difficult to work with"".

3)  One of their pillars is quality of life but they made it impossible to have one.  They cut staffing to the point that no one could find coverage or even take realistic time off.

3121,,PNC is a Good Company,2018-12-19,4.0,Universal Branch Specialist,"PNC offers many opportunities to advance your career and into different lines of business if that is what you wish to do.

PNC has kept its promise on setting the minimum wage to $15/hr. It makes me very happy to know that many out there are now earning a decent wage, especially in low income areas.

Work culture is awesome! Co-workers tend to have good tendencies. A lot of support from management and a lot of coaching occurs to promote career growth.

Middle and upper management are amazing! They have genuinely demonstrated that they care about their subordinates career growth and development as well as their concerns.

401k match up to 4%. PNC ensures that employees are saving at least $2,000 in their 401k by the end of the year. They do so by depositing additional money into their 401k to reach the $2,000 threshold (employee must be contributing at least 4%).

PNC offers a pension plan! It is a dying breed in this day and age but PNC has us covered. The best part is, it's all funded by the company, so there is no need to contribute. The cash balance earns interest!

Three weeks paid vacation, one paid personal day, six paid occasional absence leave (sick leave), ten paid holidays off, adoption assistance, educational assistance and much more!","Raises more than 10% have to be approved by Market Managers and above.

PNC is becoming a bit sales aggressive, which is ok with me, but not with most. Sometimes we have to stay past business hours to get Investment & Retirement appointments scheduled. This includes branches that already succeeding during regular business hours.

Loan support analysts and the underwriting department are notorious for not answering phone calls, returning calls, responding to emails, etc. I do not appreciate receiving an email from them saying that if I have any questions, I should contact them. When I do contact them, it's futile. There has only been one loan support analyst that has been absolutely fabulous and deserves all of the recognition in the world.

PNC only offers high deductible health plans. It gets very expensive for those that have families.

Overtime is highly discouraged. They will either have you come in at a later time, have you leave early, or make you take a longer lunch if you are at risk of hitting overtime.

High turnover due to absurdly low pay. It's slowly improving though."

- Decent benefits and employee resources","PNC is not atypical within corporate America -- but it is certainly just as appalling and unethical as any other bank, it simply wields many jargon-laced smoke screens with which to shield itself. My manager barely acts like a human being. In fact, almost none of the upper management (especially the corporate sales reps from other departments) are human-like at all. Speaking to them, it's like there is not a single genuine bone in their body, like the humanity has been slowly winnowed out of their soul. I've sat in on meetings and calls where not a single direct, or useful, thing was said in two entire hours. 

They are attempting to turn their employees into jargon-spewing monsters, too; utter automatons. Positioning and capability statements are gross and no one - particularly not younger people - will ever be drawn in by an in-person commercial delivered by a robotic employee. With the heavy sales focus, we are highly incentivized to focus all of our attention to wealthy clients while ignoring the impoverished and those with genuine need. The overdraft fees are predatory and atrocious - and PNC is content to continue to milk the elderly and physically disabled for fees that continue to make their financial life a source of stress and chaos. 

I've been tempted to recommend customers like that to another bank. 

I genuinely hope that when younger people garner the reins of power from institutions like these, that the bloodsucking corporate leeches are thrown out. 

Also, voiceCX is terrible. How is a 6.79 out of 7 a 4 star score? Please stop basing your employees confidence on the COMPLETELY arbitrary whims of customers who may simply be disgruntled about policy, or angry, or even prejudiced. I love almost all of my customers but there are some genuinely nasty people with similar moral character to the PNC higher ups, that just don't care about others, and enjoy tapping one star reviews on their phone to make themselves feel better. I've seen some of the people who leave our branch google reviews and many of them have never left a single rating on any business that wasn't one star."

3195,,"Stagnancy, no development",2018-10-25,3.0,Recruiting Administrator,"My position as a Recruiting Administrator was painfully easy. After two weeks I knew what I was doing like the back of my hands, it was just all data entry. There was no analytical thought involved. Hardly a day was stressful because if you're decently competent, you won't encounter errors or issues. My team allowed employees to work 1 day a week from home. Jeans every day.","With little responsibility comes little salary. There is not much room for growth in this position. So many of my coworkers had been there for 3-5 years already and were still content making low 30s even though they had children. There is so much stagnancy and no desire to develop oneself, unless you're willing to wait at least 3-5 years for even a 10% salary increase once. I made mention at my mid-year performance review that I was eager to move up within the role and wanted to eventually become a recruiter. My boss all but insulted me by telling me I was too eager and needed to ""put my time in like everyone else"". My boss was basically greedy and didn't want to give up competent employees even though a good manager would want to see their employees succeed and move on.  I was told that if I wanted to be a recruiter it would be about a 5-8 year process just to get to Recruiter I. I ultimately left this role to take a Recruiter I position at another company... in one year. Management here was extremely micro-managey and even acknowledged that they were by saying, ""well if you don't want your boss in your cube, don't make a mistake"". Regarding ""mistakes"" - if one portion of your data entry had a mistake in it, be prepared to hear about it for a whole month and have everyone able to see that you made one mistake on a daily error log. Like I mentioned, it's just very juvenile feeling - the low pay, the babysitting management, the scarlet lettering of one mistake (that can, by the way, be fixed easily and hardly affects the hiring process). Oh, might I mention too - be prepared to enter a world of political correctness. Don't mention that you like to go to the bars or utilize online dating apps, and don't even think about using a cuss word or you'll feel like you're back in the principal's office.  Overall, the job was mind-numbingly easy that I certainly didn't mind going in every day, but the low pay, no room for growth, and the micro-managing was all too much to bear. I ultimately left the company for a $15k raise and came back 6 months later retaining that pay raise."

Generous with support to local community.,Disgusting behavior by Bank President hiring someone with NO previous clerical experience into the highest level of admin support in the bank.  A receptionist whose  primary responsibility was answering the phone went to sitting on the executive floor with EAs who have 25+ years' admin experience.  Embarrassing.  Many employees with admin experience and demonstrated loyalty to PNC applied for the job posting but NO interviews took place - ZERO.  Elitist behavior making a mockery out of the performance review and job posting processes.  Contradicts the image PNC portrays as an all-inclusive employer.  Empty words.  Shame on senior management and HR for allowing this to happen.
3212,,Credit Card Sales < Everything,2018-10-13,1.0,Teller,"-Great job to start a career, if your previous work experience is weak
-Consistent hours
-Good PTO/sick days (although with many restrictions)
- Working at any bank will teach you a lot about how businesses operate and how our financial system works. If you go into it with the spirit of a student, you will learn a lot.","- Credit cards are clearly the main focus. 90% of all emails from management are related to promoting credit card sales. Additionally, those goals are increased each year, despite the customer base already being saturated. I've had customers who had 3 CCs with PNC, and the sales software would still indicate they should be offered another CC.

- Compensation does not track with the level of responsibility and does not motivate employees to excel. Fast food restaurants in my area oftentimes paid as much as teller positions, even though tellers are required to handle $100,000+ in transactions daily. You're also more likely to be robbed/harmed in a teller position. Some of my coworkers had been robbed 4 times in 20 years.

- Sales incentives are absolutely pathetic. Low level employees (tellers) are required to generate most of the leads, but yet they receive the least for every lead generated. Branch managers and financial advisors make significantly more off of the sales then the people actually starting the conversation. A flat $6 commission on a product the bank will make 12% on annually (based on investor reports)? No thanks.

- Turnover is a huge issue. Hard to find competent, driven employees when pay is so poor. Additionally, even when a branch is operating at 20% staff, the sales goals do not reduce. How is 20% of the staff supposed to still hit 100% of goal? Personally experienced this pressure.

- Loss Prevention is more reactionary than preventive. I witnessed how delayed follow-up from LP resulted in significant losses for the bank and the customer. Also, a flat $25 reward for stopping fraud, even if that fraud is $100,000? Another reason some lazier employees were not always vigilant."

-They do try to keep people engaged
-The Help Desk is generally useful.  You'll be using this a lot.","All of these cons are in the Retail space.  Other departments may actually be decent places, but stay far away from Retail.

-Employees are nice, but tend not to be the most capable in their fields.  There is a major lack of actual technical talent.
-Due to this, things are in a constant state of pretty much imploding.  Management doesn't listen to technical developers and plans ahead without getting any input about timelines.  Everything then just jams together.
-Because management doesn't have much of an actual life, they expect you not to as well.  Expect calls during the weekends and meetings well after you should have already left.
-There is no desire to change any of this as they only listen to the business who manage to whine their way to getting what they want.
-The business just constantly chases after the best new ideas without any concept of trying to be ahead of things.  They also don't understand anything technical, insisting instead on using 3rd parties that they can stiff if they don't get what they want.  If you are employed by PNC, this will be used against you.
-The idea of using new technology is anathema to PNC.  Expect to use well outdated technology.
-The idea of making anything easy to install or use is anathema as well.  Expect hours of frustration on the phone with the Help Desk.
-Decisions are not communicated well or sometimes at all."

Middle Management/Lower management not capable of training employees properly to achieve the newer aggressive sales goals. Instead of pushing back to upper management and/or asking for support to help employees achieve goals they default to “Produce by all means necessary” culture.

Work/life balance.,"Inaccurate job descriptions... the BSSR position is more commonly referred to as a Switcher. What this means is the multi-billion dollar company PNC is they have decided to invent this role to save money. Instead of hiring a personal banker and a teller they hire one switcher. The switcher will then be required to do both, teller and personal banker. And while they tell you 80% of your time will be spent on the banker side of things do not believe that in the slightest. 
The teller leads do not understand the switcher position and get angry and irritable if you are away from the teller line for more than five minutes. 
Also you are expected to do the work of two full time employees and get paid less than the ones who only do personal banking even though most of the BSSRs would like nothing more than to only do personal banking. 
PNC always says the goal is to improve our clients' financial well-being but apparently the only way to do that is to sell every customer something new. 
Outbound calling is an absolute joke. Named, multi-channel calls, the idea to invite existing customers in and sell them something (all for their financial well-being though).
Also with PNC's rigid and ridiculous fees and rules be prepared for people to come in and scream at you every day especially if you work at a low income branch. But also make sure to sell new things to these people who have no money.
Lastly it becomes difficult for switchers to hit sales goals if they never have time to do what they are hired to. Branches are so understaffed you're lucky to get off of the teller line for more than a few hours throughout the week."

A lot of policies are unnecessarily inconvenient for customers, which will make them angry and cause you to get a bad survey. Few people from the main office will ever assist you, even if it is their responsibility to do so. CIQ is severely inaccurate and unfair, and although the management admits it, they do nothing and still hold it against you if you get a bad survey. Pay is pretty low for the industry.

The company it's self is not bad. You get ""ok"" benefits, and the employee training program is fine.  Most of my hostilities toward the company are a direct result of the manager I worked under, the VP Institutional and Investment Marketing at my branch location. The manager operated the branch based on favoritism. The manager lied to employees, would gossip regularly,  and the manger even brought their children in to work on multiple occasions.  The most frustrating aspect of the position was how the manager would treat the employees. We were often belittled and talked down to. There were even occasions where we were asked to step in the office, only for the manager to close the door and speak to you in a slightly raised hostel tone of voice.  I could see potential with this company, but after my management experience I refused to continue in  a work environment that is toxic.

Pay is a huge issue. New employees wages were increased, but longer tenured employees were not adjusted. There were, and I’m sure still are many cases of employees that have been there 5-10 years making less than a new hire.

If you advance to a specialized area, instead of focusing on that specialization only, the company uses you as overflow to backup other departments, so basically you are often handling 3 or 4 different job roles but not making any additional money. 

The sales culture is poor. I didn’t work personally in sales, but it had become common practice to try and force every customer into a credit card or loan application. I fear that PNC is heading towards a well’s Fargo type situation. Base pay is not great, and the only way to make decent money is sales that are hard to get while being ethical."

Also a lot of talent has left this company because they promote from within but won’t pay you anymore than 10% to take on 25x more responsibility
This company still runs MS-DOS and mainframe based platforms.

Customer complaints are often extreme as customers threaten to leave this company daily, however most clients are not in position to do so because PNC lends amounts almost impossible to refinance to customers who don’t understand credit or banking.  No accountability anywhere within this company. 

Company also plays favorites on developing who they want. If they like you management will speak to you daily if they don’t you’ll only hear from them if you do something wrong.

Compliance is way over the top, making it difficult to do business with them.  Staffing is horrible throughout the Philadelphia market, most branches have a lot of holes due to firings and employees quitting.  The bank only cares about widgets right now.  Worst experience of my life.

It is typically very easy to bond with coworkers.,"PNC puts on a front as if their employees are they're top priority. That is not the case at all. They will get everything they want from you but as soon as you draw a line you are vilanized and minipulated. Managers are allowed to actually verbally abuse employees, meaning yelling, cursing, ect. My entire region is short staffed because nobody can work with the managers. There are branches where the entire staff quit at the same time. And remaining employees are stretched thin and expected to pick up slack. Also black employees who interview in suburban branches are often placed in urban areas to work instead. The only perk of working at PNC is that you will get a pay check every two weeks. Do not be fooled in training, the branches are a COMPLETELY different experience. PNC has a very high  turnover rate. Most enployees last six months. Customers are surprised when you last more than a year. Also PNC is very far behind as far as technology. It is hard to do your job when your using 10year old equipment, when your computer screen doesn't work, your scanner is broken and the phone drops calls.."

At the end of every quarter you get incentives which is money depending on how many accounts you refer and etc.,Being it customer service/ sales environment when a customer leaves mad or not satisfied that can be a real headache because that customer can destroy you literally.

3783,,First Bank Job and I Love It!,2017-11-09,4.0,Anonymous Employee,I can strongly say I stand behind 98% of PNC's policies and procedures. I liked the company before I became employed there and now I that I work there I can honestly say its great!,I wish you didn't have to be in your position for a year before you can get promoted.
3784,,PNC is a pleasant place to be employed.,2017-11-08,3.0,Pnc Bank Teller,"The benefits are pretty great, especially if you are new to banking. Health Care is decent, you start out with 2 weeks paid vacation (3 weeks after a year) and 6 days of occasional absences (paid days if u have an emergency). There is 3 months of maternity leave after being employed for 6 months, and definite room for growth in this field with the right attitude. They give you a lot of online training when new products and services come out as well.","Sometimes management can be overbearing and insensitive to circumstances. The location I work right now is in the red (the regional decided that when we lost a full time teller that we didn't need another one, we only had one other full timer, switcher, part timer, and teller supervisor at an extremely busy branch. She claimed that due to PNC staffing charts, and our new addition of an assistant business branch manager (she was attempting to have her also trained as a backup teller) we were a fully staffed branch. With little help and being overwhelmed we quickly fell into the red. The branches response is to push the employees harder than before (up our CIQ, referrals, and appointments) or we will start getting write ups. This is NOT normal for a branch and it is pushing some really good employees to find work elsewhere. Not all branches are like this, so it really depends on which branch you are employed at to have the best experience. Management here does not stand up for staff when we are bullied and verbally assaulted by customers, so it's just poorly managed and the moral is low. However, career development is greatly encouraged and many people are promoted within a year. I now make a dollar extra from my base pay and look forward to furthering my career at another branch."
3785,,Branch Manager Position,2017-11-08,4.0,Vice President Manager,Have good quality people around you,Huge sales pressure from upper management

The benefits are GREAT (starting three weeks vacation for all full time employees) and there are flexible work arrangements.  Highly recommend working for PNC.  Company culture is one of care and putting the customer first.  Incredible work/life balance.,Often times the salaries can be lower than competitors because of the increased benefits.
3787,,Operations Development Program,2017-11-06,3.0,Operations Development Program,"The program offered a lot of opportunity to see different things before settling into one career trajectory. It also offered a 5-month ""out of market rotation"" where the company pays for your housing, so upon completion, one can have a lot of savings if you play your cards right. Pittsburgh is also a great city to be in for a few years.","Overall: The program was executed very inconsistently. Some program managers were very unorganized and did not help develop associates at all. Many associates were placed in rotations with no development value or business need whatsoever. Some rotations were insightful and allowed us opportunities to really add value to PNC, but this wasn't always the case.

Talent: The program cohort was made of a generally good group of people, but some of our colleagues and rotational managers were unprofessional. There was inconsistency in this regard as well. I believe that PNC has a big talent problem, with many unintelligent and unprogressive people having been swept into the company over time. 

Salary: Very poor compensation while in the program, with management attempting to stunt your compensation growth as you exit the program. Be wary of how compensation is held against you after you're done."

As much as my boss did go to bat for every employer she had under her, at times we were given work loads with deadlines that were days away; causing our team to be overworked, and lose faith that we were being treated like individuals, rather worker bees. 40-45 hour weeks starting as a contractor, changed to 50+ hr weeks with full time, mandatory weekend and on-call changes at any time, made the idea of life-balance nearly obsolete."

- Annual and mid-year reviews are literally copied word for word each year by management, hence why its easy for them to justify the 2% or no raise. 
- Poor management at the lowest level in IT. Most managers only care about themselves and how they can achieve their personal goals/agenda using their employees in order to look good to upper management.

Managers and even higher level management seem to truly care about you and your career goals.
Team members work well together and your branch peers become akin to family.
Banking hours: a typical 9-5 type job.
Opportunities to move into other positions due to high turnover (as is the nature of branch positions in retail banking).","Communications between departments are sometimes woefully lacking. Underwriting department is consistently slow and some decisions don't make ANY sense at all. (When a customer that has no debt and owns his house free and clear in a highly sought after neighborhood and home value is extremely high upwards of $280k, WHY is he denied for a Home Equity loan for a piddly $50k?)

When promoted, you might get the job you want for the experience, and a raise. HOWEVER, the raise is so low and insignificant that it's insulting. I loved working in my previous role and was very excited to move into this new role, but I will be looking elsewhere. For the amount of work that is expected and the years of education I have achieved, I do not feel valued as an employee anymore.

You do not receive commission in this role. Half of your role will be operations-based and half is still sales-based. Your sales goals are tracked in units instead of revenue credits. The rewards for the Units are almost non-existent. At least as a banker you were able to receive a decent enough commission per quarter based off of your revenue credit balance, but as a Universal Branch Specialist your loss of being paid out is supposed to be made up with a bump in salary. As I already said, this ""bump"" is so low and insignificant that it feels more like a slap in the face. 

This role is more of a pilot role. Therefore, they are still attempting to design training and many managers are confused about your role and what you are supposed to be doing. Because your manager is confused about what you are supposed to be doing, you likely will also not truly understand your own role. It is very possible you will spend a whole month in your role without much training at all except for one hour weekly conference calls that don't go over much. The conference calls are largely a waste of time as they center around a lot of general information that you probably already know if you worked as a banker before. I had the good luck that I worked in a Universal Branch, and due to my work ethic, was exposed to a lot more of the operations side of things compared to most bankers who were not as fortunate."

Offers 401k match as well as a pension. Medical insurance is mediocre and gets more expensive each year. One big improvement and policy change was the maternity/paternity leave. Mothers get 16 weeks paid and fathers get 6 weeks paid. 

Work life balance is pretty good for most positions.","There is no set career path for certain positions. You just seem stuck in one spot with no where to go and its really hard move up internally because you can never meet the qualifications of the positions that interest you. 

Compensation is poor and below average with super low raises or no raises at all. No bonuses of any kind. You will be lucky if you get a 2% raise at your end-year review. All the money is at the executive level or upper management level. Work-visa contractors that are hired from over seas get paid big bucks which is sad because it takes away jobs and compensation from American workers. 

Management does not encourage you to grow your career within PNC. When this comes up in conversation, they are totally fine with you leaving the company to go work else where. To me this shows the lack of employee value. 

If you do end up looking to apply or work for this company, I would suggest to apply in Pittsburgh because that's where they apply all their focus, money, time and effort."

They always find some little thing to not only nitpick about but will also use it to keep you in that spot for as long as they can.  Now on to the team leads. They are absolutely useless.

I will tell you every day was a Hell working there... 

Within the banking industries, there is an impression that Wells Fargo is very aggressive/ pushy for sales but I can confirm PNC is even worst It’s all about sales at PNC 

These jobs consist of doing a Teller and Platform work and when you are standing and doing a  Teller transaction or on platform some ones comes to changing their address you are supposed to SELL them something example: Credit card/ Mortgage/ Car loan just about anything but just keep pushing bank products to customer (They call it PNC Conservation- Position/ Need/ Close business) 

As soon as I came from training they made me stand in front of a bank handing out $300 Special offer to stop and shop customer to open an account (They call it Lobby engagement)

Every day you are supposed to go to the shop and shop Isles and talk to customer ie sell them Credit Card, & new accounts you are supposed to spend 3 hrs in the Isles, 4 hrs Teller and 2 hrs Lobby engagement a day.

Your manager will treat you based on the sales you have. If you don’t meet your quota you will be very ill treated and you will be pushed into the Isles all the time, you will spend  6 hrs walking in stop and shop aisles….

Every day there are also activities such as you will be asked to Bag grocery of stop and shop customer. Set up booth outside and hand out PNC cheap bags and talk customer into getting Credit Cards…
The salary for this job is around $27K to 30K 

In all it was the worst job I every had I have worked in banking before but this by –far was the worst its hardly a banking job its hardcore sales. 

This job may be is good for teenagers who are just out of school and want to have banking experience mentioned on their resume."

Also, for the first 6 months, the MLO will receive ""top tier"" commission, which is now at 17.5 bps, regardless of their funding amount. This bonus creates a false sense of success and quickly comes crashing down once those first 6 months are completed. After 6 months, the compensation plan becomes tiered. The majority of new loan officers are unable to fund at least 1.5 million per month, so PNC pays them the ""minimum payout"" of $75 per loan. That's right, $75 per mortgage loan funded.  If you are lucky enough to fund 3.25 mill, then you can earn the top tier commission of 17.5 bps, which is very difficult to attain. Practically no loan officer on the floor is able to hit top tier, let alone the middle tier of 12.5 bps. Essentially with the base salary of $24,000, you can expect to earn somewhere in the $2000+ per month range after 6 months of employment. If you're lucky enough to fund over 1.5 mill per month, than you will earn 5 bps. This equates to $750 for 1.5 mill in funding. The compensation plan makes it very difficult to earn a respectable living at PNC's home lending center. The HLC is a call center where your only purpose is to make incessant calls every day and hope that people will refinance so that you can earn $75 on their loan (if it closes) 3-4 months later. The ""leads"" that PNC provides have been recycled over and over again, and are an absolute joke. PNC also plays games with the queue calls by placing the majority of the sales floor in queue's 2 and 3, and tries to motivate staff with the idea of climbing into Queue 1 based on ""lead conversions"" The exaggerated income potential, poor lead quality, and the churning and burning of new MLO classes which begin every month, leads to the extremely high turnover rate. The majority of MLO's cannot stand working for a whole year, and many quit before reaching 1 year.  Stay far, far away!"

4059,,PNC - probably not compensated,2017-06-28,1.0,Mortgage Loan Officer,Willing to train with no industry experience. Well known brand and with a decent market share. Things look good for the first couple months with company. Training program was useful in acclimating to a new industry. Benefits aren't bad.,Good luck making any money whatsoever. Current pay is less than than half of what I was told the average MLO makes. Backend team is clueless and and typically no help. Underwriters have declined files before even giving them a full  review and not knowing guidelines (which is their entire job). Just settled a class action from former loan officers due to not paying them correctly. The solution to this was to change the compensation plan to just plainly not paying loan officers. Stay away. There is no trust and no transparency from management and there doesn't appear to be any positive change or direction in the near future.

""Work/Life Balance"" sounds nice, but is not a benefit of working here. It is normal to not have a schedule at all, be told to come in on your days off, or be told at a moments notice that you'll need to drive an hour away to support another branch.
They offer low pay compared to other banks because of a ""great commission structure"". You have to hit a revenue goal before you get any payout and there aren't many employees who hit the high amounts to make up for the low salary.

legacy mainframe applications which are not easily to fit into the agile development model.

Due to the creation of so many new teams, the knowledge base is spread very thin.

People are being asked to work on projects involving applications they have no experience in.

There is a shortage of people who know their applications,      Directors and management above the directors seem to think that everyone is a plug and play employee and that in-depth application knowledge is not needed.

If you fall behind on one computer process you it can snow ball into a major obstacle. DO NOT MISS A DAY! Also a few ppl can easily throw the class behind and force rushing by other material.
Time frame is not fair to the new employees nor realistic to the instructor. Appears this will basically be on-the-job training. Manuals did not follow course agenda so were of little use during nor for future reference.

Few branch employees earn sizable bonuses For example, I am one of the top sales people in my region and I have been with the company for 3 years, but I have yet to gross over $35,000 annual income.  

After being at the job for a while you might not see yourself becoming a branch manager or business banker.  If you're like me you'll think retail banking is a good foundation, but you don't see yourself in retail banking dealing with the same types of customer issues day in and day out for the rest of your career.  It's true that in the pros I listed an array of different tasks that you'll be doing on the job, but after a while you will have essentially mastered the tasks you will be doing (for the most part) on a daily basis.

I got one small raise but I'm still stuck at less than $14.

Branch level bankers and tellers are too heavily judged based on customer Gallop polls with any score less than 5/5 being considered bad. It is used to hold good employees back from promotions and raises. The polls are anonymous so we never get to know who our accuser is when we get a bad score and they usually don't leave any comments. We have no idea what went wrong or how we could possibly improve. Frequently, we get bad scores for doing our jobs! Ask to remove sunglasses for security? Bad score. Ask for a second form of ID to protect their deposits? Bad score. Couldn't refund your overdraft fee? Bad score. Ask too many (required) questions when opening an account? Bad score. Know you in person and don't like you? Bad score. Racist customer? Bad score.

Management was less than stellar when it came to communicating problems.
4354,,Not a place for a career,2017-02-06,1.0,Teller,"Helping customers with their financial needs. Getting to know customers and their families.
As an employee, you get a free (tiny) safe deposit box, and you don't have to pay any fees on the accounts.","You're just a number. Perhaps it's the region I work in, but upper management doesn't care about you. Tellers are the lowest on the totem pole with the highest turnover rate for a reason. They expect too much and pay too little. In the last few months, they have been giving retention raises because PNC is known in the banking business to pay the least, and it's true. The tellers deal with too much crap from customers and are required to do way more work than it's worth. 

PNC likes to pride itself on the work/life balance, but only if you manage to get out of the branch. If you work inside a branch, you are not, under any circumstances, allowed off or leave early Monday or Friday, for any reason (this is coming from upper management. The person who does the scheduling in the branch might make an exception, but if upper management gets wind, you all get an earful). You also, if you're one of the unlucky people to work Saturdays, are not allowed a day off during the week, so to keep within your 40 hours, you have to leave early 2-3 days every week and work all six days. That means 6 days commute (which for some people can be more than 30 minutes), no exceptions. So in a month of 31 days, you're probably going to end up working 25-27 of them because you (thankfully) have off Sundays.

What they also don't tell you is you're going to get ""secret shopped"" and those customers that shop you will ultimately decide whether you can get promoted or post for a job at another branch. PNC uses Gallup to do their secret shops. Gallup (as of Jan 1, 2017) now emails random customers that were helped at a branch and asks them to do a survey, only they hold the bar so high that anything below all 5's can seriously affect your opportunity for advancement. The answer is clearly, well, just give everyone 5-star service!! Except, nothing is that black and white and if you get that person that was already pissed before they came in, and regardless of how you help them, remain angry, that one person can ruin your entire branch's ability to make a quarterly bonus as well as ruin your chances at a promotion.

There is decent health coverage, but it comes with a high deductible, and the rules about what is covered is a little hazy. The only ""good"" thing is that PNC will contribute a small amount of money per pay period to help you with your HSA that you're now going to need for that high deductible. And by small, I mean I'm getting less than $10 bi-weekly.

Another thing, if you work in the branch as a teller, they are now relying on you to sell even more product. And by product, I mean credit cards. And that is their main focus right now. The credit card goals are only growing. If you're not cool with shoving credit cards down people's throats, this job is probably not for you."

4359,,Disappointed,2017-02-03,2.0,Branch Manager,"Loved the people that I worked with in my branch as well as a few of my business partners, coworkers, and direct managers.",I worked for PNC Bank bank for almost 6 years. Started as a Teller and moved my way up to a Branch Manager. Never once left the company for more money at another bank because I was loyal to PNC. Never in 6 years was there a legit complaint filed on me or was I ever investigated for anything. Turned the branch I managed from the bottom branch in our region into one of the top performing branches. Now with all that back ground I will give you the rest of the story. I was in the process of being investigated for some ridiculous accusations that had pretty much nothing to do with banking and everything to do with my personal life. During the interview I will take responsibility for not completely giving accurate information in the beginning but before the interview was over I gave the information they asked for correctly. Once the investigation was complete I was let go because I did not give the accurate answer the first time they asked me. Even though I gave them the accurate answer when they said they were going to ask me one more time in the end. Do I feel I was without wrong in the situation NO but do I feel that I was wronged by a company I was loyal and gave my all to for almost 6 year YES!!!!! It doesn't matter who you are or what you do for them at the end of the day you are just another number they can replace and that is so sad.

I was in Operations. Pay was very low and management was stingy with raises. Not much effort put into development or addressing employees' concerns, despite wasting lots of time and expense with the ""Better Way"" project, which really just took employees away from their production and added little value. 

Be prepared to do a lot of work for little return, not be listened to when you voice serious concerns, receive no acknowledgement despite high performance, and be treated poorly by management.  Benefits are stingy, health care consistently goes up but covers less each year. Make sure you know exactly which vacation days you want for a whole year by January, because you have to schedule them all by then."

As a Loan Officer at PNC your reputation in the local market gets negatively affected because there is no support from operations and management. Closings are routinely delayed and customers are left hanging. Management doesn't address the root causes they just deal with the symptoms. Also- Loan Officers are 100% commission but they limit their ability to make money because they have to continuously raise rates to slow production because back office support is non existent. There were also several instances where top executives withheld information or outright lied about employee compensation. They brought in new leadership at the top but they left fairly quickly after realizing they couldn't bring about needed changes. Loan Officer turnover is close to 50% yearly

I absolutely regret my decision to take this position. 
From the time I have began, there has been NOTHING but LIES about all most everything under the sun. What was told to me during the recruitment stage and once actually in the company were two completely different realities. Having everything in writing does not even seem to help, there is no integrity or personal responsibility to be had by PNC for their mistakes. They fired older people who have a harder time grasping technology... although they are told in the interview stage that they will be able to go through training an additional time if they need more help. They fire pregnant people who they hired while pregnant because... of course have appointments to check on their fetuses, for attendance. They fire people right in front of you and storm in and take their belongings in a rush as if they have stolen money from a customer. Managers are just plain plum dumb. Stats are ridiculous and you are told to not take your full break if you had to use the restroom before your break comes. They fire people for using FMLA. ...I basically hate everything about PNC. I am closing my accounts with them when I leave and I would rather deal with the BLUE BANK than them... and thats saying alot because I really hate that bank. The customers are disgruntled because of changes which are designed to generate more money for the company... its a bank... they are designed to make money but they tout diversity, inclusion and core values... its laughable.

Here's the skinny: PNC underwent a ""cost cutting effort"" a couple years ago. They spent half a BILLION dollars on a building we didn't need and generous Bill decided that the employees are going to pay for it. So, they cut the phone benefit (they used to pay part of your bill since you were on call all the time and had the email app permanently implanted on your PERSONAL device), they stopped reimbursing you for parking when you were out on BUSINESS, they decided you can't take customers out to anywhere other than Eat n' Park on the company's dime, they froze all salary increases if you were promoted (seriously, more work with no raise), annual raises were capped at 1.2% (that's less than the cost of living adjustment), they completely changed the comp structure for sales and reduced commissions somewhere around 93%, there's an almost cult like attitude among management that seems to assume people don't actually need compensation for their service. ALL of their talent has left. Literally, everyone who had something to offer customers is gone. They went to Mellon, FNB, Merril Lynch, and Morgan Stanley.

Management is untouchable and scapegoats client facing employees rather than reviewing a broken culture with an incentive system that pits groups against each other such as Retail Brokerage and Weatlh Management.  Retail Brokers are 100% commissioned meaning, if they can convince you to buy an annuity you don't need, they will then turn it over to Wealth to sell you a lackluster discretionary investment portfolio at 1.35% a year and try and convince you it's a great value because you have a team of 6 ""specialists"" around you that do basically jack squat.  When they were Nat City, they didn't attact top talent, that group is likely all managers now and it just gets worse and worse.

Lots of cool people if you can wade through the fearfully paralyzed naysayers.,"Where to start. The place for the most part already had poor abusive supervisors but with company addition of ""A Better Way"" the supervisors are unbearable. ""better way"" is a creepy manipulative practice that's preaches intense cult like behavior and makes it impossible to reach goals due to the fact that once you reach them they hang the carrot out further. No matter how well your efficiency and accuracy you will never be more than mediocre on paper...therefore no raises and also makes it difficult to move into other departments because you can not separate yourself from the pact. You'll need help from people in those departments to vouch for you in order to move. I recently left due to bullying and humiliation by my emasculating supervisor.

 The place claims that they want to be a technology leader in the industry but it's really just placing band-aids over their inefficiencies to mask it from investors and outside talent. Example is their hiring board. Claimed to be new and improved. When you find a position click apply it just sends you right back to the old job website where you would then apply for the job. Also if you applied you can see these ridiculous criteria and ""competency"" ratings or suggestions. Job descriptions are even more vague than they ever were and the place pays very little and attempts to treat you like children by offering cookies found in a dusty closet for compensation or for ""employee appreciation week""."

4725,,HORRIBLE BEWARE!!!!,2016-08-26,1.0,,there are no pros about this company at all! None what so ever. I'm ashamed to list PNC on my resume! I AM UPSET I HAD TO GIVE IT ONE STAR BECAUSE IT DESERVES NONE!,"I have ZERO pros about working for this company ESPECIALLY this branch! The Miracle Mile Branch! This has to be hands down the WORST job experience of my life!!! I will never forget my time spent at PNC bank it literally haunts me at night! First i would go on to say that I spent about 2-3 weeks training.... i spent one week downtown and the other two at the miracle mile. My manager did not seem to care one bit about me or the person i was training with as she would leave us sit at a desk for the full 8 hours twidling our thumbs waiting on her to come back and let us know what to do next. Secondly, i was told i was going in as PART-TIME. In my eyes, part-time means between 20-32 hours per week. I was working OVERTIME almost every single week. I was given a 40 hour work schedule and almost always had to stay past my shift ESPECIALLY if i worked the 11-7:30 shift auditing my box or the branch because of mistakes being made. You were not allowed to leave until all money was recovered fully! (This could last up to 9:30 pm sometimes). Also, being ""part-time"" meant that I had absolutely NO BENEFITS or PTO time to use...but i worked the FULL-TIME hours so how is this even fair????   HOWEVER they make you take a MANDATORY 5 days UNPAID time off! May i add you were not allowed to do a Mon-Fri for those 5 days??? You are REQUIRED to work every OTHER Saturday but i worked practically every single Saturday being completely under staffed and running around all day so busy! Secondly, management was probably the WORST con i would say about this branch!!! They are completely heart-less and could care less about your home life, family or your own personal health. Calling off is equivalent to the end of the world to the management team and LET ME SAY if you do not follow the EXACT SCRIPT they want you to say to EVERY CUSTOMER even if you've known them your entire life your being talked to about it from every manager until you follow. ""WELCOME TO PNC BANK, HOW MAY I ASSIST YOU AT PNC BANK, THANK YOU FOR CHOOSING PNC BANK!"" It gets annoying to the customer!!!!! They make you and another employee stand at the front of the branch and greet every single customer saying ""WELCOME TO PNC BANK"" over and over again I've literally had customers make fun of me, mock me, and ask why there are 2 people standing within 10 feet of each other greeting customers and only 2 people on the teller line to help!!! But that is what they make you do! Lower management is so focused on keeping ""THE BOSS"" happy they NEVER have time to help out or care about your stress levels at this branch. Let alone the fact that ""THE BOSS"" is one of the hardest people i have ever tried talking to in my life. The most unsympathetic person i know!!! I am a female, and I was literally pulled aside by management to discuss with me ""Conflict of interest"" with another female employee because we were friends! Apparently that's not allowed at this branch because you walk around the place and feel like you cant talk to any of your employees because you'll just get in trouble. The pay is CRAP i made more money at my jobs i had in high school. The dress code is ridiculous. There was a girl who got sent home to change because she was wearing leggings under her dress what showed her ankles? HOWEVER there was a woman working that day with a dress on above her knees that they said NOTHING to?!!!!! I hope to save a poor soul from ever taking a position for this branch. This place is NOT WORTH IT PLEASE TAKE MY ADVISE WHEN I SAY DON'T EVER WORK FOR THIS BRANCH!"

Not all branches are open on Saturday so rotating at other branches makes it so you only work about every 6th Saturday.",Compared to other financial institutions the wages are considerably low.

Afterwards you get invited to a group interview then if your picked you get to meet with the branch manager.Overall the hiring process was pretty simple and easy took only a couple weeks. The job itself is a good start to your career.,The only cons would be that there are the occasional rude clients which is to be expected in any bank. You are also required to stay in your position for at least one year before you move up. They do this because they want you to build a relationship with the clients and do not want to have a lot of new employees coming and going every week it looks bad from a clients point of view.

They talked a lot about ""work-life balance"" in orientation, but it seems like they can't retain employees because their compensation is not very competitive and the 6 day a week mandatory schedule is terrible for someone with a long commute. Also the intranet where employees are supposed to search for answers simply does not work well.

This company drives in superior customer service for customers but what about employees? If you enjoy working for a company that drives its employees into the ground with absolutely no support from ""management"", then have at it. It is common knowledge that management does not listen or care and certainly doesn't work on developing their employees. I believe this mentality starts from the top down, as one of the senior managers walks around with this smug look on face and doesn't not say anything to anyone. My team manager couldn't even say good morning back to me...she ignored me. Her favorites, though, were chatted with all day on instant messaging while the rest of her team tanked. I watched 8 people resign from my team in my short period I was there - 6 months. One member resigned after just 2 months. You see, everyone saw what was and wasn't being done. We needed a manager who actually cared. Any position, especially in the mortgage industry, is hard and stressful enough as it is. Why would a company employ individuals that just make it worse. Haven't they figured out that what they are doing isn't working? Stop 365 day recruiting and start working on your employees. Everyone inside can see the problems."

Detail is over and above any other lender/bank field exam scopes to the point that it is very costly to the client. The pay is average and it is very difficult to get bonuses or raises.

No need for processors as they will note your files that the MLO is the only point of contact. After the welcome call they are MIA. You have to clear all of your own conditions. Underwriting is fine but getting your loan to that point is an act of God. Forget closing on time. 60 days plus is the norm for a purchase. Refinances can take months. 90 days or more in some situations. If you have a condo you might as well have them apply somewhere else. Besides having to gather all your own docs, clear all your own conditions, you also have to gather all of your condo docs. So once you do have a few mortgages in process you have no extra time to sell as you are spending all of your time processing.  Technology is out dated and who doesn't have signature? Oh yes, PNC doesn't. Everything is old school with wet signatures. Pay is low because it is extremely hard to close a loan. If you leave before your first year is up, they will hire a collection company to try and collect any monies that you worked out above the 24000 base/recoverable draw that you have received. You also will not get paid on any loans that close within 30 days of departure either. They also won't count those closings  toward any monies that they deem that you owe them for leaving in less than a year. If the collection calls are not bad enough they will sue you for that money that they are trying to collect. Yes they will sure you. Now lets talk TRID. because  PNC had no idea how to handle TRID they will make your clients wait 10 extra days after the CD(closing disclosure) has been received to actually close the loan. Unless you are one of the chosen few high producers that they don't want to leave. Then they get the special treatment and the rules don't apply to them."

There are so many rules and regulations that must be followed to the T. Some employees I worked with were to the book and that made the environment I worked in very uncomfortable. I came from a bank that had rules but not as many as PNC. They are constantly changing things and its hard to keep up with all the changes and as soon as you learn how to run something one way, they change it and it must be run a different, more complicated way. This whole lobby management thing is ridiculous, considering every single branch is usually short staffed and it is taking people off the teller lines and causing customers to wait longer in lines. Which isnt a bank suppose to be customer first? not this one thats forsure. Also, if you have an employee that has only been there for two months and you throw them onto doing the atm settlement and ordering supplies or the branch, you should give them more than a $.05 raise. Also, they will make part time tellers work way more hours than normal. I was part time but was working almost 40 hours a week because people were constantly leaving and it would take forever to get new people in. There is absolutely no room to grow in this company.

5019,,Pros & Cons,2016-04-05,4.0,Anonymous Employee,"PNC treats employees with respect, provides an ethical work environment, a good work life balance, and pays a fair wage.  The company also has tried to become very career path oriented and has made strides to develop talented  / engaged workers and keep them in house.  Overall, PNC is a good place to work.",Pay structures have become less competitive recently and the company has become more focused on widget selling than I would like.  The health care benefits are bad and the organization pinches pennies around expenses.
5020,,"Started motivated, left beyond frustrated",2016-04-05,1.0,Customer Service Associate,"The flexibility of work life balance was probably the best/only good thing I can say about my time here. If I needed to tweak my schedule to make an appointment, there usually was a way for me to request it without an issue.","There is a laundry list of cons, but the primary issues I faced were the compensation-or lack thereof-and the lack of positivity in the work environment. While it may not have been the case at all of the branches, the branch I worked in was filled with negativity and immature attitudes displayed from both the branch manager and also the teller supervisor. I took a major pay cut to come to this company with the hopes of pursuing my goals in the financial industry and because of this, made it a point to display my desire to gain another position in the company that would be more in my career path. However, once I communicated this to my manager, I began to notice that she would say or do things in a matter that indicated that she had no desires for me to progress. I had top sales in the region for my particular position, and she wrote me up for a mistake that I made based on lack of training that I received when I first started, which in turn caused me to be denied my quarterly bonus. There were other issues that went on that I'm more than sure should have been sighted as beyond unethical, such as having us working in the branch with no ventilation in the middle of the summer, along with no air conditioning, and exposed insulation and paint fumes everywhere. Between the constant digs and gossiping among the management and favoritism displayed towards less than productive employees, this work environment was a cross between a joke and a bad dream. While it is evident that most positions in the financial industry and corporate america as a whole are pretty much based on politics and who you know to get where you want to go, I would not wish the things that I had to deal with on anyone."

Great place to gain experience and training for other jobs that require more experience. Co-workers are friendly.","Big bank = Bureaucracy. Low pay and bonus are discretionary, which means there is no real formula to it. No real incentive to do well. Performance measurement is very vague and does not apply to the jobs. You can bring in $200 mil in revenue and it will not increase pay by one cent. Many of the managers are incompetent or not the sharpest tool in the shed."

The gravy train from Charlotte to Pittsburgh shows no signs of slowing down. People are being hired from BAC without anyone internally being given the opportunity to interview. I am astonished to think how much money this company is paying in relocation expenses when there are plenty of people already working for PNC who could do the job. The newbies are also being paid much better than existing employees. Yet there is an extreme focus from senior management on cost savings. It doesn't make sense.

Raises are practically nonexistent. 1% was the norm this year. 

Too many people sit around with nothing to do. Non-performers are allowed to coast. They keep getting bounced around from department to department while those who are good performers have to take on the slackers' work with no additional compensation.

They are also pushing the cost of health care more and more onto the employees. Couple that with the recent paltry 1% raises, and everyone essentially got a pay cut this year.

If you transfer internally into a job with a higher pay grade, you will not get a raise. The company justifies this by saying they have overlapping compensation bands. In reality, you are simply alienating good employees."

They even allow you to buy an additional week off of work. They are very focused on helping their employees to develop their skills and competencies. Some people are able to work at home, even if it is just for a day or two, depending on whether your job allows this or not. They have a wonderful system to provide recognition to employees. This is nice for peer-to-peer recognition. PNC is very philanthropic, with programs like ""Grow Up Great"".  These programs make PNC look great, but also make employees feel proud of who they work for. They also have Employee Business Resource Groups that provide support and opportunities for employees.","Unless you are an hourly employee, be prepared to work more than 40 hours a week every week. My typical day is 10 - 12 hours long with no lunch or breaks.  This is due primarily to not having enough people employed to complete work. There are always fire drills, requiring long hours and late nights.  This has become more of the norm than an exception. In talking with co-workers across other business lines, this is a consistent experience. It causes employees to be sick more often, dissatisfied with their job and the quality of the work suffers as well. It is frustrating for everyone.

Raises and bonuses are few and far in between for even exceptional performance reviews. The raises I have received over the last few years on average about 1% which does not even begin to cover cost of living increases, let alone increases to health care costs. Note that I have had meets or exceeds requirements in each of those years. Every year I lose money working here and I am starting to question whether it makes sense to try to move to another organization who will likely pay me more immediately and provide annual increases for the same (or less) work than I'm doing now."

Training program is a joke. 2 weeks and then you're on your own.
Consistent commission structure changes, so you can never make more than $1500 per quarter unless you're in a ridiculously busy branch with a vacant sales position, so you work alone. 
Credit underwriting standards are among the highest I've ever seen, so no one with a less-than-perfect credit score can obtain a loan/credit card. Denials all day when you're selling a ton.

Only high deductible plans are offered, costing far more than previous plans with my former employer. 

Training lacks insight to most practical applications. Online courses are expected to be completed, while working on the teller line, between customers. Fully understanding, or retaining anything of the numerous courses seems nearly impossible. Finishing the courses simply to please management doesn't help in actually learning. 

""Coaching"" is used more as micromanagement and the pointing out of an employees faults and shortcomings rather than a more positive learning method. Acknowledgment of things done correctly, or with positive result, is rare. Questions are routinely ignored, or answered in a tone indicative of annoyance. 

Management pushes off responsibility of explaining policies and procedures by having employees ""look it up"" on the company website. 

No clear explanation was made regarding the loss of unused vacation and personal days at the end of the calendar year. I expected more from a company stressing the value of a healthy work / personal life balance."

She was a peer of my manager who left the department a month after I took the job.  He had issues with her and decided to take another position within the company.  I had to suffer with her refusal to answer any questions, refusal to let her employees answer any questions, and ultimately her attempts to sabotage my career with the company.  I was saved when they replaced my old manager.  

I was extremely underpaid for my technical position.  Four months before I left, after years of pushing, they finally changed my title to match the position/skillset needed to perform my job.  However, when I found out that I was paid 5k below the pay grade for the position, I was told that they would not be adjusting my salary.  I was told by my manager that an increase in salary ""would be something for me to shoot for!"" I was also told by manager that the only way I could increase my salary would be to leave the company and come back, not to ever expect an increase that would be commensurate with the pay grade of the position if I stayed.

They made lots of promises to try and make up for the differences, but a little research uncovered that they made similar promises to others without delivering.  By the way, I received top ratings in both my annual reviews (I was there less than three years).  Speaking with HR after being told that the only way I could expect to receive a cost of living increase in the next year was by taking the ""promotion"", I found that they had not adjusted the pay range for my grade level in years and had no intention of updating it for the following year.

The systems you use are way outdated & frustrating to use. The turnover rate for the company is extremely high in our region because the pay is terrible and it is a miserable environment.

Those high value customers are left to others to make the commissions on.  FSC's get the credit card accounts, new accounts and have to push other PNC services, like a drug dealer, to make commission.  Additionally, the hours are awful if you have a family.    PNC is so awful in their pay that they have a constant revolving door of employees and the California, MD branch is so busy that they have lines out the door because PNC will NOT allow them to hire the resources needed to accommodate customers.

There are typically a lot of events that celebrate the employee.  There is a very good work/life balance with respect to working hours.  If you can start at a very good base level pay you'll be making more than a lot of your peers.,"There are some pockets of the organization that are still in the dinosaur ages.  It's hard to wrap their minds around working with people in an adjacent state, let alone working with people on a global scale.  That equates essentially the inability to work from home with any level of regularity.  

The raises are basically non-existent.  At best 2%.  Some years 1%.  The difference between exceeding and everything else is .5%.  A new talent system has been put in place that basically makes it next to impossible to change jobs internally and get any level of a raise to do so.

Going back to the first point, there are a tremendous number of managers (mid-level) who have been around the company for years and years.  Making change slow or next to impossible.  Their styles are antiquated, do not keep up with the times, and generally are micromanagers."

Your challenge as an employee is to learn the dynamics of retail core card services and banking federal regulations at a entry level in this position and overall be an EXCELLENT communicator by your third or fourth month their is the goal. Preferably your third month. And the sky is the limit to your career at that point. And make sure to listen to your coaching and actually act on the coaching provided.","Bi-weekly pay via direct deposit makes it harder to pay your bills on time and to maneuver your funds on a weekly basis. Pro would be that employees get massive discounts on PNC product pricing, including a free employee structured PNC Performance Checking account and Money Market Savings Account. And if your smart with your work week. Using one of your days off to handle your financial affairs at a local PNC branch is very smart to do. And of course your laundry, grocery shopping. Make sure to bring your fresh fruit zip lock bag and protein and water bottle everyday to be able to hand the strict Time Schedule Adherence. You won't believe how fast 15 minute breaks fly by.

5564,,PNC Investment Center Financial Advisor,2015-09-22,3.0,Anonymous Employee,The management team is incredible. The management team is highly skilled in developing the sales skills of their employees. Furthermore the management team is highly concerned with the career development of each employee. Most important the management team deeply cares about each person as an individual outside of work.,The branches each advisor is given are 90% low to moderate income neighborhoods. It is very difficult to drive revenue with these branches. Additionally it is your responsibility as the Financial Advisor to coach and manage each branch employee. The worst part of the job is the work environment. The Investment Center is located in a bank call center. I would suggest the majority of these employees are not professionals. The majority of these employees are very lowly paid bank customer service employees.I have seen numerous encounters where bank call center employees would bring a non work related situation to their manager thinking it would enhance their career. Lastly I would suggest not to get into an encounter with Human Resources. During my time with the Investment Center I encountered three situations where a Financial Advisor was brought under investigation for a non securities related issue. In each instance Human Resources stated if the Financial Advisor was not forthright during the investigation they would compromise the advisors U4/U5. In each instance the Financial Advisor was forced to resign

They will always give a client .50bps to get a deal, but they will NOT give that same .50bps to the loan officers.

There's 5 ""FSC's"" now so you are all basically fighting over opening accounts, investments, etc. for all the revenue credits rather than a typical FSC getting it.

PROMOTIONAL RAISES ARE CAPPED AT 10%. So if you are a secretary making $23k, and get promoted to an advisor (starting salary is around 60k) your raise will be capped at $2,300 THAT'S 40% LESS THAN YOUR COWORKERS - ALL FOR THE SAME WORK!!!

5873,,Financial Sales Consultant & Universal Banking Consultant,2015-06-14,2.0,Financial Sales Consultant,Fostering relationships with clients. Company provides a good foundation to build a professional career.,"Employees are grossly underpaid for their workload; this is true from a part-time teller to a branch manager position. Salary and incentive payouts are at the lowest end of the spectrum in the industry. Many employees migrate to competitors in search of equitable pay. 

Branches are ALWAYS understaffed, putting further strain on the truly engaged employee, which perpetuates turnover. Too much weight is placed on arbitrary survey results (in most cases the customer isn't rating the employee, they're rating the company). These surveys, conducted by Gallup, don't account for staffing shortages when they ask customers about wait times either.

PNC eliminates individuality and sincerity by imposing standardized wording and scripted conversations. When I first started with PNC, they used a solutions based sales methodology (no product pushing). Now, management encourages a by-any-means-necessary mentality. The emphasis on specific metrics, and the repercussions for not attaining goals, has created unethical sales tactics."

It is strictly turning into a sales-oriented company with someone constantly looking over your shoulder.","Most people in retail banking come to expect that the pay is less than flattering, but when I left the company, I realized how many opportunities are out there with decent compensation (much more favorable than PNC).  For people who are not performance-driven, this would not be the place to work.  I've seen some great assets, who did great things for the bank, leave because of the rapidly changing culture"

Mortgage as a Line of Business is the worst performing part of PNC. PNC Mortgage and PNC Bank are two completely different companies. Still culture issues from the National City merger. Everyone refers to PNC as ""the bank"". Also there are SEVEN different buildings on the campus, so getting from meeting to meeting is a joke. Lastly, if you are relocating be sure to research the Dayton area before you move here because there is not much. Most people working there have been with the company and lived in the area for life, very sheltered thinkers. If you have to work here live in Cincinnati!

Yes training is great in the beginning but once you are working on the floor it feels as if you have been thrown to the wolves as a finance rep and teller. It can be extremely hard to pull other consultants in for assistance as they are mainly on the teller line or with other clients. Expect to mainly be a teller and a teller supervisor and ATM custodian in addition to financial sales whenever you are not in with a client, which is about 90% of the time as a new team member. You have individual goals of $100,000 in sales revenue/ quarter to earn to see any kind of bonus. Traditional branches only have to earn $150K but in a universal branch each person is responsible for 100K...that means if you have a team of 5 your branch will need to earn $500k/quarter against the traditional branch's $150K...yeah not happening!

Overall decent training with exceptional branch support. Pension after 5 years of service.,"Very low starting salary. Incentive pay depends on the market and branch that you work at. Some FSC's earn huge quarterly pay-outs only because they work at a band one branch with more walk-in traffic and/or an affluent customer base. Most FSC's receive a small quarterly incentive; under $1,000. It's a very unfair incentive plan. More discouraging is the favoritism that I have experienced at more than one branch. Both branch and regional management are guilty of ""giving"" sales to some of their FSC's. Thus resulting in increased sales and ""revenue credits"" which determine your quarterly incentive pay. I have seen managers get away with blatant lying and unethical behavior. Anyone else would be fired or put on probation. The employee ethics hotline usually favors management. By the time you get to that point and need to contact ""ERIC"" you are discouraged and often so stressed out; you start to consider resigning than be put through any more upset. 

The weekly Gallop surveys are constantly monitored. You have to maintain a 4.8 out of 5 to be considered a good employee. This is retail and we deal with some of the most obnoxious customers. Another source of stress is worrying about your Gallop score. 

Medical benefits are not that good. A high deductible plan with a large contributory biweekly pay deduction.

Predictable pay","Unrealistic sales goals in last two years have bled over into every aspect of the bank. 
Bonus is every three months and largely depends on customer survey scores. So if your branch is horrible, but you're a star, you'll never get any real incentive pay.
High turnover, about 80%, (this is what management told me) 

As banks transition to a new universal status, it means that everyone needs to sell, sell, sell. Expect to stay after work, at least once a week, until 7-8pm cold calling customers who ""expressed interest"" in some kind of generic offer. They now want people to set appointments, like a doctor's office, for customer to meet and discuss their finances. This is because AIN'T NOBODY COMING INTO THE BRANCH anymore. 
You're to have a full 9-point PNC conversation with EVERY customer, whether he/she is just in for a deposit or to change an address. How can I do this when I'm one of two tellers running transactions?? And it is ALWAYS like this. Unfortunately, people don't stick around here for very long. In the short time I worked here, I've never been with the same crew for more than 3 MONTHS!! 
My advice to anyone looking to work here is: DON'T STOP LOOKING FOR ANOTHER JOB!!! If you're not careful, you'll find you're a soulless zombie in just a few years."

Pay for performance model was adhered to and, at least with my particular line of business, high levels of accountability and good support from HR with managing low performers up, over or out.",Changing priorities on an almost daily basis made it hard to manage effectively.   Lack of reliable business line revenue reporting.

The incentive packages change constantly so trying to figure out what you can make and how to make a living is difficult.  It is a very silo driven company with poor internal communications.

I was told that if I did NOT stay, they were taking my severance package...and that is EXACTLY what they did!!! I had just got hired by another employer, and they all knew it.

Little emotional support for the employees that bear the brunt of customer dissatisfaction.  Upper management has little understanding of what front-line employees endure on a day to day basis.    Not willing to work around assigned schedules to allow return to school.  People frequently get fired."

The part time hours, pay, and experience is great for college students.",2015-02-24,4.0,Account Specialist,There are a lot of pros at PNC for a part time employee. The flexible hours are great for college students and the pay is much better then other businesses without the late night shifts.,It can get mind numbing. There is not growth opportunity until you have a degree and at that point your ready to move on.
6119,,I loved working for PNC.,2015-02-23,3.0,Credit Analyst,"I love the ability to move around the company, Different departments, and locations. They have excellent benefits, especially the health insurance.","The training is less the  desirable, you have to be able to train yourself because the training was horrible. The trainers were more worried about dress code then skills needed for the job. Promotions are hard to get because you can not move up too much at one time even if you are more than qualified. The promotions are based of pay grade. IE you can move from 4 to 7, but can go to 4to 6.  Even the you more qualified for the 7."
6120,,Its a Monet!   Appears to be a wonderful job with lots of opportunity until you get in deep.,2015-02-23,3.0,,Co-workers have been warm and welcoming.  Health insurance for PT.,I was not aware of the sales environment as a teller.  Potential for growth seems bleak.
6121,,Do not work here if you don't have to!,2015-02-23,1.0,Loan Processor,"Some people were nice, coffee was available all day, that's about all I can say that was positive.","Pay is not as good as other processing jobs; they lay off often (could be anyone, you never feel secure!); They make you work overtime after the layoffs, which is then tough to maintain a healthy work/life balance.Everyone is always tense and the job is very stressful. Raises are pretty much non existent.. The goals they make for you each month are sometimes impossible.  Turn over rate is high because it seems no one is happy here."

Open communication throughout management chain.","Very low pay for tellers and customer service jobs.
Emphasis on sales but not discussed during interview.
Management tends to hound and over-monitor almost everything you do.
Inconsistent branch hours across markets makes for unfair scheduling and under staffing.
PNC claims to exhibit ""work-life balance,"" but the sheer lack of it is what's driving employees away.
Sometimes I get the feeling that ""customer service"" in this company is only in place to make a sale - leaves me feeling very ingenuine and opportunistic.
No rhyme or reason as to why certain people get promoted easily whereas others are denied for long periods of time before management concedes (if they do at all) - promotions restricted to fit agendas of management and fill understaffed branches vs. advancing careers of capable employees."
6125,,"Ok, but not great",2015-02-23,3.0,Quantitative Analyst II,"Good salary, team environment, Some really smart people in their risk management division.","Since it is not a bulge bracket bank, move out after gaining some experience."

I have worked in other banks where I dragged my feet everyday, however I like the people I work with, the culture, and the bank as a whole.","Benefits are mediocre, compensation and annual raises are horrible. Marketing is not so great either compared to competition. - This is my biggest gripe. I have been here almost 10 years. 5 years in I took almost a 10% cut in pay because of a realignment to my position, and since then I have less than 2% annual compensation raises. After 10 years in, I am finally looking to move out. I am tired of them always drilling expense management. When it comes to employees, we are just an expense, and even though they act like they care, and preach employee engagement, they fail to ""put their money where their mouth is""..."

I really enjoyed working with great coworkers who were always your backup. Some customers were impatient, but I liked to make them smile after transaction.","Company has huge turnover due to low pay, incentives and replacing people with machines. Sometimes it is hard to move one with this company, some people are still tellers even if they have great knowledge and experience."
6135,,teller,2015-02-15,4.0,Teller,They're growing very quickly so positions are always open/opening up. Retail banking is becoming highly sales oriented which can go either way for you depending on you.,The retail side is moving very rapidly into sales production.

Engineering teams are usually mostly competent.,Shared services groups are difficult to work with; a lot of red tape when dealing with engineers outside of your department; business drives the technology more than it should.  Product managers/Operations managers too involved in pure technology decisions.

They have a solid training program and a great vacation policy if you meet your hours.,The bonuses became harder to reach than years prior.  Criteria for making good calls got very lengthly and difficult to do.
6143,,Business Systems Analyst II,2015-02-10,4.0,,"Good, helpful people, customer focused mission, relatively flexible schedule due to work from home policy. This company made improvements in the areas of technology and operations when I was there.",There were so many restrictions and rules around advancement within the company when starting at entry level.

6144,,Its a nice place,2015-02-09,4.0,Financial Sales Consultant,The company has great benefits and an extensive training program for bankers (Financial Sales Consultant),Not enough pay and they push for sales a lot.

6150,,Overall Experience,2015-02-05,4.0,,"It is a very stable organization that focuses on risk management, which leads to slow progress on most things.",It is a very Pittsburgh centric organization.  Some managers will not be promoted if not in Pittsburgh.
6151,,Teller Full Time,2015-02-05,3.0,Teller,"Great training 
Great management
Great coworkers.","Too many constant changes
Unrealistic sales goals
Mandatory sales goals
Poor pay for job duties
No Job security
Little job growth

There are constant policy and procedure changes which can make working difficult. Many employees are told/taught different things, which can lead to customer/client frustration and poor performance. 

Pnc pays the least compared to any other bank. They keep eliminating positions and giving current employees those additional tasks with no pay increase. Sales goals have recently become mandatory, if you don't make your goals by your performance review, you will have 3 months to improve or you will be terminated. Thus there isn't much job security. The low pay, constant policy/procedure changes, along with the lack of job security makes this job extremely stressful. If your looking for a living wage this is not the job for you."
6152,,Great company to work for though salary level and increases at very conservative.,2015-02-05,4.0,Technology,"This company is very flexible with their different work/life balance arrangements. Great for working parents and those who care for their elderly parents.

This company is quite big so you can experience different careers at one company.

PNC has a great continual learning department. They are very supportive with furthering your career or personal education. Quite a number of certification are given in house and they are supportive with any reimbursements.","PNC historical pays very low in salary. HR once called me and said they had to raise my salary because it was too low to for the market. Their salary increases are not that great either. 

Their healthcare benefits are horrible. They have a high deductible plans 1500/2500 put you are still required to pay 80/20 after you meet your deductible plus a high premium for this plan. They give you a small amount of money towards your HSA but it's distribution is spread over 12 months. 

Add an extremely high deductible premium, plus HSA contributions, and a low salary can equal a broke employee who uses the healthcare system to stay healthy."
6153,,Great Company!,2015-02-04,3.0,,Growth opportunity! Great company to work for!,Work life balance was not that great!
6154,,"Great Company, Lot Of Opportunity",2015-02-04,5.0,Financial Specialist,"The best thing about working for PNC in the Indianapolis territory is the people. As a new employee you are supported by multiple business partners, classroom and online trainings and have the ability to shadow as well. PNC puts a lot of time and effort into making sure you have the support you need to hit the ground and also further develop your career within the company. Many companies will tell you they promote from within but PNC is one of the few who walks the walk. 

They also offer good befits. 4% 401k match and 3% pension. You start off with 2 weeks paid vacation with the ability to buy an additional 2 weeks of vacation after you've been with the company for a couple of years.","PNC could do a better job marketing their flagship products to clients. Although they sell themselves,  many clients don't realize we offer mobile deposit or professional investment advice because we don't do a good enough job getting the word out to prospects. 

Also, a recent change in health benefits has been a drawback as well. PNC now only offers high deductible health care plans.  I personally rarely need to go to the doctor so it doesn't effect me much. My premiums are actually cheaper, but I can see how this could be an issue for some."
6155,,Good Company to work For,2015-02-04,4.0,,"I enjoy the flexible work arrangements that are offered, and the focus on work life balance.  I also enjoy the dedication to the grow-up great program.","I think the salaries could be better, as we have continually had strong profits, and cut expenses."

Grow up great is a great program and allows you to volunteer up to 40 hours a year offsite during work.","Low salary and chances to move up in the company, seem to value hiring contractors rather than promoting within"
6157,,Low pay high stress,2015-02-03,2.0,Financial Sales Consultant,Coworkers are great. PNC provides opportunities for advancement. There is plenty of training to prepare you for your career.,It is a very stressful work environment. Pay does not reflect the amount of work or stress. Part of your personal bonus is based off of Gallup survey scores for you and your coworkers. One bad apple or one rude/unreasonable customer affects everyone's bonus. There is a ton multitasking and juggling of responsibilities. It is extremely difficult to keep everything in order.
6158,,Stressful environment with little pay.,2015-02-03,5.0,Loan Support Specialist,Good work life balance with flexibility in schedule,"No advancement opportunity unless you are ""friends"" with upper management"
6159,,The company has been good to me but I am not sure that many of my colleagues would say the same for their experience.,2015-02-02,4.0,Financial Advisor,Branches are not as rigid as some of the larger competition. Managers still have room  to run things according to their customer traffic. The corporate structure allows for good upward mobility.  People are treated fairly well and there is an easy system for reporting hr issues anonymously.  Incentive possibility ranges from decent for licensed employees or bankers. Licensed bankers have the ability to obtain full licensing without a minimum commitment to stay with the company. Good hours with branches in my area open from 9am-5pm in lobby and depending on the branch limited to no saturday employment. Bank is closed on all federal holidays unlike some competitor's.  Company provides good training which may include expense paid travel to out of state classes. For the most part the atmosphere is positive with more focus on customer service than sales although this is beginning to change.,"Pay is on the low end of the industry for tellers and bankers which results in high turn over. As of recent there has been a change in top level management with people from other big banks who are trying to implement the hard sales tactics of other firms at PNC causing the culture to shift to be more like industry heavyweights. The teller role is being weeded out to additinal atms and the ""universal model"" aka tellerless branches so full time teller spots are limited causing a loss of young talent. Not enough time spent fostering new entry level employees. Strict customer service scoring which makes it difficult for any busy branch to maintain passing scores. The branch auditors are ridiculous and care more about failing offices than giving them the  updates on policies so they can pass. The company does not pay incentive until half way throught the next quarter making it difficult to leave bc if you are not employed on the day that incentive is paid you will not get it even if you were employed through the end of the quarter. They discourage over and under achievers by reprimanding low sales and putting a cap on high incentives. If you land a huge sale they reserve the right to ingnore the percentage you are due per the comp plan and  pay you a reduced amount to avoid ""windfall incentives"". Goals are established monthly but they pay you quarterly which makes no sense."

6225,,Veteran Friendly..... Ummmm NO!!!!,2015-01-05,2.0,Mortgage Underwriter,They have coffee and try and be proactive in training. Along with this they often try and do things around the office to make it seem like a team environment when in reality it just disrupts your workday!,"Small regional mentality trying to be big time. I have worked for the big guys and the culture at PNC is one of a insular old boys club that doesn't take kindly to new blood. This company has grown by leaps and bounds over the last few years from a large regional to a Super Regional just below the big 5. 
The problem is the management on the lower levels don't seem to grasp this. Additionally they place an inordinate amount of pressure on operations along with constantly moving goals. To add insult to injury they profess their support of a ""work life balance"" when in reality this means work first, work second, work third, oh you have a life outside the bank and sometimes things happen... well call HR and see if we can get in trouble for not letting you attend to this... HR said no.... crack whip get back to work! 
There is no accountability at the managerial level with the common response to issues that may arise being to blame the employee for any problems and avoid ownership of their role in the problem. It's the not really a team so stab you in the back and smile in your face mentality. 
Training was an absolute joke. As a level 1 in my job I was held to the same expectations and performance expectations as the top level 3 employee! So someone with 15 years of experience and someone with a year of experience were expected to perform at the exact same level of production and efficiency! Well that's like asking your 21 year old to drive a car and your 15 year old to drive a car.... who do you think is more likely to make mistakes. Then as stated before instead of management being proactive and identifying areas of weakness for additional training or mentoring you learn through trial and error and are penalized for making an error. To add insult to injury then you also begin to learn that your job maybe in jeopardy taboot!"

Competitive vacation offer.,Customer service driven sales results are a thing of the past. They are joining the ranks of other large banks looking for widgets rather than quality accounts/customers. As an employee you are told to reach out to upper management with escalated issues however when you do there is absolutely no backup.  Health care packages are a joke. Ridiculously expensive compared to what the average salary is.  If you want a promotion don't expect a pay raise to come with it.
6233,,not a good place,2014-12-29,2.0,,"Lots of overtime available.   Bonues are ok but only once per quarter,  around $1000.00 every 3 months.  Training is mediocre.

As a Bank Teller you're responsible for ordering supplies, stocking supplies, accurancy in counting money, providing quality customer service, and doing all the work for the sales consultant. You'll work at branch with one other teller and it'll just be the two of you. As a teller you're expected to do all the work. Too much pressure on sales that customers don't want to hear about and don't care about. You'll get 6$ for each referral you'll make and you get surveyed on your customer service. If one customer had a negative experience and gives you a bad rating your job is on the line. Pay is disgraceful. As a full time teller you're lucky if they offer you more than 10$ an hour."

6243,,Good benefits. Terrible pay.,2014-12-17,3.0,Customer Service Associate,Weekends and holidays off. Steady hours. Small family- like work environment.,"Huge workload, especially if you are new and right out of training. They also don't teach you everything in training. Most of the things you learn are when you're in front of a customer. Small staff means less flexibility for vacation days and personal time off. For the amount of work that's done, the pay is awful. I have personally worked at a mall and had better pay. Some of the ""big wigs"" I've met are rude and completely unapproachable. The computers are ALWAYS crashing which makes for a bad customer experience."

It is an institution I will always do my banking with.",I was told I could only get a 10% raise when switching positions within the company. I ended up getting paid thousands of dollars less than those who were new to PNC. How is that fair? Also there is a major lack of communication and consistency within the company.
6246,,Not enough focus on employee relations,2014-12-12,2.0,Business Analyst,"There aren't many pros to working here.  The work/life balance is OK.  They do give options to work different schedules to accommodate employees (only if you are in a department with managers who will allow it, if you work production based positions chances are you will be forced to work the hours they set)","When you join the company at a lower pay grade it will take YEARS before you make a decent salary.  Raises are roughly 1-2% and shrinking every year.  The process to post for jobs internally is horrible and they typically only let an employee move up two pay grades, and the max raise they tend to offer is 10%.  As with any company, politics rule this place.  You are required to stay in each position for a minimum of one year.  The only way to make some money here is to post out every year and try to get that 10% pay increase.  The technology infrastructure is terrible and the company knows it.  They are investing heavily in new technology, which comes at a cost to employees.  Lower raises and less and less employee incentives.  About two years ago they forced all employees onto a high deductible health insurance plan.  They also DO NOT care about education.  Yes, they offer a tuition reimbursement program (you have to stay at company for THREE years after graduation or pay them back), but when it comes to posting for jobs internally its all about WHO YOU KNOW, not what you know."

I thought to myself finally a job that I a can excel at..when you first start the training is the basics to get you to be able to do ""simple"" transactions.  However once you are placed at your branch and are left be face to face with customers you realize that you don't have the knowledge to handle most situations that come about.  On top of the that the minute that you are interacting with customers you are not placed in a situation where you can be surveyed by the customer. Your branch depends on good scores in order to bonus...Its like you are set up to fail right away.  The turnover is crazy.....I would think that a large company would want people to stay and invest in them however the money is just spent training new people all the time.  The demand of the job is not laid out from the start and the ever daily changing of how things are done is even worse.  And finally for the pay that is given is CRAZY!!!!  I dont know how they expect people to do everything they want in a small time frame, 100% customer focused, low pay, maybe a very small bonus 2 times a year if that if you are lucky and be happy to work there,.....hence the biggest turnover I have seen with a company!!!!"

6277,,No place to build a banking career.,2014-11-19,1.0,Anonymous,Excellent 401K match program. Pay is generally on par with most large banks. PNC offers a fairly diverse work environment.,"PNC Bank's business culture has changed drastically recently.  In the Washington DC market there is a major disconnect between senior management and the branch teams. The discord seems to have intensified since the retirement of the former Chairman of the Bank. Senior management at the market level has placed an unrealistic mandate on regional management to generate widget business from the branches rather than focusing on what's in the best interest of the bank's customers. The DC market to many of its employees, has become a very undesirable workplace environment due to high sales production pressure and inconsistencies with job performance reviews. Strong arm sales tactics have created a very difficult working environment for branch management and the branch teams. There is clearly a growing distrust between some regional managers and their branch management teams. Branch management is often the scapegoat when issues arise from extreme pressure placed on branch staffs to produce sales at all cost. PNC is on a straight path to the same poor work environment reputation as Bank Of America and Wells Fargo."

6282,,Employee,2014-11-16,2.0,Employee,Good place to work for if you follow their guidelines.,"Depends on the department. Too much micro-management in my department. If you are not an officer who can bring in revenue, you are a second class citizen who ideas are not valued. Opportunities for advancement are tough and usually a lateral move. Sometimes the most skilled person with experience will get passed over for a promotion for a candidate with less or no experience because they graduated from the same school as the hiring manager or they are related to an officer or executive or the candidate has strong external connections that could bring revenue to the department.

There are always times when I can step out in an emergency or know that when I am calling out, there are team members that can cover for me. I am very fortunate that I have a great branch team, not sure about other locations.",My current position still does not have a very clear expectation of what should be asked of them. it is a fairly new position to the company so there are constant changes to try and fit the mold of whatever upper management has decided to be the 'flavor of the month' for completing goals.
6286,,Your education or opinion are meaningless.,2014-11-12,1.0,Loan Analyst,The entire department has the same morale level: rock bottom.,"Ten years with the bank, eight of which in the same role and going nowhere.  College was a complete waste, as PNC cares not what your potential is, just what is listed on their endless reports.  PNC values reports and micromanagement more than anything else.  Pay increases range from 0% to a max of 1%.  So a .25% pay increase is essentially a free soda every two weeks.  At that rate, you will achieve a 10% pay increase in over 40 years.  

The people that get bonuses (executives) state that the rest of the employees will not, so from time to time, you'll get a PNC branded stress ball, or PNC branded pen, etc.

Avoid at all costs.  They have no interest in your happiness, despite them telling you that they do.  Proof of that is when you tell them you're unhappy, nothing happens, multiplied by a whole department."

While most employers will state this, PNC actually walks the walk.","It's amazing that PNC hasn't been toppled by its own bureaucracy and general inefficiency.  The systems are stone-age, some of the policies & procedures are completely out of date and useless...  All of this results in time wasted and general frustration."

They said within a few years, all will have to re-apply for their jobs, and if you haven't been a good salesperson while providing accurate, prompt and friendly service and keeping your drawer balanced, and taking computer based training courses in your ""spare moments"", you won't have a job at all!

There are people in the main office that oversee you even though they don't know what you do day in and day out. They provide lots of trainings but they don't train you everything that you need to know about your job. In addition, they will give the Business Banker a handbook but leave critical information about the job out of it and then produce another handbook that they said they gave you with information that they should have trained you."
6301,,Terrible,2014-10-29,1.0,Teller II,Banker's hours... Enjoyable to work with the public.,"Very low pay. Extensive responsibility with no respect. Total disregard to necessary breaks. Not allowing employees to leave the floor for lunch or even to potty when understaffed. Not permitting employees to take vacation or time off when requested. Little respect from management towards well educated employees with degrees. Allowing ""teenyboppers"" without experience or education in management positions. I'm talking retail here. Branches. I can't comment on corporate or call centers as I have never been privileged enough to work in those departments even though people in retail have formally requested transfers to other departments multiple times."

Hitting goal is not an easy task....,2014-10-28,3.0,Universal Branch Consultant,"Coworkers will become your extended family. You will love the no stress, no pressure approach in motivation for you to hit goal. The training is one of the best in the industry (if you get in the right branch)",The pay is the lowest in the industry. Pay increases are at most 1% after year end reviews.

6307,,Do not be a Financial Advisor for PNC Investments in Illinois,2014-10-26,1.0,Financial Advisor,If you are working in a legacy market like Pittsburgh or New Jersey this is a great opportunity. It all depends on the book of business you are inheriting. They did not have a sizeable book of business in Illinois when I worked there. They would just churn FAs and old National City FAs would inherit the books after the new FAs quit.,"1. High turnover. I did not meet a new Financial Advisor at PNC Investments that lasted more than a year in Illinois. They would try to bring people from Pittsburgh but those individuals would also leave after a year due to low pay. They tried bring top advisers from Chase and Fifth/Third and they would leave within 6 months.
2. Low Pay. - Individuals in there 40s would be making less than $30,000 a year. Some were forced to pay back debt after they left. 
3. Unfair goals. Suppose you inherit a $100 million book of managed money in Pittsburgh. You lose half of the clients and at the end of the year your book is $50 million. Suppose, in Illinois, you get a book of business of $2 million, you grow the business 5 fold to $10 million. Who should make more money - the individual who lost half the book or the individual who grew the business 5-fold? In PNC's world, the individual who has the larger book should get paid more. You are measured by how big your book is and not how well you grow it. In Illinois you will cover branches that have no history of getting investment accounts. You can turn things around but at the end of the year you are measured by the size of your book. You are getting compared to people in Pittsburgh who inherited books and are doing nothing to grow their business."

PNC will turn you into a 40k a year processor.  You will have the worst technology in the industry and you will be chained to your desk doing paperwork.

It's easy to be pigeon-holed into a role and stay in that niche. Due to this there is little incentive to stay beyond a personally identified timeframe.

Only take what was once a large Midamerica branch but trust me they won't be available. Those branches have deep pockets, lots of low hanging cd renewals and loyal customers. You will be scheduled to work until the teller windows close and work most Saturdays. Any challenge you have will be yours to solve because your Financial Specialist Team Leader does not have any power. They just count the widgets/numbers. Your second boss, the branch manager, will be more concerned about getting good banking customer surveys than your desire to do the outbound calling required in a smaller/medium size branch to increase investment revenue.

The core company values are great but I personally did not see those in the 11 months I was there. I called HR and seemingly got no support. They only seem to care about numbers not how well the branch is running. The pay is bad in comparison to other banks I hear it is quite low. They do not give raises. They seem to only want young people working there probably as they can pay them less and mold them easier! They put people in management roles who have no business being in them. My experience was quite bad. What's sad is I was good at the job and fairly well enjoyed it except for the selling. They are really pushing the sells now. There was little organization. When I had money issues it took them days to get back to me. Money issues are a big deal in a bank at least as far as I am concerned. The list goes on..."
6363,,Worst Experience,2014-09-26,2.0,Customer Service Associate,Great benefits and opportunities to grow within the company.,"Was repeatedly harassed and picked on by Assistant Manager for YEARS. She had issues with every single person she ever worked with, made racist comments, abused her position by coming in late and leaving early due to the fact that she did not have to punch in, would literally look for reasons to fire people, and gossiped about everyone in the branch. She had MULTIPLE issues with HR, yet PNC kept her in a management position. I have ZERO respect for a company that blatantly ignores the well being of its employees and turns a blind eye to harassment. That woman is a lawsuit waiting to happen."
6364,,PNC Experience,2014-09-25,3.0,Loss Mitigation Negotiator,I learned about the culture of a new organization to the area. PNC taught me investor specifics like I've never learned before.

Medical insurance are not good just average. Limited  opportunity growth especially in a retail aspect. Top management push for sales, they claim they want to build client relationship yet they push for sales --- their loan department takes ages to get approvals or even the process are horrible and some of their retail products are misleading for clients which ultimately clients will come in to open then closed their account  the following days.  In addition,  the policy and procedures of the company are not concrete because you have to run around to make sure you are not following base on which market. Salary are way below unless you are branch managers which they get incentives for not barely doing anything... They get incentives when the branch made 5 star on the CIQ and to top it off getting additional incentive with their P&L. Now the company are doing overall changes from  the traditional branch to  Universal Branch and claim more incentives benefit.. In a retail branch people are leaving left to right.."

I personally was brought before HR because I followed said manager's instructions on a case, and he then reported me for sales manipulation...so PNC placed & kept the sale I MADE, then fired me 1 day before bonus checks were cut so they could deny me the $1800 commission for previous quarter!"

Good work life balance.","Human sigma culture that is preached, goes overboard with employees and not utilized with managers. Still working off a ""widget"" based model versus a profitability model in the new centers. There is still a large click left over from the National City merger. If you are part of that, you can do no wrong and promotions are abound, leaving mediocre management & a lot fluff positions. Pay scales need to be adjusted to market to attract top talent & retain current. CFO put it best, we are 3 small banks (PNC, National City & RBC) trying to make one large bank. The technology is way behind, still using Lotus Notes email , underwriting is disorganized and spend too much on junk promotions (ice cream give away, grand opening ($25k budget) that should be reinvested into better pay & technology.

This is a large company and they want you to learn and grow.  There is plenty of opportunity to move up as long as you are willing to move around.  They also provide the benefit of working from home if needed.,"The organization is going through a ton of change right now in its culture.  So, there is a lot of overwork due to political maneuvering within the middle layers.  A ton of new policies are being put in place without a set procedure to fulfill those policies.  This causes double or triple the work to complete anything.  This could also be due to a culture being put in place that needs a certain level of positions filled which currently are not."
6405,,Working at PNC was a great experience.,2014-08-26,3.0,Branch Manager,There were good incentive packages and good benefits.,There were very stringent goals that were not achievable in the branch system with customers now going to more of an online approach.

Customers are great as well in understanding corporate policy and why we as branch employees have to do certain things such as ""Welcome to PNC"" and often joke around with us due to that.","Lots of arm chair quarterbacking from Senior Management who have no clue what is going on and have egos the size of Texas. The lobby engagement aspect is comical as customers often comment about how silly the constant ""Welcome to PNC"" is. This organization is driven by fear based motivation, threatening write ups and termination for not meeting goals. Goals are not based on nothing, rather it is simply throwing a number out there with no basis if the goals are feasible and attainable.  For instance if for the past two years a branch has averaged 40 accounts per month, somehow the simpleton management members fell 65-70 is a feasible goal and hold branch employees accountable for those mysterious numbers that are unlikely to be reached"

Communication with support can be frustrating at times as well.
6417,,Customer Service Associate,2014-08-17,1.0,Customer Service Associate,I have a friend here that I really enjoy working with. We have the same feelings and views on the company making it easier to get through the day.,"PNC has incredibly high expectations with very low pay. I had five years banking experience and was only offered $10.00/hour which is equivalent and sometimes less than what other tellers are paid. They force us to stay two extra hours one day a week or work a Saturday to make phone calls to customers to sell products. Customers were typically irritated, did not answer the phone, or return the phone call. They expect you to receive 5 stars on all of your customer surveys and reprimand you if you do not. For example, one week a customer gave me a 5 star survey and another customer gave me a 3.6. I was not praised for my 5 star, but rather coached for my 3.6, though it is a rarity for me. They expect every customer to give you a 5 and if they don't, for whatever reason, you're disciplined. I was expected to be certified in my conversations with customers (tellers do not have to do this) and attend many training courses, and still received minimal pay. Employees are given a survey on the workplace environment similar to the surveys customers are given. If all employees do not give the highest score for each answer, nobody receives a raise, so employees are forced to lie about the work environment just so that some type of raise is given. They are always wanting you to sell EVERYTHING, even if a customer truly does not need it or want it. They want you to push mortgages, investments, credit cards, loans and checking accounts every day to every customer. Their expectations are just not feasible. My manager knew the assistant manager was bullying all employees and when it was brought to her attention multiple times, she brushed it off, defended the assistant manager, but then gave the assistant manager poor reviews when applying for other positions. The branch has a high turnover rate due to low pay, high expectations and poor management."
6418,,"Big company, but advancement can be limited depending on your department.",2014-08-15,2.0,Branch Financial Sales Consultant,"Decent benefits, decent pay for a younger person.

They offer good vacation time, health benefits are decent, they have a great volunteer program that you're able to devote time to during work hours, they give back to the community, etc. Depending on your position, typically pretty laid back about time off, calling off, etc. Values family life.","Underpaid, you are held to the accountability that you will help develop new procedures and processes, train new employees, etc. but paid the minimum. Processes change very often by managers but never consulting the specialists (who do the job everyday)."
6450,,Financial Specialist,2014-07-26,2.0,Financial Specialist II,"My branch was wonderful.  My co-workers, for the most part, got along well.  The branch is given incentive to get investment and banking referrals to me.  For someone with decent sales skills and investment background, this isn't difficult job at all.  I would have loved to stay with this company, as I could see how my efforts were helping the branch's bottom line.  Management was pleasant.  Salary was competitive.","Although management was pleasant, they weren't very helpful.  I was refused credit on multiple banking and investment closes.  My referrals would sit there, and without any explanation, they would just not pay you.  There is a faulty system they use for inquiries into why you didn't get paid, and to have it corrected.  Always, my requests were declined, even though it was clear I was the key factor in the transaction.  My branch would get acknowledged for my efforts, but I would have no credit.  I learned that just about everyone in sales has had PNC deny them pay for closes.  People talk about it, with acceptance.  It boggles my mind.  The systems are horrible, and malfunction regularly.   

They have too much overlap between this program and their Private Client Group position.  They lie and tell you there's no conflict or competition, then they put you in the ring and wait for the cat fight to break out.  

At least in my region, the men in this position have private offices and the women have desks in the lobby.  My desk was three feet from my bankers and in ear shot of everyone in the lobby.  Not a good way to have wealth conversations."

6453,,Out of Footprint LOs - A deserted Island,2014-07-26,1.0,Loan Officer,"Really nice empty offices.   Great place for LOs that come from other big in-footprint banks that paid to get their LOs, in realtors' offices (which PNC isn't willing to do for out of footprint LOs), meaning, PNC can and does get files closed significantly faster than other big bank competitors... which is important in the Purchase Money Market.","Absolutely no out of footprint marketing support, meaning, no business development management, no access to the existing database to do mail merges to send mailers to existing customers that can use PNC's help, i.e. 6,400 plus existing customers in our marketplace with rates above 6% (30 yr refi rates are mid 4s at this writing).

Antiquated technology, meaning, no paperless docs, no web based technology, 15 minutes just to price a loan (there's no quick pricing engine like Optimal Blue).

For all intents and purposes, the LO is the processor assistant, meaning, you send out, collect and upload all documents.  To be fair, an outsourced doc company mails out a package from Miamisburg, OH that's about as user friendly and confusing to borrowers as an assembly manual for an arc welder.  You'll spend 60+% of your time in processing and doc chasing functions.

The area manager is bogged down in paperwork, acts as an incessant ""file fixer"" for what should be just a normal file flow rendering them useless to help LOs develop market relationships with real estate brokers, builders, etc.  

Basically, the majority of LOs rely on chasing HARP loans to survive... looking them up one borrower at a time (see no data mail merge marketing access above)... which means this out of footprint division is 150 bps away from evaporating."

Pay for part time teller is on a scale for about $10ish - 15 (just as a reference - full-time i believe is at a diff scale), relaxing some days (stressful on others when there are long lines/someone calls out), 80% of customers were really great!! Try to ignore the bad ones.  Promotion is possibly after you work a year or so in the branch, you can apply somewhere else, but they look mainly on your Gallup score (see below) and achieved referrals.  Referrals are basically having a conversation w a customer about a product / service, them interested, getting their #/sit down/appointment, and your platform associate to close the deal; you get paid $6 for closed checking/savings, credit cards, loans/mortagages i believe. $15 for JUST investment sit down.  Forgot how much for CCs & loans/mortgages.. If you are a great seller, they will LOVE YOU! and you will probably do great in the company.","Hard to move up on the retail side unless you're interested in SELLING!, if you are part-time you get stuck with closing & Saturdays ALWAYS. Gallup is killer; it's a way for PNC to ""evaluate"" your customer service / sales skills.  Less than a 5 is bad.  So, you can already tell that is unfair.  And if you always get 5s and lets say one 3, your individual, as well as branch score plummets. And PNC cares DEEPLY for it & that system ! I have a friend who got rejected for the position because her score was lower then what they were looking for.  And she had been with the company for 5 years.

6516,,if you want to be a good salesman then...,2014-06-04,2.0,Teller,"Good scheduling, I never had a problem. In fact I used to get more hours than originally scheduled for.
Friendly coworkers.","The biggest problem I had working for this company was the amount of referrals required each month. Each year, it seems the amount of required referrals goes up. With that, your manager and the upper management of the company are jumping down your throat trying to get one or two referrals out of you. Most of the time the customer says they're not even interested, which in turn, leads to management and upper management complaining to you that you aren't doing your job correctly, even though the customer has explained that they resent you asking them constantly if they would like to upgrade their account, get a credit card, or bring an existing credit card over to PNC Bank. When I was originally hired for this job, I was told that I would have to up sell some products. What they didn't tell me, was that I would have to up sell EVERYTHING to EVERY customer. It's a very annoying process to hound every customer who comes in for some type of product that they don't want. The company is to geared on sales and doesn't focus on how much the clients I actually like being at this bank. In my region, the customer loyalty and customer satisfaction was low. More importantly, the employee satisfaction was below 30%. Had I known prior to being hired that I would be hired for a low wage of $10 an hour (with no chance of a raise in sight), be forced to get at least 30 referrals each month, and out of those 30 at least 10 have to post and go through to get count as credit. I wouldn't have joined.
I would highly recommend that everyone stays away from working at this bank. Poor pay. Hideous focus on referrals. Hideous focus on referrals. Hideous focus on referrals."

6518,,Everyone needs to read this,2014-06-03,4.0,Anonymous,"Great co-workers.  The branch I work at is very casual, and that's why a lot of our clients love us.  Steady part-time hours and decent starting pay (for someone who has had no prior experience in banking).  No such thing as a night shift.","This part is what everyone needs to read.  Pnc bank is starting to turn into Bank of America, wells fargo, and chase bank.  They implemented high referral goals, and they're putting tons of pressure on branch managers to ensure their staff meet those goals.   So what does that mean?  It means we have to hound almost every client about some product that they don't need in order for us to get referrals.  If you're about to start working at PNC, then I hope you're a good salesman.  Also, if you're a full-time college student (like me), then have fun trying to learn about every PNC product along with doing your massive amounts of schoolwork and studying.  Another thing you will have to worry about (as a college student) is studying for the 2 exams you have coming up for class and meeting your sales quota for PNC.  
Here's everything in a nutshell:   If you want to become a salesman,  this job is the right job for you.  However, If you don't want to become a salesman......

Also - be aware - it's an older ""big bank"" so nepotism is alive and well across the divisions of PNC.  Many, many times I was asked to circulate a resume for a ""son of a friend.""  There are good programs for diversity - and strong leaders driving that charge - but if you are female or diverse, you will need to get connected quickly and be both resilient and, at times, your own best advocate.

Policies and standards are constantly changing and becoming more like Wells Fargo and BOA to compete with the share of households those companies have. The sales pressure is intense, and it's hard to balance the operational duties with everything expected sales-wise. There is also a severe shortage of staffing in the branches, and branch managers are working nearly 50 hours a week as they are the only salaried positions. The rest of the staff is constantly working at a disadvantage, without lunch breaks, without adequate coverage, which makes it nearly impossible to achieve the sales and service results expected."
6577,,"If you are in IT, this job is NOT for you!",2014-04-19,1.0,Assistant Vice President,"It's a paycheck, and not much else. The benefits are actually quite poor.","This bank is WAY behind the tecnology curve. IT Systems at PNC are only upgraded when they are no longer supported by the manufacturer. There is no cutting edge technology anywhere in the bank. Technologies like Voice Over IP, Power Over Ethernet, Video Conferencing and WiFi are all largely absent from the PNC roster. Lotus Notes is the email platform in 2014, need I say more? 

I had a manager who is a VP, and his boss, another VP, tell me that the way IT workers are tracked in his division is by logging into instant messaging. If you are not logged into IM, you are considered to NOT be working. If you are not on instant messaging, your boss starts sending notes via email and SMS text messages to your personal cell phone begin immediately to ask why you are not on Instant Messaging. Did you close out the huge fat instant messaging window on your desktop to perform other work? You are not on instant messaging, therefore, you are not working. The instant messaging client? An 8 year old version of Lotus Sametime. 

This bank celebrates longevity. I met a guy who had been in the same job for 35 years and was retiring. Everyone at the bank thought it was absolutely wonderful. I thought to myself, if I am doing the same job in 35 years, shoot me.

This bank is takeover bait at best by a larger more efficient bank. Many people within PNC state that the bank is different and unique because it's a ""relationship oriented bank"". Do you have a relationship with your ATM? How about your local bank branch? Do you even know anyone's name in your local branch? This is an outdated company in a commoditized industry.

I was lied too in my interview process. Had a senior VP tell me bonuses were 15% for an AVP position. Learned on day two that bonuses for the position I was in were about 1%. Raises were also a joke in discussions with other people on the team, some averaging less than 1% a year. 

My bosses boss who was a more senior VP told me that ""At PNC, decision just happen, we don't make decisions. Decisions are dangerous and carry risk"". That statement came from a guy with FOUR different MBA's from FOUR separate colleges at PNC who is running technology, but has no detailed technology experience.

Run away as fast as you can."

6581,,Great place to learn.,2014-04-16,3.0,Branch Manager,Benefits are good.   Requires long hours and perfection.,Working with local management.  Management will do what ever it takes to make themselves look good.  They do not care about employees.
6582,,Satisfactory but left a lot to be desired,2014-04-16,3.0,Teller I,"Great team, a lot of opportunity for incentive pay and bonuses","Terrible base compensation, intense focus on sales"
6583,,Excellent values and culture,2014-04-16,5.0,Customer Service Associate,PNC is commited to growth and advancement of employees. They provide numerous opportunities for education and training.,Lots of competition for positions within the local market. You may have to relocate to advance quickly.
6584,,"Great company, but undergoing a lot of change; uncertain if for the better or worse",2014-04-15,4.0,Enterprise Services Analyst,"This is a great, stable company, and among the largest employers in Pittsburgh.  Work life balance is said to be an important part of the culture at PNC, and fellow employees are generally very teamwork-oriented and happy to offer advice.","This company is undergoing significant change, especially in the area of Technology and Operations.  This comes following the retirement of several key executives, including the former CEO.  All of the organizational change has contributed to high anxiety and has made this company a relatively unpleasant place to work over the past year.  This will change over time, but is expected to continue for the next few years.

Expense management is a high priority in order to improve PNC's efficiency ratio as compared to peer banks.  This affects employees by making it difficult to advance, or to receive salary increases.  It also means that salaries do not keep pace with cost-of-living increases.

The company places a lot of focus on its annual Gallup Employee Engagement Survey results.  PNC scores well on this survey as a company, and has received Gallup's ""Great Places to Work"" recognition.  The results are steeped in Gallup research, can be anonymously broken down by department, and seem to suggest clear areas for improvement.  I found that the results led to a lot of action, but not to outcomes that might actually budge the needle.  For example, one question focuses on whether employees understand what is expected of them at work, and another focuses on whether employees have the tools to do their job effectively.  Both of these questions received low scores in my department.  While management rallied around the low scores, invested considerable time in analyzing the scores, and assigned employees to work on improving the scores, the seemingly obvious solutions never materialized.  One would have expected such scores to result in better training, more growth opportunities, and improved employee-technology.

Finally, PNC is such a large enterprise that it is a management-by-committee environment.  No one person makes any decisions, which means difficult decisions are rarely made.  The committee structure ensures that the organization moves very slow.  In fact, it can take as many as three months for information to get from the bottom to the top because there are so many levels of management, and so many meetings for those managers to attend.  With all of these meetings, mid-level managers are always trying to get into more meetings, and especially trying to get into meetings with more-senior-level managers.  Being ""in the know"" often takes precedence over one's day job, and suddenly these managers are too busy to actually be productive.  In any given meeting, it seems like there are only a handful of people actually doing work, i.e. having developed some work-product or other evidence of their work.  Everybody else just heads from meeting to meeting trying to shell out ""advice"" and complaining about being caught up in their busy schedules.  I would argue that the 9,500-some member Technology and Operations area could get the same level of productivity by eliminating about a quarter of mid-level and upper-mid-level management, as they're only around to be involved in this game of meeting charades."

Decent benefits and lots of job security.,Compensation is below market rate and lacking in light of responsibilities and workload. Organization is run very thin to keep costs down.
6587,,Look elsewhere,2014-04-15,2.0,Business Analyst,"Work-life balance is ok. Except not flexible.  Management expects you to be in your seat 8 hours a day.  Compared to other industries 8 hours a day is good, but management makes it hard to take doctor's appointments and run errands and make up the time.","Terrible raises, in a banner year at PNC a good raise is 2%.  My manager told me she tried to give me a 2% raise but leadership cut my raise to 0.6%.  I don't trust my manager. I received a ""Meets All Expectations"" at my year end review.  In my development meeting with my manager, I asked them how I could get a better rating next year and what I needed to do to get promoted.  Their response was that I was doing a great job and I just need to keep doing what i'm doing.  There is no framework in place to understand how to get promoted or how to increase your raises.  It is all up to the discretion of your manager.  

Internal politics is so frustrating.  Department Directors fight with each other instead of cooperating to get work done.  

Vacation time expires each year and you cannot roll over unused time.  I have a family and it makes it difficult to plan vacations because I need to have some reserve vacation time in case a child gets sick.  PNC needs to move to PTO give people more vacation and allow indviduals to roll over at least 1 week of vacation per year."

PNC is evolving from a small company to a big company, and there are bound to be growing pains along the way. Some managers still think small. Some new executives brought in to help with the growth don't fit into the culture."

Management was disconnected from the front line (retail banking) and even though they had industry leading product technology, the employee side was kind of a joke. As a small business owner, I had better management of my staff with my ipad and a $20 app over what I had with this company for my staff."

Depending on who you work for, work/life balance is very good.  
In spite of what some may suggest, the opportunity to move around within the organization is good for performers.  
They still do merit based pay raises.
There is a building focus on improvement.
For a bank, good job security.  FTE reduction is always a last resort - the reason you haven't seen the headlines regarding layoffs for PNC like you have for other large financial institutions.","Technology is still a ways off from where it needs to be, but they are working on it. Example - no wifi, and they are only just this year upgrading from Windows XP.  
The culture is very set in its ways and does not react well to change.  This results in a lot of under-utilized human capital.  Example - finance experts spend far more time slicing and dicing in excel to transform data than actually conducting financial analysis."

Work 10hrs a day and sometimes 7 days in a row rarely get two days off in a row, Inadequate training and leadership. Commission is horrible compared to what licensed FSC at traditional branches can make. Because in a traditional branch you would be considered a CSA, which is basically  a way PNC avoids hiring a teller and an additional FSC. You are really doing the job of five people at times managing, sales, teller, marketing, and security.  Basically you are lucky to bring home an extra $400 a month which highly underpaid for the amount of work you have to do. Goals are unrealistic and non uniform enforcement. Constant turn over of employees and managers which leaves alot of branches understaffed. Those  who are doing well are failed to get promoted from with in which is why alot of people who stay for a couple years leave to other banks."

It's all about meeting numbers and deadlines, not about the employee as a person.  A lot of lateral moves with no real career progression or salary increases.  Equipment is outdated and cheap.

Great products for customers to help them manage their finances. This a great place for a college grad to learn about customer service and sales.,Pay is very low for what is expected of you. Incentive plan is quarterly and really low in amount you receive. Tons of reports to fill out daily and weekly that is pretty much the same report. Not only do you have to fill out these written reports you have to also out the same information in after each customer interaction in their computer system. When it is all said and done you have documented the same thing four different times which takes up a lot of your time. Management pressures you to increase your sales and no matter what you achieve it is never enough. In sales this is pretty normal but when you receive less that $500 a quarter as an incentive but you have exceeded your goals you are not very motivated since you are not compensated enough for your performance.

6652,,Best bank I've worked for in my 13 years in the business,2014-02-26,4.0,Assistant Branch Manager,"PNC is not a widget driven bank. They are a relationship driven bank. I know every bank says that, but the PNC strategy truly exemplifies this. They have an eco-system of business partners that works together to reach branch goals. At many banks, you don't know who your business partners are; you'll often only see them once or twice a year.  This is not the case at PNC. They are extremely accessible. Good overall culture. I've never once been asked ""How many checking accounts did you open today?"", which is rare for a bank.  PNC is truly committed to the entire financial relationship.","Same challenges exist at PNC that exist in all commercial retail banks.  Aggressive sales goals with a very slim work-force. Also, there's been a strong push to get clients to use the ATM, online, and mobile banking which will essentially make brick and mortar banking centers obsolete."

They are a large bank and have goals required of every position. The ability to reach those goals and at the same time service each customer can often be difficult

6672,,Worst work experience I've ever had.,2014-02-11,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"*Flexible scheduling is supported in some departments.
*Bank holidays are a nice feature.
*Annual department outings are a nice way to get out of the office.","*Below market compensation, including eroding benefits.
*Very poor technology and an unwillingness to spend what is needed to catch up.
*Management at all levels is very task oriented and tends to micro manage.  Focusing on medium or longer term prospects is discouraged.
*Work/life balance depends on your manager.  Mine liked to come early and stay late because he resented that his wife wanted to stay home with the kids.  This caused him to want others to stay late, even if it wasn't necessary.
*Promotions are being kept to no more than 5% of the company.  This is not a way to retain employees.
*If you are ambitious in your career, this is not the place for you.  Too many people seem to have found low paying slots in the company and don't want change or to grow.  Turnover has increased as it's easy to leave when compensation is so low.  Company philosophy is to have more people in place, but at much lower pay.  This is very demotivating if you expect to work with at least some vibrant smart people every day.
*Lack of accountability at all levels."

6674,,"Unprofessional Management, Lacking leadership skills.",2014-02-09,3.0,Bank Teller,The recruiter was a very nice woman. Some co-workers were very nice to work with. Clean work environment.,"The management staff had no leadership skills no matter which branch you went to. No one showed their true selves. It was hard to ask for help from upper management because they wouldn't just answer your question, they would put you down first and then decide to help you out. The managers expected new employees to learn on their own, they were not helpful. PNC is all about customer service and making the employees happy, but with both managers, I did not see much assistance or courteous acts. The company just wanted accounts and the customer out the door. Pay was low and raises did not occur often."
6675,,First company I work for.,2014-02-09,5.0,Teller,"Good working environment, good career opportunities and good management team!",I don't have any cons right now.
6676,,Decent experience,2014-02-08,1.0,Financial Sales Consultant,Pay and hours are good. Good bank with great accounts.,"I work in an InStore branch (Stop and Shop) and I completely dislike it. This position in InStore is all about sales and I do not enjoy or like sales, so that's why I don't like it. I stand on my feet all day too which is not fun. The sales pressure is not too bad, but getting accounts is a must."
6677,,"Promise the world, but under deliver",2014-02-06,2.0,Financial Specialist,"The branch staff and business partners I work with are awesome people and I have made a number of great friends.  Base pay is good, and even though I'm not a salaried position I get paid for 40 hours every week even if I'm a few hours short and whenever I exceed 40 I get overtime.  

There is a lot of opportunity within the branch's book of business to move money over to the investment side of the company and we aren't limited on product set and can offer a wide number of competitors products.  

The work hours aren't bad, typically 8:30/9-5:30/6 and as long as your branch is meeting it's goals and you have good customer review scores upper management will pretty much leave you alone.  

There is a nice tiered bonus kicker for meeting and exceeding your branches investment revenue goal each quarter.

It's a very green company with a lot of focus on being energy efficient.

Strong emphasis on customer service and desire to build customer loyalty.","The internal technology is terrible.  It's very, very dated, not user friendly, and on a number of occasions due to computer glitches and program errors (even when the information is entered correctly and according to PNC policy and procedure) will get you bad customer reviews and even in trouble with upper management.

You get every Sunday off, but expect to work multiple Saturdays a month, especially when trying to close Investment business you have to be willing to work around people's schedules.

My position doesn't really make sense to have and honestly isn't needed within the branch.  I have access to view our investment business and I am supposed to be driving more $ to the investment side, but can't provide any account maintenance, recommend any specific products or really speak outside of completely gray areas.  It's something that could be handled by any of the bankers or the private client group.  There is total reliance on other people to close business.  

I was told I'd spend 75% of my time working on and closing investments and the other 25% would be on quality banking time (lending and opening accounts). The reality is the majority of my time is spent as a personal banker.  There is way to much time spent ordering new checks or resetting pin numbers or simply standing at the front doing ""lobby management"" where you basically act as a Walmart greeter in a suit.  It's not productive, but is required by upper management.  It would be much more efficient if I was proactively seeking business either through calling or business visits. 

My position can't open any type of investment account, I have to either go through a call center with the customer,(It's awkward and a gamble if the random rep you called is going to know what they are doing, or if they are going to recommend the right product to the client) or a regional Financial Advisor who's position is poorly compensated throughout the corporation and as a result the turnover has been insanely high (higher than is normal within the industry, despite referring $2 million in new money to the position last quarter I'm on my 3rd rep as the last 2 quit).

The yearly goal setting for the branch is ridiculous.  My branch met it's investment goal for 2013 and it was a pretty high goal, but we closed more investment business then the branch ever has.  For meeting our goal management decided to more than double it for 2014.  It is unrealistically high and I personally feel it was done more to ensure that I can't receive my bonus multiplier more so than be a fair measure for what the branches activities should be or realistic growth within the branch.

If an investment prospect I uncover, do the work for and close, is labeled in our private client group (regardless of if they never agreed to it, never spoke to private client rep, or even don't want to be in it), I can't and won't get paid on it as there is no way to remove the code in our computer system, no exception process to allow me to get paid and the PCG role and financial specialist role have a lot of overlap and essentially directly compete with each other.   Sooner or later management will realize they don't need both roles.

Over reliance by management on customer survey results, customer service is important, but the questions can be confusing. If we get one bad score from an upset customer due to our computer system's inability to efficiently service our clients, but a dozen other perfect scores it shouldn't result in a conference call every Monday morning at 7 for the rest of the quarter.

The new CEO has admitted he is a ""numbers guy."" It's become apparent as PNC is trying to cut costs at every corner.  I can agree fiscal responsibility is important to an extent, but it is starting to interfere with our ability to provide an exceptional customer experience.  We can't replace a teller if they quit anymore, don't do any free checking products any longer, and we can't retain talent because we won't pay for experience and the raise structure is very flawed."

So I'm pretty sure I should have been paid more.

In the branch where I worked, the teller supervisor, who is honestly the most negative and hateful person I have ever encountered in my life, drove the culture. So the culture was terrible. In other branches, it was great. If you are considering working there, I recommend trying to somehow get to know the people in your branch before accepting an offer.

Because it is a large company employing lots of folks, it is easy to find fellow colleagues with whom you can establish good friendships.","PNC believes that they focus on excellent customer service, however, there is a great disconnect between the real branch environment and reporting given to senior management. Management holds branches accountable to unrealistic customer service parameters, and additionally does not give the branch the power to fully manage to these parameters. 

 Also, large disconnect between large marketing initiatives and sales results seen in branches - marketing has no impact. 

Career environment founded in cronyism rather than meritocracy.  Promotions not based on merit and results, rather who is known to look good, do as little work as possible, and fluently talk hollow corporate speak."
6783,,One rigid midwest stick in the mud,2013-10-13,2.0,Vice President,"Pay reasonably well, and demand few hours.",Generally this is highly regimented organization that allows little room for personal initiative.  It is fair to say that initiative is restricted to deciding which box to put a check in.  The senior managers appear mostly interested in defending their priviledges and tolerating no threats from below.  One evidence of this is the average age of officers is substantially above that of peer institutions.

6791,,Northwest suburb of Chicago** your experience depends on the branch & the manager,2013-10-04,3.0,,"Very customer service driven. In the retail segment, they used an outside company to survey customers. The surveying company randomly selected recent customers and called them to ask how their most recent experience was. Each Friday the results of the surveys were released. It was an exciting time and could help bring staff closer. Or depending on the branch and morale, it was a dreadful time. But, overall, I liked how focused PNC was on giving its customers/clients a great experience.
   I started with National City Bank and went through a conversion with PNC. I commend PNC for how smooth they made the employees experiences during this process.
   * With everything being said prior and with the cons I've listed, I still say that PNC is a good company to work for.","* Be careful of downsizing. I was with a previous bank when PNC bought it. Throughout the transformation and merging of the two banks, PNC ""cleaned house"", brought in new management (from out of state even) who didn't know the community. They forced everyone to get inside the corporate box and not all communities will fit inside. Big city ideals are not looked upon favorably in a smaller town. Many clients left during or shortly after the conversion.
  Also, PNC is NOT comparable or competitive on salaries. I had to take a 23% cut in pay. They gave me a small time frame to look for a higher position with pay more inline with what I was making. But, in my search, I found few positions available and the ones I found were too far of a drive. For me, driving over 100 miles a day round trip to keep my current pay was not feasible. So, I was forced to accept the cut in pay in order to have a job.
  Lastly, I transferred to a new branch and, sadly, that was the worst decision of my career I've ever made. I immediately felt out of place and began looking outside the company for a new job. I did make the attempt to fit in by talking with upper management, only to realize that they were in the clique. The branch was very High School mentality. It's truly unfortunate. I have never encountered such silliness in all my years of working. Honestly, if I were to review PNC solely on my experience at my last branch, I would say PNC=pretty nasty corporation. But, in all fairness, I won't."

Benefits-wise they still have a matching 401k.","The pay grades are on the lower end of the scale and the sales goals for bonuses increase greatly each year. Their employee health insurance is not very good. Depending on your department there is not much help with mentoring or acquiring an advocate.

Problem management system (Infoman) runs on a mainframe and is very clumsy to use. Upper IT Management lacks some key leadership fundamentals like agility, flexibility, and in some cases, integrity. Raises are consistently small, pay grade salary ranges have not been updated since 2004,  and technical training is spotty."

The great thing is, you're surveyed twice annually and PNC takes your responses very seriously.  They want to make sure your development is encouraged, your opinions count and that you have everything you need to do your job the best that you can.  On the other hand, they also care about the customers -- they do not product push and you are never forced to put your customers into products that they don't need.  It's all very personalized and needs-based.  
The benefits are good, you get plenty of paid time off/vacation and sick pay -- with the option to ""purchase"" an additional week of vacation.  
Training is amazing.  They have awesome facilitators who care about the success of each person they train.

PNC does seem to care a lot about employee involvement, cooperation, and dedication. They don't always back it up with action, but they do seem to care.

There are good benefits for part-time workers.

Your schedule may change weekly, but you know exactly how many hours you're working, which is important for pay stability.","Sometimes, the two ""sides"" (tellers and platform employees) don't get along, and can be blamed for each others' mistakes. Again, this is somewhat branch-dependent, but the very nature of the setup makes this kind of thing likely.

Part-timers only get 2.5 days of vacation time a year.

Their performance reviews are unrealistic. A score of 4.5 out of 5 is considered to be, in the words of my manager, ""awful."" And if you get a customer at a bad time or if they were really angry, your branch's average could be affected for months.

The pay is much less per hour than what other banks pay.

We're told to refer to online policies and procedures, but many of these are missing or in strange locations.

Not much upward or even sideways mobility. All of us at the branch had applied for other in-company jobs multiple times, and only one worker was ever able to transfer (to another section of the company entirely)."

Once in your position, you will be compensated with back-pats, ""good jobs!"" and recognition E-cards that carry no monetary value.

Operationally, the mortgage company has realized that it needs to drastically improve processing, underwriting, and servicing to stand out from the crowd, particularly in its new markets. And it has taken solid, measurable steps to do this. 

The company truly is customer-focused and executives really do care about giving the customers the best possible experience available. Employees will readily admit this.

The new CEO of PNC Mortgage says time and time again that he wants to build the best mortgage operations in the industry. While I can't say whether this is possible, I do believe that he is driven to accomplish this.","In spite of the new CEO, corporate culture is abysmal. From the executives to their assistants, one would be hard-pressed to find a group of angrier people. The finger-pointing and refusal to help out colleagues is astounding.

They kept themselves out of the financial mortgage mess and have a great story to share with clients. Cross selling and Referrals are bountiful making any sales job a little less stressful.,"Technology is horribly old and constantly breaking down at all times...and the wrong times. I have literally lost clients as a result of it. Websites have been hacked dozens of times. They wont replace because of the ease of upgrading and cost it would incur. Like working with your crazy old uncle who insists he will drive his 1976 Ford pickup with 300k miles into the ground before he buys a new one.

Consistency in understanding policy and procedures is a struggle. You can call 4 different people in customer service to have a question answered and get 4 different answers leaving you to have to wing it with a client. Not good.

Management is only concerned about you as a production number...not as a person...but that should be expected from all FA positions. Produce and you are a rock star. Don't produce and its nobody's fault but yours and you will be treated like you have the plague with nobody else taking responsibility or offering anything in the way of support or ideas because they are so scared of compliance. If you think outside of the box then this is not the place for you. There is definitely a ""get in line and follow the lemmings over the cliff"" mentality here.

They have nothing new to offer in form of sales/marketing/promotion or in capturing new business and sales meetings turn into just pushing the same tired ideas your great grandfather used to sell because it works great in SOME markets ...ergo... it must work great in ALL markets, right? Very closed minded. 

There has been many changes recently causing an exodus of upper and middle management including the CEO retiring. Sometimes this can be good and may still be...time will tell...but right now there are too many people with new cushy titles trying to assert themselves without much direction back up the chain of command causing many to have 2-4 different bosses contradicting each other as far as what can and cannot be done. Proper communication is a lost art form. Many of these ""new hires"" are so used to doing business the Wells Fargo or BofA way....not the PNC way... which is becoming a cancer just spreading. PNC bank seems to me to be trying to be the new Washington Mutual....no tellers, no cash handling, just point you to the high tech ATM and be a hostess. This concept will not be receptive with older customers (the ones WITH money) and will hurt business without doubt which to me seems to be why they are cutting so many corners in anticipation of this."

Employees are given direction from several different management sources (a lot of dotted line relationships), and no one wants to achieve the goal the same way, so you are being pulled everywhere, Many managers are very resistent to change and working with the partners (Mortgage, Investment, Business).  No team work.  Conversations between management and platform and teller is NOT encouraged or really allowed.  So, issues are really never resolved. Managements stress level is very high creating a very negative work environment.  Training on their Seibel computer system is sub-par.  They don't even have a guide of key codes that we need to know to do our jobs and process service requests for our clients. Also, their CRM system has never really been used before so there is no documentation/history on clients. Managers do not have the backs of their employees, they are all to scared of getting a bad CIQ score. Presently they are getting rid of most of the remaining National City employees.  Being that Illinois is a fire at will state, it makes it easy.  The EIQ is a farce.  Because each branch is staffed with a small amount of employees, no one provides honest answers to the Gallup Poll Surveys they do, for fear of being identified and hence fired.

Metrics are good if they're used appropriately. Gallup is one of the misused metrics...instead of drilling down on the issues that cause branch dissatisfaction, punishment and brow-beating of the staff is not going to change morale in the office nor drive better customer service.

Also, the bank's career advancement and opportunities to grow and thrive were less than stellar in my time there. I've grown much more in my career since PNC."

You could probably blame it on the budget however; I do not believe switching someone into a position that they qualify for is such a hard thing to do, with the reason being you haven't worked at PNC long enough. You do not need to work at a bank to know customer service skills. Period. If you work hard for the company you should be able to move up especially when there are so many not working nearly as hard."

I've had a great experience working here over the years with upper management. Most of the great leaders where with National City, originally.","One of the worst things about working at PNC is the ERIC Hotline. When you call them for help with a troubled employee, they give you a huge push back. It's not easy to get rid of an employee that doesn't contribute to the bank success. However, when you make a mistake, the bank can easily get rid of you. I have been with PNC for 9 years, almost going on 10 years, and today I have been placed on administrative leave for telling a client that their debit was not ordered because her name is to long and we needed to speak to her prior to ordering the card instead of telling her that the banker she last spoke to forgot to order for her. I was just trying to not put the banker in a bad spot. I ordered the card on the day the customer called and she never complaint about it. I was told the reason I am placed on leave is because I am not an honest employee. 
I have rarely taken lunch, bathroom breaks, sick days. An honest employee works hard and is committed as I have all these years. I originally started as a PT Teller and today I manage over 12 employees and over 2200 house holds. I put in my time and still love the bank, but its to bad the bank can't seem to keep their best employees."

Also, this company is very client and employee focused and does attempt to be ""one of the good guys"" in banking, for what it's worth.","Like most companies, many of middle managers are not very connected with what is going on at the ground level and so some of their initiatives are lame and half-baked.

6981,,Job review of PNC Bank,2013-02-17,5.0,Anonymous Employee,great working environment.  Nice work/life balance,Technology and software aspects are behind other companies.
6982,,"Good working atmosphere, some growth potential, fair morale",2013-02-16,4.0,Portfolio Manager,"Typical bank culture, but better than other banks as competition is cutting their work forces. Pnc allows for flexible schedules and values family life.  This bank is very sales driven which becomes a priority in most departments.","I would recommend countering whatever salary offer. Because once you're hired, you tend to receive 1% raises.  Any promotions are limited to 10% max increase in any given year- a PNC rule which doesn't help with employee retention."
6983,,Poor excuse for a Wealth Management offering. Incompetent management,2013-02-14,1.0,Vice President,"Having a hard time thinking of any due to the disappointment in the company. But there are a few, they have ambitions, but can't execute on them. They are very involved in the community","Archaic technology, frugal in supply/resource spending.


PNC Wealth Management is by far, the must unhealthy and unprofessional work environment I have been involved in during my 10+ year career.  The environment is not only chaotic and driven by drama but it is all filled with gossip obsessed, immature individuals who operate with what they believe is a “cut-throat” mentality but in actuality it is childlike behavior that leads to poor results, lack of production and failed business plans. There is no sense of direction given from upper management which leads to a free for all and a scramble for answers any time an issue arises. The only way to get ahead is to ""yes"" the under qualified senior management to death. There is a lack of quality employees and work produced which is evident by the fact that clients pull their money out of the bank quite frequently.  Management hires with an outsourcing-type mentality- they only hire cheap labor, with a lack of ability in order to give the appearance that the job is getting done. Once the employees catch on to this cyclical pattern they move on or are replaced immediately. There is no room to develop your skills, perfect your art and truly produce quality work because at PNC Wealth Management, they are only concerned with “putting a bandage over the wound” rather than actually healing it. Appearing to produce results is far more important than actually producing results. I would not recommend working here to anyone with an interest in longevity or the ambition to succeed in the Wealth Management business."
6984,,Great opportunity to  work for one of the largest banks in the country,2013-02-12,5.0,Teller,"Great leadership, growing culture. Offers top notch employee benefits. Gives new employees a full on boarding experience that  trains them for their new roles and the PNC way.",Not too much to say

6986,,"Great company, branch management could use work.",2013-02-07,3.0,Customer Service Associate II,Great company as a whole.  Good values and a place where you can be proud to work.  Support outside of the branch level is easy to get.,Some people that have been employees for a very long time are often the ones who don't adapt well to progression and change.  They're often the most difficult to work with and unfortunately latch on to their position and do the bare minimum while other hardworking up and comers have to sit by at low salaries and wait for one of them to retire.
6987,,Branch Manager,2013-02-04,2.0,Anonymous Employee,Good training and tools to do the job,"very low pay for employees, always running on thin staff, demanding customer service expectations that are not measured in a fair manner.

Always having some sort of event going on to show employee apprecation - whether it be a whole employee appreication week, free food, prizes and games. The benefits are good and you get vacation days and insurance from the start. Coworkers are friendly and helpful, and everyone is pretty laid back. Management is always there to listen if you have a concern or problem and take appropriate action.  They are flexible if you have a personal issue going and are pretty understanding.

Even with experience, you're brought it at the minimum base level to start. Very demanding in the branches; micro-managing. Expectation to sell & cross sell are hard to be met due to the low traffic in some branches. Training is far away without option of a hotel. Some training classes were cancelled without notification.

7006,,Advancement seems only possible by constantly changing jobs.,2013-01-17,1.0,Fulfillment Analyst,"It is actually a bank, as advertised.","PNC specializes in micromanagement and seemingly cares more about statistics than it does how things actually get done.  PNC seems to be so big that many processes and procedures have become redundant and inefficient.  Despite doing your job for years and glowing yearly reviews, you still need to account for how you spend your time each day, even when the employee is extremely efficient and work gets done ahead of schedule.  Regardless of years of service, or knowledge and skills in your role, pay is not competitive, and a 1% to 1.5% pay increase does not fill employees with a sense of worth.  The chair you sit in costs more than the pay increase you'll receive.  The bank will cut costs you didn't even know it could cut, but pay seemingly increases at a snails pace.   Those who get bonuses have decided that the rest of the employees do not, despite billion dollar profits each year."
7007,,Good Culture. Unrealistic expecations due to poor staffing models. Zero Accountability.,2013-01-16,1.0,Branch Manager,Truley a service driven culture.  Empowered to make decisions at the branch level.  Products and services are on par with the industry.  Long standing and solid reputation.  Very good community involvement programs.,"Extremely conservative consumer and business lender. Below average salaries.  Poor incentive plans.  Inadequate staffing models.  Branch partners regularly disengadged.  Human Resource procedures extremely lengthy and require a great deal of time consuming busy work.  Very difficult to terminate troublesome employees or underperformers even with documented coaching and action planning.  Zero sales accountability at all levels, actually the sales culture is completly missing which becomes very frustrating."
7008,,Sad at times!,2013-01-15,3.0,Anonymous Employee,Benefits are very good with matching 401K,"Office Politics, management doesnt listen and has there favorites. Felt like a robot and not a person. People came and were out the door in a very short time."

7011,,Great company.,2013-01-09,4.0,Risk Analyst,"Managers and supervisors are caring and easily approachable.  Great health and wellness programs.  My department offers flex hours, or 9/80s.  Very strong and stable company that is constantly growing.",Benefits packages are fairly expensive compared to the company that I was previously with.  401k matching only to 4%.
7012,,Management styles focus on belittling employees,2013-01-09,1.0,Financial Services Consultant,"Pros?  If you want a job, they'll probably hire you if you can be bonded.  Yes they offer benefits.  If you are looking for some income while you look for decent employment elsewhere; they'll hire anyone and everyone.","This is for CSRs; specifically people seeking employment in the call centers.  If you want to work for PNC you'd better negotiate your salary well in the first interview, because you will never get a raise.  When you first start working for the company you'll encounter a lot of smoke and mirrors when you try to follow up on the touted 'opportunities for advancement'. 

PNC tends to employ embittered management throughout the call centers and the majority of the managers I encountered can be pretty petty.  They tend to pass quick judgement about their groups without doing any research about their employee's skills.  I actually had a manager promise me that if I was ""good' for a week, she'd teach me how to open word on the computer.  I don't know why she thought I couldn't open word, or what she thought my skills were, but it was pretty disheartening since this was the woman who was supposed to help place me in the company.  

The overall management style focuses on belittling, and I have had managers make up stories about customer complaints against me (one common trick is to pull up a form letter in word) just for an excuse to degrade me during the weekly one on one meetings they are forced to have with the employees.  If you call HR with a concern about your treatment, your future is grim, and your environment will worsen.  I made the mistake of doing that and had bullying managers follow me around the company demanding meetings to tell me how awful I was. 

I found myself completely deprived of all self esteem by the time I left the company.  When I worked there, I was constantly stressed and worried I'd loose my low paying job because the managers I'd worked for convinced me I was a useless person.  If you want to work for this company, I'd suggest not taking anything your managers say to heart, that's what they want you to do, so you stay in the call center, which is a pretty awful job without all of the petty management techniques."
7013,,Everyone cares about my career development,2013-01-07,5.0,Business Systems Analyst,"I have layers of mentors, managers, and coworkers who support my personal and professional growth. Large benefits package includes domestic partner benefits, childcare, patial tuition assistance, commuter benefits, flexible working hours etc. in addition to healthcare, dental, vision, etc.",Work isn't as challenging as I'd like it to be.

The benefits are expensive and pay is low.
7016,,PNC Mortgage is a fairly new organization with a focus on designing process and setting up infrastructure,2013-01-04,3.0,,"PNC Mortgage has a positive reputation from its previous existence in the marketplace (ending 2001) and many people have high expectations for its return (in 2009) to the industry. The servicing arm of the organization as well as the parent organization, PNC Bank, has an excellent reputation within the industry (execution, service)","The origination arm of the organization has process and people leadership challenges.  The sales force is happy with some aspects of the back office and unhappy with others (underwriting and closing teams deliver, processing teams are inconsistent).  The senior leadership and overall work environment are considered poor by the sales and operations teams.  People are considered highly disposable and, much like any other banking institution, there is a higher level of focus on mistakes or errors, especially the trivial.  The sales people are the strength of this organization, being very knowledgeable and very customer-centric, often helping the back office with loan production"

Work / Home balance can be great...depending on your position and manager

Co-Workers are usually fun people

Job Security (As long as you do the work that's expected of you)","I recently switched positions from being in the branch (4 1/2 years) to an administrative position on the corporate side. This was THE BEST move I could have possibly made.  I ABSOLUTELY love my job now! My manager is great, and the team I work with is great. I don't have anybody breathing down my back, I know what I need to do, and do it on my own time.  Once I complete a task, that's it.  There aren't 5 different places where I need to document what I've done. The Cons I'm about to share were directly linked to being the branch (retail banking)...

THE PAY IS AWFUL!!  I make 10k more a year now, and I have less stress and less responsibility. It doesn't really make sense.  When you work in the branch, you are expected to be ""jack of all trades"", and never make a mistake.  You manage underpaid, dimwit personnel.  (You get what you pay for PNC)  It's a constant revolving door with branch employees.  When you pay someone $9 an hour, you get, well...$9 an hour help.  This means being constantly understaffed, and constantly training new hires.  I made about $15 an hour as a Teller Supervisor, and that was significantly low given the amount of work and knowledge required of me. 

Middle management is completely out of touch.  It's ALL about the numbers being crunched out.  I was lucky enough to work for an awesome manager during most of my time in the branch.  Most people aren't so lucky.  Once that manager left, everything went downhill.  I then directly reported to the regional manager, who only would contact me if he had something negative to say. The regionals put such fear in their managers about not making ""goal"", and this usually is filtered down to the rest of the employees creating a toxic work environment.  If your branch happens to be a busier location, and you have good sales numbers, your commission will still suck.  They way they structure commission is very confusing, and it's close to impossible to make any money off of it.  

There is a report and an action plan for EVERYTHING.  You document every customer conversation you have, everytime you mention a product, everything you talk about as a branch, everytime you breathe.  You spend more time documenting what you do in a day than actually doing it.  PLUS, as a teller supervisor, you have to document what your tellers are doing....as well as the words they use with customers...my next point...

CIQ and canned phrases.  ""WELCOME TO PNC"" to EVERY customer, EVERYTIME. This is AWFUL!!!  Again...I understand you need to have some sort of uniform for the $9 an hour idiots that are hired, but COME ON!  My regular clients would LAUGH when they heard us use they these coined phrases, and we only did it if someone was ""documenting"" our conversation. We (as a branch) would not follow these guidelines for the most part, talk like normal human beings, and maintained 5 star (CIQ) scores.  However, if we had a suprise middle management guest in the branch that day, we HAD to use the ""5 star"" language.  The PNC world would end if we didn't!  This practice is completely dehumanizing, and I was ashamed to be a part of it."

Managers do whatever they want and get time off whenever they want especially holidays. No one monitors them, yet when you ask for a weekend off they say no and tell you ""it's a business decision."" Constant fear of being fired for not making goals. They have a scoring system called CIQ where they call your customers to make sure they had exceptional service. If a customer is mad for any reason and you do a transaction for them and they call the customer, the customer most of the time doesn't understand they are rating you and the transaction you did. They could be upset about rates or fees or life in general. So you end up getting a bad score and getting in trouble for it. Even if you did everything right. It's a way not to have to pay bonus. Branches are so short staffed...and how they staff makes zero sense. A branch that has 4,000 transactions a month will have the same staff if not more than a branch that does 12,000 transactions a month.  And then they compare you to the branch that  more staff /less transactions when your CIQ scores are bad because customers had to wait. They also ask employees to ""rate"" the company twice a year. However if you say anything less than perfect you get punished and action planned to death. They dont want to hear the truth."

If you get into a solid branch with little banker competition, you can make decent incentive. But that is very rare. Bank holidays are nice and you can still purchase a week of vacation which is worth it to most, but only if approved by the branch manager.","Upper management is looking to cut costs everywhere since they lost all the overdraft fee income among other things. Customers are squeezed for every cent they have ($10 for a cashier's check? REALLY?)  They short the branches of full staffing to save every penny they can and then have a fit if your customer services scores aren't up to par. Management knows customer traffic is shrinking and is promoting ATM and electronic use to cut costs. It's funny b/c they tell us how great it is,  but then they are promoting something that will put almost everyone in the branch out of work. In every position but teller, you'll have a list of reports and forms to fill out to keep track of your time and micro manage you until they're blue in the face. Don't look for a raise no matter how well you do. Most managers do not do much besides micro manage and threaten write ups....But as I said, there are a few that will go out on a limb and support thier branch and employees. Branch hours are inconsistent around the whole territory. If you're looking for a branch manager position, lately most hires have come from outside PNC. If you want to move up, you have to go somewhere outside of the company as they rarely promote and have ELIMINATED most of the assistant branch managers from branches. I do want to add that I have heard and seen the culture is a much different and more employee friendly when you get out east, away from the Wisconsin-Chicago market. I'm sure that's a direct reflection of the current uninspiring area management trying to take over the market by force.  There is an Employee Engagement survey twice a year, but if you answer honestly, you'll be hounded and harrassed until you get tired of it and just give 5's so that they leave you alone....for a minute."

It is very difficult to get on the ""good"" side of the upper-echelons of management if an associate has done something wrong or if they have some issue with an associate. Very strict with allowing overtime which can be stressful for the branches since several associates are required to stay after branch hours to make cold calls to clients to bring them in for sales pitch appointments. Many are required to leave early to make up for these extra hours causing the branches to be short-handed. A big thing to work on is communication between departments.

In a world where most products vary only slightly from bank to bank, PNC has been able to come up with some innovative ideas.  That along with their community involvement and environmentally sound culture makes it a place where you DO feel proud to work there.","""Leaders in Technology"" is an absolute joke, from the sales systems, to the lack of contact management, to the worst reporting tools that I have been witness to make it very difficult and frustrating.  A simple task will take forever, like changing a customers address which should be instantaneous but takes three days there.  

There also is too much overlap in positions.  Certain staff are designated to specialize in a select group with another specialization that only varies in the most insignificant way to another select group.  This causes unnecessary tension and often times confusion at who is really most qualified to help the client.

And the incentives, oh wait... what incentives.  My point exactly."

-Additional work and responsibilities piled on without any additional compensation (although this seems normal for our current economy)

-Compensation is NOT performance-driven, although management claims otherwise.

-ZERO accountablilty for branch managers. Since they do not have to document their time like the rest of us, they are free to do as much or as little work as they choose to. Pretty cushy considering they make about $80k per year.

-Impossible to document every detail of every single customer I talk to, I don't have the luxury of having an office and being able to close the door when dont want to see customers.

-They have an employee survey 2x per year, if you give bad scores bc you're unsatisfied, they will try to get rid of you.

-They eliminated two positions at my branch and replaced them with one lower paid position. Where's all that extra money going? Definitely not to the employees that do their jobs."

PNC does lead the way for its clients.,"I would like to have a dollar for every time I have heard if you do this or you don't do that you will be terminated, does everything really need to be communicated this way?  There is so much pressure on branches to meet sales goals and everything you say and do is scrutinized.  There is not enough time in the day to write down on a log every customer interaction you have, then type this same information in the computer, and then go over these same interactions with your manager at the end of the day.  Whoever is coming up with these fascinating scenarios definitely does not work in a branch.  The new manager could care less about his/her employees.  We are now expected to answer the phone on our lunch break, that is if you are even lucky enough to get one.  Branches are so inadequately staffed.  We used to have 6 tellers, now we have 3.5.  A teller's salary is 20k a year,  would it really hurt to keep some of them on board?  Also, people are dropping like flies, one day they are there, the next they are not and you never know why.  PNC will let someone go at the drop of a hat."
7165,,"Unrewarding, unorganized, poorly managed",2012-03-15,1.0,Financial Sales Consultant,Training upon being hired is very in-depth and gets your motivation and spirits up.,"In-store branches seem to be very poorly managed.  Very ugly-stepsister-esque.  Immediate management seems to slide by without much direction from upper management to encourage, coach, or manage the branch at all.  There is a lack of communication between all departments (in-store branches, traditional branches, loan department, etc) and so rules and regulations were not all followed correctly or at all across the board.  Customer information gets lost between channels and processes take extra long resulting in frustrated customers.  Heavy responsibility placed on employees to run branch and take on all major responsibilities so immediate management can be away.  Long hours (for in-store branches) and weekends are not split accordingly.  Despite the manager having not met weekly hours worked, I and other employees were asked and expected to cover shortages by giving up earned vacation time that was never reimbursed as promised.  High employee turn-over because of the poor treatment.  Salary is very very low and benefits are mediocre."

7175,,PNC is a terrible company to work for,2012-03-02,1.0,Switcher,401K. Pension. Vacation Time. Insurance,"Pay is below average in comparison to other area banks, high turn-over, Extreme micro-management, little to no communication from upper management, favoritism, unrealistic expectations in order to get Gallup Survey bonus.  This is the worst company I have ever worked for. You can receive a promotion from a teller to a switcher, which requires you to be responsible for twice the amount of knowledge (both teller and office knowledge), but then not receive a raise.  Not even a penny! I worked there 6 years, and even with a promotion only received a 65 cent per hour raise from the very first day I started, and I was not a bad employee obviously or I wouldn’t have gotten a promotion. I never called off work, never came in late, always took on extra tasks, and even worked by myself as an acting branch manager for months and got no recognition.  
Branch managers come in when they want, micro-manage every move you make for every second of the day, and then expect you to do their job too.  This company expects you to bend over backwards, runs every branch short staffed, and then sends customers surveys asking them to rate the level of service from a 1 to 5.  If the average score isn’t at least a 4.87 then no one in the branch gets a bonus, even if the problem was the fact that we are constantly running a skeleton crew and customers are upset about waiting in line.  
Policies and procedures are constantly changing, and it is possible, but sometimes difficult to keep up with all the changes on a day to day basis.  In addition to that, they are always adding to our responsibilities.  Now we have a special “customer language” that we have to use.  They are running us like clones.  We have to record every customer conversation in a data base.  It’s almost as ridiculous as health records.  We are stripped of our personality and are forced to say, “Good afternoon!  Welcome to PNC, how may I assist you today?” ect. And if we don’t say that to every customer then we are in danger of being put on an action plan, especially if any of our customer surveys come back below a 4.87 average.
Basically, PNC makes itself sound like a great place to work, but it’s not.  Go to fifth third or somewhere else that actually cares about its employees."

The turn-over rate at this position is 80% and because of that the company keeps recycling employees every 6 month, add to that the sales pressure which is very very high and you are very unlikely to succeed unless you bring in 3 million in loans and above, you are treated by management like a child and not a professional.

God forbid we get one '4' on a Gallup shop, even if you are normally a '5 star' employee, you will never hear the end of it.  The pay is horrible.  I had an employee who's large bonus was taken away because their weren't any 'shared notes' on the customers profile that he was going to get a large wire transfer into the account (which resulted in a large trailer for her hence the large bonus)...not only can we not do wire transfers at in-store locations, this was two months after she opened the account, so she had no way of knowing what the client was doing at another branch.  The trailer was reviewed and since there were no ""shared notes of what her conversation w/ the client was"" they reversed her revenue credits.  Unbelievable.  Just shows how cheap this company is.  If you have an opinion that differs from your manager, you are looked down upon and passed over for promotions for people who will nod and smile and say 'yes' to everything upper management does.  This company seems to want robots working for them.  We are told to share our opinions and then when we do, we are critisized and looked down upon."

7198,,Nanny State,2012-01-21,2.0,Financial Sales Consultant,"Management places a premium on ethics
Banking products are competitive
Very risk-averse, which keeps the company out of trouble","Every move you make is monitored, evaluated, and commented on. Gets old quick.
You will spend more time documenting what you've done during the day than actually doing it.
Customer-facing employees are expected to act like clones, right down to how you greet customers.
Bonuses based on production are lousy, unless you're accustomed to no bonus at all.
If in a Branch Financial Sales Consultant position, you will be expected to cold-call businesses."

I work in fear everyday. They call themselves one of the best training organizations, but I've yet to take a training session.  The company runs extremely lean.  If your a manger, plan on working on your vacation days and into the night, and don't plan for a big bonus."
7201,,Terrible,2012-01-11,2.0,Teller Supervisor,Okay benefits. Okay vacation. Close to my house. Employees do get some perks when it comes to the bank's services.,"Poor salary. No work life balance. Micro-managers. Want us all to look, dress and talk the same way. Tellers do a lot of work and they are not compensated for it. Managers should do more work,"
7202,,Low pay. Micromanagement. Benefits are good. Typical for In-Store.,2012-01-09,3.0,In-Store Financial Sales Consultant,Benefits benefits benefits. Semi-relaxed working environment. (if your manager cares about their annual review)  They are gradually improving the teller and platform system so that is getting more user friendly.,"Micromanaged every day. daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly, and yearly goals that are not terribly high but they require a perfect balance of sales in each product category. Anything but a 5.0 gallup customer service rating is unacceptable and they mean it. How can you walk into a supermarket and get a mother and her two kids to put the frozen goods back and come to your hole in the wall branch to refinance their mortgage. 99% of the time you can't and management does not want to hear that."

7206,,"Overall, a satisfying experience",2012-01-03,4.0,,"This organization has gotten better over the years.  I was able to move up in the organization even after almost getting let go during a merger with another banking co.  Like any organization, some superiors will recognize you and help you and some will not.  Though hard work will be noticed, eventually.  That has been my experience.","I don't want to bad mouth middle or senior management.  There are some in supervisory positions that play favorites and appear to not recognize talent for whatever reason.  Like all big orgs, the review process is burdensome, however, it allows one to strongly promote themselves which is not always PC in the day to day operations."

Input is accepted and thought over on all levels
Managers respect their employees and value their input
Flexible schedule and work locations (work from home!)","Some legacy employees unwilling to accept change and can make day to day tasks difficult
When positions are filled from outside the company the caliber of people is not always sufficient"

If you get a good manager then you can go somewhere but if your regional is not that great there is no way to get to the top",Pay is not great compared to other banks. Commission checks for bankers come a month and a half after qtr has ended which sucks.
