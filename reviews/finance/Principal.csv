- Incompetent middle managers. They are focused more on the appearance of diversity than actual merit of managers. Simply quota filling so they can pat themselves on the back. Many will leave after being managed by people who are not ready nor have the ability to manage people.
- Backstabbing. Never experienced anything like this before and didn't expect this type of behavior from a midwest firm. You'll work alongside someone and get along great, only to have them trash you behind your back. Don't trust anyone"

And then all the mangement say is ""well, just try to control what you can on the call"" which is nothing. You can't control when a caller isn't prepared and takes 3 minutes for them to give the information to pull up their account and verify them, so you're left with 1 minute to wrap it up to meet your 4 minute Average Handle Time goal which is impossible. People are constantly quitting or getting fired, and nothing is done to keep or retain good enployees. because it's a revolving door of trying to get new hires while employees keep leaving because they can't meet the insane goal, they are constantly understaffed, leading to backed up call queues, so the once the callers get through they try to make the most of their time with you and ask about 6, 7, 8 accounts so you end up with a 15-20 minute call and you get punished because the mismanagement and failure to staff adequately.
Seperate issue is the change to ""Neighborhood Seating"" instead of assigned desks/cubicles. People don't wipe down or clean their workstations after themselves, and before covid a bad case of the flu spread the entire floor because everyone switches and shares desks and keyboards and they weren't being cleaned, so covid made it an even more sever issue but still non-assigned seating persists to this day."

Claimants constantly frustrated, rightfully so, as you are so overworked it is virtually impossible to adequately help them.

570,,Work at Principal is Stable Helpful and Engaging,2020-07-25,4.0,Analyst,"The company is stable and quite profitable at what it does. This is in the fintech business and is a non-banking financial firm. Therefore work is always there. Most people work on Enterprise Java, C# but we are moving towards Cloud solutions like AWS, Azure, GCP for certain needs. There is a multitude of requirements for which quality engineers are needed. Therefore diversification and specialization and growth within the company is possible. Hard work is rewarded with recognition. A good supportive environment to grow professionally.","Vendor based solutions are sometimes preferred over in house solutions. A lot of POCs are not brought to production because of that.
Work can be repetitive and constricted if delivery work is not supplemented with idea generation and POC development.
Security is such that a lot of POC development is preferred on laptops with freely accessible internet or personal devices compared to office network laptops or desktops. If stuck with a technology it is hard to diversify as people will regard you as the subject matter expert and will delegate those specific tasks to you, leaving less time to innovate."

Work is not required because there are many managers who have not seen codes or been productive in ages. 
Other mantra is get very close to a senior management. You will lots of these very close couples and everyone around knows about it and makes fun of it but no one speaks of it. The cascading effect is now you see couples everywhere as the environment encourages it. Interference of these couples basis their likes and dislikes of others cause  problems and issues. If highlighted the response you will get us it’s a personal matter. 

Many senior leaders have left the Organization and I am aware a lot of them are also trying since last few years but unable to get a job outside. So imagine the development you would get from such demotivated leaders. 

Most of the new management hired are people thrown out of other Organizations and we have taken them with open arms. HR should atleast do a good background verification on them."

6. HO counterparts are the best to work with, the best things about the organisation. If will think of staying with the company its mostly because of these amazing people.","1. Very less room to grow, initial 1 year you get to learn but then its the same stuff.
2. Managers are biased towards some people, it you are in good books of the managers u will move up the ladder otherwise u will be stuck. This is the case with lateral joiners
3. there is no relation between your performance and promotions.
4. 1:1 discussions are so frustrating, if the manager don't get any point to highlight ur shortcomings they will stick some illogical trait of yours as a shortcoming even if it does not negatively impact your work.
5. the experience criteria for a position applies only to laterals and not to trainees. You will find a trainee with 4 yrs work ex as a lead and a lateral will 9 yrs work exp as a lead even though the lateral has a good working capability.
6. Worst part - some people are in the company to settle , and you will be constantly be compared with a fellow colleague who has been in the organisation for a long time. i have never seen such comparisons anywhere.
7. Lots of focus on innovation and very less attention is being paid to business deliveries, if u are not involved in any activity apart from your day to day delivery , according to them u are not working at all, even if u are doing wonders at the delivery side of things."

- Appraisal discussion is based on stupid discussions like who was wearing sandals or slippers (Male) or round neck t shirts, or whose innovation has got more awards, or who has more visibility in organization like : from CSR activites, or event organizing teams or other such teams. No focus on delivery work, and no good ratings based on actual work that you do or actual profile you were hired for.
- they treat you like resources : they don't give a crap about what technology you were hired for, or what you're interested in, they'll just randomly put you to any new technology which you have no experience/interested in an you're supposed to learn that and do the work. If you lose interest - that's your problem. For them you're just a replaceable resource.
- More dominance and value of business analysts who technically contribute nothing to product development, since requirements are sent from home office-which is an onshore office where users are, business folks just try to translate it : but domain is better understood by developers who've been here for years, so BA's just try to shush and dominate developers and play petty politics.

Caseloads are unmanageable. The phone rings nonstop so you feel more like a call center employee rather than a claim analyst at times. You are expected to take your own calls plus everyone else’s. You are expected to work your own claims plus everyone else’s. The turnover is high, leading to “abandoned caseloads” which must be absorbed by those remaining. It’s not realistic to keep up with. There is no such thing as a 40 hour workweek although you’re expected to be able to meet expectations without overtime. Claimants are often disgruntled because of timing and communication issues - the reason behind that is no one has the time to do everything we’re expected to do in an 8 hour workday. I work nonstop just to maintain and it’s a vicious cycle. It’s exhausting and anxiety inducing. Everyone is burnt out, including management. You are also “feedbacked” to death. There is endless scrutiny over every single action taken on a claim - and feedback/direction is often subjective depending on who happens to review a claim at any given time. Impossible to take PTO without working around the clock nonstop to get caught up afterwards."

Once you’re out on the floor you’re given a goal of how many claims to pull for the week at first it’s low then after 2-3 months it gets worst impossible especially when your consultants hasn’t released you. You never have time to take breaks or use the restroom. Lunches forget it they want you chained to your desk working like a robot. Management doesn’t care about you unless you are one of the few successful ones. Consultants is like QA they check your work on your claim and whether it’s done right and approve it and pay it out for you to the customer. They’re just as bad terrible at communicating and don’t take time to explain and help you be successful they’re just as overworked.  You will need to go on anti depressants or get a therapist for this job that’s how bad it is.

Toxic work environment.  
Management was pretty clueless about how to implement the cloud strategy.  They want to move EVERYTHING to the cloud; not just that, but they want to move it to an different RDBMS system.  They want to do this without providing any kind of meaningful training; the expectation seems to be the employees should spend their own personal time learning the cloud environment, while keeping up with their existing responsibilities.
Absolutely no appreciation for the job being done to keep the lights on while this new strategy moves forward.  
There seems to be a philosophy that about 1/3 of the employees will get below average ratings, regardless if they are doing a good job or not.  I heard from many employees who have experienced this.

If you are looking for an IT job, stay away from PGI within Principal."

2. Health benefits. Leave policy. 
3. Recroom.","Cons - 
1. Recroom. I have seen people playing TT all day in rec-room and get hikes better than some people who work hard all day (includes me obviously)
2. Unfair treatment. They say they use market correction my foot. They pay differently even among teams and boast of being fair. I mean come on, isn't that funny. People who do not understand basic programming stuff get same hikes are people who do good just cuz of manager bias or cuz manager is of opposite sex.
3.They dont follow on their words - Managers are only for the sake of approving leave. Do nothing sit all day in single place and talk big words. Leadership just talks about big terms and do nothing on it.
4. Leadership does not care about a persons career growth. U wil be treated as a resource and not a human. So much that I am planing to switch back to the company I came from.

797,,Be your best self,2018-05-03,4.0,Jack of All Trades,"I've worked for this company for 15+ years with a short break in the middle. This organization has supported my personal and professional growth as I completed by undergrad and graduate degrees (including tuition reimbursement), certifications and not to be forgotten, great on the job learning opportunities. I've moved around the organization from a business unit to a support business unit (SBU), rotated into yet another SBU with both lateral and promotional opportunities. I worked hard for those opportunities and feel that the company and various levels of leadership recognized my contribution and rewarded for that. I love the intentional path the company is taking to encourage employees to bring their best selves to work, knowing that if they treat their employees right, they will take care of the customer. 
There are phenomenal benefits - some above market, some at market and perhaps even some below but I do believe that while some of the benefits don't pertain to me (updated maternity/paternity leaves, etc.), I'm still thrilled that I work for a company that is always trying to do what's best while being fiscally responsible.","No company is perfect and I've had my share of ups and downs but I recognize that companies are run by humans, and we all make mistakes. I do wish we were a little faster with change and maybe a few less levels of leaders. While it's nice for growth opportunity (if it ever becomes available), it leads to greater disparity between the front line employees and senior leaders. My current role has just three levels between myself and the CEO and I'm not a formal leader! Make more opportunities like that (even to their BU senior leader) so people can truly see the direction we are moving and understand that strategy."

Principal is a successful financial services company in a medium sized city, but has a world wide footprint.  It boasts many employees who have worked there for their entire careers. I worked there almost 20 years myself.   It is trying to attract the younger talent to position itself for the future.","This is not your father's Principal.  The small company atmosphere has given way to a generic, large company, corporate coldness. The pay is mediocre. The medical insurance is middle of the road by design. PTO has recently given way to the new open time off system that companies all seem to be adopting. PTO was considered a ""liability to the company.""  In my case, I forfeited nine days of PTO that I had remaining in my PTO bank, but the company policy changed, so I was not entitled to that anymore. As indicated previously, I had worked for the company for twenty years ( two separate time periods separated by a short period of about one year).  I had no disciplinary issues. My performance reviews were solid. I was probably not a ""superstar,"" but I was versatile and consistent. I was always complimented for being a team player with a good attitude.  I put in overtime when needed, in order to complete time sensitive work.   My quality was 100%.  Why mention all of this? I was let go, based on missing ""performance goals,"" the last time by less than 1%.  The department had recently adopted a new work log system, and they took a hard line on performance, based on this system, which was not entirely accurate. It had to be fixed a couple of times for not correctly recording the data.  Any attempt to reason with management was met with canned responses. ( I had about six managers in a ten year period, by the way). So, even though we were having to break in a new manager every couple of years, we never got credit for keeping things together during those transitions.  There was lots of turnover in our department. The stress of this constant turmoil, coupled with minimal training, high expectations, managers constantly harping on your ""metrics,"" and the monotony of the job, sends you home feeling like you are just a cog in the machine. No sympathy from management. They have directives that must be delivered, so expect that going in. Principal is just like any other financial services company, but with a sweet wellness center.   Not for everybody. It was time to get out of ""cube city"" for me."

1. Good joining compensation
2. Group Insurance policy
3. Free transport (cab) facility
4. Comparatively less work pressure (due to this, most spaces are occupied by married women, mostly mothers - for years)
5. Salary received on last working day of every month.","For Pune location:
1. the way in which the performance appraisal process is carried out by management (this happens twice a year and is the period when employees are frustrated and pissed off the most)
2. no transparency in promotion policy; Managers and HR are incapable of answering the related questions and always provide fancy sounding answers to fool the employees.
3. unapproachable or non-responding Human Resource (HR) department.
4. Lack of technical knowledge to most of the managers / leaders. If you wish to have manager's guidance in technical areas, then it is myth in Principal Pune.
5. Following the Agile principles for the namesake; actually no department has come out of waterfall mindset yet. Still they boast of Agile world. Clear Over-hyped here.
6. Middle management is not capable of taking cues from top management goals and derive business unit level goals for Pune employees. Here they are completely dependent on US based counterparts. So rest of the App developers / BAs / POs / QAs get dragged behind such copy+pasted strategy.
7. Mid management does paperwork for planning but lacks the drivers for executing the same; also it lacks managers who can lead from front to implement the plans. Due to this most of the plans have never come into existence and remained on power point slides.
8. Only 4 organizational leaves per year in addition to 30 individual leaves.
9. Cafeteria food quality can definitely be improved.
10.Career growth gets stopped after a while.
11.Favoritism is promoted a lot by managers / leaders.
12.Managers/ leaders are not aware of your work so before appraisals they try to get that knowledge from their favored employees (who can easily malign or downgrade your work).
13. Too old technologies to work upon. Other competitors and even the start-ups are providing better technologies.
14. Lack of transparent communication at most of the levels.
15. Not much motivation and time given for practical innovation."

The continual churn of the make work is embarrassing:
Project managers insist that the project fits into their personal template method.
Project managers insist on using a past projects, that are similar in name only to populate the new project. This leaves no room for something new or different. All tasks must be accounted for. Most tasks are left N/A. Then the project team goes through each task to scrutinize each task, followed by mass confusion. STRIKE 2
Mother Hen / Queen Bee will scrutinize every word you write, every word you say.  They will guide you to go left when straight is the correct course, the project team will demand to go right even after advising of the risks. Strike 3

Management decides to coach you, and now you are officially blackballed.  From that point on your management will always go all historical on you. Many are kept around as patsy's.

Nice buildings easy access to the skywalk system.  Benefits appear to be nice but do your research Principal takes advantage of many loopholes to ensure you can't really have or use your benefits.  In the end the end, the benefits are no better than any other insurance or financial firm in town.  Frankly benefits at other major employers in town are better.  You won't have to work very hard particularly in management because social hour is every hour if you are selected to be part of their Greek social letter. At the Principal the edge that will take you far is your unabashed flattery of management.  Principal is an easy target for another organization to acquire.","MICRO-MANAGEMENT be ready for your leader needing to read and critique every email you write.  The current management is:  If you were not capable of performing your job, but were part of the selected social order then you were considered management material and are now part of management.  Principal states that they want new ideas, this is unequivocally false, the only ideas that are to be entertained are the social order's ideas.  The technology at principal is laughable at best, backwards hardly describes it.  The new technology is all about having more social hour meetings.  It now enables the do nothings to do nothing from home well perhaps make it easier to micro-manage the staff.  Analysis Paralysis - the best way to cope with this is to create an analysis that supports the existing status-quo or the preconceived notions of management.  If something is incorrect or wrong never ever bring any attention to it, if it runs counter to any existing practice.  Outsourcing is the future of Principal, if you work here or are thinking about working here understand and embrace that fact.  The management team is a self-serving social group,  they will talk about you behind your back, remember that when they talk about others to you.

You can not learn a new technology, you can not grow, No onsite, No competitive salary , worst HR , worst management it can ruin your whole career  if you join after having 2-4 years of exp. Basically they do not have anything to offer to the people who wants to learn.
The scenario in QA is the pathetic they hired some senior consultant  to monitor QA and  that was the decision which is going wrong against PGS.  When you hire mid management/higher management  people from Service industry they can damage  the culture of a captive unit which is happening now.

And specially Indian management is ruining the name of THE PRINCIPAL. Time has not yet gone if controlling power remains with PFG still they can save the brand value of PGS else it would become worse sooner,. People do not get promotion for good work but for all other odd thing (you can imagine the worst thing you could do to get a promotion)"

1056,,Minorities Be Careful,2016-03-11,3.0,Support Specialist,"Great company, awesome big company perks, and has a mostly great overall culture.

Work schedule is sorta flexible, they don't care if you're late if it is less than 30 minutes you don't even have to call in. You can flex up to hours per week with management approval. Some people can work from home. I have almost never had a problem getting time off.

I have met Dan Houston in passing a few times. I shook his hand and saw him at the grocery to once, and he spoke. I have never met any other CEO in a casual setting.","My direct boss is not a critical thinker. My department requires a college education for even the lowest level entry job but my manager doesn't have one. My boss is a dinosaur that doesn't know how to use our computer tools or interpret new data beyond the obvious. Honestly, the type of general incompetence that my boss displays as a manager is like none other that I have seen. I also I think this person has a bias against black males or perhaps males in general. My boss does not remember names of guys that report to them and usually makes decisions that lean toward women when a disagreement happens even if they are obviously fundamentally wrong when compared to guidelines. 

There is not a lot of ethnic diversity and not a lot of diverse thinkers.

When I was hired I had more work experience than my peers that started at the same time and 4 year college degree. Yet fresh graduates get paid more than I do who started after me.

I think that it is possible that some of the resistance that I have felt could be because I am a minority. I am not say that my coworkers are bigots, I am just treated differently. It also doesn't help that my direct manager has been creating a negative narrative. 

I can't give the culture a high score because I am being mistreated, even though outside of my department has been a completely opposite experience.

Benefits are not as good as Wells Fargo.

Their might have been a lot of opportunities for me but my manager has made advancement and even transferring impossible.

HR is not really responsive. They never followed up with me even via email.

I would never recommend my company or department to any black male. Outside of that I might recommend them a non minority if I got a paid referral.

6 month outlook? I am sure they'll be around but sometimes I wonder. My department percentage of the overall revenue stream is probably less than 1% overall."

If you at all wants to stay here then you will need to be very extra ordinary means you need to have below things at its best level,
1) Most important you should be very good at managing and doing events. Even if you are not good at work that is fine but you should be good at some extra activities apart from work like managing events, birthday party , games for employee, take parts in annual functions and so on.
2) You should know the development skills as well. As a QA they expect you to play a role of BA, QA and events organisation then only you will be able to survive here otherwise they will not terminate you but you will not get promotion and salary hikes.
3) As a QA you can only achieve the level of Team Leader. They will never promote a QA person to the manager level as they have adopted Agile and they wants the Scrum Master from Development back ground only. So QA people have no future over here.
4) Rating systems are pretty pathetic. They can give all the bloody reasons if they want to screw you up and you don't remain with any choices here.
5) Principal is now not paying as per the markets.

Employees are treated like adults  (as opposed to competitor companies in the DSM area).  There was quite the opportunity for growth and positive encouragement from management if the choice was made to leave the department. The company does a lot (in my opinion) to show appreciation and gratitude for employees. My co-workers were all on the same page and there to get the job done & ease the workload. Opportunity for overtime depending on the workload.  I would work here again & recommend the company to others. Granted this was just my experience with Princor BDS & I can't speak for other areas but the department I was in was a group of warriors all the way to middle management and they made it an enjoyable experience to work for Principal.","No cons to Broker-Dealer Services at all. Overall, the company has a corporate feel, you can get lost in it if you don't truly understand where your department fits in.

At a superficial level things seem okay but in reality the employees are extremely spoiled with a strong sense of entitlement.  Employees expect to be 'given' everything.  For this reason it is not uncommon for coworkers to come in late, leave a couple of hours early and complain about others the rest of the time, all the while expecting the next promotion will be theirs.  The culture of the company is only nice on the surface, scratch beneath the top layer and the people are treacherous, manipulative and untrustworthy.  On top of that many have a ""Me first"" attitude.  The egos at this place are outrageous and because of it people don't genuinely listen to what others have to say.  That is to say the culture is extremely insular.  Case in point of this a surprising number of the people I worked with were totally clueless when it came to basic business knowledge even as it pertained to finance which was surprising in a financial services company, and being woefully uninformed seemed to be totally acceptable just so long as you didn't inform anyone of that because everyone believes they can walk on water.  My guess is that the company may be doing well now but as the industry becomes more competitive the company will slip and the people that work there will only get worse.  Worse yet Principal pays below market average and try to lowball you as much as possible as a premium to get to live in Des Moines I guess.

-People there more focused towards other people life and day to day home activities instead of work. That's really funny - Are you here for gossip it was shocking for me.
-Selection procedure is worst, they take 4 rounds of interview and select GEM, but when that GEM joins company  he will find very less quality work of his level. Company is still growing in India even after 8 years of completion.
-According to Policy, we cant share our rating and hike which we get on annual basis..Good Rating people gets less paid and other gets better hike on the name of NORMALIZATION ?? Are you really serious ? Very Demotivating Environment.
-PGS is work under Home Office  and its clearly visible that HO people dont trust much on Indian teams. so we usually get Labor work and good work was always taken by HO Teams. - Lack of Trust to Indian Teams.
-I think Management should make environment free for youngsters - Freshers feels very suffocated in between old people of PGS -They are very narrow minded.
-History says that PGS started with 6 to 7 People and now these people became managers and seniors management in 8 years which doesn't brings quality in system instead less qualified people at higher level make system more inefficient.

No career growth. there are developers of 10 years experience and if you ask for growth you get answer like ""if you want you leave, we dont have anything for you"". Management is arrogant that they can pay and get resources whenever they want. The typical life span of an employee is 2 years beyond which you will find it difficult to work in PGS.
Most of the senior employees are very poor technically and also in business area. If you are expectation is that PGS needs technical skills or great business skills, then you are wrong. All you need is  a below average brain.
Lots of unethical practice - which can't be commented here as glassdoor will anyway remove them, when I say unethical, it is really bad - even political organizations may not be that bad!!

They start you off with a 4 month salary and even provide benefits.  Commissions are complicated but the best out there.   The biggest 401k player in the market.  Great Managing Director who is a straight shooter.  He is very ethical and is an expert at sales.,"Expect to work hard, but rewarded handsomely.

1218,,"Weak Pune Management, good for short term stay",2014-09-15,1.0,Consultant,"Principal Global Services, the IT & ITES extension of Principal Financial Group provides excellent facilities like cab service (yes AC cabs!) and Industry average pay. Your salary will usually be around the average salary for typical captives like RBS, Wellsfargo etc. Thanks to the US office, the work load is usually never heavy, and typical of a reversal role in IT outsourcing, the US office usually works extra, while the India office has less work. There are Pune employees who have not worked for several years. 
Work and direct interaction with US office is the highlight of being in PGS and hence there is no onsite to play work related stunts.
If you work hard, you can learn a lot and use it after you leave PGS and join other companies.","Due to captive nature of organization, there is no outward thinking and management is more on operations side - ie simple supervisory job. the senior managers in PGS don't act or work because there is not incentive for them to perform.
Promotion is in the form of IJP  and is highly controversial. There are instances of employees being promoted because they played ""Tambola"" (Bingo) and hence contributed to organizational activities and therefore promoted! Promotion has come in the form of shooting an email to the CIO on asking how backups are taken!! 
Decisions are based on hearsay and loose talk - anyone can ""conspire"" against anyone by going to the senior management and saying that ""he/she said like this...."" and the management takes decisions on such loose talk. In fact, the concept of ""spies"" aka ""khabaris"" is common in PGS. Every manager has a gossip monger and more the filthy talk, better is the reward granted in promotions or townhall awards.
Unethical practices like personal relations being favoured in job selection and promotions. 
Learning in technology and business is strictly restricted. Even exams for certifications can't be refunded, and domain knowledge and skill building is a strict no no. There are weird reasons for not supporting knowledge like ""We don't want to build knowledge, we build relations"".
Some managers curse and use abusive language to employees and despite complaining to higher ups, things have been hushed up making a mockery of the so called employee values and ethical policies.
Birthday celebrations for the so called top management are executed in style, the most of the lazy bunch practice for a day and when the d-day arrives, what you see is songs, Mexican waves, balloons and sycophants that can put the the middle age dark world to shame.
You may be wondering what is US office doing despite knowing the razzmatazz in Pune? Perhaps, US office is the main culprit in the kind of total waste of Princial's public shareholder wealth. The cost to PGS is a hedge to the ineffective team of PGS so that US jobs are safe."
1219,,"Great place to earn your wings, not so good once you have them.",2014-09-12,4.0,IT Applications Analyst Senior,"Work Life balance is good in most areas.  Retirement benefits are great, you get 401K and a pension.  Onsite fitness center.  Other benefits are OK.  The people you work with are generally top notch, teams have a family feel. Some employees can work from home or remote.","If you work in a SCBU you'll have to deal with political infighting among the various business units.  Once you reach a ""senior"" level in your position opportunities for advancement are slim to non existent if you don't have direct reports.  Its not uncommon for senior staff level employees to retire having spent the previous 20 years with the same job title.  At times work-life balance can tilt heavily towards work.  Salary is on the high side of mediocre, other companies will pay more but Principal tries to make up for it with a flexible work environment.  Another drawback is that during the remodeling some employees will get crammed into building with very little amenities."

When I left it was all about metrics, numbers and reporting.  The people were undervalued, not recognized, and overworked."

2) Great work life balance as very less work pressure
3) Lots of fun activities, interest groups.Strongly suggest to participate as its the only thing brings you to focus
4)First in last out to compute your daily hours policy.Trust me you are gonna love this in company like this specially when its near to amanora, seasons
5)This should top the list-Free cab facility within 50 km range
6) Relaxed exit process","1)can you spend 8 hours without doing anything meaningful day by day?No right?

2)I was lucky to be under a cool manger but most of them are not

3)If you wanna learn google is open there so search and learn .Work is not going to teach you anything meaningful

4)Award is a joke there.Its there to demotivate the smart people and to encourages the eye candy of the managers

5)No onsite but you would be made aware of that at the time of joining

6) Hike is very very less and the vp is almost 15% of your package so to get that you have to KA(decode that)

7)There is merginal difference in developers and testers salary 

8) You will have a very bad time if you are not good in singing dancing because 10% your VP is there to perform in annual function

So you want to join this company ask yourself

-Are you married and less ambitious ?
-Is IT job is your side income and you have a primary business?
-You just have 2-3 yrs of exp and looking for a cool 1-2 yrs doing nothing but fun.

I am not being sarcastic here ,all of us have different priorities."

There are too many managers who dont understand why they exist and they pretend to know more than the HO folks. The so called L3,L2 (managers) get some one or two words from HO and then try to act as though they know it all.
A level called AVP was created to ""move up the value chain"", so more festivities were executed!

This company is good only for those who join managers and above. For any other level, team lead or developer, this company is only good, if you wish to take a break for 2 years from typically Indian IT service companies."

1299,,Quality company...but not for everyone,2013-02-15,3.0,Financial Representative,"Great facility, support staff, first class environment","My personal experience was that during my recruitment, I didn't fully understand the role prior to accepting an offer - that was my responsibility. In my defense, it is truly difficult to fully understand any role without actually doing it. I based my decision on generalities rather than hard facts and I probably added some ego in the mix as well. 

With 10 years prior experience in B2B Outside Sales, I felt that my understanding of people and general business acumen would be sufficient to allow me to be successful. I was wrong.

My hope was to develop my book of business as more of an ""assets under management"" type model with insurance as an added necessity. Slow, patient, sustainable growth built on willing referrals. My personal situation was that I could afford to be patient with the growth.  

It is said that insurance is never purchased, but always sold. I understand now... No one wants insurance. It's not an exciting product and it involves self evaluation on the clients part, which let's face it; no one loves to do. Also the strategies that were encouraged, involved obvious leading questions into how a person would feel if they didn't make it home that night etc. Not trying to place a moral judgment on this, but it just felt manipulative and unnecessary.

I guess that I much prefer a straight business proposition - this is who I am, this is why I'm here, and this is why I'm the best choice for your business solution. With insurance there is very little proprietary about your product. There's not much benefit from one provider to the next other than consumer trust in your brand."
