PB always confident and proud of their over the counter waiting time(said to be 3mins). When I first joined,I mistakenly took number that is meant for customer(where PB has a staff counter),
and I waiting more that 3mins obviously. 
2nd, when you join processing dept, you will be bound by that ""department"" rules,such as cannot take leave during end of month, cannot this and that. And jobscope for most of staff in processing dept is almost the same(difference only in terms of transaction value,who will process big big amount and lower amount), even though the staff is ranked assistant manager or one level above that. But all the balancing stuffs will be passed on those lower ranked as they said, those ""higher"" staff will have ad-hoc task(in which not all managers do the ad-hoc in same day,while some will do nothing other that chit chat after cleared all the works). So,the higher rank you get, the less work you do,and get paid double/triple of junior's salary.

Flattery is all you need for promotion as company never retrench, many ""leeches"" stayed on and certain people manage to climbed the ladder (promotion by default) who usually doesn't know much of things (it could be a manager or higher post).
It had resulted them not producing quality output, instead providing short term and ineffective solution to cover up butt.
Due to the good money paying by the company, sometimes it retains more retards than talents, and this is what it had reflected in this company. 
Work Life balance depends on your boss, but usually they share the believe of ""good staff works longer hours"".

- Long hours are common
-Steep learning curve,high expectations but little time given to adapt.
--There seem to be disconnect between policies in HQ and Branch. I would advise fresh graduates to apply for HQ positions. I also found that training in the branch was rushed and we were quickly expected to get on with the job. Not enough done to promote talent development.
-Autocratic management style.Ideas and opinion from employees are not appreciated.
-Outdated systems and business practice.
Office politics are not uncommon and 'bodek culture' (apple polishing culture) is very apparent.
-Lack of resource- I was not allocated my own computer during training. Reason- save cost as I may not be permanently based in that branch.(Each branch is treated as profit centre)
-People in the branch also might not be willing to train new graduates as you might end up being transfered to another branch upon confirmation and will not benefit them.
-High turnover rate for new graduates."
