Many doors are opened, and my department head is one of the best in the entire floor - the sweetest boss ever, a boss who is willing to train and is patient with young RMs when coaching them. 

Overall, working environment wise, I dare say it is one of the best amongst all local banks in Malaysia. Ideal environment if you are looking for stability - getting married or retired soon. To sum up, it is a place you want to be in if you are at the stage looking at stability.","Compensation and benefits wise - it has a reputation of paying the lowest in the Malaysian banking industry. The HR policies are all out of date, lack focus on human capital and requires major revision. HR is very rude to staff. 

If you are an ambitious individual looking for advancement and a fast-paced environment, this bank is definitely not for you. Processes wise, majority of the time you will be doing a lot of manual workload, processes demotivate you from career focus with the bank. One may look at it as - you may learn a lot more by assuming the role of an admin/operation staff, credit analyst, and deal hunter but then in reality your time is consumed by a lot of internal processes. 

The internal policies of the bank are risk-averse to business. For those who are looking for a steep learning curve, please join CIMB or Maybank, or any other foreign banks."
