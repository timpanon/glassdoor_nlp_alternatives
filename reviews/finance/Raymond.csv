I wake up everyday knowing I am going to take hundreds of calls from angry financial advisors and their assistants who are going to take their frustrations out on us lower level people. New accounts handles nearly all of the paperwork for Raymond James. We are forced to “reject” almost all of that paperwork sent in from the financial advisors because none of the assistants or FA’s know how to fill the paperwork out or how the systems work. Therefore, them and their assistants call the line and have very unpleasant conversations with the associates. It is an extremely hostile work environment. I once met a corporate VP in Raymond James and he told me “I wouldn’t wish being in new accounts on my worst enemy”. That’s a pretty big red flag. When I was first hired, I told my supervisor that I wanted to climb the ladder in the company and work my way out of new accounts and get a better job. After 6 months I learned that I was stuck here, and moving to another department was basically impossible. For your own mental health, work somewhere else. You will regret taking this job"

I could get nowhere financially in this job,. Due to the compensation, and the nature of the job (a lot of information to absorb and a high call volume) the turnover had been constant. They also expected me to train new employees at that pay level. Advancement opportunities were rare; my predecessor in the role was not promoted until 5 years in."

Executive level management is very professional and extremely kind.","The back office areas of RJ are borderline sweat shops. Extremely high turnover & excessive micro-management. I cannot express enough how out of control the micro-management is that occurs (they will time your bathroom breaks and time away from your desk, even if you are working with a co-worker on the same floor.). Collaboration/training between co-workers is not allowed without approval and also must be monitored by a supervisor. If you are an independent thinker, are innovative, self motivated - and like being treated as an adult - don't work here.
 The workloads are un-sustainable for existing staff. Even salaried employees work 12-14 hours days with no relief. Since 2018, my department has had a exodus of 4 people, 6 people in 2019, 2 in 2020, and now another 4 in 2021. Either management is aware and justifies the high turnover as cost of doing business due to the ""high burnout rate"" of the positions, or they are not aware or being misled - either way - its bad."

The company is constantly sending out anonymous surveys and trying to be better. You are trusted to perform your job duties without needing to be micro-managed. We still have the option to work completely remote due to the pandemic. You have the opportunity to move up within the company so you are able to get out of the monotonous tedious roles pretty quickly if that's where you start with the company.","The salaries and benefits are below average for the amount and value of cash/assets each employee is working with and for how successful the company is. The company will only contribute a max of $1,500 annually to your retirement savings. The entry level jobs can be extremely tedious to the point that it's almost mind-boggling why they don't just create computer program to do it. Lots of mandatory overtime in entry level positions.
One con is with the size of the company, it's hard to really shine or stand out. In previous jobs I've been a noticeably valuable asset to a company. Here, I'm one of 20+ strong workers on a team that's one of many teams that all perform well."

Bring in a bunch of folks from Merrill, Wells, etc. All, not some, all of these folks are incompetent and don't care at all about the culture. They just don't get it.

Was RJ perfect prior to this shift? Absolutely not, but it was a good place to work. The culture is now dead. Not dying, dead. They have a convenient excuse, oh the pandemic, people are remote, it's changing the culture. Trust me, that ain't it. It's the new leadership. They're awful."

Team camaraderie is very high among rank and file employees.,"The department brought in new leadership at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic who wrecked department morale more than the travel halt. Frequent, capricious changes to processes with no explanation compound the difficulties of conducting remote exams. New hires make much more than the current associates who train them and there is no attempt to remedy this imbalance. Hiring decisions are based on industry experience rather than job skill/ability. Top department leadership is incredibly imperious in meetings, with eye rolling, reference to their senior leadership peers making them feel very disconnected from the department. The primary function of the branch examinations department is to conduct branch examinations so you would think that senior leadership would actually observe at least one exam, but this isn't the case after over a year in place."

269,,Don't waste your life here.,2021-07-08,1.0,Asset Management,They are located in Florida,"Sexual harassment is very common. Happened 3 times to me, went to HR but they did nothing. 

Racism is very common but they pretend to try and fix the issues. They made a big fuss over the BLM protests last summer saying they would do better but nothing changed.

CEO and other managers take time to send out letters of hope and love during most catastrophic events like hurricanes but surprisingly said nothing about the Jan 6th attack on our capital. Very suspicious. Many were probably at the attack. 

Supervisors will change policies mid sentence just to throw you under the bus.

Managers will blacklist you from development opportunities if you question even the smallest stupidest policy.

Don't fall for their ""charity"" work. They will charge participants to fully pay for any charity events and pocket the cash. Very little ends up donated to charity. 

Entry level jobs require 10+ years of experience and wages are at the poverty level for everyone other than financial advisors."

423,,"Yet another false corporate ""heaven"" - decent, but don't hold your breath for stability",2021-02-17,3.0,Technical Writer,"This is an incredibly homey office to work at. It's got free coffee on every floor, pretty decent cafeteria food (full service cafes with delicious breakfast), there's a gym, it's a gorgeous campus, and there's lots of classes, seminars, and sit-ins to spice your work week up with and improve your own skills from. When I started there, I was surrounded by people that had been working there for decades! Or returned after some time away - returnees always speak highly of a company. I felt my manager was the best in the whole world and I felt protected and supported by them in the general corporate chaos.","The longer I stayed there, the more the rose tint wore off and I realized that much of the talent RJ was leaning on was ruthless, not good listeners, and very much out to get certain people. They brag all the time about never laying anyone off - and the moment they hit a hiccup, they did. I left right before a massive layoff and I'm very thankful I was not one of the disposed, but many of my very kind and talented colleagues were. They followed up the layoff by bragging online about record assets and financial advisor hirings. They also raised the cafeteria prices several times while I was there - that food was the MOST affordable aspect of the job and they even took that away. They completed re-org after re-org upsetting long standing managerial and employee connections, ruining trust, and then refusing to give space for discussion. This was when I started looking for a new job because I knew it wouldn't last much longer. My most important note - just don't believe the hogwash they sell you. They're an OK company, just like the rest."

These managers go through no formal or informal training on how to manage people and therefore do not have the capability to do so. Benefits and pay are both subpar and below industry standards. Laid off hundreds of employees after ensuring they would not, and then told remaining employees they’d “known they were overstaffed for months” while continuing to post jobs. Very little room for career advancement, especially among the younger workforce. No permanent wfh options. If you’re not a financial advisor, expect to be treated like you don’t matter to the company at all.

719,,"Stay far, far away!",2019-07-08,1.0,Anonymous Employee,The cafeteria has pretty decent food and the health plan is better than a few other finance firms I’ve seen.,"Geez, where do I even begin. I should preface I am NOT in an entry level position, so these are not the typical “call center” complaints or the like. This is coming from a person who really understands this company. 

The structure: the structure is not only incredibly inefficient, it’s also dangerous from a regulatory perspective. No one knows what another team is doing (and I’m not talking about places that need a “Chinese wall”) I’m consistently amazed at how long very important issues take to solve, issues that could easily result in fines for the firm or losses for a client/introducing broker dealer. It’s not uncommon that it can take 2 months to resolve and issue and my temporary solution has to be “just keep doing what you’re doing because it’s either that or stopping a instrumental part of your business entirely.”
From a risk standpoint It’s scary how lenient the firm is with its financial advisors and introducing b/ds due to their structure. After having seen what I have seen I would not be caught dead having my money managed by anyone associated with Raymond James. It’s incredible how relationship managers have the such a major part in the final say in disciplinary actions against malpractice by the aforementioned parties. 

The people: I have never has the displeasure of working with more terrible people. Don’t get me wrong, if you are a cut throat go getter you will love it here. But if you are a good and decent person who wants to work hard but also not kill them selves or others to do so, then you are in the wrong place. 
If you cannot help someone get ahead you are nothing to them. It is incredibly common I hear/see complete disregard for people if they are not in a place of power. (This is coming from a person in power FYI, so I can see it first hand)
People here believe they are a “brand” (I’m not kidding. This is something I have literally heard countless times)
Obviously there are some kind individuals who work here, but for the most part you will be sorely disappointed with your co-workers and bosses. 
There is NO cooperation between teams or people. Why? Because they are all so obsessed with their image that they are too scared to take on any sort of responsibility.

The benefits: Abysmal.... the pay is averageish, however, they are cutting costs and their ability to pay competitive salaries is fading. But let’s say that you do get a competitive salary, great! Now you have to deal with the cap on raises between positions. It used to be that if you were promoted in the company to a new pay grade you could look at a max of around a 16% raise.... now the max you are looking at is around 8%.... this is not just my experience, this is the experience of all my co-workers AND straight from the horses mouth in HR when I questioned it. 
The time off is terrible for a finance firm... 2 weeks of paid time off per year and 2 personal days. Not only is that terrible for most any financial company, but when you see how terrible the work life balance is here you’ll hate it even more. 

The work life balance: 
It’s average to work 60 hours here on salary, no extra for overtime and as I said, since raises are capped so low you aren’t working towards anything more than a few extra dollars after a few years.

The culture: if I have to hear this company brag about moving up on the Fortune 500 list one more time I will lose my mind.... I have worked for 3 Fortune 500 finance firms... none have even been close to this bad. 
They brag about their revenue while cutting costs. 
The associate surveys? Haha yeah no... we had an entire firm wide meeting dedicated to the associate surveys people filled out... I assumed they scheduled it because the reception had been so terrible (I know for a fact many employees are pissed off currently about the company) they blatantly said to our faces “it’s been fantastic to see such positive reception to our changes as per the responses in the survey.” Why is this? Most likely because it goes back to these people protecting their brand... god forbid someone relays that their employees aren’t happy to the big men upstairs.

Honestly, I could keep going on, I really could. I’m actively looking for other positions and IMPLORE you to do the same."

• Very young department (frequently hiring individuals directly out of college)
• Promotions and leadership opportunities are based on who's been there the longest and not on credibility/talent/experience in the medium (ex. copy experts are acting as creative directors for design projects)

724,,"Great Company Overall, some departments have better cultures than others",2019-06-14,1.0,Manager,"The company's client-first culture, stability, and conservative business model should keep it being a great company in the future.","The ""Global Wealth Solutions"" department is rife with favoritism, cronyism, and constant politics. There are many unnecessary and overpaid managers who aren't contributing and the few specialist's who are face back breaking work volume and poor compensation. Two older white male Case Consultants are compensated $50k more than their counterparts with the same credentials, or over 50% more for doing the same job. Despite this, they were recently given promotions other team members never had an opportunity to apply for. There is no clear plan or philosophy across the department, though some units in this department have great managers and high morale while other teams have one foot out the door. Work life balance is non-existent.

Raymond James chooses to undercompensate their Wealth Strategist's and Wealth Management Consultants far below industry peers, but demand the same level of activity. It makes them very uncompetitive adding new talent and contributes to a toxic work environment where demands often outweigh recognition/compensation and associates become jaded over time.

Upper management in Advisor Tech team lacks technical experience and communication skills. Bad management is reflected in every product and project. Teams lack tech experience and when offered they turn their noses and try to push employees out. Their only expertise is in creating power point docs.

Horrible 401k plan with no matching. The worst healthcare coverage that I’ve ever seen for such a large company. When they interview they promise everything yet the reality is nothing even close. I was really surprised at how technically backward this company was. No remote work despite modern tech capabilities even in an emergency. HR does nothing for employees who’ve been mistreated.
Advisor Technology team is a joke  with awful, biased attitudes and poorly managed budgets and constant staff cuts. They are not even aware of their budget let alone how to manage it. The management have no direction or any idea on how to run a team or train associates. They create redundant mundane tasks and the team has no proper background.  They are reluctant to train associates yet will spend money on lavish hotels for themselves and attend conferences not letting anyone else have a chance. Anyone who tries to make a difference or change their old attitudes will get thrown out.  Just glossy power point is all they do.

The company has a family business feel that I'm sure can only be matched by an RIA. 

My advice to anyone is that if you're discouraged at your Wall St. based firm look into moving your book to Raymond James.",I don't have anything negative to say about RJ.

The PTO is not competitive, the healthcare option, while in line with what other companies are moving to, is not financially feasible for many families, and the 401k match is a joke, especially for the industry.  The company's benefits package does not allow for employees to customize what they want/need.  Although the maternity/paternity leave is generous, someone who does not have the need will never benefit.  Also, many companies, RJ included, look for people with degrees, yet there are no benefits available for student loan repayment.  Lastly, compensation is a touchy topic, especially in my field.  It would seem that new people coming into the company make more than those who have been here for a while.  The best way to get what you are worth is to change positions."

A ""Taker"" culture is quite prevalent among the office.  People expect to take more from you then you'll ever receive, which is a horrible feedback loop for an office environement.  I point this out as the company prides itself on it's Customer first culture.  This mentality is counter to this."

There was a lot of pushback from upper management. There was little to no company culture, and as usual, female assistants were undervalued. I saw a male assistant getting bonuses from his FA every time he tied his shoes (an exaggeration, but he got quite a few bonuses), and then female assistants who had multiple children were scrounging for an end-of-the-year bonus. I'm not sure if the execs were being greedy with the flexible part of the budget or if budgets were slashed by national higher ups, but it's not a good situation for women at this company unless you push to become an FA and fight for your standing."

1249,,Horrible company to work for,2015-02-21,1.0,IT Technologist,Located in a beautiful location of Florida.,"Management in the IT area is horrible.  They frequently have employees do overtime without any comp time or monetary compensation which is illegal.  Some teams in IT would get comp days for their Disaster Recovery testing (which ran from Friday night through Sunday) but some teams, such as mine, did not get any comp time - we had one stretch where we worked literally 3 weeks straight without a day off and was told by our manager to ""belly up to the bar.""  This was fully supported by upper management.  I also have several friends from the company who were very dedicated who would get negative performance reviews for projects that could not get finished due to dependencies from other groups not being delivered, all being acknowledged by the manager...but in the end would tell my friend too bad so sad, doesn't matter if another department prevented you from completing the project in time.  Many promises were made to me for my job, none of which were delivered.  Backstabbing was a frequent occurrence from those who were there before me.  I found out that many people in my industry avoid this company like the plague.  They frequently compare themselves to the Goldman Sachs and JP Morgans of the world but they are nowhere near that level.

We were expected to user our personal cell phones for IT support - my co-worker ran up $300 in cell phone usage one month and was told by the manager that it was ""part of the job.""  I know of NO company on Wall Street that would ever expect a worker to pay for cell phone overage as part of the job.  We had a group cell phone that was for the person on call - unfortunately the carrier that was used  had very poor reception where I lived.  As a result I frequently did not get support calls and was berated by management for not having good cell phone reception.  In a real world class organization (such as Credit Suisse where I've worked) they would have multiple carriers for their cell phones and you would simply be issued a phone with better coverage than what you had.  But not Raymond James, instead you were expected to use your own cell phone and accrue hundreds in cell phone overage charges."

If you are working for a good, respectable advisor, it's a good gig outside of the three points above. If not, you are at the mercy of your direct report, who can and will expect you to work 60+ hours and make the job your life with little appriciation and lower pay than you would expect.

It's a company that works hard to follow a set of principles towards clients and employees. In most every way, RJ doesn't just talk the talk, they walk the walk. When they talk about putting the client first, it's ingrained in the lexicon, processes, and approach. Everyone thinks it, and does their best to live up to it.

Pay isn't the best in the industry, but it's good for our geography. And for a decade, I've seen the people that perform the best, get rewarded in salary and responsibility.

The company strongly supports giving back to the community, with many dozens of charitable events and projects going on across the firm every year. In the department I worked in, there were ongoing, sanctioned committees to make available charitable activities for the department, and everyone was given some time off to participate directly, such as food warehouse stocking, holiday 'adoptions', helping the unemployed with resume and interview skills.

The firm, from the groups I've worked with across a decade, generally do not have gossipy, unproductive environments. There's not an abundance of debilitating tension or conflict. Everyone is excited about doing a great job, serving worthy clients and partners, and working with a great group of peers.

There are many, many roles you can pursue at RJ. I've seen employees go from role to role, department to department, as they round out their skills. Technology, finance, marketing, operations, there's plenty of internal career options. I would, and have, recommended to many friends and family to work at RJ. We're having a blast and providing an important service to clients.

Benefits are full, extra perk of top financial advisor for every employee, and good company stock program for all. Also, RJ as a business has been amazing, 105+ consecutive quarters of growth. That means security, stability, growth of your stock options, team, and opportunities.","Nepotism, is encouraged at RJ. There are quite a few husband and wife teams, and brothers, sisters, working at RJ. That can be a pro or a con, but I've never had a problem with it.

The firm is very conservative with investing in innovation and digital technologies. There are numerous core functions that go without attention at RJ, likely alone among their peers. Many of these functions I wouldn't run a small business without, and yet RJ doesn't invest in the basics. In some areas, RJ is absolutely the leader in their industry, and there are always new technologies to learn and grow. But even still, big holes remain as the company grows methodically.

Some micromanagement at dept head level. Not many middle managers are given full P&L responsibility."

He's hands off which can be good but it make him out of touch as in this case.  There is a constant battle between departments.  I hadn't had a review in over a year nor had our manager visited our office yet they took the word of others from a different sector because he was saving his own job.

The only con is the amount of turnover in the sales assistants, but this is somewhat the nature of the business.

Benefits start after 90 day probationary period.  Parking garages are nice in since they are in Florida (rain/heat).  Lots of quality people working for this company.","Was a great place to work until the last couple of years.  The Company's direction has changed drastically from long term conservative growth to short term profits.  Corporate culture is the worse I've ever seen.  Departments are pitted against each other and have very adversarial relationships.  There is zero focus on the endgame; instead the focus is on department budgets and who has to pay for what.  This usually results in finger pointing and no action taken to correct the issue.  Employees are treated as 3rd class citizens and looked down upon by upper management.  You definitely get the impression that you are considered a burden to the company and not a valued member of a team.  Any suggestions to improve processes, service levels, employee morale, etc... are taken as criticism and highly discouraged by lower and upper management.  Office politics are rampant and the resulting stress levels are thru the roof.  High production and hard work are punished on a regular basis.  The theory seems to be that if you make you Supervisor look good then the other Supervisors in the department need to make you look bad to compensate.  Most employees agree that their actual job is not a problem, but the stress caused by management makes the work environment miserable.  It has become the very definition of a toxic workplace.

The HR department (with certain exceptions) is pretty much useless.  I don't think I've met a single person who works there who is happy with them.  Career opportunities are extremely limited.  The company seems to have changed from trying to find qualified experienced people to hiring green associates.  Most positions are not filled by the best person for the job but whoever has a friend that can get them in, someone who just graduated college or from Wal-Mart, Best Buy, Target etc...  There is no effort by management to help associates advance their careers.  It’s basically every man for himself at RJ.  RJ recently changed their Health Ins to a high deductible plan in order to save money while also increasing the montly premium for less coverage."

1355,,Not what it once was...,2013-07-01,3.0,Business Analyst,"Probably great for a new IT recruit now.  While I worked there, a great environment and work/life balance.  RJ philosophy was ""Service First"" and it was displayed by virtually everyone.  In IT department we raised money for charity all year long and contributed to needy families/children in the community at year end.  People worked hard, long hours as needed to get the job done and then celebrated successes with a work hard/play hard approach.  Lots of training and advancement opportunity.  After Tom James stepped down as CEO in 2010, things began to change...","New management brought in to modernize IT, but in essence it was apparently to obfuscate and clean house.  New CIO brought in people she used to work with previously and they felt free to chastise and humiliate managers already entrenched in the RJ culture.  These new people either were given direction to make legacy folks uncomfortable or they have no polish at all to their professionalism.  Either way, many IT folks began to search for other jobs and leave.  During Morgan Keegan acquisition IT gave up vacations and time off during holidays in order to make it happen and convert accounts over to RJ platform by Feb 2013.  We did it and were verbally thanked, then in April 2013 they had their first major layoff, mostly IT.  (Thank you and good-bye!)  More layoffs expected.  Future uncertain."

Supervisors/Managers say they want to help career growth, but do not offer insight or follow-up to ensure you are on track - nor are they willing to actually develop talent, would rather higher those with experience than develop stars into supervisory positions. 401k match is a bit antiquated, as is the vacation/sick time mix.

In the last year or two many new senior managers have been brought in to affect change.  Change may have been necessary to take the company to the next level, but it has come at a very high price of lost talent.  Attrition is very high, and management seems to be ok with that.   People have been quietly walked out the door, titles and reporting structures changed without any announcements, etc.  The water cooler conversations have gone from how we can make a better organization to who just turned in their 2 weeks notice and who's next.  Recruiters are crawling all over existing employees trying to drag them to other firms. Senior management may so it back and say that this is all part of the plan or all necessary in order to change the firm.  However, they're really hurting morale and don't realize that what they are losing will only cause more problems.    This firm was profitable and successful before the new regime arrived.

""Good old boys"" mentality is rampant, but new leadership is changing that dynamic (albeit slowly). The general concensus is that anyone who went to the University of Florida walks on water; these people have established their own 'secret society' in which the choice positions and projects are reserved for ""Gators"".

Most of the departments give puny bonuses. Being serious, they hire too many old people that are extremely inefficient. In fact, it seems that efficiency is more often punished than rewarded.

They are very conservative in decision-making in order to control and maintain growth.","All that said, there is very little pay in any career paths that don't directly involve trading.  For some, the cultural and non-monetary compensations stop making up for the gap in pay with respect the responsibilities they are asked to take on.  Promotions are also done only once a year - so it's easy to be doing the work of a position for most of a year and not be paid for it until December.  And even then, if the pool of budgeted money runs out, you could be waiting another year.  I've also seen a failure to deliver on reimbursement for continuing education, even when it directly applies to the position."
