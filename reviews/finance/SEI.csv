56,,Worst Job I've Ever Had,2021-12-23,1.0,Internal Account Executive,"The company itself isn't so bad. They try to innovate. Campus is pretty cool and different, lots of art everywhere. I also never really felt micromanaged.","Keep in mind this is specific to the Internal Account Executive role. I'll just start with...there's a reason why there's always an opening for this position on Linked In. In my time there (18 months or so) I think maybe 1 person within all of the Sales units actually got a promotion, but I lost count of how many people left. Turnover is rampant.

There is literally NO training. I had a 3 hour corporate orientation on my first day, and then was just walked to my seat, and that's it. They basically expect you to tap someone on the shoulder to learn everything, the only problem is the job can get so ridiculously complex that there's no way you can learn that way. Then add Covid and working from home into the mix. Not good.

You're also pretty much at the mercy of your External, you basically work for them and not your boss. If your External is cool and wants to mentor you, you might get the hang of it. If not and they wanna be a jerk, then good luck.

My experience was different than some of the other guys on the team, but I can't say I ever really enjoyed a single day in this job. You have your External calling you at random moments throughout the day to dump work on you, and they'll probably say something sarcastic to you if you don't answer their initial call and have to call them back, you have advisors calling to complain about something that went wrong out of your control, advisors emailing you asking you to explain the basics of finance and the following up with 5-6 individual follow-up questions until they leave you alone, emails coming from Management telling you to call advisors that attended a webinar that you didn't even watch so you have no idea what to talk to them about...the list goes on. I think I made my point. The job is chaos. I worked at another large farm for a long time before this, and it definitely got frustrating at times, but I never felt as lost as I did in this job."

62,,Slog!! slog!! - no recognition on top of that,2021-12-03,2.0,Project Manager,Exposure to some new technologies,"Micromanagement by senior management. They are only focused on saving money; they don't think about the long-term damage their decisions are causing. Very narrow-minded, CYA type people.

Total lack of transparency regarding the direction the organization is taking.

Budget revisions/cut happen often causing the remaining people to overwork beyond compare. On top of that, you never get recognized.

The compensation packages are also sub par compared to the other employers in the area.

The HR group is one of the worst HR teams I have come across. They are a bunch of bossy, inhumane people with very less on the ground expertise dealing with ""humans"".

This is NOT a 9-5 or 9-6 workplace. Unless you (technical staff) put in 10-12 hours (minimum) a day, you won't get things done because,

1. The business staff don't write requirements nearly well. Many a time requirements are ""TBD"". The technical staff has to conjure up requirements and validate them with business teams.

2. Business and Tech Architecture teams are purely namesake. They send out proclamations now and then but are never, ever involved beyond that.

3. The infrastructure team is also a crippled faculty unable to service the scores of development teams here.

4. None of the dev/QA/post dev environments are stable.

5. Performance engineering group (that services 100+ development teams) lacks basic technical skillset except for 1 or 2 people.

SEI used to be a wonderful place to work. I am sorry to say this a totally dysfunctional organization today."

112,,"Dynamic and fun, but poorly managed. Unfair, unclear and extremely misleading..",2021-08-15,3.0,Business Support,"SEI has a good crowd in its London as well as the US offices. Both offices are also very modern and fun to work in. The US office is designed like a university campus which makes things all the more interesting. The London office is decorated very well with artwork and is very spacious. If you work here for over a year, you are bound to make at least 1 or 2 life-long friends. Teams are usually diverse at the lower level (although not so much at the senior level). The company throws great parties and has made a good effort to improve the status of women through the SEI Women's Network initiative.

The middle management is very good and inclusive of its team members. Unfortunately the senior managers make their lives quite difficult and as a result the frustration can filter downstream on certain occasions.

Work-life balance is good and there is no discrimination against people who have not received a formal education. Everyone is given an opportunity.","Business decisions are often made by senior male members of staff, during or after work hours, and in the pub - not the office. A respectable woman who has a family to go home to after work can, in no way, ever participate in such situations because of which it is ensured that the top level remains a ""boys club"". It is not uncommon for women to file grievances with HR. I have witnessed the submission of at least three of them in my time, all of which had one theme in common: sexism.

One elderly woman was made redundant after she complained that her manager treats her like a secretary. This is another problem at SEI, as the company is open plan and does not have any secretaries. Manifestly, what then happens is that male managers who failed elsewhere in larger corporations where they do have secretaries and come to take shelter at SEI find themselves in positions whereby they do not know how to sort their calendars or books a webex call. As a result, lo and behold, they ask women of a lower rank to do it all for them. Should any woman ever push back for being treated as thus, lo and behold, she gets sacked.

Underhand politics. Covert sexism. Institutional racism. Discrimination. Work here long enough, and one soon realises that these are the foundational pillars that secretly run this organisation.

SEI tends to retain many people who do not have the competence to work elsewhere. They are people who have failed in other larger and more structured corporations and have absolutely nowhere else to go. These individuals end up becoming life-long employees at SEI and adopt political tactics for their survival, and not hard work. As a result, hard working employees are often punished while incompetent individuals are rewarded.

The company recently underwent a restructuring and appointed a new leadership team in almost every division. The new managers, much like how the nouveau riche are defamed for ""new money"", are people of ""new power"" and think that they are gods who rule the entire galaxy. In reality, they are only senior managers of a company that harbors no more than 350 people.

The pay is not fair and not up to the market standards. In comparison to people working in other companies in the same position as I, it was consistently concluded that I was well under paid for my role which is why I had to eventually leave. The management also makes you work extra hard and promises you a good bonus, only to eventually reveal an unsatisfactory compensation which was determined by an auto-generating algorithm in their systems. Then they blame the US office for not listening to them when they tried to fight your corner (in reality, they never tried to do anything for you in the first place). The gender pay gap is absolutely outrageous and nowhere close to market standards or anywhere near the achievements of firms like BlackRock.

It pains me to say that the senior members of staff in the London office are solely comprised of white males. Women are nowhere to be found at the top. Appalling politics is often filtered downstream from the top, after which the senior male leaders consume outrageous amounts of alcohol to forget about all that they have done.

A few funny things have happened in this company. Extra-marital affairs and sex scandals are rather common and some people are incredibly eccentric. For example, one person joined as a project manager and ended up having a severe nervous breakdown two years later and resigned. It turned out that she was actually a professional actress in the past who was just acting the part half the time and eventually couldn't cope! Another employee who was formerly a stripper got promoted to become a manager after having an intimate evening with her senior director at an office party. Many married or ""committed"" male managers tend to get involved in intimate relationships in the office with younger women. One of them did so while his partner was pregnant with his child. The greatest scandal of them all was when some head of pensions that I never met (but inevitably got to know about) ended up leaving his wife and daughter for a woman he worked with, who was much younger than himself . His wife went hysterical and defamed SEI all over the media, and personally messaged the entire staff on LinkedIn to educate everyone on what her soon to be ex-husband had done. It was devastating and heart-breaking when she shared the details with me personally. The management did not fire him - instead they retained him and hailed him as a hero. HR does absolutely nothing about inappropriate relationships in the office because HR members themselves are involved in such relationships with members of staff! One of the HR managers always had quite a reputation with the males and nothing was ever done to discipline her in the office. In the past, HR members have also gotten married to male members of staff within SEI, presumably after looking at how much they earn. The corporate system here is therefore extremely partial and favours people based on personal preferences. 

Some senior members of staff also vanish under the umbrella of long term sick leaves (specially when an FCA audit comes up). This is very common in teams that are closely affiliated with risk management and compliance. They do not do a very good job in keeping things intact and conveniently disappear as soon as they are about to be found out.

Cramped, disgusting office - I’ve gotten sick more times here than I have anywhere/anytime else I’m my life.

-Poor Management. 
-Co-workers-   the consequence for being a bad employee is less responsibility and hours. The consequence for being a decent employee is getting pigeon-holed and abused w/  doing basically all of the dreg work left to you by bad coworkers.
-Promotions - These same coworkers have the time and energy to go and gab  about sports and stupid internal procedure w/ supervisors and other hire-ups, so they end being the people promoted. I mentioned poor management?
- New hires. Not trained, not policed, and not fire-able. If your lucky, you get to do their job while explaining it to them as they forget it.

Development opportunities are not easy to come by and I had to experience more than one times when male senior executives told me that I wouldn't get a promotion because ""I am not hungry enough"" - following the above harassments I was not too keen on inquiring what would be ""enough"" for their liking."

- There is no cubicle. Even though SEI says no cubicle is their strength to improve their team work, I don't agree with that. My supervisor was right behind me and watched me what I did. It made me feel very nervous and uncomfortable even if I had never done anything not related my jobs.
- SEI always says that their active teamwork with the open place is one of reasons why they are growing fast, but I had a proper training (I think) only twice from my supervisors. Most of time, my supervisor said ""check the prior year's file and figure that out by yourself"" and my manager said ""I can't not teach you every single things. you need to do by yourself"". I understand that I need to do that by myself, but, at least, I expect that they would tell me how to do something I have never seen before.

Petty office politics really ruins the service team.  Hard work does not matter.  Advancement is predicated on favoritism.  There is even a ""secret society"" within the service team, that has at least one team supervisor on and is effectively sanctioned by upper management.  It is insane.  This ""secret society"" goes by the name of ""Duck Dynasty"" as members are marked by keeping rubber ducks on their desks.  If this sounds ridiculous, its because it is.  This unofficial body wields opaque influence over the service team, and upper management does nothing to stop it.  Seeing this type of behavior is reminiscent of high school cliques, not of a professional organization.  All of this creates an environment where performance and dedication are subservient to the whims of petty employees and managers who utilize opaque influence to those on the outside from advancement."

- Well-kept, beautiful and modern campus
- Company Happy Hours every quarter
- A lot of activities that try to bring SEI employees together
- Gym (free), manicures, hair cuts, dry-cleaning, oil change, other car services etc. that are a nice opportunity, although many employees (like myself) did/do not use these services","*(Please read my following opinion carefully. However, please keep in mind that this is just one person's opinion! Not everyone will have the same experience!)

SUBJECTIVE CON:
What bothers me the most about this company is the AMBIGUITY from the get-go. For entry-level positions, the offer letter describes what seems to be a temp to perm position even though it is NEVER disclosed as such. (I believe that HR and management is trained to be misleading on the status of employment for various reasons).  I was hired through SEI, after attending their company career fair. I was NOT hired through a temp agency.

Upon being hired, every new entry-level employee is assessed after a 3-month probationary period on whether or not they would like for you to continue working at SEI. From the beginning, you are automatically working on a probationary period, and after the 3-month mark it is decided if you are good enough to keep at SEI, or if they will ""work"" another couple months with you to help improve the skills you are lacking as an employee (this is decided by your supervisor, signed off by your manager and discussed with HR). In my opinion, the 3-month review was completely subjective and I could tell my supervisor was not fond of me from the beginning. However, I sucked it up and had a plan I shared with my supervisor on how I would work specifically on the skills she believed I was lacking. This is because after the initial 3-month review, it was decided that my probation would be extended for another month and be discussed again.

For the next couple of months, a nightmarish cycle continued where I would have regular one-on-one meetings with my supervisor to discuss and make sure my progress was headed in the right direction: which she told me it was. Then, I would continue to get blind-sided during my next two probationary extension progress meetings where I would be told that my performance was still not meeting the requirements. On my very last probationary extension, I was supposedly told that my last extension would only last 2 weeks (which I do not recall this being the time frame, as it was not formally written anywhere). However, I made the most of it by asking my supervisor for now DAILY morning meetings and DAILY end-of-day meetings to discuss my progress because I was STILL determined to make the best out of the situation and work on improving myself as an SEI employee.

Finally, a week and a half so later I was called into a one-on-one meeting with HR to discuss my progress where I learned that I was being let go. Once again, I was blindsided considering that my supervisor would always give me positive feedback on my progress. Lastly, neither my supervisor nor manager said goodbye to me or acknowledge my leaving at all, which I thought was a very cowardly move.

OBJECTIVE CONS:
- Depending on what department and team you're on, late nights are very common
- Extremely low pay compared to industry average
- Sloppy and irrelevant training- will be put into different departmental trainings by accident yet still are expected to attend and participate (example: I had to take an accounting training class even though I was in the operations department) this has happened to some of my other peers as well

Lots of ""amenities"" at the Oaks Office:  Hair Cuts, Shoe Shine, Dry Cleaning, Food Truck Thursdays.  Management was flexible, open to new ideas, questions, and advice.  I liked my supervisor and manager while I worked there but (see below).","I worked for SEI through a temp agency.  From all indications that I had everything was going well and they were interested in hiring me on full time.  I was told 5:15 on a friday before a holiday weekend that my temporary employment assignment was ended.  I was told that ""I would be bored in the role and they thought I was destined for bigger things.""

Career Opportunities:
None.  I was hired looking at this as a career opportunity to move into another position.  I offered innovative new ways to save time and money in my role.  While in my position I gave 110%, I showed up early, stayed late.  But no it really wasn't an opportunity.

Compensation and Benefits
$15/ hr and no benefits because I was a temp.  It was a get my foot in the door opportunity to advance.  I was supposed to be provided access to the education website... over 3 months and multiple request later, I never received it.

Work Life Balance:
They were flexible with work life balance.  I had to stay home to watch my sick kid afew days while I worked there, I had no problems.

Senior Management
I have to rate them low.  I was never even in a meeting with them in the 3 months while I was there.  No new employee orientation or anything (again I was a temp), but I expected something.

Culture & Values:
Culture is great but their values are aweful as evidenced by how they let me go."

It is a young, fun work environment.","Management goes with their gut instead of using facts to make decisions.  They couldn't admit the Global Wealth Platform was designed wrong and ended up wasting hundreds of millions to fix it.  As a result, they preach innovation but tend to play it safe in most cases.

SEI has a policy of open communication but don't really want to hear dissenting opinions.  It's a very political place with lots of nepotism.  

Younger employees often get blocked from rising the ranks.  They are blocked by a small group of people who got very rich on stock options because they played the game well. Not because they were innovative leaders or made huge contributions to the success of SEI."

Other companies definitely look very favorably upon time spent at SEI on your resume.,"The compensation compared to the exact same role at other TAMPs or fund companies is very low. The quotas rise without much actual thought being put into how they actually come up with the numbers, very much a ""spin the wheel"" approach. The in house training is average at best, I found a lot more value in working individually with my external and MD. SEI loves to think of itself as a true innovator and thus refuses to outsource any new product builds (i.e. Wealth Platform) which is an extreme detriment to success. It is ironic that they are stubborn in this regard yet do not realize that they are rapidly falling behind their competitors. The quality of the internals has dipped due to hiring more kids fresh out of college (because they will accept lower compensation). As a result now even the externals are baby faced with almost zero experience because they had no alternative options as the top people from outside the company are not willing to settle on the compensation/company outlook combination."

Although, I will say, after working at another software job, I was impressed with SEI's willingness to adopt new methods (Git, code reviews, and other things you might take for granted as a software developer)

- Heavy exposure to mutual funds as a whole, as opposed to other Fund Accounting jobs where you just get one piece
- Great company happy hours/events!","- Hard to get promoted unless you work the right people - it is like ""high school,"" if you are popular you get promoted. Promotions are more based on popularity and tenure than actual merit

570,,Don't be fooled,2014-12-28,2.0,Accounting Analyst,I got pretty good with Excel by doing this job.  Other than that I can't really think of any pros.,"If you are considering a job as an Accounting Analyst with SEI I have a couple pieces of advice for you that I had to learn the hard way.  First, any accounting job that doesn't require you to have your CPA or even care whether or not you are pursuing it and doesn't require you to have been an accounting major in college (I worked with econ majors, math majors etc.) is not really an accounting job.  There is no specialization required to do this job.  They are just looking for labor and the salary reflects that.  It is not even close to the market rate for an entry-level accountant.  Second, if you are being pursued by one of the recruiting agencies, don't fall for the pitch.  They will tell you anything to get you to take the job.  They don't get paid until you start.  And it's not SEI that is paying them.  You are the one paying them by accepting a lower wage for the first 3 months.  Finally, understand that if you do accept a job through the temp agency you will not have any benefits for the first 3 months and you will not be allowed to take any time off for the first 6 months that you are employed.  You have to work there for 90 days before you are allowed to take time off but your time as a temp doesn't count towards that 90 days even though you are still working a 40 hour (or longer) week and doing all the same work as a full time employee."

Horrible place to work.,2013-12-20,1.0,Accounting Analyst,There were no PROS about SEI.,"-No Training until 3 months after I started. Thrown into the work on your own, and was expected to know everything within a few days.  

-Supervisors look the other way when you walk by them in the hallway.  No ""Good mornings"", ""How are you doing?"", ""How was your weekend?"", or even a ""Hello.""  If you see one of your supervisors in the parking garage, bathroom, or cafeteria, they just ignore you and keep quiet.  It was the most AWKWARD ENVIRONMENT.  Everyone was very ignorant and there is NO OPEN CULTURE at all.  If anyone else saw an open culture, let me know.

-Hours were awful.  I was told my hours were 9am-5:30pm, but I had to wait for emails later in the day that always came later than 5:30pm.  The email was delayed numerous times and I ended up staying until after 6pm, even 6:30pm on a regular basis.   

-Awful pay for the workload.  I arrived slightly before 9am everyday and got to work right away.  Constantly busy the entire day, and rarely had time to eat lunch.  The department doesn't give overtime, so don't think about putting it on your time sheet.

-The Human Resources department were not helpful at all.  They were never in the office to respond to new hire questions. Everytime I emailed them, I got an auto response: ""On vacation...""  They took at least 3 days to respond to my emails, and didn't even know the answers all the time. 

-I was told by my supervisors in a meeting, ""DO NOT LEAVE DURING THE FIRE DRILL"".  Myself, along with my other coworkers, had to stay at our desks to do work during a fire drill.  The fire chiefs inspected the building and looked more confused than we were.  I don't even think it's legal to tell your employees to ignore the fire drill.  

- Such a high turnover rate.  From the very first day, I heard nothing but ""I want to leave this place so bad"", ""I had an interview last week for another company"", ""There is nothing good about this place.""  Every single person in my department, including some supervisors, told me they were looking to leave ASAP.

Its quicker to get Promoted to Accountant II and supervisor since They don't stay long. You will probably have to work harder and suck up to supervisor and volunteer to take things that you can handle without messing up too much. Plus it feels like data entry,"Temp starts at 15/hr and Perm Starting Salary is 35k. After 1 year, salary goes up to 38k and thats it. Work even harder to get Get promoted to Fund Accountant II, salary starts at 41k.. There are NO Christmas party like most companies and there are NO Christmas Bonus. We'll be lucky if we get a $10 gift card. DECEMBER is a HELL month because most accountant takes off and you will have to take an extra work load to cover their funds. 1-2 person leaves each month in a team of 9-16 members and you will have to work harder to cover their funds until they hire a new person. The hiring takes about 2-4 weeks and that new person will go through at least 1-2 weeks before they can take over the easy funds. You do the math! Your workload will increase and probably won't decrease.. BE WARNED! Most people like the company before they start but after a month, They will regret their decision. If you get an offer from SEI and from another company, You better choose that other company. Stress level is extremely high and underpaid. By the way, This is reference to Accounting Analyst and Fund Accountant from SEI. You will see this available position a lot in monsters, indeed, careerbuilder, and from temp agency.

The work sucks, they will continue to give you more and more with with no raises, bonuses or promotions. If they do finally give you a promotion (I am mainly talking about IMS under Steve Meyer) they will stiff you out of a yearly performance raise because you got promoted. If you are there longer management will let you do whatever you want. The pay is also significantly less than any other place you will find a job opening for. Management tried to offer an incentive for staying a year by making you go from 35k to 38k, still below starting salary for other companies."

Co-workers are very friendly/helpful. Cool campus, great cafeteria. On-site gym. SEI will jump-start you to higher paying opportunities within the financial services industry. PTO (7 days/yr) & Vacation (10 paid days/yr).","Salary is low (entry-level is 35k). Located in Oaks, PA (Remote suburb of Philly). Little room to advance within company (NO CAREER TRACK), managers do not stress advancements to other areas of company, only lateral movements within department. Most co-workers do not hold business degrees, most jobs are 'financial processing'. Most managers don't even work, they just delegate 100% of their duties. Not a lot of reward for recognition, 1-2 performance reviews a year result in small bonus. Probably mentioned it before but I cannot stress this enough, there is very high turnover, you will likely see a couple new faces every week."

The cafeteria has good food.,"Pay is horrible!!! There are people who dont even have degrees making more money with their entry level jobs than SEI will ever pay. They work you like a dog and then give you a hard time when you have overtime. Management doesn't have a clue about  reasonable time lines in comparison to your work load. Also, if you are a woman in the investment managment services department, find a new job. Moving up is about as likely as the US getting out of debt. It is sad really that SEI plays into the statistics of woman not having the ability to succeed in this industry but I am living it. Upper level management needs classes on how to run a team."

Benefit time and work life balance is great.,"There is little reward or recognition for hard work (I should say none).  Oftentimes you won't even get a review of your performance.  The salary is OK.  There is a rumor that salaries are kept within 80% of the market, which sounds about right.  Limited pay growth.  With the workloads being much higher than competing companies, you kinda would expect the salary to also be more competitive.  Benefits are not that great either (higher cost for a high deductible plan).  There is no career track for growth, training or advancement.  Also GWP is sucking the life out of this company.  While the culture is great I don't know that the values or ethics are."
