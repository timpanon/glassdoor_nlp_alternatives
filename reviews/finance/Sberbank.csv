Rude people, most of them is not on their positions, at least half of employees have no technical\computer science education in Sberbank-Technology. Unadequate management, who avoid any kind of solutions and strategic management, but like to perform micromanagement and check your work three times per day with a demand to draw for it new presentations instead of doin real job duties. Moreover no possibilities to grow, only negative feedback, no matter how or how long you work, which improments and goals you reach, to higher positions the prefer to hire not-competent people (maybe even from another areas). Actually, company live just because of low-ranked workers, but ruled and controlled by enclaves of corruptionists. Funny fact - that on workplaces of top management you can find attributes of FSO and Putin's photos. Workplaces of employees also mostly not good. Firstly, there is two domains you need to work with. One is for external communications, meetings, timesheeting and internet. Second for coding, testing and some tools. Data flow between them is poor, and software installations is big problem. You can't install even opensource software without visa from security department. Second point - locations is overcrowded, everything is too loud, permanent calls and crying - you can't focus on work or must to use earplugs. Poor lights, too dark (!), air conditioners never cleans, viruses flows in openspace, chairs is broken. Not good locations, and shuttle buses are shame, probably they already has been used somehere in Korea or China. Several actions are banned, like Google Spreadsheets (but Google drive works well). Also, every action is traced by security (especially via Yandex browser). Totally unfriendly and rude atmoshere, where you are Man-Day, but not a person. There is no trainings, benefits like coffee and cookies, no events during the year. Just work. Just work with overtime. If you won't perform overwork everyday and to have a meeting at saturday or sunday, you'll get a hate portion from management. Why?

High-level professionals can find conditions much better than those they offer.,"Awful place for IT specialists: insane-bureaucratic old-style-bank paranoid-security internal structure and management incompetent both in IT, management and their domain business field make it literally impossible to work here. 

Most of your time you will be dealing not with your real duties  but with irrelevant obstacles such as trying to get necessary software or data access (most of time, nearly impossible), find someone who knows someone who knows someone who knows someone who knows about some matter (how-to, IT-system characteristics, another specialties), and so on.

Terrible project planning here. Half of your working time you have nothing to do, another half will be overtimes (up to 70 hours a week in my case, with no compensation).  

Software developers treated as second-class people here. Also very toxic environment in general (disrespectful, aggressive, petty tyranny, unwilling to help and share, political).

Bonus system. Part of your initially demanded salary in fixed monthly salary and part in regular bonus. It's the only way sberbank can offer market or higher market  total salary for developers. Bonus payed  once a quarter with some delay. And it can be changed by your direct supervisor according to his opinion on your work (fairly or not).

Working experience in this organization adds nothing good to your resume nor because of the company reputation on the IT-market nor because you almost certainly won't be able to finish any project because of endlessly-slow and unclear processes and unwilling and frightened to complete changes management (moreover most of projects from the beginning were intended to be useless just to make appearance of activity in the department they came from)."
