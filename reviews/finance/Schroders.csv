Unfortunately there is an aggressive culture promoted throughout management which has seen many excellent, knowledgeable people leave. 

Belittling of people in meetings and in the open plan office for all to see is a daily occurrence and in fact promoted. Staff roles and responsibilities are changed depending on who is currently in favor which seems to bypass contractual and HR intervention. Strong blame culture.

The high turnover and exodus of staff appears to not concern the CIO or Human resources.  In 25 years of working in Finance IT this is by far the worst managed infrastructure department I have ever worked in."

I was embarrassed to represent this team and thus my decision to leave. Some members of management at the highest level have openly admitted to enjoying seeing aggressive behaviour within the wider team as they feel it makes the team stronger.  The management team although very capable are chosen from a cookie cutter.  If you are not white or male do not expect to move up in this chaotic environment as the ideals of the top dog have been passed down to the next level to uphold. The department overall is one where if you speak your mind you will be belittled until you are fired or forced to quit. There is an extremely high staff turnover in IT Infrastructure.

As ever there is an innate snobbery associated with some parts of the Investment Management culture.
The reciprocity of loyalty to the employee is questionable, as evidenced by their willingness to dispose of loyal hard-working veteran employees who no longer fit the current culture with extraordinary lack of sensitivity. (But would you expect anything different anywhere?)"

The business works hard at putting on social events & getting employees across disciplines to interact, share time & ideas, even contribute something to society via charity or volunteering. A positive work environment is reflected in a fairly successful & happy work force. Compensation is decent but not the highest in the industry. Bonuses are OK, though not always based on absolute merit. Bonuses are rarely in the form of equity/options unless you're middle/top management which is unusual in finance. Vacation increases with length of service & is a decent to good allocation p.a. The company is global with many offices in varied geographies and the occasional opportunity to move country/job which is rewarding for both career & personal development.","Almost constant restructuring over time, often repeating structures/business plans as they go in & out of fashion. This destabilizes the confidence of employees. Top management & HR are unaware/inactive when (in rare cases) middle management acts poorly or treats subordinates unprofessionally, often taking years to fix problems and/or waiting for employee turnover to fix the issue.

at their behavior tho. it was a good riddance.

 I cannot comment about other departments but the IT dept. at Schroders is run
by incompetent and whimsical people . The HR department is completely subservient to managers
with no say of its own. Even the most senior management in IT is unresponsive and total waste.
 The mind of this firm is very narrow and conservative - salary is one of the reflection of it. I also witnessed some nepotism I'm my department .
