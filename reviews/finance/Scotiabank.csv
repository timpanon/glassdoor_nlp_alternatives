Training focused on soft skills, no real training on products or systems. The what and how of your role are expected to be picked up through trial and error... with clients!! I understand that this may sound like i'm the problem but the issue truly is the lack of training. There is no clear answer for any system or product questions and I understand why they recommend you just jump in and learn on the job-it's faster that way. Unfortunately, that means that you look like a fool in front of clients a lot and have to learn to bs people so that you can buy yourself more time to figure out how to best help them.

No proper training system in place but are monitored as if you received the information you needed to properly perform your job from the moment you start. Upper management/executives/HR horribly out of touch with how ground floor operations actually work which impact many functions of day-to-day operations. Stats used for performance reviews/salary increase considerations/bonus considerations are not relevant to someones actual performance on the job (on the service side) - ex. survey goes out asking customers to rate scotiabank as a whole after service, however internally is is a rating of the individual employee that helped them, and as you can imagine there are many people who simply hate banks scoring 1/10 which has nothing to do with employees servicing capabilities.

1080,,GWRT: small teams + old infrastructure + messy management = burnout,2021-08-24,1.0,Software Engineer Specialist,Easily recognized company across the globe.,"Everyone was part of multiple projects, so multitasking created little delivery throughput.
Tight regulatory deadlines on a project with old technologies whose original team had left. This lead to insane overtime for the two devs and two BAs working on the SIDAC Brexit project, because we had to reverse engineer the existing solution to build the knowledge from scratch. These deadlines were never discussed with the developers, and giving an assessment was nigh impossible due to the lack of knowledge.
Disregard for the mental and physical wellbeing of the team when put through the 2 month+ crunch period.
Unattentive management that would not listen to alerts from the devs when a possible showstopper was found.
Devs work on BAU, projects, production support, and side work that was unaccounted for, which meant little chance to focus.
Over time was encouraged, then expected, and finally enforced, when the deadlines were not met.
Requests to move to a different project are seldom listened to.
HR is not aware of these operational exploitation situations, so they can
Understaffed infrastructure team would create bottlenecks in the projects, at the cost of its members sleep and vacation.
Little architectural oversight lead to software solutions that derailed from the bigger picture.
Old technologies, such as Java 6, shell scripts for ETLs, out-of-support software and hardware meant that, on top of all the regular BAU, project, and support work, devs would need to coordinate migration projects to newer technologies, which are already outdated at the moment, just to comply with the bare minimum standards.
High turnover rate due to the aforementioned circumstances and work environment.
No opportunities to learn from other teams' strategies or internal knowledge bases, as well as no time to do courses for personal and professional growth within the offered platforms.

All of these observations apply to the Colombia office, as well as the Toronto and SIDAC/BNSL offices. I saw teams working every day 12h+ shifts across the board (talking to team members at 4PM EST meant the UK team was working till 10PM GMT)."

-The medical benefits are pretty good.","I'm going to make this as objective as possible. I'm not sure what aspect of this job is the worst but overall, it's pretty terrible from top to bottom. The salaries are so low it's pathetic. The recruiter that hired me was gracious enough to start my wage at 19.74/h and after a year of employment, I got a raise of 7 cents per hour. It isn't just customer service reps that don't get paid well, it's everybody underneath directors. When I say everybody, I mean literally everybody. Analysts clear a little under $1500 bi-weekly, HR recruiters make roughly 60-63k/year and that's an entry level position that commands years of experience and a high level of education to get into. For reference, the person that hired me has a masters degree in HR, has almost 4 years of recruiting experience and makes 60,995/year. Any HR position available in the government, big pharma, or the tech industry pays a 60% premium on these roles. Unless you get into IT at Scotia, just don't bother. The wages are terrible.

Getting promoted is exceedingly difficult. If you're unlucky enough to get hired in the contact centre, management will move you around, keep your wage the same and give you more responsibility. 

This phrase is said so often it's just a cliché but it's true: ""it's not what you know it's who you know"". The end game is extracting the most amount of work from people while keeping the costs as low as possible. Scotiabank is the Nike factory of banks. Customer service, revolving credit, consultant roles (essentially supervisors), loans department and collections are all outsourced roles spread across Colombia, Mexico, and the Dominican Republic. 

Management...I don't even seriously know where to start. There are roughly 9 managers on the floor at the campus I work out of and 2 of them are good, helpful people. The rest micromanage their teams to the point where staff is just discouraged and have crippled morale. How many times per week can a person be spoken to about how many literal seconds they were in aftercall work prior to taking their break? 

This is the reality of working at scotiabank in the capacity I work in as a customer service rep; right now, I'm supposed to be working but I called in sick. I hate everything about my job. I don't have a single colleague that likes their job here, and I've only spoken to one person that is satisfied in their current role who also coincidentally told me that ""it's not what you know, it's who you know"". I had the pleasure of speaking to him while I was reversing an NSF fee he was charged. If you can avoid Scotia, then do so. Actually, if you can avoid working any entry level position in any bank, then avoid it. They're all trash. When I say ""entry level"" I mean anything from business analyst, HR recruiter, but ESPECIALLY customer service."
1320,,Great place to work,2021-06-18,5.0,Financial Planner,"Flexible work schedule, a high degree of autonomy, great support structures.",Tendency towards internal competition. Client experience will differ dramatically depending upon the channel they use to engage the bank.

- No blame culture, retrosprective meetings with lots of chances to speak up your concerns
- good salary, over the average in Colombia
- writing this review during worktime.","- They have lots of automation tools, but still story mapping and requirements process are VERY POOR, building new features is a pain, BAs are not fully aware of their duties so you have to define features in the middle of a sprint. Could be just my project tho, but still bad.

- There's no motivation for going extra mile, managers prefer that you complete tickets before deadline and no more, also very tricky to finish on time poorly defined features you never now when you are really done.

- I am in a project with react front-end that is like the old west, everyone shoots on sight and we have similar modules with very different implementations for the same things so feels like there's no standard at all.

- The poor analysis also derives in a poor assignment of tickets when several people end up working in the same feature.

- Before start coding you have to ask several questions for tickets because there are no detail at all, and BAs just share links to another tickets instead of provide the info and thats for bug-tickets, for features it's even worse."

Took a 10k pay cut from my last job which was less demanding. Calls are none stop. Advancement to higher roles does not increase pay. Software for doing job is slow, error prone, makes job difficult, and since call time factored into your merger bonus, you are punished for poorly functioning applications. You are expected to reference dozens of resources that are shared on multiple different platforms and are given no time to review or organize them. Customers are always angery, which seems to be by design. Seemingly arbitrary changes to customer's services in order to change them more in fees result in demands for refunds which I suspect is the desired outcome in order to offer more products and services. I could go on but what's the point this job stinks.

I feel spoiled because I actually had a good job before covid. Way too many lifers at this job who are clueless to how overworked and underpaid they are. Actively looking for something else and will quit with zero regrets."

With that, one needs to be more careful in verifying customers in cases of fraud, or account takeovers as they are more of a threat than most people believe.

They wouldn’t cover my regular checkup at the optometrist for some reason and I was then out $200.","Low pay for the market. Gender inequality-Found out that many of the women get paid less than men for the same positions (Found out a much younger guy with no experience at all makes $7000 more a year than me). High stress-deal with a lot of complaints/maintenance, a ton of pressure to get sales, “good” clients are often given to higher advisors making it difficult for new advisors to reach goals, the way to achieve goals is not balanced based on how much work you do, but how much money the client has (for example, one advisor may have one client with $200,000 to invest and they meet their goal for 2 weeks while another advisor gets 25 clients with only $100 to invest but they don’t even reach their goal for one week). The amount of effort is very uneven. The low pay and meetings that make you feel bad in front of everyone if you don’t meet your weekly goal are demoralizing and doesn’t make you want to do more. Best to look for a job that pays at market for the same work. Training is non existent. It’s all about talking to clients and making them happy, nothing about how to actually do the job and process paperwork. Other advisors often steal your sales, but management ignores this. Often expected to bend over backwards and give up our lunch/breaks to get sales."

 Once you are in, you want to run. If you just come out of college looking for new job, go elsewhere.","- People are like ignorant school boys and don't know what they are doing. The lack of knowledge about their fields is simply appalling.
- People simply slack in their work. Bunch of lazy folks chitchatting who do not have any motivation to work for a broken company. People came late and left office at 3-4pm. At 5pm the office is pretty much 80% empty, which is just unheard of!
- Abuse of work-from-home (before COVID-19) as a way to hide from their work and responsibilities.
- Management is a joke and totally incompetent. They don't know how to manage people. Sometimes you think you could be a better manager yourself. They don't reward your merits for sure and fire people when they get angered at your good suggestions. In fact, they all need to get fired.
- Strong smell of discriminatory practices against certain people and races.
- Pay is utterly horrible and unforgivable as compared to other competitors.
- It's a retirement home when you have no one else hiring you and you are already in your 50's having no other choices to make your ends meet.
- Bad everything. Do not work there. It was my total regret to have joined the company years ago in the first place. I got a much much better job since then!"

4.- Company cares about the diversity","1.- The bank cancel projects all the time that affect your personal objectives, therefore, the employer won't pass the annual evaluation affecting the incentives/bonus.
2.- employees always strive to complete the work and the bank always changes the rules of the game without warning affecting schedule, budget and time.
3.- Worst salary in the market
4.- The directors do not make an additional effort to advocate for the work of their employees.
5.- nobody cares about your ideas because the only thing that matters is the bank's reputation, and you will hear it all the time."

- Salaries are based on on 'Level system' which is common for banks but the system is completely unbalanced  which result in very non-competitive salaries for most positions.
- As mush as there is room to grow, there is also a lot of employee turn-over due to the lack of job security (Casual positions) and non-competitive salaries.
- It can take years before going from Casual to Full-time permanent which only then allows you to obtain benefits, vacations and job security.
- Upper management (VP's, Directors) tend to give the illusion of willingness to improve upon these cons but fail to deliver.

It was nice for a few years or so, but not anymore.

- They completely ran out of the office space. Heard the CEO talking about 350 people at Digital Factory on TV? That's how it was designed to be. And now double that number. There's 2 categories of people - those who joined DF early and claimed their seats/desks and new joiners who don't have that ""luxury"". You would think that having a desk and at least one extra screen for a developer (or any role, really) is the least employers can do, but none of the new joiners get that. If you join now you will end up working from a cafeteria or just sitting in the hallway with a laptop on your knees hurting your back while being surrounded by a bunch of people as if you are sitting in the middle of the St. Lawrence market on Sunday. To be fair if you work there long enough to see somebody from your team leave - you can try to claim ""dead man's"" seat. Nice, eh.
- Very noisy environment. Which is caused by the overpopulation of the space. It's impossible to book a meeting room and people are forced to have ""meetings"" right at their desks.
- They completely banned GitHub in the whole bank not realizing that the world runs on the back of the Open Source software. If you actively deal with Open Source tech - try to code for a day without being able even to browse GitHub and see how it goes for you. But then the management said that we had to compete with the Big Tech who's running full speed into the banking space. See the problem here?
- Their food is some cheap processed junk 50% of the time. Digital Factory is located quite far from the downtown core and there is no food courts around to buy food from. They have their own cafeteria that feeds you with a bunch of carbs at a discount. You'll have to cook unless you want to eat that."

I was lucky to work at a branch with a fun work environment and made friends with my co-workers. Starting out as a CSR was a really good opportunity that taught me a lot of essential skills. In addition, the company would be more than happy to help you climb the ladder if you show interest.","The new management system they had around the time I left was very frustrating. The work schedules were very unfavourable. You’d work weird hours like 11-2pm sometimes or 1-5pm.  So it’s hard to get another part time job as the work hours are awkward. It’s also hard to get more work hours as that’s one of the company’s focus on cutting. They try to run lean on staff and it can be really stressful if you’re working at a busy branch. Due to those reasons and more, there’s always a high turnover. Then again it’s more of an entry level temp job."

2. Opportunity to grow as a manager and learn about banking
3. there is lots of data here
4. great opprotunity to network among other data scientist within the bank and in Toronto area","No technical direction 
examples: 
1. in less than 5 years,  SVP position has changed 3 times, reorg happens every 8-12 months
2. the bank is hella confused on tech stack.  we've been switching priorities between on prem and cloud (the usual providers) for a long time, and no one really cares what  happens 
2. projects are too simple, you won't gain any technical skills
3. most data scientist are not part of an P&L business line therefore whatever you work on will probably never be productionized or used by anyone. ie mostly for show
3. they block github, and don't give the necessary tools to do our work (slack, VMs, gpus, python3, external apis/tools, dual monitors, decent coffee machine)
4. security and privacy is slow, leadership is old and doesn't understand the needs of a younger customer base and a younger workforce
5. pay is too low, salary adjustments are 1/2 of  inflation, hr doesn't understand that our roles are very high in demand, so we have a lot of attrition
6. old tech stacks are being used still, there is no clear direction to upgrade or migrate to 21st century tools.  The bank has too many employees (like 80k-100K) and too many divisions, to even consider an overall tech revamp/implementation
7. its slow, its a bank what'd you expect, but its nice that the slowness can allow a lot reflection time and personal+independent development 
8. Scotia does not care about the environment, we still use plastic dipped coffee cups and waste tons of paper
9. no career growth for a technical role unless you are willing to switch to a management role (director/vp)"

In the last five years, multiple shifts in management, as well as a drive to lower costs everywhere have created a toxic stew of too much work needed too quickly with not enough people or money to do it.  Management seeks to cut costs by clawing back bonuses, benefits, pensions, and everything - rather than reporting a loss for a quarter or two and fixing the systemic problems that abound everywhere.  

The result is a very high turnover rate, with many staff teetering on full burn-out - and NOBODY enjoys their jobs anymore.  The expectation is work yourself to death for a compensation package that is higher anywhere else on the street, and an environment filled with backstabbers, cliques, and pettiness.

Also being one of the worst paying banks, it's easier to hire qualified immigrants (but with no Canadian experience) since it's tough (money wise) to steal from the competitors.

Benefits are good - 4 weeks of vacation for level 8, 3 personal days, 5 sick days, an okay insurance coverage.

Good work/life balance, most people work from 8:30 to 5 pm and are not expected to work after hours. From level 9 (director) up things are slightly different.

Lots of women in leadership position","Scotia is massive with lots of different areas. Expect to encounter different cultures within different areas of the bank. Lots of gossip, and unfortunately some senior management incentivise that, by asking around people's opinions on their peers!

Pace is slow, very slow. Overall the bank is very risk avoider, so decision making is hard and lengthy.

Progressing in the career is also though. Ambition is not really expected and though there are tons of jobs posted daily, applying online doesn't really get you anywhere, so you need to do a lot of networking and get a direct referral / introduction to the job poster.  

Pay is worse than other banks. Base bonus for level 8 is 12% (the actual can be more dependent on performance)."

Most of the time they don't have a valid reason for doing so.   It's not like they have a doctor's appointment or anything they need to take care at home.  They make it a routine to take 2 to 3 days work from home every week.  That's quite outrageous and their boss won't care.   Worst thing is it's very clear they are doing much less on those days.

Big focus on ethics and respect for your coworkers.  You won't find any unprofessional behavior here and if you do those who are acting disrespectfully are fired.  Managers sit next to employees and aren't on a power trip. Great place to start a career as there are many smart and professional people who care about your growth and success both inside the company and your own professional development.  Very mature business processes and exposure to how a leading company does things.  Processes are very mature and optimized.","Open concept workplace so makes it hard to really feel like you have your own cubicle where you can personalize and make it feel more like home.  The office I worked from was very sterile meaning it was very corporate and lacked any type of character.  You have a very small and basic lunch area, no free snacks offered even on fridays, basic tea/coffee/refrigerator set up.  The open concept takes time getting used to as you have no privacy and when people are on calls you can hear everything.  Meeting rooms also have no privacy they are pure glass.

A little more flexibility to work from home would be nice especially because of the lower Manhattan location is hard to get to unless you live in immediate New York City area. 

The bank has HQ in Toronto so hiring and onboarding is extremely slow for U.S. employees.  Can take a few weeks just to receive laptop, monitors, phone, etc.  In the meantime you have to try to stay busy and not looking bored."

1. Lack of training required to do your work as expected by management. 3 months of training which mostly involves role play calls and little experience doing the actual work. When I asked if I could shadow someone on the job to learn the process I was told that I should know how to do it and if not, to go back and read the Job Aids (it's like reading a dictionary). 

2. Promotions have nothing to do with merit or performance. I was told by interviewers when applying for a promotion that there is a lot to consider when hiring someone, particularly the number of men and women in branch so they will look for who fits in the branch at that time. 

3. Be ready for a zero accountability workplace. Tasks will be reassigned and passed through multiple hands before reaching someone who will finally action it. No one is willing to take the responsibility of requests and will hand it off at any given opportunity. 

4. If you have a concern, keep it to yourself. The human resources department is only there for show. They will listen to your concern regardless of the validity and take no action to improve your situation. My religion was openly mocked in front of my colleagues. When I raised this concern with the department, after an ""extensive investigation"" they said it was a ""harmless joke"" and that was the end of it. In fact, they were asking me what I did to make him say something like that.

Sales staff regularly fabricate leads because of the pressure to present something in these rallies, then sit in empty offices making phone calls the rest of the day. 

Managers openly gossip about absent or former employees with new and current staff, exposing personal and confidential topics related to employment records. I guess Scotia has not been sued in this area yet. They'll surely get around to correcting these confidentiality breaches after a lawsuit.

The system is filled with many unacknowledged glitches, which you need to sit through smiling like an imbecile while you try to call help desks that do not answer their phones! The only alternative is to excuse yourself and hope that you can find someone in the branch who’s figured out a workaround.

Rewards for movies and junk food are not competitive with what the big 4 banks are offering, and attract a lower demographic than is needed to provide the large amounts of  investment cash required by financial advisors to meet high sales targets.

Increasing Holidays over time","Below standard pay - usually around 20% lower for the same work at other companies
Income freezing - They have set maximum incomes for certain positions and once you hit them you will not receive any increase until they change that maximum. They only review the max every 5 years.
Changing benefits - They keep changing your benefits. Latest change will remove health benefits from retirees if they retire after 2019, and I will have 5 years left before I can retire. They also removed early retirement last year, so you have to work until 65 in order to get your pension.
Buddy Benefit - Your director and manager pick your raise and bonus at the end of the year, so you better be on their good side or you'll not get a raise or decent bonus.

4249,,"The company’s fine, but management isn’t",2018-01-15,2.0,CSO,Upward mobility ...after 6-18 months though.,"I worked at the CCC, and like all call centre jobs, it’s difficult, and emotionally and physically strenuous. They assign teams depending on your hours. I was supposed to be with one manager, but ended up being manager-less for about 3 months into employment due to some mixup with management. But it didn’t matter so much to me because I loved working at Scotiabank and would come early and stay late just to learn more! Then, when I got my manager, everything changed. She was the worst. She had this god-complex – an “I’m better than you” persona – and was extremely manipulative. She picked favourites, and didn’t bother connecting with you if you weren’t her favourite. She didn’t bother teaching you, but would sit there silently judging you. Moreover, my hours of work conflicted greatly with hers and the rest of the team’s, so naturally I wasn’t apart of any team meetings. I was kept out of the loop. There wasn’t any support and her advice conflicted with other managers’ advice, which she ended up overriding. For example, (since our schedules didn’t match up, this happened often) if CCC needed to make a correction on a cx’s account for an amount greater than $150, a manager has to approve it. One manager told me to submit a ticket and assured me it will get approved l to ensure the cx is happy, but once my manager came into work the next day, she immediately declined it saying this is a branch matter, and the branch manager responded back saying this is a CCC role. The branch was right and my manager was wrong; but she still wouldn’t approve the request to rightfully refund. (Note: if you work at a CCC, be prepared to go back and forth with branch representatives on what is a branch-only request and CCC-only request.) This issue ultimately led to two things 1) me to calling back the cx with the bad news, and putting a bad impression on Scotiabank all because of my managers unwillingness to budge and 2) put a bad impression on Scotiabank from an employer/employee relationship standpoint. Finally, along with being kept out of the loop, not feeling like a team, facing extreme levels of stress on your own, poor management, a constant back-and-forth with branches, be prepared for strict policies (eg. can’t keep cx on hold for more than 2mins, and how that will affect your bonus), poor wages ($17.77/hr is not enough to deal with this!), poor benefits, no unionization, disorganized envioronment, but also a stressful environment going against HR policies. For instance, I got in trouble by that same manager for using the washroom for 3-4 minutes. It was embarrassing that I had to break it down for her that getting up and walking to the  washroom from my desk took 1 minute, finding a clean stall and using the washroom in a hurry took 2 minutes, washing hands took 30 seconds, and running back to my seat took another 45seconds-1 minute. She did not care. This poor-excuse-of-a-manager only cares about the numbers and NOT the people. If you’re supposed to be on the phone for 8hrs a day, then that’s it. No time for drinking water or going to the washroom. She overworked me, took advantage, and was extremely manipulative (even if you have 5 sick days, you better bring a doctors note! Even if you have something as simple as a fever/cold and don’t usually go to the doc’s for that). She was a bully. And she was the reason I faked an excuse and quit a few days before completing my 6 month probation. She made an already-stressful job unbearable."

4301,,terrible training!!,2017-12-04,1.0,Financial Advisor Trainee,sundays off so you can spend time with family.,"i have worked at Applewood mississauga branch and Westwood Mall Mississauga branch. 

Terrible training. you are given 4 months of reading to be followed by 2 months of job shadowing. Managers have no idea of the training program, because they were trained differently 100 years ago. they are not updated by headoffice how new recruits are to be trained. at my first location, manager told me to read the materials. Applewood is primarily a mature branch = where most clients are older clients, with existing accounts, mortgages, lines of credit etc. there was hardly any new accounts opening. i was told to job shadow but those would have been about complicated matters such as mortgage and estate planning, so you cant job shadow those until you have read the material related to them in your 3/4th month. 3 months in the training, i got transferred to Westwood Mall in July which was peak season for intl students in the area. here the scene was opposite. there were myriads of students accounts and credit cards - so many that the months of july and august were primary spent on students accounts opening - almost 4-5 per day. entry level recruits were given students accounts. after the student rush went down, i was told to catch up with my training - then they advised me to find out from other advisors who were available each day so i could job shadow them. but advisors were busy meeting their targets. every day meetings would get cancelled, and advisors are not good trainers because they have enough on their plates to meet weekly/monthly targets. some advisors often made up meetings and agenda in the morning meetings, because they were already many years into their work, their agenda in the mornings were not exactly matched. managers did not play any role in training. 

cronysm - one advisor got hired after me through his sister who was at another branch. and i found out he was given a dedicated advisor to train him while i did not get the same, although i had joined 3 months before him and, of course, i did not have a bro or a sis in the bank.

hazards if being team player - if u, the recruit, think u r gonna get brownie points by going the extra mile and doing something else to help the manager(s) which is not in your training plan, in the end it will bite you. stick to your training plan. if managers ask for favours and tell you take customers, you have to say NO. being nice and a ""yes"" person in such environment will only get you kicked out later, because you would be sacrificing your own goals to help the branch with their issues, which do not matter to you."

Job can become monotonous once you've been there 6+ months and get the hang of things. A lot of taking the same types of calls and answering the same issues over and over all day long.

The leadership program, specifically in terms of curriculum,  was probably amongst the best in the industry.","As a large organization, experiences can vary by a very significant variance between teams, business units, organizations and business lines.  Some organizations within the bank prize initiative while others want drones.   Some require teamwork while others (inadvertently) emphasize individual effort at the expense of co-workers.

When goals go up significantly without any increase in pay, its the same as a paycut. The incentive pay is a joke, especially when its near impossible to reach the required sales.

Theres zero pressure to actually get anything done.,"The job is simply not what was advertised. The Digital Factory (DF) was sold to me as an innovation hub where a honed agile process rapidly generated world class solutions which were iterated on. 

The reality is that the agile process is pure theatre, most of the scrum masters are very weak and lots of the employees are not even familiar with basic agile practises. The DF is beholden to the larger bank so the release cycle is too long to do any real iterative development anyway. Another result of this relationship between DF and the bank is that basically nothing gets released, you are essentially building prototypes to the whims of whichever scotia exec is sponsoring your team at that moment (expect the sponsor, and therefore your requirements, to change pretty regularly).

As nothing gets released theres no sense of satisfation in a job well done, on the plus side, there are no real deadlines, just do as much work as you want! Gets old though."

Top yearly bonus only 1 of 1000 people get, in yearly review, or know the right people.

TD and RBC are in their mature years hence they hesitate to provide too much perks that people can take advantage because it boils down to COST. It's a reduction to their profit if they try to cater great value rewards to millions of their customers, but with BNS, being the third in rank,it has still so much room to develop and reach that top spot in the long run. As for CIBC and BMO, they are way too far behind the BIG 3 to be compared with RBC, TD and BNS. Plus paywise, I kid you not, BNS has the better pay. Because I've applied at TD and CIBC just for the sake of wondering if they'd offer a better pay, TD pay is really bad CIBC is way better than TD but Scotia still beats it. I can't tell for BMO and RBC as I have not been successful to get to the job offer part in my applications with them. I wouldn't betray BNS though. It has proven me that working in the Alberta area, i don't have to kiss anyone's butt just to be promoted. I got promoted in less than a year, because of exceeding my targets immensely. Training program of BNS is absolutely the best thing that happened to BNS. Almost all the best performing Financial Advisors in Alberta are those who have gone through the rigorous training where only the best trainees gets to be successfully become Financial Advisors. It's been a pivotal component in stepping to the role when you've been prepared and have learned the fundamentals of what your work would look like.","Long Term Disability benefit!

Their model is ridiculous as you have to know the CEM, do the appointment interview, the full CIS and total view, you will always be asked as of why you didn't get more business from the original reason and it's all about pushing into the digital channels and you are expected to stay extra hours because you have to do the Mopping Tomorrow

As a new Financial Advisor you are expected to retain everything you learn, go the extra mile, be really aggressive with your attitude , you will have to report to your in branch coach, learning facilitator, call instructor and you will be given all kinds of centralized opportunities from customers who only have one product and you will have to proof the bank that you can sell at least 2-3 more products (go figure, you just started yet they so expect you to know all their products and services. Good luck learning everything involved in a STEP restructure)

If you have your PFP/CFP and think you will be doing financial planning good luck as they are so pushy with lending and if your branch is on the ""wave"" a fully qualified Senior FA will spend 2-3 hours in cash as a teller or with the iPad helping the line up

 - shoddy starting salary

 - overly crowded 3rd and 4th floors with nearly constantly busy washrooms = no personal space, even on breaks. Isles where staff is situated often too narrow with people constantly bumping the backs of other employees' chairs - most annoying.

 - being blown on full throttle by air conditioning from fall through winter!??

 - constant petty rules (2 separate 5-digit codes to enter into phone when first logging on in the morning, as well as umpteen other passwords and codes to enter when logging in to desktop programs and when stepping away from desk)

 - way too many nosy supervisors (which, I'm guessing is largely why the starting salaries for new hires is ridiculously low and not ""at par"" with other major banks)  who all way over micro-manage (mine would actually call me whenever I was running late - something I'd never experienced in ANY OTHER WORKPLACE!) Felt more like I was back in elementary school!?? These many supervisors could often be seen giggling and engaging in non-work-related ""gab fests"" while the ""underlings"" had to have ""nose to the grindstone.""

 - you are required to open a Scotia bank account for direct deposit of pay. So in my case, every pay day, I had to first go to Scotia to withdraw 500/day of pay (that was my daily maximum allowed for withdrawal) and then deposit it to my primary bank.

They truly believe in qualifying the advisor by using constant requirements for continued education. Excellent product suite and very good departmentalization support (for units dedicated for employee support) Decent pay, but not the best. Managers are usually a wealth of experience (could be good and bad)","A huge disconnect between the pay scales for the levels of job. Seniority does play a role, but the jobs are very similar. Extremely unrealistic performance metrics. Sure, your a Financial Advisor (salesman/lady) and your job is to sell. Terrible amounts of cold calling (don't let them tell you its a warm call they are only kidding themselves) Goals and metrics based on how/if/when your customers use mobile/online banking. Yes they give you targets on ""demonstrating"" how to use non-branch banking options. And your either clawed back or rewarded based on If that customer uses the non-branch solution. Not to mention your customers also have to ""use"" their product prior to you receiving full credit for your sale.(not commission, but tracked sales) They use a tactic for customer experience by calling a recent visited customer to complete a survey on how their experience was. Problem is that they use way too small of a sample size for these goals/actuals to be a true reflection, and the output effects your Annual Appraisal as a branch, which we all share whether its good or bad. Dog eat Dog with other advisors and VERY clicky (watch where you plant your flag) There is not an open door with the manager regardless of what they say. You even ""get in trouble"" for calling HR with your concern before consulting your manager. No transparency at all.

But goodluck getting time off to visit the doctor!,"Seems like the only folks willing to take (and remain) in these positions at Scotiabank are young folks undecided in life that get sold a dream that if they work hard they will rise to a position actually worth being there. This is partially true but totally not worth the pittance of a pay you receive for said hard work.

The pay is REALLY LOW! REALLLLLLLLLLYYYYYYY LOW! You cannot have a family to support, bills to pay, goals of saving money while working here! It is almost impossible. Even overtime is paid at the same base rate as your regular hours. Is that legal?

BUT, if your dream job is sales, then go for it!

This job is more about sales of products and services than transactional processing. But its not commissioned based, so forget about being duly compensated for bringing in new business.

Also there is a trickle down effect of pressure where the lower staff members are often aggressively intimidated by management to work harder to keep branch numbers where they should be. Scotiabank Trinidad has no union, so management can practically do what they want...invent new rules by the day, and you HAVE to follow it. or else...

It is a tense, strict and micromanaged place to work. And I would not recommend working there as a lower-level employee."

Scotia is a huge company, but this role is back office, which is lowest on the totem pole and Scotia cares about us the least.  So there is room for movement within back office positions, but if you want to transition to middle or front, this isn't a great place to start."

3. They offer you a slightly lower salary than what they mention in the interview.
4. When you try to negotiate regarding the salary, they do not respond, but rather they make an offer to another candidate. So, Scotiabank offers the same position to two (or more) different candidates, a dishonest practice.
5. After making an offer, Scotiabank can come back to you later and say that the offer is rescinded, no discussion permitted, and that the position has been given to someone else. Whether or not you have already made plans to relocate or to quit your job or turned down other opportunities does not matter to Scotiabank.
6. Scotiabank does not offer pharmacy insurance to employees in the first year, even though the Ontario provincial insurance plan does not cover prescription medications, and it is standard in Ontario for a business, particularly a huge one like Scotiabank, to offer pharmacy insurance.

It's quite unfortunate the way the bank and the industry as a whole has changed, but the fact of the matter is that financial advisors are not advisors at all. They are told to sell pretty much anything and everything regardless of the client's financial situation. Case in point: all clients are ""supposed"" to have a travel credit card, and a cash back card. Aren't most Canadians over indebted?!? isn't debt reduction a more important goal? Also,creditor insurance on most products is not only a complete waste, it's also very likely that it will never get paid out because the underwriting is done post-claim. Any advisor that sells balance insurance on a credit card is taking you for a ride. In terms of managers, there are very few good ones around. I've seen multiple coworkers break down in tears from the stress, training is sink or swim, computer systems are always crashing, pay is always below market reference, back-office support staff was phased out so now you're doing even more paperworker. I also question how a manager that has received a multitude of employee complaints, tanked a branch that was at the top of its district for years and seen a turnover of 90% of her sales team, can still manage to retain a job and be a leader.

The managers want just to move forward in their careers, running after bigger salaries, don't care about the employees who really work hard for small salaries. Too many changes, employees leaving the bank being unhappy and stressed out. In my branch, half of the old and experienced staff  quit because of the bad and new management.

- People here are very helpful and actually take time for their team mates, if you're lucky enough to find a good team.
- Management is generally more caring than most places. They understand if you're late from time to time or if you are just having a bad day. It is very relaxed here.","- It is a political minefield here. Everywhere you step, something will go boom. You cannot trust anyone here as everyone will probably have an ulterior motive. 
- Development is completely in your own hands. If you want to move up, be ready to do all the dirty work yourself. Don't count on any help or guidance from the management team.
- Expectations for numbers is very high however, they sugar coat it. ""Numbers don't matter as long as you are following the Call Flow Model"". At the end of the day, this is BS. Numbers do matter as only those who hit all the targets get the higher rating, and hence higher bonus and more opportunity to advance their career.

MANAGEMENT

-Management is a huge problem, from managers sitting there on facebook/having loud conversations with employees while others are on calls/working to simply throwing you under the bus when it comes to taking criticisms (ex. one of their employees needs to be trained on something, but they take it as a personal attack, clients don't get great service and analyst keeps making the same mistake).
-spend a lot of time micromanaging analysts that do better than most, instead of managing those that aren't pulling their weight
-Worse thing about management is that they make promises but never do anything. Currently part time, however instead of hiring me as fulltime, they've decided to hire several new analysts through contracts (and they've hired several previously while I was partime) when it makes more sense to increase the hours given to someone who has already worked the job and as per reviews one of the top people there
-They promised another analyst that if he worked lateshift it would work to his benefit to get fulltime with Scotiabank, instead after a getting an extension on his contract he was forced to find another position because they wouldn't hire him fulltime.
- Management takes credit for all these statistical improvements, when really it simply a matter of hiring more employees(half of them are not even the right ones) because they were extremely understaffed before (department went from 20 employees to 41 at last count)"

Pay for performance is not correlated, there are many true stories of millions of dollars worth of business being landed, and the compensation/recognition in return being petty, as in ""here's a coffee mug"" petty. The company does not appreciate good work. The command and control structure creates a negative environment at the branch level. Managers and staff are unable to act on local market situations because of the layers of restrictive bureaucracy.  Technology is very outdated, computers still used windows 95 until recently (now XP). Financial planning software can barely load on the hardware provided. Paperwork and software processes are unreliable, tedious and reduce efficiency. The company is restructuring, eliminating support jobs, moving the work load to remaining staff without increase in compensation.

Do read them. Management issues, old guard, no innovation, shabby offices, low pay, etc... Essentially, a few rich dictators taking advantage of the working class - and that working class is different than in any other bank. 

On the surface, seems great that Scotia is such a great multi-cultural employer but the new immigrants are taken advantage of. Some are very skilled and working for peanuts. Look at those comments by happy employees - see the trend in spelling/grammar errors by those with English as a second language?  They are happily oblivious to what good employers look like in Toronto. Glad they have personally advanced. Knew many who worked so hard to get educated and immigrate. Just hope they don't stay in Scotia long...God forbid they become one of the lifers. Just compare - visit a Scotia, BMO, CIBC, TD and RBC branch in your hood.

Looks great on your resume, great stepping stone to a lot of things. Everyone is always helpful. You are encouraged to take part in extra-curricular activities, have a good work/life balance. The culture and environment will obviously be different from branch to branch.","Lots of paperwork! But that would be the same with every bank. The pay is not that high compared to a similar job in a non-bank company, but you get job security with the bank, well atleast if you perform. There is pressure to perform, numbers matter, but thats universal. Training is mostly on the job, so it can be challenging.

Management was inconsistent - managers weren't hired because of their management abilities but because it is the next step in career progress after Financial Advisors - so 1 manager was awesome, approachable, friendly, and another was mean, belittling, and would micromanage the hell out of us.
I was encouraged to downplay the good, basic accounts like regular chequing or No-Fee Visas and focus on ""upselling"" more expensive banking products even to people who didnt need them."

6013,,Horrible Experience,2012-01-06,1.0,Product Manager,Job stability - Only bank that didn't lay off employees during recent downturn.  The organization does have alot of long term and very committed employees.,"Not a dynamic organization.  If your bright and show initiative you will not fit in here.  All decisions are made at the very top levels and the other 99% of employees are expected to be mediocre, yes men.  The organization is very hierarchical and clique.  Only the ""chosen"" few get career opportunities, and merit seems to actually work against you when it comes to career opportunities.  The ""chosen"" seem to regularly move to areas of the business that they have zero knowledge, which can be very frustrating for people working under the ""chosen"".  Company is embarrassingly cheap.  Has the shabbiest, most dated decor and salaries are much lower than any of the other major banks."
