They’ve repeatedly used mass layoffs to balance the books and don't have any problem using the livelihoods of their people in order to meet arbitrary projections for an arbitrary date. In so doing they’ve destroyed their culture and employees trust. They also suffer from a very inefficient organizational structure, wasteful spending, declining revenues and gross misallocation of resources.  The company stock is down over 45% in the last 12 months and over 10% in 2019, and we’re not even through the first quarter.  Let’s face it, companies come and go.  It’s a simple part of the overall business cycle.  Businesses are born, they age, and eventually die off.  SG is in the dying off phase.

172,,They're going out of business but just don't know it yet,2018-08-22,1.0,Business Analyst,None. This is not hyperbole,"This review will focus on their FCM business in Chicago as this is the area I worked in, however the comments in general are relevant to all areas of the organization mainly because the issues at this company are widespread and encompass all business lines.

The morale in the company is at an all time low. It’s truly like a ticking time bomb. You never know when the next round of layoffs will be, but rest assured there will be more.  I am sure the vast majority of employees are searching for job.  

Management is basically inept and at the ready to layoff employees as soon as the slightest dip in earnings occurs.  In other words they'll layoff people purely to make quarterly numbers.  Several months later the positions for those that were let go will be reposted, but at salaries that were well below what they being paid.  It's sad but true.

Compensation is a minimum of 20% below market, that's if you're lucky, but more like 30%.  This is something they openly admit to, and as you can imagine results in them being unable to recruit any real talent.

There is NO growth in Chicago.  Instead the business has been in steady decline for at least the last five if not ten years. You don't have layoffs for years on end if your business is succeeding!

The pecking order is Paris, New York, and Chicago being a very distant third.  If you work in Chicago you’ll more than likely report up to someone in New York.  The problem here is that most management in New York have had careers that started and reputable firms but have since followed a downward spiral to working for Societe Generale.  Since most are incompetent and only concerned with their own continued employment they make hasty decisions just to make numbers, which results in loss of jobs.  You'll read this in almost every review.  

HR preaches inclusion, diversity, and mobility.  In reality none of these things exist and their responses to the reviews here are nothing more than a failed attempt at damage control."

They have town hall meetings that employees are forced to go to because if not forced there will zero attendance. French nanagers will only speak to you if you are French . The backoffice in India is out of the stoneage , yet SG management will always support India over New York staff for the simple fact , they pracically pay India no wages ."
181,,Chaotic mess with a surreal backdrop,2018-04-20,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"Few and far between, frankly, I can't think of any.","To put it bluntly SG is a disaster! Headcount in Chicago in 2012 was around 550, today it’s around 200.  I’m not a math whiz but that’s roughly 64% reduction in force over 4 years.  Most of the jobs were lost to either India or Montreal as SG views a developer in India as fungible with an American developer with a decade of industry experience.  Needless to say their offshoring and nearshoring tactics have not had the best results for the company.  Back in November of 2016 they laid off the entire development staff for a critical back office component in their architecture.  Volume increased the software broke and there was no one to fix it.  If you want to read an article regarding this google “SocGen Computer Glitch Said to Ripple Through Bond Derivatives”.  SG may have saved $1M in headcount but the resulting outage cost them in excess of $50M.  The continued layoffs over the years resulted in over three empty floors in their previous offices at 550 W. Jackson, which prompted the firm to look for new space.  They ended up moving to 440 S. LaSalle, a building that is 60% empty, where they could pay pennies on the dollar compared to where they were before.  Don’t be fooled by the thin veneer of their new shiny offices as below surface lurks nothing but a company on the verge of imploding.  Glassdoor did a great article on the types of companies to avoid titled “7 Types of Companies You Should Never Work For” and SG fits almost every one of these.  I bring this up now as one type they mention in the article “The Curb Appealer” just popped into my head when speaking about their new offices.  

When it comes to talent there isn’t any left.  The brain drain has already run its course, leaving the firm with absolutely zero talent in their Chicago office.  What they’re left with are C players who think they’re A players (umm…, A players work for Goldman) and cult-like managers and their idiot followers.  When it comes to incompetent management, you’d be hard pressed to find a bigger group of lackeys.  I’ve never worked anywhere where the vast majority of people including management were uneducated.  It’s fair to say 80-85% of their employees in Chicago lack a college degree and most if not all are just hanging on hoping they aren’t let go in the next round of layoffs.  

The complete and total disaster SG’s Chicago office has become is not entirely their fault though.  The trading industry as a whole is in the worst shape it’s ever been in.  It is not just FCMs that are feeling the pressure but also exchanges like CME and ICE that have been struggling as well. In the vendor space 99% of the technology being sold is at least a quarter of a century old.  SG’s core vendor on the front office trading side is Fidessa, which was written in the early 90s. In the proprietary trading space, most firms are on life support especially the high frequency players most of whom will exit the business in the coming years.  If you’d like to learn more about the current state of the industry just google “Dwindling numbers in the financial industry” one of the first results is an article that paints a clear picture as to just how grim things really are.

I totally expect this review to receive a tone-deaf response from Paris touting what a great place SG is to work for but the harsh reality is my review paints a clear picture of their Chicago office. My advice to anyone looking to take a job with SG is to think twice if not three times before accepting an offer.  You’ll be doing yourself a huge disservice by working here."

They have a decent cafeteria for employees to buy lunch and breakfast.","Worked here for 3 month, and I quit after it. 

They didn't give me a laptop to work on. They gave me a very old hardware. 4:3 monitor  that has some color issues and a computer that's very slow. When I asked for a newer hardware I was ignored. My phone has a better spec than the computer I was given.

They will micromanage everything at a ridiculous scale. Do you need a software on your computer? Call the help desk. The help desk might not install the software you need for work.

If you need to do development on a Linux server, they will give you hard time getting you access or right permissions. If you need to install git for example, you will need to contact the ""UNIX TEAM"" to install it for you. Each request for installing a package can take few days. You can waste like 2 month on not doing anything just to wait for someone else to run a yum install that will take them less than 3 seconds to run.

You built a web application and need to deploy it? Call the ""APACHE TEAM"".  You may need to wait like a month to get things done for you. Developers are not allowed to configured services by themselves. 

No clear goals. I was hired to reduce cost, and they don't know what needs to be done in order to reduce cost.

It is not a super driven place like some of its peers, which can be frustrating if you want to really make progress very quickly. However, this isn't to say that there isn't progress. It is just at a different speed to what one might expect.

There are a lot of smart people everywhere. They also compensate most people pretty well and the benefits are unparalleled with 8% matching on your 401K.","Many approvals have to go through Paris, so it is sometimes difficult to get things done. Management also just decided to not create an IHC board for the FED, so essentially there is a glass ceiling on how big the company can grow.

Creating your own solutions to problems is very rewarding  in a MacGyver esque sort of way.,Acclimate to the culture or be an outsider. French  will be spoken so the quicker you learn the better off you will be
308,,Great Benefits,2015-03-26,4.0,Analyst,"27 PTO, 8% 401k match and good location (next to Union Station). Relatively good hours.",Competitive workplace. French are more likely to be promoted.
309,,Former employer,2015-03-23,1.0,Analyst,perks were good when they took the time to explain them to you.,"leadership, management, company values they have none, no ethics"

good balance between private and business life
good atmosphere at work",low salary and low benefits
311,,Good professional environment but poor HR policies,2015-01-27,3.0,Director,Professionals with strong technical skills / overall good team work / good work life balance,"No career management, managers promoted based on technical skills rather than good management skills"
312,,If you want to experience unlawful behavior and poor HR practices go Soc Gen,2014-12-08,1.0,Managing Director,"Office culture is like working in a country where there is no respect for humanity, ethnicity or gender. Sexual jokes and racist jokes are quite common and openly told out. There is no control of any hr policies to protect bullying and sabotaging others on the basis of their background .Most important if you complain against unlawful conduct they lay you off. Stay away and save yourself from unprofessional garbage","Senior leadership is disconnected from the rest of the team members. Works according to the jungle law where people fight, demean and steal to get their food."
313,,good benefits but no growth opportunity,2014-11-19,2.0,Anonymous Employee,good benefits & reasonable working hours,"low bonus & salary, hard to grow without being able to speak french"
314,,No growth for Analysts,2014-11-13,3.0,Analyst,Work with a lot of people who have been in the industry for 20 + years,No growth for recent graduates. They tend to higher experienced workers.
315,,Great team focused company,2014-11-13,5.0,Quality Assurance Analyst,The best reason to work here is to work with managers and directors who are committed to helping grow your career.,One of the challenges  is that pay increases don't match what you can get on the open market at least not as fast as one would hope.
316,,The Bank Management in Paris Simply Does Not Get It,2014-11-04,3.0,Associate,"Stable Company, will still be in existence in 5 years","Refusal to add the necessary head count even with increasing regulation, refusal to increase salaries, cutting back on bonuses/promotions while increase CEO compensation 18%"
317,,Management is lost,2014-10-19,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"Good vacation time, if you do not perform well there probably will not be any consequences.","Extremely limited opportunities for non French speakers, zero interest by the managers in developing employees. Morale is very low everywhere, I do not know one person within the company who would not jump at a decent opportunity somewhere else. Management philosophy is to create assembly lines where the employees are the equivalent of machines. The culture throughout the company is one of secrecy and hoarding information without any intent on sharing. It is actually acceptable to not respond to inquiries, and follow ups to inquiries. Constant changes in the organization have eliminated any sense of team spirit, as soon as one reorg is finished everyone starts talking about what the next one will be. It has been 12 months since the last one, I think thats a record."
318,,It's OK if you're French,2014-10-08,3.0,Structurer,"Quite a few smart people, wider job responsibilities compared to American banks, less likely to lay off people than American banks.",A very nepotist environment that promotes French nationals from a few select French schools. Links to Paris HQ are a must for serious advancement. Lower salaries than in American banks. Much slower career progression compared to American banks. Very very bureaucratic.
319,,"Good atmosphere, but lack of motivation",2014-08-31,3.0,Vice President (IT),"Exposed to all activities of a large investment bank but in a structure with smaller headcount: it is a plus for a newcomer in finance, who will quickly grasp investment banking
Good work/life balance: good hours, and management is understanding of personal issues, usually easy to plan vacation
Ability to move horizontally","Change is slow: it takes some time for the company as a whole to accept changes, and then their investment is not large enough to have a quick impact
Few advanced/recent technology, knowledge sharing within IT is scarce
Management listens, but frustrations are often left unsolved"
320,,Excellent experience,2014-08-13,5.0,Managing Director,"many opportunities, training curriculum, people development...",compensation is below market (base and bonus)
321,,Pay Rate Could be improved,2014-06-11,3.0,Associate,Good benefits but salary could be better. Excellent training offerings. Most managerial staff seems pleasant and easily approachable. Office space is nice too.,Little management recognition. Limited opportunity for growth. No company cafeteria or pantry. Bonus pool could be better. Otherwise a nice place to work.
322,,"Good job content and opportunities, decent work life balance",2014-05-15,3.0,Director,"opportunities often pop-up due to the size of the company, it's still growing. management gives responsibilities if to performers.",lack of culture in the US and complex organization.

326,,"The world of dead front office technology, robotic managers and cultural silos... run for the hills",2013-10-28,1.0,Front Office IT,none if your non French,"The front office technology is the worst I have seen at any bank. It does not work and its overly complicated. Everyone in IT and quant dev are hostile, they work in technology silos and they all have hidden agenda's. More emphasis is placed on the education you have rather than the actual creation of the idea for example only people from the top Ecole's are suppose to have ideas everyone else is a dog. Do yourself a huge favor avoid this bank at all costs you will writing off a few years of life with nothing to show."
327,,overall a bad experience,2013-10-06,1.0,Vice President,free tickets for the MOMA,"too much managers and no leadership

332,,Slow-moving culture,2013-07-21,3.0,Derivative Sales,"The greatest pros of working for Societe Generale are the work flexibility, relatively good hours, access to good resources, and the opportunities that open up due to lack of extreme competition.","The major cons of working for Societe Generale are a highly bureaucratic culture, fear of change, top management overhang, and a bias towards promoting French employees."

- lots to learn and fast pace
- challenging work
- technologically advanced compare to most other banks","- IT help desk department are sloppy
- little corporate communication/meeting to know what else is going on in the company
- department is very isolated so no chance to know anyone else in other areas"
334,,Frustrating,2013-04-15,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"Overall talent level quite low, so it is easier to advance","Very little concern for employees by management. Staff development is not considered HR or managers responsibility. There is a significant reorganization once per year, so the managers have to spend significant amounts of time on that rather than managing their teams. There is a large cultural gap between French and American employees in the NY office. Surprisingly, while this may seem obvious, the management and HR do nothing to address or manage the problem of culture and communication. I would agree with many other reviewers, if you do not speak French I would not recommend working here."
335,,Better work life balance but lower pay than competitors.  Difficult career traction for non-French.,2013-01-12,3.0,Associate,Favorable work-life balance.  Very well-regarded franchise in equity derivatives and other structured products.,"Below market compensation for NYC.  Very bureaucratic.  

Not necessarily a pro or con, but the New York office is very French.  Career advancement for those who don't come from the Grandes Ecoles / Societe Generale Paris office pipeline can be difficult."

Low work morale for Americans"

339,,An extremely frustrating place to work at times,2012-11-04,2.0,Vice President,"Great vacation policy, solid benefits.","Management is too busy playing politics and blaming others to participate in actual work.
Very few employees willing to help others - a culture that comes from the top down. Issues are always someone or some other team's problem."
340,,Very French,2012-10-07,3.0,Director,"Growing in the Americas, Decent risk culture","Hard culturally, everything must go through Paris, lots of power politics"
341,,"learned a bit there, but no advancements.. everyone speaks in french unless they have to ask you something",2012-09-27,2.0,Middle Office Analyst,smaller than US banks so its easier to get to know everyone in the business..,You will not advance unless you are french.  2nd class citizen...

Elitism of the NY office.
HR is very disconnected with the rest of the company."

Fosters professional growth as training is relatively easy to obtain if desired","Compensation is not comparable to competitors
Career opportunities are sometimes provided without the appropriate training
Focus more on retaining local talent, rather then the over abundance of 2 year contract of Paris employees."
349,,You are in a glass box,2012-03-09,3.0,Senior Software Engineer,"Lots of vacation time, especially if you have been with the company for more than 5 years
Ability to travel to France or other SG locations, if you are lucky
Until recently, the job positions are fairly stable and secure.
Most groups and peers are usually very nice to work with.","If you are not French, you can only get so far. Definitely a glass ceiling! Also, be prepared to get paid less than everyone else in the industry.
If you want to advance  or get promoted in your career, don't work here. Expect to wait many, many (MANY) years in between titles.
Lots of politics. Innovation may come from other regions, such as the Americas, but they are usually either ignored or stolen by the Paris office.
If you work in an office other than the Paris headquarters, you are confined to just doing your tasks, and take an extreme amount of direction from the mother office"
350,,Was a good learning experience!!,2012-03-06,3.0,Intern,"Flexible work hours, exposure to various departments and good environment to work !!",Hourly wage is minimum as compared to other banks and the ratio of hiring interns full time is minimal.
351,,SocGen embodies everything that is loathsome about French institutionalism--but there some positive aspects.,2012-02-25,2.0,,SocGen can be bold in areas in which it chooses to focus.  SocGen takes advantage of the French higher educational system that gave it an edge in areas like derivatives.,"SocGen is not a meritocracy.  It operates with a three-tier hierarchy--with zero mobility between them.  At the top are the French from the right schools or families (their upward career path is guaranteed, no matter how incompetent).  The next level are talented French who have some opportunties for advancement (these include workers like Jerome Kervial, who blew up the bank partly out of spite towards its deeply anti-meritocratic structure).  Below that are non-French employees, who during flush times can fall under the misimpression that they are valued and respected."

356,,My experience has been good with some particular reservations.,2011-12-30,2.0,Director,Many people are quite competent and hard working.  You can learn a great deal.  You can contribute and be recognized for the contribution.,"The French do have a bit of a glass ceiling for Americans at the Director and above levels .  It is definitely NOT insurmountable, and my impression is that many more expats from France come here to New York  than Americans go to Paris.  But some Americans DO get through it."
357,,Did not  advance career as much as I thought I would.,2011-12-21,2.0,Analyst,Pay is market rate and hours are very relaxed.,SG does not advance your key or develop your skills as a junior investment banking analyst.

All opportunities go to the French. Trying to route out Americans. Company will never be able to compete in US. High Turnover. No respect.
Very poor compensation compared to peers."
