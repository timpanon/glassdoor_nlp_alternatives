4,,Fake it till you make it,2022-04-13,3.0,Tracker,"Easy money if you have unlimited access to the Venture Capital money pot
HR no longer has limits for max % of increment. Everything lies in the hands of the line manager and the Budget.
So if we fake it enough, and communicate well, even a tech job with no tech knowledge gives you a promotion and big increments to the next grade. It helps if you’re female
If your boss favours you enough, they’ll be nice enough to reward you based on team effort (on the coat tails of the rest of the  teammates work) Even if you have just done just enough.
Nice remote work from different locations at co working allows me to run errands when I’m not busy
have a godfather and you’re all set for a bright future.","The chief person overall isn’t tech savvy enough to know he’s being promised big outcomes from startups which have yet to prove profitable. 

They lied abt why much increments barely given at Group level when it was freely given abundantly at ventures. Every recruiter knows this.

Zero increments in some India where more jobs than workers meant staff will resign. We’ve lost a lot of good talent

The pursuit of digitalisation and huge payouts has normalised underhanded practices such as harassment of approvers via personal mobile, WhatsApp late nights and 7am, harassment  by intimidation, backhanded remarks, name dropping of ceo as if they’re exempt from the code of conduct. 

Some ventures just want to get things done, so this means they are ruthless. You can be unwell and yet they will harass you.  If you skip meals and sleep to do them the favour, they’ll come back again to expect the same a few more times. Money is everything which means they’ll throw you under the bus anytime it profits them. Whatever religiousness, principles, empathy anyone has, all goes down the drain.

They dare do this because their founder has strings with the Chief C level person, so they have the confidence they will never get implicated 

Use and dispose culture."

This makes it interesting because you gain a lot of experience, but also there is no work life balance. It’s all work.

Promotions are difficult to receive. Many years in a row there were no promotions.

Managers have good intentions but see comments in Cons below. Work hours are reasonable and hybrid working policies are good.,"Very bureaucratic and people struggle to take decisions out of fear and too many things have to be escalated to the top. Decision making is concentrated in the hands of a few and slow. Too much time is spent navigating the bureaucracy and avoiding individuals who are always difficult. 

The organisation is diverse but not inclusive especially towards women and minority ethnicities. While managers are decent people, other teams like HR will inflict micro aggressions and use the bank’s bureaucracy to wear you down. After a while you realise these are not one-off incidents and you get demotivated. It is difficult to discuss these issues in the bank because managers don’t have a similar experience and things seem perfectly fine on the surface. But the micro-aggressions start to add up and opting out feels like the best option."

Their 6 weeks training program tries to teach you Front -end, backend & Database & JIRA; but it actually fails as you're taught everything for just 1 week & have to immediately switch to learning sth else immediately. And on top of that they expect you to implement these learnings & showcase in a project in those 6 weeks itself.
2. I'm from Tier -I college, & it's sad to see a very toxic hierarchy for salaries & promotions in place based on if you come from good college or not.

All HR people policies and benefits are given at the discretion of the line management/business and consequently, the experience with different employees is not homogeneous across the bank. Until the bank addresses this structure, or better still, train managers on decision making when it comes to benefits, this will continue to be a pain and the will continue to lose goodwill.

After a long painful process of hiring - my superior did not even remember my starting day. The team was 95% female, several were domineering unforgiving Alphas with daddy issues. In an open office set up, when agitated on the phone, they would speak loudly, be rude and let the whole floor listen to their power trip and rants. Very disruptive and not conducive environment. Favouritism was very clear, and the 99% females would be very obviously 'softer' on the younger males and ignore others. If you got into the group's bad books or said something they didn't like, you were marked. And they make it very clear. If they avoid you, good. But if they want to have 'fun' they will speak to each other in a different language about you, not behind your back but right in front of you, thinking you don't know how to read tone of voice and vibes. Not right. Basically, if they want you out, they will make it very unpleasant. To a point where it's worth your sanity and dignity to leave. No point in speaking up to HR when it's your own supervisor who's the cause of this attitude. It's a cold place if you don't behave like them. Do not be like them. No support from HR either. They're hard to get, unavailable, late in responding to emails or on leave. Be warned."

Rigid rules for promotion"
1192,,"Imbeciles Everywhere that are ""Here for Good""",2021-08-02,1.0,Manager,"Should you desire a career experience where you become less intelligent, be surrounded by idiots and imbeciles, and get invited for 200 tea/coffee breaks a day by people who do not do any work, then this company is here for you.","1) Too many imbeciles, lazy bosses and clueless colleagues who are ""Here for Good"". Their only purpose is to milk the bank of its cash while not doing any work. All they do is (a) Talk at meetings without making sense, (b) try to steal your work and pass it off as their own (c) push emails around to 'coordinate' and seem like they are doing work.

2) Which company has so many 'Head of XXX' and big inflated titles? I think SC has up to 75 CFOs and 30 COOs. One COO will manage 15 COOs...who in turn manage other COOs. (there's CIB COO, CFO COO, FM COO, FM Finacne COO, GB COO, GB ASA COO....etc etc) and this repeats for all the C-Suite functions. When these psudo C-Suite and peduso-Heads go out to market, they are laughed at. COO Salary at 1/20th the salary of a normal COO elsewhere? Have a laugh. They might have a Toilet CFO, Pantry CEO, Head of Meeting Rooms, MBFC Gantry CFO, ATM CFO, Email CFO etc. The common joke when someone is heading to SC is: ""oh, what department are you heading?"" - even for a fresh graduate.

3) Many Senior Managers/ Middle Management are clueless about their role. They managed to secure their position by jumping internally to various other roles. Where clueless managers (who do not know what is needed) hire such clueless staff; who in turn also hire other clueless staff. The entire pyramid is rotten - nobody knows what is going on. Managers throw around big words like ""Big Data"" and ""Machine Learning"" and ""Unsupervised Learning"" while not know what they really are. Do simple balance sheet calculations seriously need big data and unsupervised learning? It's simple accounting! Worst thing is that their bosses are impressed, and themselves go about throwing these words around - as if it will solve the bank's problems. No amount of ML can help you if you do not even have proper data - its like trying to build a skyscraper using tissue paper. I daresay the entire chain relies on the poor fresh graduate at the bottom who tries to properly understand what the job is about. 

4) Staff in Singapore from certain other countries are rude and demeaning to the auxiliary staff in office - such as the cleaners, concierge, building services. They place used cups in the pantry, especting the cleaner to wash it for them. They leave food around, expecting the cleaner to clean up after them. Worst of all, if you have ever had the misforunte of working at their Changi Business Park office, you'll realise that there are humans in need of toilet training like infant animals! They do their business anywhere but into the toilet bowl, and pee all over the place. It is so bad that the building services team has asked the cleaning uncle to clean up every hour! Every. Single. Hour. The poor cleaning uncle has a torrid time.

5) The bank's systems are archaic. Probably can't talk about it in specifity but you will realise you're better off with paper and pen.

6) Last but not least, there is no accountability. Ineptitude, sloth, slipshod work, and even malfeasance is tolerated throughout the bank. Managers who do not deliver projects after asking for millions of dollars of funding are still around; their projects conveniently forgotten and written off. What they do is to find a new role within the bank, and chuck the project off into some god-forsaken hole. Individuals seem to be graded on how many times they have coffee/tea with their managers instead of quality of work. If you've had the misfortune to grace the canteen in Changi Business Park during a work-week, you'll realise that it is constantly packed throughout the day with people having 'coffee chats' (which is really just a secret language for malingering).

--honestly, no consultant, system, way of working can fix the disaster that is Standard Chartered. It might be an option to liquidate the bank and start from bottom up again."

3. Managers/Senior managers i worked with them are non technical people. So you need to spoon feed them about what you have done. Make them to understand what you have done
4. Hike & promotion are not transparent. People who are in good touch with managers/senior managers get more as well as get promotion. There is no disclosure to team about the promoted people and there is no justification for promotion 
5. Recruiting automation resource and deploy them as manual resource and asked to extend work hours to do automation and they will give weightage for that too. It we are not meeting it then it will be impact on performance. They won't bother about work life balance even though company supported for that
6. Managers can do what they want, they are the authority to decide so raising voice against them doesn't help you. HR policies are just for name sake
7. If you have contacts inside the company you can get an offer. 
8. Internal vacancies are just for name sake, you won't get call for your application. It would be filled by known people. Most of the times, team decide the people and open the req

1. Worst management, treats you as a slave.
2. Pay/Hikes/Appraisals way below market standard.
3. Inefficient managers (only has UG degree). No product/process knowledge and lack leadership quality.
4. HR has no play (other than hiring). Everything is managed by your line manager aka People Leader. So basically if you have any grievances you cannot take it up with anyone.
5. To be favourable you need to be a Tamil (or else regionally same as your manager)
6. Zero appreciation on performance (even if it's an acknowledgement over a call/meeting)
7. Leaves are sufficient (only if they let you take one other than block leave). This highly varies team to team.
8. Exceeding working hours (+ 2-3h) on a daily basis and not rewarded. 
9. Shift allowance policies are not up to the mark. 
10. Excessive cost cutting.
11. No transparency on policies from the organisation end. 
12. Conflict among team members which leads to loss of productivity and time.

The HR is non-existent, which means the managers run their respective teams like a fiefdom. Your Manager's word will be the gospel. The Global management changes every few years, so you will also see the strategy, organization design & management focus change every 3-4 years as well. Fact of the matter is, they have no bigger picture in their mind about what they want the bank to do, every incoming Global CEO will dictate his terms and reinvent the wheel every few years, and then the next CEO will come in & undo everything his predecessor did. For employees on the ground, this means that you're dispensable. Managers have little to no work. In fact, if you're a manager & a big enough sycophant, you can get by with doing nothing & just forwarding every single mail to your juniors and then blame them when things go wrong."

4. A lot of work has been outsourced, hence the chances of being made redundant has increased 
5. Consistent restructuring across the bank and reorganisation at top management makes things confusing and affects the ground staff to middle management (change is the only constant but you wouldn't want changes to occur so frequently without bringing any significant benefits)
6. If someone leaves, work is just distributed among the remaining folks. Nothing wrong until it stretches everyone to the maximum for long periods of time making it unsustainable

There are generous HR policy and flexible work arrangement options.","If you are focused on self growth, especially in terms of skills and self value, please reconsider an offer from the bank. My observation while working in this bank is that it is very good at "" retaining"" people, so lots of people you work with can be very ""experienced"" people who have been ""staying"" for a very long time in the hope to climb corporate ladders and often got their wish fulfilled after many years of ""hard labour"". So if you are perseverant enough to stay with the bank for many years, you might end up in a similar situation, where you will be given a more senior title than the one given to you when you joined, and some increment to your salary, but then that's it. If human is the biggest asset to a bank, then this bank's asset is aging faster than average. and then you can imagine the future....


Lots of people in management positions ( at least those I met) are  not leaders but micro managers who gives detailed instructions on things that don't need it. They lack foresight or management skills of businesses and treat you as their means to achieve personal  KPI, rather than an asset to the bank who have a career to take care of too.

Lots of things that don't  make sense are instructed to be done , whereas lots of things that add value are ignored by managers.


there is not much technology being adapted, the way things are done are obsolete, which in a way protects those ""very experienced "" people. What they care about the most is respect and obiedience from you."

2761,,Review.,2020-04-29,3.0,Business,"The country teams are great - the environment in country is friendly, my own team is very supportive, flexibility allowed i.e. work from home, in country management is considerate, maternity leave is great, etc. The pay is good, learning opportunity is good up to a certain extent.","Unspoken corporate hierarchy/politics where your behavior is shaped based on the seniority of who you are addressing - one of the worst I’ve experienced though they advertise it as otherwise.

Blame game is big - focus should be “we found a problem what’s the solution” instead this ends up being a blame game instilling negativity and at times even fear.

Constant structural changes by higher management - and I mean constant with no clear rational or vision communicated to employees on ground facing these changes full face. These changes are sometimes blanket changes and seem like the are no considerations for particular regions/ countries. 

You spend a lot of time doing irrelevant work this may be due to being an international bank adhering to many international regulations but sometimes you feel you can drown in doing documentation work. A large part of this is because the bank supports “simplifying” this is not actually done. The bank invests heavily on software, etc to make the client experience smoother however internally there is much to do to simplify - there are so many systems created that do not speak to each other. Many times we have to deal with large data where we spend hours trying to clean it up as a result . Processes at times are slow because of so many unnecessary systems not speaking to each other and so many work flow layers - think of an assembly line for a factory each line assembling one thing (literally). Sometimes software and systems should be created to ease particular work - this is not done to the extent that you think that your stuck in the 90s with the way these processes has not yet been updated.

The big clients are everything and if you do one tiny mistake like not respond to them even if it’s way past working hours your questioned by everyone internally surprisingly the internal team will give you a harder time than the actual client itself. God forbid you make an error.



Some people at work need to learn communication skills.

Although I say that SCB encourages work life balance I have to add this does not apply to everyone - unfortunately some teams work constantly even on weekends and late into the night i.e. I do receive emails from those at 3 AM in the morning their time. And when asked they explain that they are under pressure and have lots of work to do. 

Many talented people were given the cut, this brings into an underlying question on job security always.

This is for maybe the bank management - management encourages speak up for all things and try to normalized it - however speak up to employees is the highest form of escalation and not very available option. Fear, worry, being questioned etc is always on the table.

A lot of teams frequently change and this change brings about inconsistency and confusion - i.e. every time this team changes they change along with it the way things are done e.g. team one prefers a, b and c. Team two comes and say go back
To 3,21 - then team 3 comes back and says no we should do a,b,c again.

Business team is the all knowing God for every known thing even the most irrelevant to them in the bank for some reason. They are like an octopus with arms extending everywhere and at the same time are definitely not empowered on relevant decisions because they are the con man for lack of better terminology."

As far as you can complete your daily task, management allows flexibility for working hour

-Willingness to let junior expressing opinions
Management will ask for opinions from junior staff, though sometime management just does not have a well understanding about the workflow nor system.","Terrible systems 
Really really a hell to operation staff. You can never imagine in Year 2019, an international financial institution is still using such terrible system. It is not a JOKE. The systems are much much worse than its major competitors like HSBC or Citi or DBS. Maybe the systems are little bit better than banks like Dah Sing bank or Bangkok bank in HK. 
To be fair, the middle or junior level managers know this issue.
Nevertheless, the overall strategy of the group is to spend the least to achieve the basic needs instead of spending little more to achieve normal level or even more.
As the result, when the market changes or clients demand more, they are reluctant to enhance the systems, instead, they ask operation to do more...even operation has already worked 10 hrs a day without any Overtime pay.  And this problem does not only happen in operation, it also happens in HR system, IT system etc.  Oh, anyway, the statistics is meaningless in the bank, because the management does not care you work 10 hr, 12hr or 24 hrs a day, the management just care if they can release back to home at sharp 18:00. You can hardly find a manager after 18:30 while the rest have to work from 9am to 8pm or even 11pm


So if you want to try systems two decades ago, it will be the best place for you!
So if you are seeking managerial level opening here, it will be a heaven to you!"

- Exceptionally political. 
- A lot of individuals not doing any work seem to survive thanks to a combination of sucking up to the boss and/or being from the same race and country (there is an Indian mafia, Pakistani mafia, Aussie mafia, British mafia and the only criteria for survival is to pick a team of the same nationality, any talent aside)
- a consequence of the nepotism is that there are a lot of unqualified resources who don't do much if anything and are still fairly safe despite any losses or failures 
- a lot of initiatives started with no hope of success and continue till it becomes so ridiculous that management pulls the plug. By this time, the MDs/ Ds and their cronies have gone through two bonus/promotion cycles and get an internal mobility out. The last patsy or the new one gets thrown under the bus. Rinse & Repeat. 
It's then somewhat surprising to see CEO and MT worry about why programs aren't generating returns. Surely you're all not that naive not to see that somee of your one and two downs are taking the bank for a ride. 
- Outsourcing to Chennai/ Bangalore/ Poland/ Tianjin may be cheaper but so badly done that processes still continue to sit in the original location while you now pay for high cost locations and low cost locations headcount.
Bear in mind that 75% of band 5, 6 and 7 resources fired doesn't mean that the remaining 25% will do 100% of the job while the low cost resources twiddles thumbs."

Doing simple tasks like expense reports can be extremely time consuming simply due to the technology being so poor. Anything relating to admins is poorly funded and not well thought out. 

There is absolutely no training or proper onboarding for new hires. Completely ridiculous for a company of this size who uses a bunch of dumpsterfire programs that no other company uses. There is a very blatant ""figure it out yourself"" attitude. 

Admins here support WAY too many people. Could be 15, could be 20, could be more. The bank wastes tons of money on certain things but again, when it comes to admins, there is no consideration or investment. You're expected to essentially be on 24/7 call which is ridiculous for someone on the admin level.

The approval process for everything (for example: travel) is extremely convoluted. It seems that very few decisions (large or small) are made stateside- everything goes through Singapore or London which is a huge pain due to the time differences. Even band 3 employees in NY have absolutely no influence.

Bullying is a real problem and completely tolerated. No matter how many mandatory meetings this bank has about harassment and bullying, nothing will ever change because the most toxic people are promoted and never disciplined. Some of these managers and directors gossip more than what you would expect in a hair salon. HR is completely ineffective and lazy, the payroll department is equally incompetent. 

It seems like things may be better based on the reviews in some of the other SCB offices but the NYC office is a cesspool of incompetence.

This is not a place that attracts the best and brightest. A lot of people seem stuck here because they wouldn't get anywhere at any other bank.

The whole diversity thing is a farce. If you're not white, south asian or east asian good luck getting promoted. And speaking of promotion, when interviewing they tell you there are a lot of growth opportunities within the bank but generally this doesn't apply to most admins."

If you want to work for a truly global, emerging market institution that can give you exposure to EM + Frontier, this is it.  They have deep history in many of these far-flung places and I would think they will never leave.  This gives a deeply embedded advantage over other international players and, of course, local competition.  I actually feel ""here for good"" is an excellent representation of this and a wonderful tagline for the company.  Long history, through it all, thick and thin.  If you stand in Central in HK and look at HSBC and SC buildings side by side (notwithstanding that SC sold its building a long time ago) you see what I mean - HSBC purportedly built its building to be modular so they could dismantle it and ship it out after the handover in '97 if things got hairy.  Who knows if this is true or not but the building looks the part.  SC building is a veritable fortress by comparison - in other words, ""here for good"" in living color.","The bank has an absolutely toxic culture.  There has been far too much change at all levels of management.  New management come in, excited by all the aforementioned pros and have unreasonable expectations heaped on them and they simply cannot deliver.  The result is they fire their directs or themselves get fired (as the blame goes around) and the cycle repeats itself.  The bank has to figure out a way to break this cycle.  The people that have been around for more than 2 years are inevitably those that are best place to avoid getting caught by this - have either managed to fire and apportion blame or have avoided decisions or rose through the ranks quickly.  It's sadly apparent throughout the organization.  The functions are mediocre to incompetent and don't know how to support front office.  The middle and front of offices are working off of antiquated systems - there has been no investment in improving systems, majority of investment is on regs.  The conundrum faced by the institution is that so many areas of the bank need to be literally burnt down and rebuilt, but the cost to do so is so great, that it is simply not possible from the highest stakeholders (shareholders, board) on down.  Senior management rolled out a campaign recently, presumably to fulfill it's obligation to ""change the culture"" called ""Our Shared Values.""  In some ways it is good and necessary but in others it is a sad reflection on the state of the bank.  For instance, value #1 is ""do the right thing.""  In my opinion, anyone that is not clear on or doesn't automatically know to do the right thing shouldn't be at the bank to begin with.  So does this mean the bank tolerates employees or managers or don't spell out or do the right thing?  It's very confusing and illustrates the challenging place that the bank is in."

3883,,a lower rating than one star isn't available,2018-04-24,1.0,Anonymous Employee,Used to be a #Human place,"Standard Chartered Bank has become utterly Orwellian strangled under the naif specter of operational risk and the organization revels blindly in all the inane toxic suffocating redundancies consequently created. 

The Human Resources (HR) function at Standard Chartered has always been disconnected from, and absolutely uninterested in anything to do with needs of the people there - its sole purpose remains to rubber stamp ever more disjointed ""business call"" and as always, filing out reams of doublespeak (jingoistic paperwork that never sees daylight). The hiring criterion has little do with the capability/track record/qualifications or cultural fit of a potential candidate - but rather is a factor of who is the 'cheapest' hire. 

At Standard Chartered PLC there is no succession planning/grooming. Pick a senior vacancy and they've mostly brought in an external candidate. This when the average tenure of the next-to-senior existing staff throughout the Group has not been less than 4 years. Not only does it reflect an obvious utter absence of investment in the 'talent' the organization already has, what this effectively also does is simple - it terminates the growth pipeline throughout the organization's considerable hierarchy. Internal international movements, much touted at job fairs, is the biggest fallacy at Standard Chartered - not only is grooming of existing staff absent, internal job advertisements are cursory, paper filling exercises - with absolutely no feedback on an application - even for the minority of vacancies where a candidate for the position hasn't already been pre short listed before the job is advertised. For ""Group"" level roles there is no active involvement in the hiring process of HR nor of the international mobility HR subfunction - nor is any hint given of the active xenophobic 'restrictions' to 'non native' hiring let alone any internal mechanisms to counter/mitigate it - but diversity is purportedly valued ""highly"" at Standard Chartered.  

At senior management level, these new hires have no inkling of the ground realities at the Bank, nor any interest in acquiring any modicum of understanding of the same - they each work off a set of preconceived notions that brook no contrary view - not that there are anymore forums where a different view to doing things could be aired or would be tolerated let alone invited. so no, you must not stay in your own house or with relatives while traveling for business, because the policy says you cannot and in any case there is no per diem - just pay the hundreds of dollars out of your own pocket (again as per policy - you lodge a claim once you return, and will be reimbursed some time in the future, only once the dozen forms, approvals et all plus the entire OR bureaucracy is sated) for a hotel room in which you barely will have time to sleep in. And good luck to you if for some reason the hotel didn't give you an original receipt/or you couldn't find it. Try getting the Bank to lend you money interest free for the time it takes to get your out of pocket expense money back. There is no forum nor interest anywhere in the Bank for you to try and simplify this - you cannot ask questions, for none are entertained - even though 'simplification' is the latest 'big' deal.

Much touted is ""diversity and inclusion"", which effectively amounts to touted quotas ""enforced"" for women with chauvinistic verbal homage tilted to putting up percentages and timelines - to replacing existing non vacant staff positions with women. Utterly no regard to the existing staff pool - because for the 'management' staff are redundant wood blocks. The active discrimination extends to gender exclusive (read women only) events (on which the Bank spends good money), gender exclusive (for women only) mentoring, gender exclusive face time with senior management. None such fanfare exists for existing staff who happen to not be female. At Standard Chartered there is absolutely not the least recognition/ space for any form of orientation diversity, safe work environment, let alone empowerment - the deliberate absolute silence on this could not be less gender phobic even if they tried! Conveniently to cover for their this bias they quote 'cultural sensitives of the markets they operate in' - yet oddly in these same markets they - purportedly - stringently enforce /zero tolerance of internal policies that forbid gratuitous token gift exchanges (a very cultural thing in 'their these markets') for example - at least there is a policy for this and a lot of blurb frequently circulated around it. That as opposed to the utter silence on orientation, safe work environment, tolerance et al.

The parallel organizational structures, much reviled by the current CEO when he joined, remain, with all the silos between the various businesses since re-enforced. The erstwhile ""bridge"" support functions were rendered neutered and headless at the start of his tenure, because they all had 'outsiders' appointed to 'lead' - who have little interest if any in the existing biology of the function/organization - reflected in the diktat that reign as the current ""policies"" there. So blase are these gents, one and all, that throughout the organization 'facts' no longer matter, 'appearances' are de rigueur - so intolerant of anything but their own view that their directs go to no uncertain lengths to ensure nothing filters up except what syncs with the ""desired"" state. Their titles increasingly grow remote, with the length /web of hierarchy under them expanding to the effect of leaving the totem pole so tall that even the middle branches are no longer visible (let alone accessible) from the ground.

Adopting the stance of the Group CEO are ""regional CEOs"" - who have little knowledge of, and even less interest in the ""geographies"" they ""rule"" - accordingly they grant arbitrary financial targets among their ""dominion"" and yet control not the spend of their court. They then hold their geographies to account for failing to 'deliver' for these same exorbitant uncured courtly expenses - which the regional CEOs have apportioned arbitrarily back to these same geographies. Courtesy the great 'purge' post the coming of Winter - a grim assemblage of reluctant yes men ekes out existence under increasing strangulation of self defeating policies while battling the redundant ogre of OR all the while waiting for the day to wind down so that they can clock out. 

Make no mistake this organization is NOT some 9to5 operation - long hours ""at"" work are expected (with frequent 'productivity' excel based  exercises) and the work phone given is guarantee that your attention will remain available whenever asked for. Need further proof? The vaunted 'refresh' of the 'core values' was the the hashtag #beingHuman, with an 'expected' set of ""valued behaviors""! Orwellian huh?"

Highly political environment, so much so that business is second place to self-preservation and protection of comfort zone.

Morale is ok in pockets, sadly not in my business area (eComs)
There is a lot of genuinely funny trench-humour with laughter at the seemingly duplicitous and machiavellian behaviours of business and technology leadership.","The attrition within Standard Chartered is the highest I have seen.  It is like a revolving door across the business and technology team with many complaining about the same root cause.  
IT heavily micro-managed by the business using their historic and out-of-date knowledge, this heavily impacted courage, creativity and agility.  
Projects start with brutality and no regard for personal circumstances.  Demands for immediate business travel are not unknown which made the eTrading the least family friendly environment I have experienced.
Infamy of certain business heads impact seriously on hiring, hence the need to over pay for ""hero work""
Name calling, rudeness and arrogance purveyed by business heads led to a wider trust issues within the global team.

There is a good amount of international mobility, both during the two year program and afterwards. Many IG's chose to work in a market different from their home countries upon completion of the program. The IG're are paid higher than the average employee on the same grade and well looked after generally during the program.","Once the IG program finishes, then its different for different people. Some find it hard and same as end of honeymoon period. Quite a lot of IG's leave the bank afterwards. A lot depends on where the graduates chose to work. Some markets are great and have good potential, others not so much.  Also the IG's are used to good support during the program from HR and afterwards its no so forthcoming anymore which is a rather disappointment. The HR policies for common employees are rather 'not pleasant' and the IG's once they become part of regular core of employees feel the heat more .

5208,,"Recent merger of wholesale and consumer banking, and shifting of tech & ops roles to South Asia is ruining the bank.",2014-06-13,4.0,You Don't Need to Know,"I work in the technology division and here are my thoughts in bullet point:

- Pay scale is pretty good. However, the range is also wide, so it boils down to how generous your boss is.
- Work-life balance does exist, but there are some individuals who slog like slaves.
- Most people enjoy the flexibility of working from home once in a while, as long as you deliver what is required.
- Lots of leave for permanent employees.
- No shortage of employee volunteering opportunities.
- If you work in the city office, it's very accessible, but you will spend a lot of time and money on food and parking.
- If you work in the changi office, there are more (affordable) lunch options compared to a couple of years ago, but it can be difficult getting to work if you miss the free company shuttle buses to Changi - unless you stay a couple of train stations away from Expo.
- Medical benefits is ok, but not great when compared to other banks.
- Group CEO is widely respected and revered.","- Most of the middle managers, and some senior managers, seldom come across as impressive when it comes to their management style or expertise.
- Too many people were hired just because they are friends with the hiring manager, and not because they are genuinely capable of what they do. If you want to shift to another role within the bank, you have to spend a lot of time and effort networking.
- This bank is horribly, terribly disorganised, and many things are done last minute. This compromises the quality of work.
- When it comes to new business opportunities or innovation in banking, they are always one step behind other banks.
- Managers of south asian descent tend to hire people of the same race. Other people have also said that they generally have difficulty adapting to the working styles of other races.
- There is a lot of shifting of tech & ops roles to South Asia for the sake of lowering costs. I personally think it's a recipe for disaster. Most of the time, the southern Asian counterparts are seriously lacking basic communication and listening skills. They are not efficient in delivering outcomes and many projects get delayed very badly. Project cost over-runs can get rather alarming. When they say ""yes, it's done"" or ""yes, it will be done"", it usually turns out to be the opposite. I don't believe it to be true for all south Asians, and there are exceptional cases within the bank (though very few), but such sentiments are echoed by many other non-south-Asians in the organisation.
- Quite a lot of redundancies were made with the recent merger of its wholesale and consumer banking business. Sometimes these retrenchments happen so fast, it's just bollocks!
- Since the merger, everything is in a state of confusion and semi-chaos because people are not sure where the company is heading, how they should navigate the organisation to get things done and how it impacts their promotion and pay. There has been little communicated to staff worldwide.
- From time to time, you hear about women sleeping up the corporate ladder. And they still get away with it.
- Didn't bother about the employee share options - doesn't seem attractive.

Advice to someone who is thinking of joining this organisation soon:
- Wait for the dust of the recent reorganisation to settle first. I suspect this may take about a year from now."

Forget fair compensation. they will sell you statements to the effect of how 'competitive' (read: low) their salary structure is - of how the 'bonus' structure puts you ahead of everyone else... empty hot air. thats all. at 'review' time - which btw you will not have because the management does not have the guts to do this face to face - and in any case your rating is already decided weeks in advance and there is very little you can argue to impact it... so you merely get handed a paper that says what you've been 'rated' and what your 'compensation' is - and a speech about how 'difficult' things are etc and that what you've been given is better than anyone else... even though the 'bank made a killing in the market and is the most profitable out there'...

career progression - they still follow the 'bell curve' methodology to rate 'talent' (its easiest and they've kinda grown adept at it of late) - not that you will know what you've been profiled - where you can improve - what is expected of you. but there are forms somewhere to these effect that someone is filling out about you. rest assured. they do follow processes on paper. but your ranking/status/profile will never be shared with you - nor will you have a clue of what/how you're doing - until the review - and not even then...

personal growth/upskilling/ trainings. on paper only. its all up to you when you find the time and opportunity for these on your own for your own.

HR at Standard Chartered suxs. it does not exist to assists, guide, *gawd forbid* mentor, inform, defend, enforce employee supportive policies of any sort - it is merely a tool to recruit fodder for the grinder, and ensure paper filling exercises with fancy names are completed, mostly post dated - just to complete the process. you will not have an HR relationship manager that you will have ever met. and if you have nothing will ever have come out of it in your favor.

benefits. these don't exist beyond the statutory requirements of 'medical' and 'housing' - which as statutorily defined are a third of your paltry basic pay - because they are a 'reward' structured organization - with competitive salary structures.. but this rule is not uniformly applied for there are numerous examples to the contrary - entirely composed of fresh hires... not all of whom are fortunate enough to get this exemption..."

As it is such a huge organisation, there is hardly attention given to your career or development even if you are facing difficulties and sought help.

Forget fair compensation. they will sell you statements to the effect of how 'competitive' (read: low) their salary structure is - of how the 'bonus' structure puts you ahead of everyone else... empty hot air. thats all. at 'review' time - which btw you will not have because the management does not have the guts to do this face to face - and in any case your rating is already decided weeks in advance and there is very little you can argue to impact it... so you merely get handed a paper that says what you've been 'rated' and what your 'compensation' is - and a speech about how 'difficult' things are etc and that what you've been given is better than anyone else... even though the 'bank made a killing in the market and is the most profitable out there'...  

career progression - they still follow the 'bell curve' methodology to rate 'talent' (its easiest and they've kinda grown adept at it of late) - not that you will know what you've been profiled - where you can improve - what is expected of you. but there are forms somewhere to these effect that someone is filling out about you. rest assured. they do follow processes on paper. but your ranking/status/profile will never be shared with you - nor will you have a clue of what/how you're doing - until the review - and not even then...

personal growth/upskilling/ trainings. on paper only. its all up to you when you find the time and opportunity for these on your own for your own.

HR at Standard Chartered suxs. it does not exist to assists, guide, *gawd forbid* mentor, inform, defend, enforce employee supportive policies of any sort - it is merely a tool to recruit fodder for the grinder, and ensure paper filling exercises with fancy names are completed, mostly post dated - just to complete the process. you will not have an HR relationship manager that you will have ever met. and if you have nothing will ever have come out of it in your favor. 

benefits. these don't exist beyond the statutory requirements of 'medical' and 'housing' - which as statutorily defined are a third of your paltry basic pay - because they are a 'reward' structured organization - with competitive salary structures.. but this rule is not  uniformly applied for there are numerous examples to the contrary - entirely composed of fresh hires... not all of whom are fortunate enough to get this exemption..."
