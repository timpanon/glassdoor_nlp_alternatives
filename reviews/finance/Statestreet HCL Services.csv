* No work life balance... The reviewers himself delay the process deliberately to get over time .. so they push other members to work on over time... Eg.. if the dead line of a work is 1-3 pm most of the time it can be finished with in half hour but the reviewer won't review our wrk until the dead line comes , that's why they are delivering delaying process to get OT..most of the day we need to take overtime upto 2-8 hrs
* U definitely get life style health problems. beacuse in this company we can't plan our daily plan.. every day i wakeup at different time,sleep at different time, having food at different time... It's happen because of this overtime
* Most of the employees are from tamilnadu, they are the worst employees having no working culture...they act like a school toper.. having the mind that if i teach him it may affect my superiority ... So don't make close connection with them..
* Annual salary hike range between 500-3000... Mostly we get hike of 1k .. even some team has the hike of 500 only... So when u join here from another company u can demand higher salary later u won't get any hike as per industry standard..
* About 90% of the top management and leads are tamil . They don't consider other natives people concerns and compliant regarding tamil people... it's sad truth . Most of the employees from other states has no good option about this tamil employees
* Because of evey day over time we feel sleepy every day...we have holiday on Saturday and Sunday ...but because of this sleepiness we can't enjoy our week end
* Last not recommending this firm to anyone... Am just here because of work from home . When it end. I should leave this organisation"

2) Dont expect any hike every year hardly we may get 2% to 5% for top rating 6% to 8% max as numbers for that management may ask you guys to work for 12 to 15 hrs no surprises.
3) No proper cooperate work culture, only 24*7 work only no fun at work .
4) For AM and above position HR will tell you ll get variable pay, please dont believe them, i worked here for 3 years nether me or my seniors have got the variable pay ""0"" rupees till today, you guys ask your friends on this.
5) No proper support from the Sr. Management, they are more concern about the clients & production issue not the employees issue or concerns.
6)No cab facility is given to the male employees, for that you need pay Rs:-2000 per month again that will be deducted from your pay.
7) Most importantly the company ""HR"" they will never respond to the emp concerns or the issues, due to shortly of HR in the company, only HR has to manage a team of 100 to 150+ emps, just imagine how are they managing.
8) For freshers is good company not for the exps employees guys, they have so many layers in the hierarchy to reach Manger it will take minimum of 5 to 8 year if you joined ad TL/SME.
9) 3 months is the notice and its a locking for your carrier growth no companies are ready to hire you unless you are highly skilled and the need to the process, so plz think twice before joining SSCHL.
10) Only 18 leaves here in SSCHL and 5 client off that you need take permission from your manager, no sick leaves, no Indian holidays (double pay for 26th Jan,15th Aug, 2nd Oct & 1st May).
11) Finally on FNF settlements, its been 45 months still no reliving or my FNF that i have got so for from HR team, i sent so many mails on this still they are saying some non sense reasons for it, from the date of joining till getting your reliving letter its big headache, if you want spoil your career, work life balance and peace of mind plz join this company, else take wise decision, its mine humble request or advice to all friends.

Good luck.","Not recommended to any friends, no growth/no hike and no work life balance."
