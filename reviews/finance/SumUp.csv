1,SumUp,Good people but very top down,2022-04-06,3.0,Anonymous Employee,"Colleagues are collaborative and kind to one another, fun environment",Top down. Many acquisitions may have led to quite a political culture
2,SumUp,Great culture and amazing product,2022-03-29,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"I joined SumUp not that long ago and I was amazed by the company spirit. For the first time in my life, I am wearing branded clothes and it is not just because I love our product but also because I am proud to be part of the SumUp team. Also, it is perfectly fine to wear a sweatshirt although you are part of the financial team :smile:
Within my department I feel free – free to share my ideas and point of view, free to do whatever I find suitable in a specific situation and not be told how an issue MUST be handled. Of course, such kind of freedom is not for everyone and most probably this is the glue within the team – we all like to be free.
For just a couple of months, I learned a lot and not only technical stuff (as there are various internal and external training options) but also how to be a better human being in the first place and how important that is. The way the war in Ukraine is currently handled within the company is another reason to feel pride.
Of course, there are downsides to every place on this earth, but personally, I find an opportunity here. If sometimes is broken, I get a chance to fix it and learn from it. If a process is not well designed – I have the opportunity to change it and grow.
In material terms – there are benefits such as a (significant) training budget, additional days off to use it, annual paid leave is 25 days, health insurance, life insurance, internal training.
In summary, due to all the freedom, everything could seem chaotic when you first join or hear about the company, but after a week or two, you realize that chaos is actually the willingness to provide the best.",My personal downside is the office location that's why I highly appreciate the opportunity to work from home :)

7,SumUp,Stay away from Controlling,2022-03-24,1.0,Accountant,Overall good product aimed at small merchants.,"Highly unprofessional management. Total disregard of the so promoted company values from the management, looks good in theory yet in practice cant' be further from the truth . Way below market salaries at the same time a workload that is not manageable at all. Chaos reigns in controlling in terms of processes and good practices. The only good practice that can be derived from that experience is how not to treat the employees (they are treated like vermin from management and in better cases as slaves) and how not to manage a team let alone how shouldn't an accounting team look like. You can't learn anything (inadequate both professional and social experience) while at the same time you will be overwhelmed with work and tasks that have been butchered to this extent that you would wonder whether it wouldn't have been better if it wasn't even ""done"" in the first place."

18,SumUp,An absolute disappointment,2021-11-26,2.0,Anonymous Employee,"Really depends on what you're expecting out of a workplace. There are lots of social events and the kitchen fridges are always stocked with sparkling wine and beer, but I particularly would want different things. Met incredible coworkers and did grow a lot professionally, so those were the things that made a difference for me.","So many... People cry in bathrooms and have panic attacks from interacting with leadership, all the big projects this year ended with people resigning immediately after finishing them because the pressure and lack of support were just too high. Leads and HR seem to work hand in hand to stop promotions and complicate career progression. Office politics are high and you'll get nowhere if you're not a show-off. A true burnout machine."
19,SumUp,Average at best,2021-11-24,3.0,Marketing,They have money to throw around which is good as it allows for experimentation. Most people there are nice and there are benefits to fill the gap where they know they need to improve.,Highly different experience depending on which team you are in. Also believes they can get away with an extremely pressured environment (many people suffer burnout) by throwing a generic perk at it rather than solving the actual issue. Suffers badly from office politics.
20,SumUp,"Best part are the employees, from leadership is not trustworthy",2021-11-18,2.0,Mobile Engineer,"The company mission and products themselves are interesting. Obviously this is a tad subjective.

Good feedback and collaboration culture: Coworkers are always up to give you a hand and provide valuable and constructive feedback. There's almost always someone to answer your questions and help you out

Making a safe space for diversity: Although there's plenty of work to do, the company has good initiatives to make people of different ethnic/nationality/gender backgrounds feel
 welcome.

Work and life balance is good, and there's also mental health panels and discussions every now and then.

The urban sports club subsidy is very nice.","Mediocre salary and benefits. 
For engineering positions compensation is underwhelming, even though the company claims their offer to be ""competitive"". To make it worse it varies across teams with similar qualifications and experience. 
As a foreigner after some time in Germany, I learned I was being significantly underpaid by talking with external recruiters. Offers that SumUp had no intention of matching. 
They will try to justify it by claiming it's consistent with their internal ""ranks/scales"", but these are never communicated and you don't have any way of verifying their claims. You just have to ""trust them"".
No automatic raises take place, you have to go ask explicitly for one.
Benefits are laughable, other than urban sports club, you get almost nothing for public transportation. No equity, no lunches/breakfast, bellow average vacation time, ok private pension scheme.

Leadership is not trustworthy.
They destroyed our trust with the layoffs earlier this year. The entire ordeal was managed unprofessionally, irresponsibly, and with complete lack of action to reflect and do better. 
Full responsibility was never taken, it consisted of empty apologies with no action whatsoever to regain that trust. Giving a sabbatical month after 3 years of work does not make up for showing they don't care about their employees.

Teams are silos.
With the excuse of being more ""agile"", squads were restructured as smaller teams which only introduced silos of people working separately and collaboration took a big hit. Cooperating with other teams became much more cumbersome and time consuming.
This change also introduced unnecessary middle management with the expected micromanaging that comes with it.

Going the extra mile gets you nothing.
Even during the toughest moments during the pandemic, we worked hard to bring features and products forward, all we got from it was kurzarbeit and nothing else even as the company started making a profit again. Even if you collaborate with things outside your job description, and even profession, you won't get a thank you, even less some sort of bonus.

No Engineering roadmap or leadership.
SumUp is a company with thousands of employees, it stopped being a start-up a long time ago, stop using it as an excuse.
For a company that claims to be ""tech"", it's a significant flaw not to have company wide engineering policies and roadmaps regarding best practices, design and architectural recommendations, documentation etc. Each team is encouraged to make such decisions independently, but with even more team fragmentation happening, the result is a lot of inconsistent design choices within the same codebase.
In the case of mobile engineering, there's no leadership or roadmap in place to make a reliable and robust product. For example, the CI is ridiculously unreliable, and no one wants to allocate resources to work on it.
With this points in mind, the engineering onboarding process is virtually non-existent, you have to figure it out by yourself and wait for someone to have time to assist you.

Diversity performativity.
Even though the company tries to foster a diverse workforce, this doesn't apply to leadership. It consists in its vast majority by white cis men that happen to be friends with the CEO.
Diversity MUST also come from leadership positions."

Their products really do help a lot of small merchants, it was always very touching to see the stories of people’s lives which had economically improved thanks to sumup","The restructure in spring of 2021 was the most poorly executed layoffs I’ve personally witnessed. The narrative for why it was necessary made no sense at all and felt like a cover up for the real answer. I was part of one of the affected teams and it was awful to see how little planning went into retaining the employees left behind. The department leadership was silent for weeks allowing the team to stew in confusion and fear. It was especially alarming as up until that point, there was so much focus in the company culture on “we care” and then from one day to the next it did not matter at all. Actions spoke louder than words, seeing how quickly everything could change left me with a memory of SumUp being inauthentic and almost sinister. It’s a shame because it took a lot of work by a lot of people to build the formerly healthy and positive culture, only for it to be completely destroyed in a matter of months"

That being said, they have no idea how to handle their size and growth, and the direct victims are the employees: HR might as well not exist, career development is 100% up to the employees, no guidance whatsoever are offered.

You're most likely to be fired because of some restructurations than to have a good professional growth path.

They treat employees like cattle. All the while pretending to care, but one look behind the iron curtain and you will realise management has no idea what they're doing, and that all the bullets are taken by lower employees.

Growth opportunity and career ladder are well defined.","The company, on the whole, could be a great place to work and grow, but your happiness depends directly on the team you work with. Mine was very top-down, which meant agreeing to the things that were very wrong just because the higher-ups had already decided. Very toxic.

Some teams are not remote-friendly at all and passive-aggressively try to get you to the office. If you speak up then you become a ""culture misfit"" and they give you a 2-hour notice. I was even warned by one of the colleagues ""you can't work in the team if you don't come to the office"". And this was during the peak of the third wave. Even though my work was amazing and my peers loved working with me and looked up to me, not coming to the office had a huge impact on my termination. 

There's an inner circle of people who have been in the company for a long time. Agreeing or actively saying yes to them is encouraged ""to keep it simple""."

It helps to bare with all the inconvenient that this company has.","- They have decided to do a whole restructuration of the organisation of the support department, without consulting the Customer Agents beforehand. This had awful repercussions to the working conditions of the Support Agents. Our workload has increased, our tasks are not clear and we are forced to deal with unhappy Merchants that are mad to not have their issues resolve. On top of that the management is messy, no one is competent to find solutions to our problems and no one is taking the courage to say that they have made a mistake and it is simply not working ! They call their lack of communication a ""misunderstanding"" and keep reminding us that if we are not happy, we can always leave. 

- The workload is incredibly stressful for a Customer Agent. There is too much to know about all SumUp products and it is honestly not worth the pay we are getting. The salary is not competitive and it is very sad to see colleagues and employees that have been here for years calling in sick week after week due to burnout or resigning from the company due to the lack of directions.

Nice office with a great view over Berlin
Beers, snacks etc. 
Great diversity and inclusion initiatives from colleagues/employees","C-Level management is very corporate and old-school, especially after Executive VP of Europe has left (or let go, we don’t actually know) earlier this year it just went down hill. The company has no interest in the small business owners, even though they try to portray it that way. If anyone is looking for a job with even a little fulfillment or purpose should stay away from SumUp. It is a very traditional financial service hidden behind the very basic start-up ‘perks’ and behind the lie that they want to empower small business owners. Many companies have these marketing-oriented missions of course but it is so clearly fake at SumUp that it hurts.

Daniel Klein is obviously a ‘my money before everything’ kind of CEO and has little idea about what he is doing and gives zero cares about his employees. It becomes more clear every time he gives any presentation. He leaves people with a lot of questions and confusion after each meeting and leave it to the middle management to deal with the aftermath. Nothing seems transparent in the company and it always feels like someone is hiding something. The lay-offs happened in May was disastrous. After that most people have lost their trust in the company, the energy in the company changed negatively, it was obvious even in Slack channels. Many people who were let go were on probation period and it had nothing to do with their performance or anything. If you decide to work at SumUp, you should know that you can be let go any minute during your probation period as a result of the incapabilities of the management.

You should also always get ready to accept top to down approach of how decisions are made. If you have worked at a new-generation company before, it might be hard to adapt to this old-school, non-transparent and exhausting approach."

This, combined with high level of confidence and sometimes even arrogance makes the work unpleasant especially when being micromanaged..

They respect work/life balance. No one is expected to work late hours.

There are individuals within the company working to make it a better place.","The one who speaks the loudest gets his way. People who are consistent in their work yet quieter are often ignored when they do speak up or not valued as much.

Often teams don't work together or share resources and can even be blockers to each other.

They do not perform postmortems and there isn't a cultural ""Why didn't this work?"" after a project. More often then not, the excuse is, ""This is just the fast culture here.""

The company certainly has the money for more personnel resources (such as copywriters, designers, videographers), and yet it is consistently lacking them, causing long and major blockers. 

There's an attitude, ""We don't have to be friends. We just work together."""
141,SumUp,A well-rounded review of a good company with the ambition to be great,2019-07-17,4.0,Engineer,"- It is a very exciting place to work. The people are really great and I enjoy to come to work every day with such smart people who are really nice.


- The company is doing well financially (able to attract large financing) and is experiencing huge growth in customers, employees and bottom-line revenues.


- I’ve been here over 1 year and the number of people doubled. Latest announcement was 1500 people globally. It’s quite exciting the rate of growth and I enjoy meeting new people from all over the world.


- I like the vision and purpose. The vision is to build a world where the customers can do what they love and the purpose is to empower them on this journey. I feel that this allows me to have more freedom in my day to day work than I have had at previous employers.


- I feel that I get to have my say. There are employee surveys, weekly ""all hands meetings"", regular ""ask me anything"" sessions.


- I like the change to agile and I have enjoyed the coaching I got from the company helping us with this. I think this will help us to make better products, faster in the long run.


- I have gotten to travel to many places. There are many offices globally and I have gotten to visit 3 so far. People are also always visiting the Berlin office and I get to interact with people from all over the world regularly (the Berlin office is already very international).


-There is a yearly hackathon for engineers. A week away to have fun and work on interesting technical challenges.


- They support my education. I have been given the opportunity to travel and go on a course this year which was nice.


-The future - payments is interesting and there are a lot of exciting ways the company can go in the future. So I see a good future here.

- There are groups of people that do things like looks at how we can be more Eco friendly or how we can improve the working environment and lean-in groups for diversity.","- More experience and leadership skills need to be added. As with most growing companies people with little experience become managers. But I do see a big effort to upskill them and hire more experienced people.


- Can be demanding - my work life balance is definitely shifted towards work. But this is the reality of where SumUp is as a company. Competing in many competitive markets, whilst also undergoing huge change.


- Move faster… There is a conscious effort to speed up. But I think the fast growth and old way of doing things slowed us down. Again there is an effort to change. Needs to happen faster though.


- People mentioned work from home as a negative. I have had no issues doing this in my team. I was told it's a team by team decision and our team is good with it.


- Could be more holidays. It's lower than what I had before and also I know friends get slightly higher in other companies.


-Office in Berlin - The main office situation in Berlin could be better but the location is good (Alexanderplatz)."
142,SumUp,Good for unexperienced people,2019-07-10,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"Friendly and young environment, breakfast, beers, kitchen.","Top management is not up to its role, and this can be seen from the fact that valid people are not valued while they tend to keep people who have no idea of how to work. Salaries are not standardized for a particular job position, on the contrary it can happen that people earn a third more than their colleagues working in the same position. This depends on how much managers like you. Apparently sympathy is a key value for the company. There are no bonuses except for customer service, extra hours of work are not tracked and it is not possible to work from home. They promise you an extra vacation day per year up to a maximum of 4 at the interview, but the contract does not mention any of this. It is possible to make a professional career but the salary is not adjusted to the new position."

If you can keep up the pace, there are plenty of career opportunities there since the company is growing really fast!","Due to super fast growth, the company is disorganized, everything change in the matter of minutes and you have to constantly submit everything you do to the directors and CEO, that are constantly micromanaging everything.

Super long hours and little work life balance due to the amount of work - SumUp does have a great office, with nice things to do there, so if you are alone and like to be in the work environment, you'll make friends and be there most of the time, but if you have a family, you'll be spending less time with them."

166,SumUp,"Great people, challenging technology, and open to feedback",2017-09-25,5.0,Software Engineer,"- Lots of autonomy to try new things. You don't get bogged down in bureaucracy to experiment.
- The business progress is very promising - you can believe in the vision of the company and the numbers back it up.
- The people are very friendly. There are a lot of social events, which can be really great because the company is very international and a lot of people don't come to Berlin with a network. 
- On career development -- many reviews say SumUp doesn't support this. Contrarily, if you take control of your own career development, you will find tons of support: the company sponsors visiting conferences, courses, many people from other areas are promoted to new positions in the company. But you need to find your own path and not wait for someone to take over for you.","- Communicating with other offices can be challenging - but not more than in other international companies, I believe. But you have to be aware that you work differently when your colleagues are also remote.
- You need to be self-directed to succeed here. It's not for everyone, but if it is for you then you will move mountains."
