After extending my probationary period the obese lazy unteachable TL who felt threatened by me terminated my employment. I constantly felt bullied by him. HR we’re not presented at the termination. The reasons read out to me by him revealed that he loved terminating my employment and had clearly done this before. 

I had to go down fair work and ended up getting the remedies I wanted as well as monetary compensation. I am placing this review as I think people should be aware that this company is nothing about their Motto, “This Australian Life” and it’s not worth going through the stress. 

I was over qualified for the role with degrees in legal and heath as well as experience but sadly wasn’t good enough for TAL. Hope that speaks for itself."

Like any corporate role, your experience will depend largely on the supportiveness and approachability of your leader and their leaders. I was provided with many opportunities for career advancement and movement into other departments. This applies to all, even if you are starting at the very bottom of the ladder like I did.

My experience was that management is generally supportive of your career goals and helping you maintain your work-life balance. The flexibility of the organisation is excellent - work from home is available and very common (even pre-COVID), and they are open to flexible leave and working around other commitments. If flexibility is important to you, Suncorp is a great place to work.

Targets were that were set were achievable. Office location in Wellington right by the railways and bus station was very convenient for public transport.,"Outbound sales roles were made totally redundant while I was there. Admin, Accounts and Quality Assurance roles where being outsourced to India. Pay rate was very low, less than the NZ  living wage in NZ.  For employees who are expected to be professional dealing with customers it simply was not paid well enough. There were incentives, yearly bonuses and shares issued if you performed at or above satisfactory level in your role. If you attained incentives, yearly bonuses and were  awarded shares it only brought your pay up to a living wage level.  When asking for what you are legally entitled to be paid regarding annual leave, overtime, etc they vindictively punish you for asking for what is legally yours.  Extreme selective nit picking of some staff and not others by management. told to put the customer first and when you do that you are then told that you are not to do what you are doing. Basically want you to pretend to offer good customer service while leaving out the truth about aspects and clauses of insurance policies. Going out of your way to help a customer also negatively impacts your statistics incentives and bonuses are based on. But hey guys we really want you to put the customer first... yeah right!"

Suncorp creates a community culture which fosters harmony in the workplace, with an employee base who are generally 35+ suncorp is great for employees who are looking for a long term career prospect with great job security and a sense of family within the workplace. With management supporting workers movement to other departments to experience more sides of the business and a very generous policy on flexible working arrangements, I would reccomend Suncorp for workers who are looking for long-term career roles, or require flexible working arrangements to suit their out of workplace commitments.","Suncorps culture may not be for everyone, with little to no commission structure, and an arbitrary bi-annual bonus structure based on the budget management has set aside, younger millennial or workers looking for high performance high paying roles may find themselves quickly suffocated. Suncorp tends to utilize secondments over promotions to ensure workers are given different roles and responsibilities to understand the business better and decrease the repetitive nature of their roles.  But ultimately this leads to lack of promotion, with workers returning to their original roles and not having any potential for vertical movement."

This creates an excellent culture that could lead to thriving and long careers.","Change is important to deliver the sound vision that Michael Cameron has created, however my opinion is that there is too much unneccessary change. Strategy changes, structures change continuously and people change constantly. This leads to uncertainty, stress and an unstable environment which makes it hard to get work done and/or innovate. The ultimate impact is on the customer."
584,Suncorp Group,Leave your brain and integrity at the door,2017-12-15,1.0,Financial Modeling,Opportunity to work from home one or two days a week - dependent on who you work for.,"I was brought in at a salary far below market, and assured I could renegotiate after six months. 18 months later, I was still on the same salary. When I pointed out to management that my salary was well below that of other people in similar roles at Suncorp, I was told that they couldn't bring other people's salaries down, and were trying to cut costs, so if I didn't like being paid far less than other people I could just get stuffed. Partly this was because of regulatory changes that came in after I joined which made my role less necessary in the eyes of management (which they aware of when I joined, of course). However, when I asked if they could assist me in moving into a different role, since I had performed phenomenally in this one, they just blew me off. The manager who originally hired me (and who subsequently quit as well) was so disgusted at how they had treated me he used my personal contact information to contact me and tell me to look out for myself and start looking for another job. Management at Suncorp display zero loyalty to their staff and have zero interest in investing in them or developing their careers. When I finally got a job at another bank, my pay went up by over 40% instantly. I didn't even need to negotiate - that's what they offered me right out of the gate.

Suncorp has a culture of manipulating models to give the numbers that management find most politically convenient. Most of my time was spent running and rerunning the models with different inputs and parameters until management got a number that they liked. If the number was too high, we'd go back and fiddle with the model inputs to get the number down. At one point, I showed them that a model they were using was completely methodologically incorrect, to the point that the numbers it produced were meaningless. They eventually acknowledged this, but elected to keep using it because it had been officially ""validated"", and if they changed it now they would have to go through the validation process again which is a nuisance. They would also probably have to explain to their superiors why they had been feeding them incorrect numbers for so long. At my performance review I was chastised for being ""too focused on academic accuracy"". 

It's almost impossible to get anything done at Suncorp, because management don't work with their staff, rather they fight with them and actively undermine them. For example, at one point I produced a new model for the bank that met every standard of quality. I was able to complete all the work in just one morning. One manager didn't like it (I suspect he had an agenda), and spent the next three months trying to do something himself. Everything he did was methodologically incorrect, and I had to fight with him endlessly before he finally gave in and deferred to my model (as noted, Suncorp management don't really care whether their models are correct or not). At my performance review, there was no acknowledgement that I had been right all along, and that if they had only listened to me they would have saved three months of the bank's time and money. 

On another occasion, I found an error in a model that was causing our numbers to be completely disproportionate. The two managers who presided over the decision whether to fix the error or not declined to allow the change. One of them believed that if an error in a model causes a number to be twice as large as it should be, that's good because it just means the model is being ""conservative"" (again - not sure whether he had an underlying agenda or is really that daft). Before I quit, I discussed my experiences with some other staff. They told me that they also spent most of their time fighting with management to get anything done. One person told me it was the worst place they had ever worked. 

At my performance review I was attacked for having ""poor communication"". Now, I worked for many years in a teaching and public speaking role, and one thing I was always praised for was my unusually good communication and oratory skills. In fact, after I gave a presentation to a room full of people at Suncorp, another member of staff approached me and commented on how well I spoke. This makes me think Suncorp management have a culture of inventing phony criticisms about staff when they don't want to pay them fairly or are trying to force them out for their own political reasons. In fact, when I was applying for my next job I was praised for my good communication skills in the interview. Suncorp have a review system where for each attribute you are either failing to meet, meeting, or exceeding expectations. However, it was very obvious that people's direct managers were strongly discouraged from giving anyone exceeding because management didn't want to have to give anyone a raise. The whole process is entirely dishonest.

I would strongly recommend considering other options over Suncorp. If you have no other options, just leave your brain and your integrity at the door. And don't show them any loyalty, because they certainly don't show their staff any."

- Good work culture - everyone seems to leave at 5pm, nobody stays back
- Relaxed office vibe
- Great offices with stunning views of Sydney","- Excessive micromanagement - staff are not given any sense of autonomy of their role an are treated like mere kindergarten children, with every single move being monitored and judged. Cannot even go to the bathroom without needing to explain where you were! You need to tell the leaders constantly what you are doing, and the excessive micromanagement makes for a poor working environment with low morale on the floor 
- Unrealistic target - targets at KPIs that simply cannot be met, as the organisation has contradictory goals (mission to have excellent customer service, however targets for taking as many calls as possible where it is next to impossible to provide good customer service within a time restriction)
- Middle management - these people have no understanding about how to manage teams and create engagement within a call centre. All they care about is meeting their own personal KPIs, which includes ensuring their 'teams' are taking as many calls as possible, and rejecting claims so the business can cost-save. Managers are not leaders, and are unapproachable, very unfriendly and turn their noses up to entry-level staff. 
- Zero career progression to move vertically - the organisation claims there is lots of career progression, however the movement is purely lateral (horizontal), where you end up doing the same tasks but in a different functional department, without appropriate pay. Suncorp also does not hire internal candidates for their Graduate Program, which I find absolutely goes against their core values. The organisation seemingly advertises ""internal"" positions, however any internal positions are actually filled through favouritism or an external person (for vertical movement roles).
- Constant restructures - there are organisational restructures every 3 months. If your role changes, you are basically forced to sign a new contract otherwise you will be ""let go"". There is a clause in their EBA which allows them to do this to avoid paying out redundancy 
- Pressure to work extra hours when no extra benefits are given
- Little or no on-going training or development for your role. The induction program is great, however that is where the training invariably ends."

As I live just over an hour from the office this has been life changing.

The atmosphere in the offices is great, everyone is helpful and friendly, and they're always kept very clean and tidy with no obvious health and safety risks.  For those all about the money, they offer extra for working weekends and evenings, and often email the consultants offering extra shifts at overtime rates when it's busy.","The only issue I've had is inflexibility of hours, however, this is just because of the award that I'm on.

- your work efficiency is openly disused with the wider team on why you didn't achieve target, furthermore it is detailed on a whiteboard for the entire floor to see - at times can be very demotivating when you've tried your hardest
- poor management in terms of knowledge, people skills and ability to drive a team to success 
- a billion and one new ""special projects"" are run time and time again to improve staff engagement but nothing ever eventuates, management does not listen, it seems the conversation is held just to tick a box
- no flexibility with annual leave - Especially with the team leaders who have been there the longest they are more concerned regarding their team stats
- management assume rather than read and review the EA agreement or consulting with HR, 9 times out of 10 they are usually wrong
- in home claims- limited career progression

The Insurance part of the business is where you will find the best opportunities.","The banking business has failed to increase customer numbers/profit from each customer.
The banking business culture is fairly conservative and is resistant to ideas that could significantly grow market share.
It seems that the board has given up on market share growth and has embarked on a program of large scale head count reduction.
At an executive level, IT strategy appears to driven by whitepapers from Netflix and a computer gaming organisation.

Outsource almost all back end processes to cheap offshore labour.
Move all IT systems into the cloud to facilitate head count reduction in IT engineering teams.

De-centralise IT teams and integrate remaining talent into more business focused teams.

The management are also very humane, something almost never observed in large companies.  There are great opportunities for long term development.","Sometimes a bit bureaucratic, probably due to the companies history as a former government business.  The senior management are professional managers and don't really necessarily understand the business.  They are also following out-of-date paradigms such as outsourcing many IT functions (savvy international companies are now in-sourcing key IT infrastructure, having discovered the hard way the outsourcing was a costly mistake).  Also, they are obsessed with cloud offerings without any clear understanding of the risk both to information security as well as operational efficiency (network latency is a major non-controlled issue).  IT processes are overly complex, it takes 6 people four weeks to set up an FTP capability.  There is also an unhealthy obsession with Agile development methodology, it operates largely as a cult and is deleterious to good development practice (if all you have is a hammer, everything looks like a nail)."

This is because in order to score well and therefore receive a good bonus you have to do tasks that don't necessarily relate to your job - For example, set up a <Insert Job Role> community. Although the desire to have such contributions from staff is founded, encouraging it via bonus incentives means that staff do work based on how it contributes to their score, not how it benefits the company, their team or project ..."
