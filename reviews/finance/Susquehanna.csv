IF you end up on the Australian Options market making desk, then AVOID at all cost. Uncivilised, unhygienic and pompous egos which is laughable.

Other fun perks (poker tournament, free zoo trips, baseball games). Great for introverts. We all had standing desks. Provided WFH setup.","No titles which I think makes growth difficult-- and harder to use market research in salary negotiations. Lots of individual work and very little collaboration. Work-life balance is a challenge (9-hour days). Most teams stuck in old tech (they don't use Git, some teams still stuck in Python 2). This company is not people-first-- it was clear to me at least that management cares more about money than its employees. Employees have been fighting for the option to wfh for years, and even after quarantine they're still fighting. Really just off-putting company culture. But if you enjoy mostly working on your own, getting a big paycheck, and working for the weekend (no shame in any of that!) then this might be a good place for you-- that's why I think it's not a bad place to end your career. I do think it's a mistake to start your career here though."

50,,"Great pay, management, benefits and people!",2021-10-22,5.0,Recruiter,"Competitive pay - I believe that hiring managers truly care about employees being fairly compensated for their work. I felt this way when I initially got the job, and still feel this way on the other side of it (as a recruiter)!

Excellent management - The firm seems to have done a great job at placing the right individuals in management positions (and attracting them to begin with). They all treat me with respect and have never turned me down for a meeting or left any of my questions unanswered, plus they've been generous enough to give me plenty of their time whenever I've requested it. Additionally, my direct manager has given me plenty of autonomy, not micromanaged me, and demonstrated flexibility in finding the best way for me to grow within my role. 

Great Benefits - Employees are genuinely treated with dignity by being given unlimited sick days off; plenty of vacation days (plus NYSE holidays off); catered food, snacks and drinks everyday; 401(k) with profit sharing; a gym; great medical, dental, vision and life insurance (along with other things like an HSA or FSA); a mail room; free supplies; plenty of events for employees (like renting out the entire zoo); and plenty of free tickets to local attractions and events.

Great founders/directors - On my very first day I had a great interaction with one of the founders. He treated me like we were one and the same. More generally speaking, these individuals just do what they love to do everyday and treat everyone around them equally. I've been genuinely impressed and I believe they've set a great standard for the firm.

Great culture/people - Everybody I've met has been nice! I think much of this comes down to management for hiring the right people and maintaining a pleasant culture, but surely everyone at the firm should get some credit for this too!","Honestly, I can't come up with any."

Everyone else is subject to the manager they've been dealt. 9/10 that manager is good at a job function and not people managing.

Employees of color have minimal representation and diversity and inclusion efforts are non existent. Lots of racial microaggresions throughout the entire firm that I witnessed first hand."

59,,Good before pandemic,2021-10-07,3.0,Business Analyst,People are generally nice. Free food.,"Long hours. Pay is on the low side, and the mentality is that they only care about the traders. No flexibility, and work from home policies only got complicated after Covid. Managers were in a rush to get back on site, and they require weekly testing even if you’re vaccinated. No clear Covid policies before or after…we spent a year of being told “next month” before going back. Then they brought people back and had an outbreak."

Good place to end your career in a safe environment.","Management committee don’t have any ideas. They just keep the lights on in Sydney and rely on offices overseas to send over good talent, strategies and systems. The office is really stagnant under their leadership.

72,,Leeches! Worst time of my life,2021-08-12,1.0,Systems Engineer,You get to work with lots of up-to-date technology. Office is based in central location in ifsc.,"Culture of presenteeism and zero trust of their staff.
Systems staff are treated like mules, bleeding them dry all year round.
Staff are expected to work extra hours for nothing.
Bonuses and salary reviews are a joke, and are justified by the mistakes you make rather than rewarding extra effort or positive impact you may have made.
Disagree with a manager and you’re out, they make life hell for you until you move on.
Lots of stress for v.little reward.
Very minimal investment in your education and development, has to benefit the business directly.
They employ lots of technically gifted people who can’t communicate properly which leads to very dysfunctional teams."

77,,Great company,2021-07-08,5.0,Software Engineer,"Great benefits such as a tasty cooked lunch every day, as many snacks as you want, a well equipped gym aa part of the office and regular personal touches to make you feel valued.

Working with very smart and driven people which makes it easier to improve your skills

Great pay but also reasonable hours that allows you to have a life outside work.",The work day is quite intense which makes it hard to catch up on continuous learning. Its shown by the tech stack being a little dated. Everyone there is open to modernizing things where there is benefit but you most probably can't start with untested toy libraries which would help make you marketable outside the company. Its not exactly a bad thing though because you are writing production code that is heavily optimized and used by users instead of switching frameworks every 6 months.

As a recruiter, it is encouraging to see all of the stakeholders being highly involved in the recruitment strategy development and being eager to help the recruitment team to improve the recruitment process. Tech teams are incredibly helpful and always eager to spend time with you explaining their work and team's focus.

SIG is also by far the company with the best benefits provided to employees that I've worked for. Free lunch and on-site gym, as well as a well-balanced employee assistance program which was especially helpful during COVID.","As any large company, change can be slow. We are adapting well to the changed work landscape in Australia, but it does require patience as we are not as quick as smaller organisations."

* There were major infrastructure components that I had used 20 years ago, that I thought the whole world had abandoned in the early 2000s, SIG is still using those
* Very long working hours. Every employee is required to work a 48 hour week, but 60 hours is not uncommon. Your average week will likely be 50 hours, 60 if you're on a support rotation.
* Company discourages lunch breaks. You will be expected to eat at your desk, or in the meeting. That's why they give you free lunch."

Anyway they will be trying to bluff you big time when it comes to the salary negotiations. I mean BIG time. And if you would fall for it - it would hurt your respect and future path. No matter your level I would guess you should target 30K$ than initial offer. This is minimum for juniour position."

Before coming to SIG I had heard rumors that long hours were expected, but that has not been the case for me. I work just as many hours as I have at every job I've been at. Even better is that I spend much more of my time at SIG doing what I was hired for and interested in that I did at past employers.

SIG has a great flat culture where anyone with a great idea and a vision to see it into action can get something done.","Prior to quarantine, remote work or work from home was allowed but maybe not encouraged.

See more in the cons.,"Stay away! Compensation is poor for technology. Get used to 0-3% raises and a bonus that is a pittance. There are no stock awards like other tech firms. Bonuses are a far cry from 100% base that most other HFT firms pay. Even Comcast has been paying better recently. Undergrad hires make 90k + 5k bonus, Grad hires get 120k + 10k bonus and after that small raises. Go to Citadel, Jane Street, D.E. Shaw or Hudson River Trading among a few if you want to be paid well. I haven't seen any ivy league or top tier school hires in tech in a long time. A lot of good people are leaving. Many people who don't pull their weight and are just clipping a paycheck (it is good work life balance, great job security because they never fire anyone in tech). You could be doing the job of n such people but only get paid n% more in recognition for that. Senior managers are busy trying to hire more people who report to them because that is how they make more money. I am glad to have left and should have done it a long time ago, will regret the loss in lifetime earning for a while. I personally know a few people who were contemplating the same.

Technology is very mediocre, nothing exciting. The firm operates at a scale where they can make money if the systems keep running. They have a lot of resistance to adopting open source technologies and instead develop poor ripoffs internally. As an example their version control system locks up regularly slowing people down, enough said!

Don't come here if you are young and looking to learn exciting technologies and make money."

I had never worked in finance, and I expected the worst. I was pleasantly surprised by the emotional maturity of the senior traders I met. They were generally calm and reasonable under pressure. They did not throw phones, scream at subordinates, or act like sociopaths.

Management did not attempt to control every detail of my life. My boss did not contact me outside normal hours except in extraordinary situations. When someone interrupted me at work, it was almost always for a legitimate reason. When senior quants overruled me, they were usually correct.

Most desks spent relatively little time on ego battles, office politics, and the usual playground stuff that dominates American tech companies. Everyone was too busy making money.

Nobody pressured me to do anything illegal.","During normal office hours, employees were expected to be at their desks almost constantly, even when eating lunch. That working style is common among traders, but somewhat stifling for others. I work better by taking long breaks when I'm stuck, then racing at maximum overdrive when I know what to do.

Quant work mostly consists of dull and frustrating data cleaning. I don't think this is the company's fault; it's the nature of the job. With supportive teammates, it's not so bad."

People should not have to be told when to do their job and have their hand held throughout the process. 

There are managers in the EOT space that are out of touch with the times. Their ideas are outdated, their terminology is outdated, they micromanage ... I could go on. These same managers do not take criticism well at all. They would rather figure out who the criticism came from instead of addressing the root of the problem.

The hours are LONG. You will work at least 45 hours per week and the compensation does not match. You will often hear praises from management about how efficiently technology does their job, but the pay does not reflect that. Year end salary negations aren't much of a negotiation either. It's more of a ""firm did great, you guys (tech) stopped the firm from losing millions potentially ... here's a couple thousand."" This leads to very poor work life balance.

- Wide array of benefits like discounted gift cards, on-site free food, etc.
- Access to senior level knowledge to help you learn. You can always ask someone for help, and will almost always get it, which makes learning a lot easier.","- Being so collaborative comes at the cost of no privacy and small work spaces - a constant feeling of being watched. It can be hard to sit and focus on anything when you keep getting distracted and interrupted by the seating arrangements.
- They will try to pay you as little as possible, so you need to know your worth and fight for it.
- They do not care about work/life balance and expect you to give up a lot of your own free time to help the business. No WFH options, don't even try (during normal business operations anyway). They think anyone who wants to work from home is just a slacker.

177,,Give it time,2020-02-26,4.0,,"SIG is kind of a weird company, but once you learn to tryst it, the people, and the weirdness it’s a great and fun llave to work. They do a great job of supporting local businesses with the catering and are getting better about having women’s programming. Although it’s not necessarily a diverse environment (especially in technology or on the trading floor), it’s a very welcoming and inclusive environment.

I think the difficulty with SIG is just really based on where you came from. If previously you worked somewhere with lots of hierarchy and titles and rigidity, SIG can be overwhelming in how relaxed and informal it can be. Other places might say they dress casual, but SIG actually means it. Yes people do actually wear shorts in the summer to work. 

If you are used to a micromanaged atmosphere, SIG can definitely take a while to get used to. I’m definitely very independent, but I have found for the most part people let you figure out the best pace for you to get your work down...and at first, this was scary. But if you learn to treat SIG with an honor system mentality you’ll do great.

I was worried after reading reviews I would find payroll raises to be nonexistent. However, after starting with a slightly low base salary, my first raise was decent/fair (not outstanding) and my bonus above target.",No working from home unless absolutely medically necessary.

The atmosphere is very modern and they have an open floor seating plan (which I didn't think I would like at first, but it actually made me more productive in the long run). Because of this, the teams are tightly integrated which was a refreshing departure from the 'silo' approach of sitting in a cube that I experienced in almost every other company I've worked with. 

They offer you the ability to learn new technologies across departments, and grow your existing experience with whatever they hired you for. I worked for the IT department under Bob and Rob, and they were two of the best bosses I ever had. Very personable, and easy to approach.

196,,"SIG, great people, latest technology, incredible growth.",2019-08-26,5.0,Senior Technologist,"SIG is a great company period.  I worked at SIG in the Technology space for almost twenty-three years. During that time, I worked with great people, worked on the latest technology and witnessed incredible growth.   

SIG’s biggest asset are its people.  I’ve worked with some incredibly talented people during my time there.  People that are smart, hard-working, team oriented and respectful.  I believe SIG strives to hire people with all of those qualities with equal emphasis on ALL of them.  As a result, it promotes an environment of constant learning, challenges and success.

It is not big leap to think that Technology plays a big role in most companies.  It is the same at SIG but the difference being, SIG constantly assesses latest technology and if any of it can provide a competitive advantage, SIG will leverage it no matter how new it may be.   They are in the business of assessing risk and that includes the use of technology.  For a technologist this is the best type environment to learn, grow and be successful.

As far as growth is concerned, over the last 23 years, I have seen SIG grow from 4 offices to 14 including international offices in Sydney, Dublin, Beijing, Shanghai and Hong Kong.  The bottom line is it did not stop growing the entire time I was there and there was no indication it was going to stop anytime soon.
I could close this review with a pros and cons list but I think that can be read in other reviews.  Some I would agree with and some I would not.  One pro that I will always give SIG big kudos is in the area of benefits.  They provided adoption assistance benefits 20 years ago during a time when it was not very common.   I may be a bit biased but if this is the thought that always comes to mind after being at a company for over twenty years that speaks volumes about that company.   

It is a great company with great people, using great technology to fuel incredible growth. I think nothing more needs to be said.",All jobs and companies have their challenges.  None here to merit a mention.

Some sections much better than others.,"I worked for this company for 10 years and had some horrible experiences. Some people are impressed by the free breakfast and lunch but this just means the company gets another hour of work out of you in a mandatory 45 hour + week. The interview process is brutal and you often don't hear the results. The company is very conscious about paying as little as possible by way of salaries and using whatever leverage they can against you. For example a friend of mine was there for five years and never got a raise because her husband was undergoing cancer treatment and they knew she could not leave and lose the health insurance. During the 2008 crisis they told everyone there would be no raises and bonuses because the company had done poorly. In 2009 they told everyone that they would be no raises or bonuses because despite the fact that the company did extremely well, the market was tight and they were lucky to have jobs and they could replace all the employees easily. It wasn't until the market turned around and people began to leave that the company panicked and began giving raises again and asking what else they could do to make employees stay. They are happy to take advantage of employees situation when it suits them and then complain when employees are not loyal. Certain groups are much better than others and certain managers are excellent While others are terrible. The programmers and developers in the technology and are treated extremely well. The Enterprise Services Group was treated very poorly and managed very poorly. Lots of incompetence and Empire Building and many broken promises. Management takes care of other managers even when they're incompetent or even abusive while employees are expendable. They promised training and education but whenever you applied for it suddenly there wasn't time in the schedule for it. They would tell you that education was part of your compensation package but it was next to impossible to get any training. I personally took on a project that was supposed to have several other people on it, and yet when these other people were removed from the project I was expected to meet the deadlines unchanged without the resources. In fact I ended up having to buy some software on my own out of pocket to finish the project. I even put off my vacation to the next year to finish the project on time after being assured that I would be able to take my vacation the next year. When the project was done the following year my position was eliminated and I was let go after 10 years of service and was not paid for my 5 weeks of vacation untaken nor was I given any severance. Susquehanna has a staff of excellent lawyers and they're pretty sure that you won't sue them unless you are in management. Managers get excellent Severance packages. Don't get me wrong there's some good groups to work for and you can learn a lot although advancement is extremely Limited. They have a tendency to hire Traders & quants in large numbers and then after a year firing the low performers. So many more strange things going on in this company that I don't have time or room for here."

I don't know how they choose who to elevate to management, but I saw two of the worst managers I have ever seen in my whole life while working here. ""Incompetent"" doesn't even begin to describe how these people behaved on a daily basis. Rude, aggressive, and outright hostile are more accurate descriptions (people being screamed at in front of their coworkers). For some reason, the ""great culture"" was touted to me when I was interviewing here, but in my experience, most people are only there to collect their check and cover their own backside. If you're considering working here, do not expect a collaborative environment. Do not expect to be welcomed into the prexisting tight-knit groups that are already there without a ton of effort.

256,,"Ops – Great Place to Work, Learn and Develop – It is what you make of it.",2018-07-22,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Working in SIG’s Dublin Operations department was a positive and rewarding experience in many ways. The many pros outweigh the few cons and I would highly recommend SIG as a place to work.

The working environment:
     SIG’s culture promotes a relaxed and open working environment where people are actively encouraged to interact. As a result, people can easily get to know one another on both a professional and personal level. 
     The office is full of talented and knowledgeable people, many of whom are experts in their respective fields, and who are overwhelmingly friendly and approachable.
     An open plan office, genuinely friendly employees and a management team that openly encourages cross team and departmental interaction results in a very collaborative work place.
     This collaboration is supported by a shared understanding that working together will develop a stronger business and result in better outcomes for all. There is also the reality that with so many intelligent people in the office, working alone and producing sub-optimal outcomes will likely become very apparent very quickly.

Trading Exposure:
     Operations directly support the day-to-day trading of the firm giving workers a great insight into the world of trading. Many operation teams sit alongside traders and work with them on everything from day-to-day trade flow management, to projects that can enhance trader’s tools to free up their time, to developing business opportunities in new financial products and markets.
     Operations in SIG is not like your traditional operations department found in Dublin. It offers true exposure to the front office.
     Proximity to trading often results in a faced paced and an exciting environment.

Management Style:
     Management’s well communicated approach is to hire motivated, hardworking and smart individuals who can drive the business forward and not simply just do a job.
     People are empowered with the freedom to make their own decisions and take direct responsibility of their work.
     Innovation and initiative are encouraged, if you spot something that can be improved, management do not stand in your way in implementing positive change so long as you continue to perform your day-to-day responsibilities. 
In all, they provide people with a platform to prove their ability.
     Recognition and rewards for hard work often come in the form of enhanced responsibility and learning opportunities through taking ownership of new areas and tasks. 
     When performing your job as expected, management do not look over your shoulder. They make themselves available with an open-door policy when advice and direction is requested.

Business and Development Support:
     SIG have large in-house development teams which actively build and maintain the majority of the firm’s day-to-day tools. The result of this is that you get to interact directly with the people who make the systems you use. You are given the opportunity to directly communicate issues, bugs and recommendations to them. For larger projects, people can also voice their requests and have a say in the direction of development, while in some cases, individuals are asked to actively work with the tech teams to spec out and then test such systems.
     While major emphasis is put on individuals to drive their own development, the company do offer good in-house training programmes across a variety of topics – from tech skills (VBA, Python, SQL etc.), financial products, market structures, to management techniques.
      There is a large and supportive HR team who make themselves available to all and offer good guidance when called upon.	

Personal Development:
     I learned a great deal at SIG and firmly believe that had I spent the same amount of time working elsewhere, I would have gained only a fraction of the knowledge and skills that I have now.
     Personally, I expanded my knowledge on all sorts of financial instruments, exchanges, markets and technologies, learned technical languages in VBA, SQL and Python, and developed project management, people management and communication skills.
     Development, as mentioned above, is not simply handed to people. SIG provide the encouraging environment and supportive management, while leaving the rest to the individual to use their own initiative and drive to put in the hard work required to build knowledge and develop skills. You are given the freedom, what you do with it determines what you get out of your time at SIG.

Benefits Package / Remuneration:
     Overall SIG pay pays well. It complements good take home salaries with a very generous benefits package which includes breakfast, lunch, gym, 5-a-side football, VHI, local store discounts, holiday gifts and merchandise, high expense holiday parties and prize money for various events (eg. all employees won $1,000 after the Eagles won the Super Bowl).","My time at SIG was overall very positive however there are of course areas for improvement:

Poor bonus structure:
     As mentioned above, people are typically well remunerated in salary terms. However I don’t feel the bonus culture for Ops is in line with general expectations for a trading environment. Ops bonuses are set a year out and act as pre-defined salary extensions so long as pre-set goals are met. While this is the standard for many finance jobs, it does not work as well in a trading environment where, more often than not, individuals receive a bonus proportional to their results for the year. In Ops, should you have a year of above expected performance and in some cases realise unexpected wins for the firm (substantial cost savings, business developments etc.), bonuses do not meaningfully reflect this.

Under resourced areas of business:
     During my time at SIG, there were pro-longed periods where certain areas of the firm (not just Ops) were under resourced. In some occasions, the issues may not have been foreseeable with unexpected departures however at other times the resource issue was due to poor planning, for example when well forecasted market changes required development focus and thus additional hires. The issue of low resources persisted for months and months in some cases and put noticeable additional pressures on various teams.

Senior management communication:
     There were many periods during my time when communication from senior management on firm strategy and direction were lacking. While laying down this criticism I must acknowledge that management, operating as a private company in a highly competitive external trading environment, could not afford full transparency on strategic direction. However there were still pro-longed periods where I and many of my colleagues were not entirely sure on the direction of the firm or the what the long-term objectives were. Towards the end of my time at SIG, I did see attempts to improve upon this communication.
     There were also occasions when this lack of communication was compounded by uninspiring and flat, firm-wide addresses made by the CEO and other C-level management. While there is a huge amount of respect and admiration levelled at the feet of upper management for their experience and achievements, I felt that many staff who were less aware of their history and reputation were left deflated after hearing their addresses.

The following are NOT cons and more realities of the job:
     Can be a demanding and pressurised environment – it is a trading firm after all!
     Fast paced means that targets and objective change regularly.
     Development is not hand-held.
     Freedom management offer can be perceived as a lack of direction – you must own your own development.
     There are some back office (mundane) elements, as there are with most jobs."

- Management not showing the example when it comes to transparency and holding up your arm and admitting when you messed something up
- When everything works it's just normal and because you're doing your job even if you and your team are breaking your backs and pulling out all the stops to make it happen

From  SIG's review, you will see it stands out with its ability to keep smart and good people.  Some of the good and smart people with decent technical backgrounds become the managers. However, with SIG's growth rate, some of street smart people grasped the chance and became the managers.

275,,Dublin Operations Department: Choose Larger Firm,2018-02-11,2.0,Operations Analyst,"Opportunity to learn VBA/SQL and put into practice through project work

It is a genuine front office environment where the operations staff share floor space on the traders so you get to witness the ups and downs of trading and the events which take place. If personality type is inquisitive and confident enough to ask the questions, the traders can be generous with their time. 

Line managers have good technical knowledge of the products traded and the mechanics of trading them however this has to be tempered with the fact that if they left this knowledge is not widely held. 

Good healthcare package 

Food and gym on site free of charge","Better to start career at larger firm which has a developed learning structure in place and promotes employee growth and development

No structured training program to enhance operations staff knowledge of the products and trading. All learning is primarily asking questions to the right people.

The advertising for the roles is very misleading. They are advertised in a way which implies heavy interaction with trading however as stated above the only knowledge to be gained of trading is by direct interaction with the traders. 

The day to day of the job is mundane, repetitive tasks which do not involve a huge amount of complexity. Reconciling versus prime broker data, crossing/blocking trades, liaising with cpty’s on settlement or other related issues. Even the potentially more interesting teams have a high level of mundanity in the role. 

No opportunities to move outside of the operations department. Some moves have been blocked in the past. 

Senior management of the operations department in Dublin seem slightly out of their depth and rely heavily on the knowledge and decision making of the line managers below them rather then making strategic decisions from the top down. In general I found that their knowledge of the products and trading was quite poor. Also personally wasn’t a fan of their management style. Very authoritarian and aggressive. More stick then carrot!"
276,,Great place to work in the Philadelphia area,2018-02-08,5.0,Technology,"* SIG employs some very smart people solving some interesting problems.    People are generally collaborative and good ideas are not shot down.  The one negative about this is that SIG can have a difficult time filling many positions in tech, since expectations are very high and the right candidate may not be ready available. 
* Flat management structure.  I can literally schedule a meeting and talk with anyone in technology.  I won't get turned away.
* If you are excelling at what you do, you are generally noticed and challenged more.
* If you have ideas, management will listen and there is a good chance it can be implemented.  Money spends can be justified and are not a barrier. 
* It's a financial industry company, but with a relaxed atmosphere and dress code.  This means jeans (and shorts in the summer). 
* Good leadership at the top.  The company thrives even in very tough markets.
* Catered lunch and breakfast
* Onsite gym and many other services like dry-cleaning pick up and onsite haircuts.  There is even a fancy espresso bar.  These are generally designed to avoid losing employee productivity time due to employees running out of the office, but they are nice perks. 
* Various company events, like holiday parties, night at the ballpark, 5k runs, etc.   There is definitely a good social culture.","* Lack of a policy that allows employees to work from home.  There are exceptions in certain cases, and this is changing a bit, but slowly compared to other tech-heavy companies.  
* The management structure is fairly flat.  However, this also impacts the ability to get things done.  You really do need to build consensus across many teams to get major initiatives done, and this will take time.
* Hours can get long and impact the work-life balance, especially with the lack of work from home policy.  This is fairly standard in the tech space unfortunately. 
* Few public transit options to / from work for those who live in Philadelphia itself (SIG is just outside of Philly)."

305,,It's definitely not a bad place to work,2017-04-17,3.0,Engineer,"There are managers that are passionate about the work and is open to suggestions.

Hands down the BEST training program in the securities industry. For tech and business. Very well thought out courses. Fresh grads should definitely come here to work for a few years, even if taking a pay cut. Especially if the securities industry is your focus.

Overall very well structured compare to other hedge funds or prop shops. Lot's of documentations for everything. Everything is very well planned out for new comers to pick things up quickly.

Decent compensation for the Philly area.

Tons of talented people and hard workers. I think almost everyone SIG is giving all they got but some are just more talented than others.

Free food and snacks. Some cool outside activities during the year. 

Management tries not to point fingers when human error occurs but actually tries to come up with solutions on how to fix them. This is really a rare trait and is highly undervalued.

Everyone is really trying, some just tries harder.","Compensation not really competitive on national market.

Growth and mobility is hard because how well defined the company structure is. This is really a double edged sword. Everything is very well defined and breaking barriers is hard. I'd say it's good for the company over all but it kinda screws people over that's been doing the same job for many years without an option for growth.

Yearly raises are terrible. You really need to hammer down you initial offer because expecting decent growth isn't going to happen.

Yes some managers are just clocking it in and out, but that's not the majority. If you get one of those then I feel sorry for you.

Some old tech still in play but a lot of people are working on phasing it out.

Too many production freezes and sign offs for changes. They are there for good reasons but some are just offensive. It's like they think we graduated yesterday. I'd say half of all the freezes are completely worthless.

Some luck does come into play for progression within the company. Depending on what work your manager assigns you, you might be an all star. Seen some people write some pretty impressive and important things, and some people just got lucky to write the important things. And those are usually turds.

Documentation is everywhere and is core to the culture. Switch is also a double edged sword because it makes everyone replaceable. Good luck using what you built as leverage for raises and such."

311,,Conflicting Culture. Long Hours. Bad for Tech.,2017-02-25,2.0,Engineer,"Fair disclosure: for every pro listed below, there's a ""business reason"" (e.g. productivity) for it and therefore, a con. Also, beware of the fake reviews - the 5 star reviews contrast greatly with the ones with low rating.

- Free food (Breakfast, Lunch and if you're lucky, take-out). Although you forfeit your lunch break/going-out-with-colleagues-ever
- Okay people to work with (despite some favoritism, like in any organization). The culture does in a way encourage ""mediocrity"" due to the clerical nature of work.
- Casual dress code (collared/polo shirts with jeans/sneakers - no T-shirts. But, SIG T-Shirts are allowed... Huh?)
- Convenience of facilities such as dry cleaning, laundry, car repair, detailing/body works, hair dresser etc. on site!
- Gym classes, if you have the time and money (most of them cost money)
- 401k with 6% matching","- I have seen over 5 people leave within the same team within less than a year. Clearly, the management doesn't want to listen and respond.

- Highly disorganized processes / inconsistent workflow at times with certain things that can leave (new) employees feeling stuck, drained, frustrated and even bored. If you're a creative person, this could be a nightmare.

- Despite what the HR/company claims about ""openness"" within the culture, the promises fall short at times when people are afraid to be themselves/express themselves freely, or have candid conversations with the senior managers. The place has a strange, hierarchial, corporate vibe to it - despite their ""attempts"" to make it Silicon-like - it's simply not and can't be.

- Free food  =  no going out, working throughout the day at your desk (no lunch break) or ...lunch meetings 2-3x a week. Smart move to keep you in the office.

- Long hours - min. 9 hour workdays mandatory (8 to 5, or 9 to 6) without breaks (45-50 hour work week typical). Yes, lunch is provided but in a way, it is a smart move to keep you in the office the whole time. Most folks eat at their desk either while working or at a stupid Lunch meeting 2-3x a week. The culture doesn't encourage ""going out"" for lunch at all. Work life balance is terrible.

- Due to the quasi-""flat structure"" of the company, there is little to none opportunity for advancement/career growth.

- No remote/work-from-home/flextime/flexplace policy for Tech! Really. They have the available secure technology to let employees work from home but no official policy. The managers may give you an okay on working from home under extenuating circumstances (you'll hear a word or two about it) but it seems like the practice is discouraged in the culture.

- Purely Decorative ""game room"" with XBOX/Playstations, 3D golf, poker room, library, gym, etc.: Yes, they have all these facilities they brag about that any employee/interviewee will fall in love with, but where is the time to use these? And if so, when is the right time? Perhaps, if you have time and energy after a 10 hour workday, you can go to the gym, but the rest of the facilities are largely decorative. All I see is work, work, work.

- Regulation, regulation, and more regulation: I am very uncomfortable with this. Part of it is to do with the finance industry, but they have a highly restricted web/surfing. ALL emails, IMs, messages are archived for years and monitored. I'm not alien to this policy at other companies, but the measures here take it slightly overboard, and ultimately people have to keep watching themselves at all times. This greatly conflicts with the ""open culture"". Also, Gmail/other external email systems, paste bin, etc. (basically anywhere you could type over 1 sentence ) are blocked out of fear of you exporting their trading secrets - this shows their distrust in employees and frankly the distrust is mutual.

- Little appreciation for work unless you are an old timer.

- 90% of the ""fun events"" advertised are held after 6 PM. Why would anyone, after a 9-10 hour workday want to go to poker or a meeting for ""team building"", unless they are peer-pressured (which this place has a tendency to do) ? This is bizarre, bad for employee health (i.e. no gym time) and work-life balance. Often times, their focus on the teams can fall short. Teammates at times seem to be imposing and nosy.

- Outdated technology to work with. Bad for technologists / software engineers! E.g. many teams are having discussions about migrating to ""JIRA"" (vs. the 1990 version of an inhouse product they used) in 2017 - something companies did 5 years ago! They don't want to invest in technology (or do the bare minimum) - everything has to be made into a ""business case"" and in terms of productivity without regarding what's new and what's best for employees. 

- Definitely, not for millenials or people who are creative and want to be part of the ""new"" side of tech.

- Work is largely company-specific. If you work here for some time, you'll ask yourself what are you taking with yourself to your next job? At other places, 70% of the work is specific to the nature/industry (e.g. for a software developer, it would be software development) and 30% would be company process-specific. Here it can be the opposite. 70% of the things you do will only be applicable to SIG and their systems. Where is the benefit for employee? What is the employee gaining out of it in the long run?

- Limited PTO (15 vacation days+2 personal days). Not the best in pay or benefits (health insurance, dental, etc.). Benefits are stingy (or just okay). Educational assistance takes 6 months to kick in. Fair disclosure: unlimited sick days (of course, they expect honesty from employees using them which is fair)."

- Free food (Breakfast, Lunch and if you're lucky, take-out). Although you forfeit your lunch break/going-out-with-colleagues-ever
- Okay people to work with (despite some favoritism, like in any organization). The culture does in a way encourage ""mediocrity"" due to the clerical nature of work at times. 
- Casual dress code (collared/polo shirts with jeans/sneakers - no T-shirts. But, SIG T-Shirts are allowed on Fridays...)
- Convenience of facilities such as dry cleaning, laundry, car repair, detailing/body works, hair dresser etc. on site!
- Gym classes, if you have the time and money (most of them cost money). 
- 401k with 6% matching","I have seen over 5 people leave within the same team within less than a year. Clearly, the management isn't responding fast enough. 

- Highly disorganized processes / inconsistent workflow at times with certain things that can leave (new) employees feeling stuck, drained, frustrated and even bored. If you're a creative person, this could be a nightmare.

- Despite what the HR/company claims about ""openness"" within the culture, the promises fall short at times when people are afraid to be themselves/express themselves freely, or have candid conversations with the senior managers. The place has a strange, hierarchial, corporate vibe to it - despite their ""attempts"" to make it Silicon-like - it's simply not and can't be.


- Long hours - min. 9 hour workdays mandatory (8 to 5, or 9 to 6) without breaks (45-50 hour work week typical). Yes, lunch is provided but in a way, it is a smart move to keep you in the office the whole time. Most folks eat at their desk either while working or at a stupid Lunch meeting 2-3x a week. The culture doesn't encourage ""going out"" for lunch at all. Work life balance is terrible.

- Due to the quasi-""flat structure"" of the company, there is little to none opportunity for advancement/career growth.

- No remote/work-from-home/flextime/flexplace policy for Tech! Really. They have the available secure technology to let employees work from home but no official policy. The managers may give you an okay on working from home under extenuating circumstances (you'll hear a word or two about it) but it seems like the practice is discouraged in the culture.

- Purely Decorative ""game room"" with XBOX/Playstations, 3D golf, poker room, library, gym, etc.: Yes, they have all these facilities they brag about that any employee/interviewee will fall in love with, but where is the time to use these? And if so, when is the right time? Perhaps, if you have time and energy after a 10 hour workday, you can go to the gym, but the rest of the facilities are largely decorative. All I see is work, work, work.

- Regulation, regulation, and more regulation: I am very uncomfortable with this. Part of it is to do with the finance industry, but they have a highly restricted web/surfing. ALL emails, IMs, messages are archived for years and monitored. I'm not alien to this policy at other companies, but the measures here take it slightly overboard, and ultimately people have to keep watching themselves at all times. This greatly conflicts with the ""open culture"". Also, Gmail/other external email systems, paste bin, etc. (basically anywhere you could type over 1 sentence ) are blocked out of fear of you exporting their trading secrets - this shows their distrust in employees and frankly the distrust is mutual.

- Little appreciation for work unless you are an old timer.

- 90% of the ""fun events"" advertised are held after 6 PM. Why would anyone, after a 9-10 hour workday want to go to poker or a meeting for ""team building"", unless they are peer-pressured (which this place has a tendency to do) ? This is bizarre, bad for employee health (i.e. no gym time) and work-life balance. Often times, their focus on the teams can fall short. Teammates at times seem to be imposing and nosy.

- Outdated technology to work with. Bad for technologists / software engineers! E.g. many teams are having discussions about migrating to ""JIRA"" (vs. the 1990 version of an inhouse product they used) in 2017 - something companies did 5 years ago! They don't want to invest in technology (or do the bare minimum) - everything has to be made into a ""business case"" and in terms of productivity without regarding what's new and what's best for employees. 

- Definitely, not for millenials or people who are creative and want to be part of the ""new"" side of tech.

- Work is largely company-specific. If you work here for some time, you'll ask yourself what are you taking with yourself to your next job? At other places, 70% of the work is specific to the nature/industry (e.g. for a software developer, it would be software development) and 30% would be company process-specific. Here it can be the opposite. 70% of the things you do will only be applicable to SIG and their systems. Where is the benefit for employee? What is the employee gaining out of it in the long run?

- Limited PTO (15 vacation days+2 personal days). Not the best in pay or benefits (health insurance, dental, etc.). Benefits are stingy (or just okay). Educational assistance takes 6 months to kick in. Fair disclosure: unlimited sick days (of course, they expect honesty from employees using them which is only fair)."
315,,Software Engineer,2017-02-16,3.0,Software Engineer,"- Relative freedom with how you solve problems (though technology is restricted)
- Free breakfast and lunch
- Nice people
- Decent / Good compensation for area
- Introductory level trader/market classes","- Implicit long work hours even though you work through every meal. Expected to work 10+hrs
- Farm-like, row after row of developers sitting elbow to elbow, cramped, no personal space or privacy
- Minimal communication between team members despite touting 'collaboration' 
- Very little upward mobility. Expect to be in your role for 5-10yrs
- Special Amenities cannot be used 95% of the time (game room, gym, etc)

OVERALL: 
Not the worst place to work, and definitely fine if you're starting off or don't have any expectations but if you're a hard-charger, motivated, passionate person you'll probably feel the life sucked out of you with the lack of inspiring or challenging work/environment. It definitely isn't 'Wolf on Wallstreet' or even an exciting place to work really. Overall, I'd give it an ""OK""."

- Opportunity to understand business and technologies many may not have exposure to
- Free breakfast and lunch (Although no cafeteria, expected to eat at desk)
- Onsite amenities (Car maintenance, tailoring, haircuts for men, car detailing)","- Very inflexible for a technology company; No laptops, only desktops and very limited work from home policy (Access is available to request, but highly discouraged. Only appears to be available for so many employees to work remotely at one time, causes issues in events that would keep many to all employees out of office - weather, city events etc.)
- Mandatory 9 hour days although this may not be explicitly explained during the interview process
- Work areas offer little privacy due to open concept layout and key technology space is very noisy. Unless you have a preference for open offices, it's very difficult to adjust to.
- Mediocre health plans"

The company will invest in you by sending you to modeling/writing classes, as well as sponsorship in the CFA program. Perks include free meals and casual dress code. Research Associates with 2-3 years experience can move to larger shops with better compensation, and occasionally the buyside.","SIG has a strong brand in the derivatives world, however the institutional equity business, namely Research and Research Sales, is an amateur organization at best.  The idea that SIG will leverage its Options expertise to build a strong institutional equities business has been unsuccessful as most equity investors do not care to understand derivatives (and vice versa).  Senior Analysts and salespeople are generally comprised of has-beens and never-will-be’s, which is par for the course at most small boutique operations.  Leadership is the real concern, as the defacto head of the institutional brokerage operation is a SIG-lifer with little brokerage experience, employing self-serving sycophantic department heads beneath him.  Sales tends to rule over the Research Department with little regard or understanding of the Research process (scheduling firm-wide meetings and other important events during earnings season).  Salespeople are loathe to make outgoing calls, save for one or two, and are typically interested in heading to the bar by 4:05pm.  The Director of Research is a former salesperson who embodies the company’s lack of understanding of how to run a research business.  This individual lacks research experience (and the respect of many senior analysts and associates), making up for that with canned speeches about the bright future of the business. Nearly 25% of the company’s Senior Research Analysts defected to competing organizations in the past year as the business continues to shrink under current leadership.  The firm has make some questionable hires to replace departed analysts, including individuals who have been out of Equity Research for more than 3-4 years.  With the NYC office’s lease up for renewal in 2018 many believe the founders may cut their losses and shut the business entirely."

347,,"Sterile, nerdy, masculine energy",2016-07-11,2.0,Trader,They know how to trade well and are good at rational thinking. The Assistant Trader internship might be the best internship in America. The poker culture is also solid even though the founders and higher ups (not talking about BC/JA) think about the game the way one would in the early 2000's and not the mid 2010's.,"No diversity: almost all of the decision-making is done by white males. Only women they visibly hire are in HR – they will do their best to include the few minorities/women that they do hire in every recruiting picture possible. (Look for repeating faces it's hilarious)

They will brag about their education department but it really isn't that incredible. Any real trader you ask will tell you how everything you'll learn about trading happens on the floor, talking to other practicing traders. There is one sharp fellow who was in education when I left, and I'm not sure why he isn't on the floor instead. The other two clowns up there are a soccer mom and a pompous neanderthal

There's another issue that at least applies to incoming Assistant Traders, which is: at every point in your lifetime at SIG, you will be ""priced in"" to continue to the next level. At no point do you ever think it's a ""rational"" decision to stop working there. For starters, they pay interns more than anyone else, and give the best intern experience possible. This sells you on the idea of becoming an AT. Then you're an AT and grind pretty hard to make trading class, so how could you possibly leave SIG after you make it to that? In doing so, you sign a non-compete and lock yourself into a non-competitive salary (for trading) for the next 3 years. You've committed to living in Philadelphia for the next 1000 days, with the promise of cashing in on the first year after the non-compete. Then after you think your payday has arrived, they shoot you a lowball offer since they are well-aware you already have a stable girlfriend/maybe wife, are planning to have kids, already call Philadelphia ""home"", etc. At every stage of your relationship with this company, they are so deliberately thinking about how to extract maximum value out of their employees.

There's no upward mobility any more. They've got everything in place, and it's REALLY tough to move up. If it were 2000 I would say you should definitely go work at SIG for this reason. No more, now they're just looking for cogs to make the system run smoothly.

Then there are the minor things. It's a company worth 11 figures, yet the office decor is bland and there's no color/art/character to the place at all. The food is repetitive and outside of the salad bar, pretty unappetizing and unhealthy.

Overall, if you are in SIG's hiring set (white/asian male who is good at math and has some common sense), you should either work:
– at a smaller trading firm with people who have better taste (you'll work longer hours for more reward), OR
– at a larger tech company like an Uber or Facebook, where it's still homogenous but at least you'll have laxer hours & good food, can live in a better city, and there's a bit more upward mobility, OR
– grind it out at a small startup where you aren't drawing dead to win big, even though the hours will be rougher"

I have the opportunity to solve challenging problems, with the freedom and resources to solve them properly.  Creativity is encouraged and supported.

There is a fair amount of opportunity for training and professional development, but don't expect to hit multiple conferences or training courses each year.  You're on your own for certifications and cert maintenance.

That said, overall I'd say that what they lack in premium compensation and profession development they by far make up for in challenging work, benefits, balance, and culture."

People say the free food but you are supposed to work through lunch. People who went outside to walk around the parking lot for air and sunshine were told that looked unprofessional. 
It is fun to watch the helicopter land and take off from the pad.","I worked here for ten years and watched clear favoritism with some employees allowed to skate through their job based on if a manager liked them or if they were attractive. Saw many hard working individuals treated poorly. People with tremendous results and reviews year after year kicked out when managers changed. At least they take very good care of management when letting them go, they get good packages. Regular employees? Often let go with no severance, and, due to a quirk in their system, if you have vacation unused or carried over from the previous year? You  lose it all. That's right. Five year, no severance, no vacation pay, please leave right now. 
THey have a dark culture in some areas, ruling by fear and intimidation. Reminding you at all times that they can replace you and you are lucky to have a job. They did that during the 2008-2010 dip. No raises and no bonuses in some cases...as they explained...we do not have to give you raises just because a year has passed. THe market for jobs is tight. So we have the upper hand. So...no raises. Some people went five years without a raise. Then when things got better they were shocked, shocked I say, when some of the best talent left. 
I watched people work 60+ hour weeks out of fear that less would lead them to be fired. I watched middle managers groomed by their abusive bosses to pass that abuse down the chain. Fear and intimidation. Sad. Again, not in Enterprise Technology, while that existed, but in Enterprise Services.

It is a good place to learn about the nitty-gritty of financial markets on a low level. They have a good technology infrastructure that really helps you on a day-to-day basis. Good information flow---important ideas travel fast in the organization.,"SIG has a pattern of  hiring people into finance, training them in a system, then not promoting them as they move up in skill level. Very few people move up instead of out (although some of that comes with any trading job). There is some of the usual bureaucratic inflexibility that comes with being a 1500-person company. They are also a little aggressive about non-compete agreements, which I believe stifle innovation in the economy.

Amazing perks including free breakfast, lunch, and snacks every day. A new gym, that actually has everything you need, and I'm a pretty serious lifter. The gym also has beautiful individual private shower rooms with shampoo and body wash dispensers, your own sink, bench, and towel service. A game room with poker tables, pool tables, arcade games, video games consoles, virtual golf machines, and other stuff I can't think of. Electric car charging stations. Dry cleaning pickup and drop off. On-site car detailing and servicing (that and dry cleaning you have to pay for). An on-site nurse practitioner that is completely free. Fitness classes. An international poker tournament in addition to a bunch of other stuff.

Aside from the amazing perks, it's also just a great place to work. There are so many talented and intelligent people, and you can walk up to any one of them and start a conversation. I was told a couple of the guys who started this company still show up to work everyday and sit right on the trading floor and talk with the employees.

The pay is also good, but I don't know how the raises are yet.","Surprisingly mediocre benefits. Health insurance is either high deductible or high monthly cost with smaller deductible and you are not fully covered.

401k contributions are only %50 matched for the first %6 of your salary. There is also a vesting schedule of %20 per year, so you are not fully vested until you have been here for 5 years.

Although the flat corporate structure is appealing in some aspects, there also appears to be little room to move up in the company and advance your career at least from a job title standpoint."

437,,Great place to start a career,2014-03-10,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Smart people, free lunch, focus on education",Work hours can be inflexible
438,,"Interesting work, less than ideal environment",2014-02-28,4.0,Software Engineer,"The work at SIG is challenging and fun. You are presented with unique situations, difficult situations, and often have to move quickly. The technology organization actually keeps up with the times pretty well, you aren't using ancient programming technology or outdated hardware.

The work culture is friendly and open. Engineers are given a lot of flexibility to solve problems the way they think is best. Very good fringe benefits like free food, gym, and on site hair cuts. Salary is very competitive for the area.

The other engineers are generally pretty smart, and pretty willing to work as a team. In many other companies, different groups within a company form ""cliques"" that are often adversarial - not that way at SIG at all. Groups work together towards common goals and are very willing to help each other. I find this rare, and actually pretty awesome as an engineer.","-The work environment is not ideal if you're in the trading floor. If you're a software engineer that's used to an office, or even a cubicle, you're in for a rude awakening. It's noisy and there's no privacy.

-Strict hours can be a pain. It's the nature of finance, but being expected to be in the building from 8-5 is irritating at times. Life happens. They're understanding of exceptions, but it goes against the company culture.

-Similarly, they don't believe in remote work / telecommuting, which makes no sense for technology

-I'll be blunt - the benefits stink. Health care is very expensive, and the 401k program is severely lacking. They only give their match in a lump sum the following year, and it takes 4 years to vest. Meh.

Flat organization structure.,Traffic in the area can be very bad. Flat organization is both a pro and a con as title promotions are rare even though responsibilities grow. Contribution impact can be obtuse due to nature of the private company.
442,,One of the best places to be a Software Developer in the Philadelphia area,2014-02-07,5.0,Team Lead,"- You get to work in a very collaborative environment along side some very smart people. 

- Direct interaction (and collaboration) with traders and the other people who are using the systems/features that you are working on. This is great because you get real-time user feedback and get to see first-hand the impact your work is having.

- Very little bureaucracy or politics, especially for a company this size. Working at SIG often feels like working in a small company, but with access to the resources of a large firm.

- The pay is very competitive compared to other companies in the area. There are also lots of perks like the often-mentioned free breakfast and lunch, a full gym, exercise classes, on-site car wash services, and they are adding charging stations if you have an electric vehicle.

- The culture here is EXCELLENT. The people who work here are generally very happy and the low turnover rate we have is a testament to that. 

- SIG has a very flat structure which I think helps foster the collegiate environment that is present here. On multiple occasions, I have gone to technologists (or business people) on other teams for help and have never been turned away, even when I was new to the company and the industry. 

- You won't see your good idea ignored in favor of a lesser idea by a ""Senior"" developer here, like I've seen happen at so many other development shops. Management really does foster an environment that allows the best idea to win.","Since SIG is a private partnership, company financials are not public information and the employees are often in the dark about how the company is performing as a whole."
443,,The Crown Jewel of Wall Street,2014-01-31,5.0,Technology Manager,"Excellent culture. Very anti-corporate. The focus here is not about the titles, policies, micromanagement, politics, bureaucracy and layoffs when the P&L takes a hit which is what I experienced at other financial firms. It’s about collaboration, teaming, decision making, innovation, delivery and empowering people to be the best they can be to contribute to SIG’s success. I faced culture shock when I arrived at SIG but easily adapted once I realized how this culture contributes to SIG’s overall success and individual and team success. I’ll take this culture along with the jeans and sneakers and shorts in the summer over the suit and tie and wing tipped shoes I trashed years ago.

I consider the managing directors to be approachable, friendly and fun, and passionate about their employees and company success. I also consider them to be some of the top risk managers on Wall Street. Their proven track record in trading and approach to running the company gives me confidence and comfort that we are part of a winning team especially when facing tough financial markets.

We have very friendly, intelligent, skilled hard working employees committed to the success of the organization with the willingness to educate and help each other. Traders and Technologists are united partners that shape our overall Trading business. Employees have the opportunity to grow and have greater impact along the way if they are determined and committed to do so. Open communication and idea sharing is encouraged not discouraged. Fairly flat organization structure which contributes to the lack of politics and bureaucracy. As such, decisions are made very quickly and people are more productive. 

The Technology team is led by a CIO who is committed to ensuring that her team is core to the success of the business by delivering innovative solutions that give our business an edge on their competition. The team is unified, committed to innovation and delivering cutting edge and bleeding edge technologies to our trading business. This fosters an exciting, challenging and rewarding environment for technologists. Micromanagement is non-existent but exposure to all levels within the organization is the norm. We are focused on overcoming challenges and making the impossible possible. These are things I didn’t experience at previous employers. The workload is generally heavy and consistent across the Technology organization. This is why prioritization is a key area of focus. If you are looking for a 9 to 5 job with many breaks throughout the day then this is not be the place for you. If you are a highly motivated technologist looking to be challenged and busy and working with complex technologies then SIG could be the right place for you.  

I’ve seen a significant commitment to the evolution of our education programs such as co-operative and internship programs and our Technology Associates program. I’ve seen each produce opportunities for recent grads to join SIG full time and have successful careers over the years. These are a few examples of the many channels used to attract and hire top talent. 

Benefits and perks are good. Free breakfast/lunch is one of the better perks. In addition to being free, I don’t have to contend with traffic and lines at local food establishments wasting time. This allows me to get back to work faster. 

After working for other financial firms, I consider SIG to be the crown jewel of Wall Street. Among other things, the owners, people, culture, team approach and my ability to innovate and have impact is what keeps me at SIG. To me, this is the place to be if you if you want a challenging and rewarding career as a technologist at a financial firm.",The grass is not always greener but in most cases it’s much greener than any of the other Wall Street financial firms I worked at during my career. That along with my consistent losing streak at the annual poker tournament and in any of the many sweepstakes that take place at SIG throughout the year are the only cons that come to mind.
444,,This culture here is designed to breed mediocrity,2014-01-16,1.0,Technology Associate,"Everything is so disorganized with no real chain of command in Technology so if your goal is to fly under the radar, you could probably collect a paycheck here for a while doing very little work.","Simply put, in Technology there is no management.  Teams collaborate heavily, but I rarely saw any managers step up to bat for their teams or open their mouths when a process could be improved or work being done was redundant.  Status quo is the name of the game here, so don't expect to be given any opportunity to advance, simplify processes, or to have your input be valued.

There are also multiple systems for doing nearly everything in technology.  Want to get system access to a Server A?  Request it through Webpage A.  Want to get access to server B?  Email Team B.  There is so much wasted time with half completed projects and systems that barely do their intended function.

Overall, I saw these problems pervading through the entire Bala Cynwyd office.  Most people seemed to do the bare minimum, the standout employees left after a short period, and the average employees stay for years and are promoted based on seniority only. (skill level and knowledge appeared to have nothing to do with your responsibility level)"
445,,A good company with smart people.,2014-01-02,5.0,ETF Trader,"It is a good place to learn from some top people: in addition to a formal education program there are many opportunities to learn from others, both on the job and after hours.","(It is likely true at any company in this industry) in a meritocracy there is a bit of implicit competition among peers, even though all Susquehanna people are on the same ""team""."

The work environment is very casual and the level of stress, I believe, is lower than that in comparable companies.",Contrary to their advertisement - there's no free lunch there. The level of the salaries is lower and growth rates are low. There are people who have been there for way too long and might stifle the growth of younger employees.

There's a lot of opportunity to learn new things and be surrounded be intellectual people.  Benefits and pay and fairly decent, and there's many perks - free breakfast/lunch, onsite car service, pharmacy, doctor, etc.  If you take care of SIG, they will take care of you.  My team had zero micromangement, and I was able to be very autonomous.","The culture can be tricky to adapt to, and some teams have a ""good 'old boy"" mentality.  SIG preaches a collaborative environment, but there's a lot of compartmentalization and information hoarding.  Furthermore, management definitely plays favorites, which puts you at a disadvantage if you're not the favorite.  There's more egos here than the traditional shop, and the interview process is downright excruciating.  Most people at SIG have been in the same role for years, so if planned career advancement is your desire, than you'll be unhappy at SIG.  In addition, that free lunch comes at a price -- management discourages employees from leaving during the day, and it helps facilitate working through lunch.  Lastly, since the company is private, there's uncertainty regarding SIG's future business model and financials, especially as additional HFT regulations are being proposed."
461,,Fun place to work,2013-06-27,4.0,Operations Associate,"Great benefits, and a very relaxed environment.  Free lunch, a gym, intelligent people.

You will be among very smart people, and you will be challenged and paid well.",You may feel that the smartest people at SIG are actually the ones that leave.

- Extremely talented employees; the most talented collection of technology employees in the region

- Great place to learn and grow; internal mobility opportunities are good
- Little bureaucracy, which can be difficult for those used to structure; politics do exist, but at a below average level
- Contrary to popular belief, managers are given ample discretion to provide flexibility for employees' hours and out of office time to address work/life balance challenges
- Nice onsite benefits such as a gym, fitness classes, wellness center, barber/hair stylist, catered lunch, continental breakfast, free bottled water, and .25 soft drinks
- Relaxed dress code and atmosphere","- Lack of transparency that causes unnecessary and unfounded fear, mild paranoia for some, and puzzlement over certain decisions; the firm truly cares about its employees but doesn't show it well
- Difficult to navigate the orginization - who works on what and for whom
- Too reactive to problems in the organization, but the firm addresses them when they surface.  Many problems could be avoided by being more proactive.
- Health benefits, 401k, and pay could be more competitive, but are certainly not the worst in the region/industry"

Additional perks are nice - free breakfast and lunch, gym on site, wellness center, fitness classes - but come at a cost, namely that you're expected to work an additional hour that you would usually be eating lunch.","The cost of benefits have risen steadily, and this year's health care package costs almost 50% more than last year. Salaries and bonuses are not keeping pace. There have been a number of core people departing the company for green pastures, and you can't help but wonder if the compensation and benefits aren't a big part of those decisions.

Technically, there is a tendency to stick with older, proven technologies and a resistance to moving forward."
474,,Good Experience....,2012-12-04,4.0,,benefits are good and really friendly people and environment,salary is bit less than industry rate

484,,Great company to work for,2012-08-13,5.0,Helpdesk Associate,"The salary is fairly competitive, but the benefits are second to none. There are 17 vacation/personal days per year,  a gym with showers onsite, breakfast/lunch provided daily, many services onsite during the day (dry cleaning, haircuts, car repair/detailing, etc.), and it is easy to get to from Center City (car, bus, or bike). Overall it is a fantastic work environment.","While lunch is provided there is no lunch hour as the financial markets are open all day. The 401k would be more competitive with a full match and 3 year vesting period instead of a 50% match and 6 year vesting period, but neither of these are big dealbreakers for me."

491,,Great place to work,2012-04-06,4.0,,Great place to work. Lots of competent people. Very high hiring standards.
