391,,They do not value loyalty.,2021-05-03,1.0,Engagement Expert,Benefits start first day. 15.00 min wage for customer service representative.,"Overworked because they are always understaffed. Have to deal with nothing but angry people who are verbally abusive and you have to warn them like children before being able to hang up the phone. Have to use benefit time( vacation, PTO) to have a day off and if you have none available you will get wrote up they do not care if it's an emergency. Very strict metrics and they also now have Artificial intelligence monitoring your tone and flow of conversation for every call. They also brag about work/life balance but they really aren't flexible at all. Especially since they don't ever have enough people to handle the call volume. In the years I've worked there I have never seen so many people come and go and I have worked in the retail sector. While they brag about benefits they are mediocre at best. They limit employees as well that aren't in pursuit or have a degree from doing any of their development programs which is very discriminating to an employee that may have multiple years of financial experience. They think sending you candy is a way of rewarding your hard work. Raises are horrible. I am glad I moved on."

2. Analytics technology (and technology in general) is 5+ years behind. SAS is by far the most common software. Little support for open source tools like Python and R. Machine learning and models are not really used here, and the ones that are tend to be vendor models. Reports with shallow insights are the norm.  Do not work here if you want to do Data Science! 

3. Leadership and organization challenges in analytics and technology functions. High turnover of employees; leadership comes from business backgrounds and does not really appreciate data science or what is required.

4. Work life balance problems if on a client team.

5. Senior leadership does not seem to know what to do with the business. It lost Walmart and many of its remaining clients were struggling retailers even before the pandemic. There is a very high risk of stagnation, especially as competitors beat Synchrony in technology.

So really no pros here,"I would not even give it a zero... I'd give it a 'minus' rating.
Wanna know why--
100% racist company. only need employees who say 'yes sir/yes mam'
World of difference in treating employees versus contractors. 
Escalations mean nothing. HR policies are absolutely ridiculous... 
Loads of playing favorite... in terms of not taking action if that person is your favorite or white skinned or a GE employee.

God knows what contract Synchrony has with contracting agencies... absolute weirdo's and good-for-nothings are hired!

I guarantee whoever gave this firm more than 2-3 stars are either white skinned, GE employees or just plain lucky!"
708,,Not one of my favorite places to work,2020-02-21,1.0,Network Engineer,Work from home. Pay was competitive. Change freeze from mid Nov to Early Jan reduced workload slightly during the holiday season.,"1. Synchrony IT is offshoring TOO MANY JOBS. 
2. Way too many hours. Very common to work 40 hrs on dayshift and another 10-20 at night doing changes or change/troubleshooting support. Week after week.
3. I left after 1 year because I hated it so much. Culture not a fit. 
4. No uniformity of strict change management between departments. Eg...Server team changed stuff on the fly with almost no oversight while Network teams had their changes reviewed scrupulously. Then when stuff broke Network team blamed when it was ALWAYS the server(or application) teams at the root of the problem. 
5. If you are an independent thinker youre not going to like working at Synchrony. If you like being blamed for the problems of other teams, and then required to locate the sources of the problems they caused(of course ALWAYS without root access), under the gun when stuff is broken at 5AM and they start business at 6AM,  you will love being a Network Engineer at Synchrony."

724,,Terrible Business Practices,2020-01-22,2.0,Underwriter,Can't think of any. I was employed,"Where does one begin. Asks for way too much and the compensation isn't sufficient for what is required. No flexibility.  Like most,company extremely top heavy with senior management receiving mid to upper six figure salaries. Concerned more with ranking highest on great places to work rather than BEING a great place to work. Huge disconnect between management and employees who actually do the work. More concerned with ""appearances"" than realities. Moves entire departments from.site to sure with no regard as to how those changes will affect employees.  Does not stick to promises made. Follow through horrible. All in all NOT a great place to work unless one is senior manager, ( CEO, VP, SVP,EVP).  CEO dumped over 126k in stock collecting over $4 million all the while they were shutting down entire departments. These appears to be common practices with this company. Spends more $$ on handing out tshirts and tumblers and handing out pizza as opposed to simply paying employees a living wage and bragging about how they're a $6 billion  dollar company. Easy to be that when senior execs only people enjoying huge salaries. Was not a pleasant experience to work there at all."

I have worked here for over 5 years with no complaints until they brought in 3 new upper managers who have no experience in what we do. The sales team has worked very hard in growing this part of the business and when they brought in these new managers who had nothing to do with our prior success, now want to change everything and not recognizing that we are who helped grow this business.  The treatment that is being given to this role is unfair and unjust. I hope Margaret King CEO of Synchrony reads this so she can see what is being done to us, it goes against Synchrony’s core values and they are losing a lot of great people who have put their heart and soul into this company. It is so sad that they (upper management) is getting by with it. I would not recommend this job to anyone."

And also during team meetings/events, they do not consider vegetarians. Multiple times they did not have vegetarian options, i have seen people continuing in meetings without proper lunch.

You should not complain if you do not have enough work. Manager would threaten to put you in performance improvement program. Out of 2 years, i would have had 40hrs/week work maybe for 6-8 months. 

Top management seems to try something new, but middle level they still have old GE mentality and they do not foster good culture. Everyone afraid of failure, how does innovation comes from that?  Every one is ready to point at if something goes wrong even before fixing it.

People suggests to create dependency on you, and they are the ones who get appreciated and promoted.

You can see politics in this company at every level, are equal or more but not less than DC Politics."

*Depending on how you look at it, but from a tech and design standpoint, the products are remarkably behind, so it can be fun to work towards turning things around as they can only get better.","* This has been the most unorganized, bureaucratic, non-employee centric company I have ever been a part of. I believe that there is a ton of well-intentioned, but the execution is the opposite. For example, the company will talk about employee well being and promoting equality and generally have friendly marketing towards employees. 
* The benefits, like many things, look awesome on paper, but when its time to collect any benefit. ANY. It is the most painful, heartbreaking, and frustrating experience. Their Human Resource department lacks all human to it. It is really bad and makes me wonder how it all stays afloat."

Any positive reviews were written by management to make it look like working here is great. 

When the company employees receive the ""Great Places To Work"" email survey, management forces the employees to take the survey together as a group with the managers to ensure the answers are positive.","•	If you are one minute late, you will not meet schedule adherence and will be marked negatively.

•	If you have to go into Personal Aux to go use the bathroom, because you’ve been holding your pee and it’s still an hour until your next break, you will not meet schedule adherence and will be marked negatively.

•	If you were about to log out to go to break, lunch or leave for the day and you get the beep indicating a caller is on the line and the call gets complicated and runs over, you have to stay and assist no matter how long it takes and no matter how it may negatively impact your schedule adherence and/or your personal schedule.

•	If you have something come up unexpected, and you have personal business hours but your “unexpected occurrence” isn’t on Synchrony’s approved list of items, then you can’t use your Personal Business time.

•	If you have a family emergency and you’re on the floor/taking calls, your loved ones cannot get a hold of you. You’ll have to wait until your break, lunch and/or end of shift before you can speak with your family. No cell phones are allowed while you're at your desk taking calls.

•	All your calls are recorded and you're being graded based on software that is not 100% reliable. Workstation (the software/program) glitches, shuts down, freezes and overall does not always perform the way it’s supposed to and yet the call center associates metrics and jobs are dependent upon it. If something’s off with Workstation and it messes up the call center associate, the call center associate is in jeopardy vs. management looking further into Workstation and what may be wrong with it. 

•	Management shares that a Customer Service Representative is not here to help customers but to get them off the phone as quickly as possible. We are not here to help but to do what we can to ensure they don’t call again.

•	Your call time is supposed to be 3 mins or less per call. Going through training doesn’t truly represent what will happen on the floor. It’s understood that you can’t train on every single item that may occur but being told that you’ll mainly be taking payments and waiving late fees is false. Most people call because something out of the norm is going on and they need help. So most calls are not simple which means your call time will typically be long. 

•	Important updates that involve changes in processes are sent via email and then the Customer Service Representative is expected to read  these communications and keep up to date while continuing to take calls and always be up to date on what’s changed. Sometimes the changes are a little complex and additional training would be beneficial. Sometimes there’s off phone training but most of the times there’s not. 

•	Taking verbal abuse from customers and having to remain calm and being forced to read from a script or potentially face termination if you allow your feelings (that are rightly felt when someone is treating you like dirt) to
get the best of the situation. 

•	Customer Service Reps are expected to be IT experts but are not paid extra for it. Each client should have a Digital Tech team but they don't. Customer Service Reps are supposed to have low call times and yet when someone calls and needs someone to hold their hand as they try to register their card, or set up Auto Pay, or is having overall IT related issues with an App or with getting into their account…the Customer Service Representative  is stuck on the call until the customer gets access. You cannot have low call times and help people with IT and online/eservice matters. 

•	Dealing with Multi Client Schedule Bid process. Upon being hired, you don’t really get to pick a schedule that truly works for you; you have to select from what’s available. When you get that schedule, it is not permanent. During the Multi-Client Schedule Bid time, every person is ranked and depending on your rank order, you are scheduled to select from an entire new list of schedules (your current schedule may not be on the new schedule bid list) and by the time you get to select, what’s left may not work for you. If you have to make it work, you’ll have to rearrange your childcare, any scheduled doctor’s appointments, etc. If you can’t make it work, you have to resign and it’s a great way for them not to have to
perform layoffs and potentially be on the line for any earned unemployment benefits."

Human Resources is terrible a bunch of AVP and VP titles and these people have no interpersonal skills and could not find their way out of a paper bag. Management is comprised of friends of friends of family. This company is a joke and has gone way down hill. If you do manage to get promoted they will eventually send your job to Manila or India.

These surveys are implemented to ensure we are living up to our investor's expectation.

831,,"""Abandon hope all ye who enter...""",2019-06-27,1.0,Account Manager,"The seldom realization that you have a choice to leave the company, and are not trapped by the exorbitant amount of paid time off.","The interview process at Synchrony is an elaborate ruse to promote a diverse workforce. We focus so much on inclusiveness because it is only accolade Synchrony is continually recognized for. It is a counter-intuitive practice, in that some certainly deserve and are qualified to be in the position that they are in, but they did not get to that position based off value. The interview process itself remains completely unchanged, even after we have claimed to have fixed it; in whole it is a disengaged, robotic charade. Synchrony allows initiatives to be in place to promote people based on diversity, not merit. 

Synchrony’s agenda to promote for diversity vs. competence will inevitably cause more harm than good. Putting lesser-qualified candidates in positions that could be better performed by someone else causes continuous management issues and a lack of faith in senior leadership. There are numerous studies detailing how it is impossible to hire both for competency and diversity initiatives concurrently, so the fact that Synchrony acts as if both are in place highlights our obliviousness.     

This is the root cause of 95% of our problems here, yet we choose to continue full-steam ahead with this hushed initiative. I’m not sure if senior leadership thinks we are too thoughtless to realize what is actually happening or afraid to say so, but that is not the case. Everyone knows we are promoting under qualified minorities over those better suited for jobs. 

I’m certain nothing will be done to improve our interview process because Synchrony cares more about appearing successful than setting themselves up for success. You would think that after losing our biggest client after a decade’s long relationship we would realize our error. Walmart chose to leave us because we are years behind on technological advances and have exemplified a stagnancy to change. How do we ever expect to get ahead if we continue this same path of complacency and ignorance?"

The pay is decent. They used to do monthly bonuses but that went away at the beginning of 2019. They averaged your 2018 bonuses and added that into your base pay. So instead of making $15.50, my pay bumped to $17.50/hr. Onsite gym, cafeteria, marketplace, break rooms, vending machines, etc. You have to have a badge to get into the building so I felt safe while at work. Management is nice and approachable. Ample time off. So many committees to join. You can tell they actually care about your personal growth.  Tuition reimbursement.","It’s a call center, so the work is very dull and repetitive. You will deal with unhappy customers on a daily basis. As an account manager, part of my job was to take the escalated calls. 

This is more of my personal experience, but the sick time policy needs to be changed. You get paid for sick days, but there are certain “triggers” (hours) that you hit and that results in corrective action. I get sick a lot, so I was put on corrective action quite a few times for it. I wish I could have the option to take unpaid sick time and not get in trouble for it. 

Synchrony has been rated a Great Place to Work for the past couple of years and it’s true, but that initiative is pushed on us too much. Around the time of year that we take the survey it’s all you hear about from management."

Yes, the CFO or CCO knew who you were, but that didn’t necessarily help you on program. Could be extremely beneficial if you stay at SYF for a long period of time.","BLPs toward the end of the program aren’t paid fairly or based truly on Merit/ level of work/ responsibility  post program. As someone who went through the program and received the highest merit rankings, the difference between you and an average performing BLP is just a few hundred dollars in total pay at the end. Doesn’t incentivize a BLP to stay. The program management also lacks transparency and often waits until last minute to explain very important details that affect you in a big way ( I.e. they tell you a month before you move across the country when they’ve known for the last 3 that you’re doing it.... just to be fair to everyone in program rather than rational). This lack of urgency is very frustrating  when trying to find housing for each rotation.

Finally, industry isn’t the most appealing outside of the IT function."

I'm not sure what all of these other reviewers are talking about, but 13.25 an hour is not decent pay. It is insulting pay for the amount of stress their customer engagement specialists (aka call center employees) have to deal with. They give ""bonuses"" sure, but they are only $25 for each metric, which can total about $200 max. That is laughable. I have been in call centers where the calls were not even CLOSE to as stressful as these calls are and they bonused they employees out with over a thousand dollars a month (and yes it was a private company-non-collection call center). They ask for too much and offer too little in return. I cannot even enjoy the employee engagement activities because I think how all of the money they spend to look good could actually go to paying their people better.  Also, dont even think about getting a promotion unless you are willing to jump through hoops or possible move your entire family across country."

This is by far the worst company I have ever worked for. This company hires people fresh off the boat to get diversity awards and compensations, as well to basically conform the person to what they feel is normal, which is not. If that person leaves to go elsewhere they will  be in trouble. Every person I worked with during my time there would fail at any other company, I am 100% sure of this. As well the mentality of working for a bank is out the window, everyone is stuck in GE mentality that they have no idea what they should be doing.  They pay is horrible and try to retain people by giving  ""star awards"" yet these are given to people that should be removed...nothing makes sense at this company."

The human resources staff are very down to earth and friendly as well.,TraInning is rushed and not thorough. You are lied to about how long the actual training is. You are put on phones too soon with not enough knowledge to be proficient. Then given new company to learn in 1 day put on phones to take calls the next day! Management asks for feedback but then gets rude and defensive when told your feelings. Ask for you to do review but has a lady question you and fill it out for you not really a review then. Feedback is digitally tracked on other supposed review of your trainers. There is a creepy guy who antagonizes several people daily who corporate should be aware of who comes in and out of the training classes all day long. Incidents are not handled fairly a young lady was confronted in hallway by another in front of several witnesses but none of them called on for their statements but the accosted young girl was reprimanded and treated like the aggressor. The people who handled the situation were same race as the woman who aggressor. They spoke with her first not the young lady who was verbally attacked. This aggressive young lady had another violent outburst previously and was talked to by management. All in all I would not recommend this place to anyone. They are liars and are rude.
1279,,Not a place for young professionals,2016-07-01,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"- Generous graduate tuition reimbursement
- Collaborative working environment depending on the site
- Flexible hours and opportunity to work from home depending on your manager","- This company is positioning itself as a technology and analytics leader, but in fact it's a dinosaur in both regards. It's only now starting to transition to the IT environments that had been already implemented several years ago at other fin tech companies.
- The compensation is poor and well below the market. There is a raise threshold when you go from one role to the next, regardless of whether you were low balled in the first place and are underpaid in comparison to your peers. I don't see the analytics talent sticking around for very long, as the millennials have a low threshold for boredom ie operational work and data clean up. You won't find machine learning, dynamic simulations or any interesting analytics projects here.
- IT support is poor
- Some employees have been there for decades and have no motivation to advance their skill set even when it comes to basic computer skills
- Senior leadership is still holding on to their GE history and is completely out of touch with reality on how to retain and grow young professionals
- Poor work life balance as some clients and the respective client teams expect you to be on available on weekends and during after-hours or to stay connected during your vacation time
- Poor relocation options

1294,,World-class spinoff from a world-class company,2016-05-17,5.0,,"Great senior leadership and management when it was under GE Capital. Many of the senior leaders remain, so I'd assume that the GE culture has carried over. There's really a culture of leadership and professional development here with Leadership 360's and leadership training. HR and your managers often have proactive discussions with you when it comes to career development. Obviously, you still have to drive your own career, but they certainly provide the resources, training and assuming that you perform well, the opportunities, as well. There's an emphasis on rounding out your skill sets to position you for ""that next job.""

Other pros:
1) Well-developed business processes in place, such as the 1 and 3-year strategic planning reviews.
2) Great sense of camaraderie across the functions. Everyone is generally willing to help and support you. It feels like an army marching to the beat of the same drum. 
3) The Marketing function really drives the bus here, but there are healthy debates with the other functions (Risk, Finance, Legal, etc.)
4) Compensation is competitive. Health insurance could've been better.
5) Good work-life balance. Ability to work from home occasionally.","1) Since the company is so mature, they are not always the first to innovate, but once they put their resources behind an initiative, they can play catch-up quickly. 
2) Be prepared to possibly move every few years in order to move ahead in your career. Synchrony's approach of having teams co-located with their clients means that there are many smaller teams scattered across the country. Additionally, there are major HQ offices and centers of excellence in Connecticut, Ohio, Georgia and Illinois."

There are several Coordinators available in Instant Messaging for all shifts, to answer questions or issues you have in real time with callers. There is a 4 month ramp up period, which gives a good amount of time to get more comfortable in your role.","Set your schedule carefully when offered the position as you are stuck with it for a minimum of 6 months, possibly longer.  While the majority of calls are covered in training, there is a time-period when you first start that you feel training did not cover as much as it should have and you feel lost.

I worked for Synchrony when it was still GE Financial from 2007-2011. It was the worst 4 years of my life. I'm not sure now why I tried to hard to get the job. They jerked me around from the start. I had temped there for one day years prior and passed. So when I took the test for the job (which was a joke) they had to do additional processing or some garbage and it took them almost  2 months to get back to me with my results. I should have taken that as a sign from the start.

It was great at first. Great benefits, decent entry pay for someone with only an Associates Degree, a second shift schedule that didn't make me get up early. I loved my first supervisor. But then shift bid happened and I was moved to a new supervisor who was a jerk. I started getting write ups because my call handle times were too long. I was told I ""helped too much"". I'm sorry, but I thought  customer service was about resolving the customer's issues? Not there! I had 10 years of customer service experience and an AS degree in Business Administration before I set foot in there, but they didn't care. They want you to get the customer off the phone as quick as possible. It's not about helping, it's about handling the most calls. My quality scores were PERFECT, but I took too long. I eventually transferred to Store so my handle time went down. Then I got sick, and things really went downhill. They were not at all flexible in letting me take sick time that I had. I was written up for BEING IN THE HOSPITAL. When I had to be off work for surgery I had to jump through a million hoops to have my disability leave approved and ultimately someone at their disability center who wasn't even a doctor made the determination to allow me time off, not my doctor. It was a joke. I was eventually fired. Hilarious, since I was one of the few on my team that actually did the job - you know, answering the required number of calls, getting the required quality score, and helping the customer."

No company is perfect but Synchrony really is a great place to work.  They don't mind promoting within - but you do have to work for it.  Don't expect to be spoon fed - but if u want more the opportunities for advancement are there! I would suggest after your 6 months are over apply for the STEP program!,Compliance changes are not streamlined but there seems to be efforts to remedy that. Fitness area is pretty skimpy and needs more weight training equipment. Company needs more opportunities for departments to mingle - its a bit hard to appreciate the vastness of the business when u never have the opportunity to meet those in other departments. Collections can really burn you out - I would really suggest only using it as a door into the company. STEP program is the way to go.

Management - self-absorbed that any recommendations outside of their own are foreign territory. 

Lack of Work Life Balance - unusual push to just be in the office, for ""face time"".

Lack of recognition - efforts go unnoticed unless you're a rocket scientist and even that might just be mediocre for this place. 

Racism aka bureaucracy (shocking as it can be in 2015) - didn't think this would make the list, but it sure does. What they (management) do not know is the creation of all their 'networks' disintegrates teams. Yeah, it's great to know that there are communities you can belong too but many of those higher up involved tend to closely associate with those who are involved with the same communities."

I'm so glad I don't have to go back, as it was one of the worst experiences of my entire life (and I've been through some very difficult times).  

I have been meaning to write this review for a very long time, but just thinking about SynBnk put me in a bad mood.  I'd get angry and upset all over again while trying to write about that horrible place.  I'm at a wonderful job now and enough time has passed that I can finally write this.  If it convinces even one person to NOT apply for a job with SynBnk, then it's worth it!","There are many reasons why the turnover rate at this place is so high.  There are back to back training classes, yet rows upon rows of empty desks.  Some people quit during training, once they realize what a horrible place they've signed up with. 

Every day on local talk radio, there's an ad played regarding open positions at SynBnk and I know it means they're still understaffed.  I smile every time I hear it because I know I'm driving to a job that I love, and NOT to SynBnk. 

I will list some specific cons, but I'm only scratching the surface here.

*Employees are made to feel that they are constantly on the verge of being fired, no matter how good they are at the job.  Even ""star"" employees will up and rage quit in the middle of the day.

*Favoritism is a problem.  Suddenly there's new positions custom-created for a select few people.

*Disciplinary action is constantly taken against people for the dumbest of reasons.  Each disciplinary action sticks with you for ONE ENTIRE YEAR, no matter how insignificant the ""violation"" was.  

*There is no room for cutting anyone some slack, no matter what the circumstances were.  It doesn't matter if you or your child had an emergency; the rules are the RULES and everyone must abide by them.  

*Examples of things people were disciplined for, that I know of:  using the f-word while on lunch break, across the street while talking to a friend in a casual conversation, where no customers could've overheard; being 1 minute late clocking in or out; using your sick day benefit for what they deem is too many times even though you have enough hours; etc.

*Policies are explained in the most vague way possible.  If you ask for clarification, you'll find that different co-workers are given different answers from different managers.  Yet, you are held responsible for following all the policies and it's your fault if you interpreted the written guidelines differently than how the person punishing you saw them.

*When a new process or procedure or anything comes out, they're fond of tacking this phrase to the end of it:  ""failure to comply will result in disciplinary action, up to and including termination.""  Am I just there to be punished, or am I at work??!!

*You are micro-manged to death.

*You are not treated like an adult, but as a misbehaving child 

*You have to stick to corporate-approved scripts while on calls, and some of them contain lies.

*Not only does management treat employees horrible, but the company as a whole treats customers horrible.  You only needs to look at BBB's site to see proof of what I'm talking about.

*Even if logical reason led you to believe that the person on the phone was an ID thief, you were not allowed to act based on evidence or your own thinking skills.  Rather, you had to ""follow the process.""  If the ID thief could pass the screening tests, then they could get away with doing whatever they wanted to do.  

*""Following the process"" per company rules and regulations could leave actual cardholders stranded,or repeatedly unable to use their cards despite making the same kinds of purchases at the same kinds of merchants.  

*Having to participate in treating customers so poorly (or else I'd get fired)  HONESTLY had me in tears after work some days.   

*Every negative comment I've read about SynBnk on Glassdoor is 100% true.  I still feel I've listed the bare minimum.  Basically, avoid this place like the plague."

There are lots of opportunities for travel and explore different parts of the business. Rotations are every 8 months and you can pretty much go anywhere in the US to explore the different parts of the business. Relocation benefits are generous. 

Salary and benefits are extremely good, especially for a first job out of college. I haven't heard of any salaries for first jobs which are as generous as Synchrony. 

It seems like they took the best of the GE leadership programs and even made it better. I see this program getting more and more competitive in upcoming years, but so far it's been great! They really want to see you succeed and the program is well respected throughout the company.","Since it's a new program there are a few kinks still being worked out- but it's only going to improve in upcoming years.

1402,,It's not bad,2015-07-22,3.0,Fraud Universal Representative,"Good pay, great benefits, flexible schedule options, and tons of paid time off avaliable.","""New"" company. The customer experience can be made a little worse by the processes, management can often be lacking."
1403,,Good place to grow a career.,2015-07-15,4.0,Customer Service Representative,"Plenty of overtime, schedule flexibility, great benefits, shift differential along with regular average pay. Community involvement and events.",Hard to schedule time off during peak holidays. Not everyone allowed to flex schedules the same way. Computer system network needs updating. The new hire absenteeism policy is very strict with no flexibility.
1404,,Fraud Division,2015-07-10,1.0,Fraud Analytics,"There are not a lot of typical pros for working at Synchrony Financial. They did recently add a ""coffee"" station in although they had to add a disclaimer sign indicating it was not made from actual coffee. The work is consistent. Always at least a 40 hour work week to complete under normal circumstances.

Healthcare used to be good. It's not anymore.","Working in conjunction with peers to solve major issues is discouraged. The rules and requirements of the job change every day but the software used to do the work is 10-20 years old.   Shooting the messenger is a common tactic. Trying to go above and beyond in your role is strongly discouraged across all areas of the business. Stay in your box and keep your head down. Analytical people need not apply. Sadly because the business does not promote people who are analytical upper management is full of individuals incapable of adapting and creating solutions. 

Work and family is something that is preached about. It does not exist here. Any deviation from the set schedule will land a person on the fast track to write ups.

Compensation is poor, advancement is negligible."
1405,,Good Company,2015-07-10,4.0,,"career opportunities, lots of activites and groups to join",If salaried you have to stay in that position for 2 years

Very organized ,informative and knowledge-oriented training.
The knowledge and experience you gain from this company(though mine was for a short duration) helps you further ;especially when you are looking for a new job.",The salary you draw every month would be slightly at the lower end.
1407,,Call Center Fraud Division,2015-06-28,4.0,,"Plenty of training for the position, the people you work with are all great. Everyone help Everyone. Management on the floor is very relaxed with the exception of a few. They offer quite a few in house functions such as 5min massages, BBQ's, they celebrate the holidays although you work all of them, they buy food for numerous occasions, and they have an on site cafeteria and a gym.","The standard for making a bonus is unreasonable, the standard time for completing calls is unreasonable, they will coach you till your blue in the face but in the end if you don't meet an average call time of 6.5 minutes per call (fraud dept) then you will be discharged."
1408,,Be ready to Slave for little pay!,2015-06-27,1.0,Customer Service Representative,PTO health insurance 401K schedule that's it. Not much good things to say about this place besides that it sucks!,"This company is very strict on quality, literally you can't do anything for the customers can't help them get access to there online account, can't help with online username or account number. Very limited on what you can or can't say to the customer be ready to read word for word from a script. Also a lot of favoritism. 1 person out of the whole company gets to give updates to the whole site while the others slave on the phone and only get awarded $100 more a month. This site is located at 3150 S 48th st phx. I would never recommend a friend/relative to work or apply here! It is horrible!"

I can work in my underwear and that is so comfortable for me.","Only able to work 19.5 hours a week, I wish we could work more hours from home but it is a great part time position."
1410,,Significant areas of improvement,2015-06-23,1.0,,Excellent benefit program in regards to tuition reimbursement and healthcare benefits. Fair 401(k)  program. Great business practices in theory.,Some of the disadvantages to working at Synchrony Financial would be pay related. It is not competitive and not designed for talent retention. It is a great entry level company for someone out of college or new to the workforce who wants gain experience for their resume. This is not a long term plan for someone to establish financial security.
1411,,OK for students,2015-06-18,2.0,Customer Service Representative,Coworkers are excellent. Everyone gets along pretty well. I love the team I work with.,"Too strict on Quality. I can respect the fact that you want all customers treated with divinity and respect, but to be fired over too many failed calls is ridiculous.. And it's not even because of being rude to the customers."
1412,,Just starting out,2015-06-17,4.0,Customer Service Representative,"I have just accepted an employment offer with Synchrony.  So far everyone that I have dealt with have been friendly, accommodating, and knowledgeable.  The hiring process has been smooth and it seems like they have it together.

Clients and customers think they're entitled to the world,2015-06-10,2.0,Customer Service,"Free coffee, events, a lot more paid time off than another company around here, coworkers are like family, room for growth (only if you move within the first 6mo-1yr) listens to employees about changes needed within the company it's self, very flexible hours","Favoritism, inconsistency, micromanaged, customers are incompetent, little pay for high stress, after 4 years of doing this job and having pride in my work I realized the benefits don't outweigh the stress, there is no debating or talking things over, he said she said drama"
1415,,Horrible,2015-06-09,1.0,Specialist,ABSOLUTELY NONE.  Before the class action lawsuit this company had decent benefits but since having to pay out millions to customers they cheated out of $$ they have no money left to pay for decent benefits.,This company changed its name from Ge Capital Retail bank after a LARGE settlement was won against the company due to misleading customers.  The management has no common sense and no respect for the employees.  Everyone is treated differently depending on your willingness to slave for them. You work so many hours with little pay and no respect. DO NOT WORK HERE.
1416,,Poor management no real growth opportunities unless you know someone,2015-06-06,2.0,Customer Service,"Have own cubical
Small bonuses
Days go by fast when busy","High school drama no opportunity to defend yourself
Opportunities are only available for those who know someone not based on real qualifications. If your not good at interviewing don't bother.
Information is inconsistent and the right doesn't know what the left is doing 
Very micromanage
Not enough pay for what you actually do
Terrible hours combine with split days off."

Ultra modern facitlity with cool activities .","Managers don't know anything and hold employees accountable . Quality assurance is brutal they will fail you on a good call for the smallest thing . Forget bonuses because of the quality assurance team. You can work your butt off but if the quality team gives you a zero you can hang it up for the month. Which a zero could be something as simple as not moving a telephone number or coding something wrong .  They preach this is how you learn !!!! But when you are put on a write up they have no flexibility on that ? All write ups stick with you for a year reguarless of how mild the situation is . Managers stand around and have meetings allday. No weekends off no weekend rotation, 2 months to request a sat off in advance or more.  Department should be mon-fri but isn't because of unecessary work load . Saturdays you are pretty much cleaning up the store associates messes on applications allday (nothing frd related ).No flexibility in days off most split days no two consecutive days off . Shotgun meetings this needs to be done immeadiatley no time to figure it out . 

  No growth within the company whatso ever ! Also they don't consider that most of there clients are elderly or broken english speakers which makes the job more difficult. Phone system isn't very clear because they monitor every call you take. You get 12 evaluations per month which is overkill most banks only do four to six on a agent. Benefits are not that good you have to meet a $800m deductable most is $ 500 before paying out 80%. You have a 500 balance on a wage card but that still leave $ 300 to pay out . Then what kills me when you go to the doctor its not automatically deducted you have to submit a request ? Very High turnover rate in the department and noone cares. Not sure how the company was when it was GE but I wish I had of known better. Very strict rules no flexibility whatsoever on anything so just know that ."
1419,,Potential to be great,2015-05-19,4.0,Frontline Manager,"Generous time off package, Solid 401k with up to 7% match for new hires when taking into account match and company 3% contribution. Health insurance is middle to lower end, no PPO available. There are good opportunities to advance if you apply yourself and perform.",Some longer tenured employees left over from GE don't pull their weight. The company seems to be keeping a lot of the outdated policies from GE despite the spinoff being the perfect opportunity to modernize workplace policies and procedures.
1420,,Working hard for little pay,2015-05-12,2.0,,Coworkers are great and the work environment is OK. The training is OK and the trainer staff is one of the best I have seen.,Management is sub-par at best.

Colleagues, managers and HR all truly care for you as a person, and will work with you as best as they can to help you overcome obstacles and to accommodate personal life matters.","As the company is making the full transition from GE Capital to Synchrony Financial, we are all guinea pigs. From an operations perspective, this is damaging on many levels to company reputation, customer relations, and employee morale and well being. Turnover is astronomical, and the pay is unbelievably abysmal for what is expected. Micro managed like I have never experienced in my life."
1428,,Great Company to Work For,2015-02-20,4.0,,The management is great. You get to work with smart and friendly people. A lot of the core values from GE have carried over.,The office isn't in downtown Stamford and the pay could be a little more competitive.

HR is very unprofessional and uncaring. Management states they have an open-door policy, but general if you have an issue with something or someone, you're on your own. They do not communicate well when it comes to new policies."
1445,,Success with Synchrony Financial,2014-11-15,4.0,Customer Service Representative,Clear and positive communication exists between each layer of management and subordinates as well as with clients and customers.  Everyone I've interacted with thus far has been very encouraging about my new position with the company.  The benefits offered to new hires are also wonderful,"As a relatively new employee, I haven't yet experienced cons with the company.  I've heard a few coworkers mention wishing there was a café on site.  As with most call centers, tight attendance guidelines make it more likely that workers will come to work sick. That 'con' is prevalent with any work position that requires good attendance, though."
1446,,Crushingly disappointing,2014-11-13,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"Pleasant people, nice building, free snacks, free coffee, occasional free pizza, management is considerate","-If you are under the age of 45 walk away. They can use the brand name of their old parent company for another three years to sucker in new grads and they will. This company recently spun off and they're a bit of a mess. 

-Understaffed and at the same time bloated with employees who coasted through when this company was with GE. The best GE employees (there were a lot of them) bailed out before this company split away. Synchrony legacy employees haven't bothered to further their education in decades. It's going to show now that they have to ramp up IT project work/ finance platforms and can't rely on their parent company anymore for brand name and support. The IT platforms they do have are archaic, it will stay this way because legacy employees  jobs depend on them not having to learn new languages/ systems

-Trying to be hip and have a startup atmosphere. (In a patronizing and ham-handed attempt to attract ""millennials"" they quickly set up an ""innovation station"" complete with an indoor putting green) now that they desperately need younger people- don't fall for it, the support and manpower just isn't there and they backed the wrong horse when it's comes to mobile payment platforms

-Most employees are generally nice but have zero candor, creativity, and judgement. They honestly just want to coast through the day and go home to their families. For a younger person eager to role up their sleeves and build something this is crushing. For a company recently gone public, it will really slow them down. 

-They try to position themselves as an analytics and marketing company, at the end of the day they are still a low tier credit card company that targets people with the lowest credit quality relative to other lenders. Their collection methods and platforms give them terrible reputation and it shows even more without the GE brand name 

-North Stamford location very far from metro north, (move the HQ! You're a new company now!!) I mention this because it can't be helping with retention of new talent they need badly"
1447,,So far so good!,2014-10-19,3.0,Manager,"The employ good people and they have a good culture except for those who came from Bank of America. They have good benefits, and the work is challenging.","They are spinning off of General Electric Capital.

There is no cross functional collaboration on projects and or implementation."
1448,,Lead Analyst,2014-10-13,5.0,Anonymous,"The people are absolutely phenomenal. Everyone is willing to lend a hand, no matter the task at hand.

This is a company filled with people who genuinely care and strive to meet and exceed regulatory and customer expectations. The pay is above industry standard with an excellant bonus structure and perks from versatile benefits to an enjoyable culture with a team mentality.,"The technology (hardware and software) are subpar. However, the company is currently in the process of separating from parent, GE, so this may change. Business units sometimes have difficulty communicating and sharing ideas. Again, this may improve with a smaller and more nimble organizational structure."
