If you need time off, some groups are more flexible than others in allowing it, even if you've got a lot to take. There is little appreciation shown to most, unless you're a C-level manager. Work/Life balance varies across departments and despite rising costs of childcare, after being home for the last two years, everyone has been required (unless you're not vaxxed) to come back to the office 2-3 days a week. There is no consideration for those who want to remain working from home full-time, even though work has carried on just fine the last two years with everyone doing that. We are told folks WANT to come back, and if that's even true - all are being forced to do so. It's been a rough couple months and morale is low."

This has led to a number of high-profile resignations in technology.
- Baffling, autocratic decisions, change of strategy and teams disruption without any justification or consultation.

42,,If you have a family/friends/or a partner- DON'T WORK HERE,2022-03-01,1.0,Representative,While it lasted-working from home... (they are taking this away as they are making everyone go back into office now),"1) Mandatory Overtime- You are told you will only work OT during the ""busy season"" of April (tax season) and December- lies! You will work mandatory OT every single day. You can't plan anything after work because you never know what time you will be off! Have kids to pick up after school? Have a dinner date with your partner? Plans to go to church on Sunday? -You can't plan that! You never know what time you will get off work since the overtime call is different everyday, but one this is guaranteed- multiple hours of overtime! They will literally tell you on Friday evening that you must work on Sunday. Or when you are working and you have 15 minutes before your shift ends, they will extend the overtime without any forewarning! Avoid this place at all cost- I beg you. 

2) Training. The training here is a joke. They are constantly hiring new people since everyone keeps quitting. They rush you into a class of 15+ people (they do this every other month- check their job posting) and throw you on the floor to process. Even if you don't know what you are doing they will still make you process so they can get ready to train the next set of workers that come right behind you. and then they have the audacity to put everyone on a metric system when you didn't even get properly trained! 

3) Pay. You can get a higher paying job being a cashier at a retail store. (i'm being serious). 

4) Dogfight- Since pay is so low at this company everyone seems to be in a ""dogfight"" to get an additional $1-2k pay bump at the end of the year. There are NO promotions here. If you do your job well, they will make you assist/help new hires. And since people are always leaving and they are always hiring- can you guess what you will be doing? Yup you guessed it, stuck always training new hires.

5) No work life balance...at all. There will be times when you work from 8am-8pm, don't believe me? Find out for yourself and watch the relationships you have with your family/friends tear apart. 

Unless you are on the verge of being homeless- do not apply here.
Even if you are a recent college grad, do NOT apply here. If you are so desperate, take the $1K sign on bonus and keep looking for another job- you will be miserable here! & there is a reason why they give a sign on bonus...

They sell you a dream and then don’t let you move up even if you’re doing well and are willing to work hard. 
They want you to very hard and work overtime hours without compensation and recognizing your value and the second you take it easy they punish you by putting you on corrective action which freezes you from promotion for 6 months. Even after those 6 months are up they will constantly use that against you and use it as a reason to not give you a pay bump/promotion."

It’s a good company to work for and your efforts as an employee and as part of your team are generally rewarded particularly in times of high demand - eg. Gift cards and meals being provided as a thank you during busy periods where there is extra overtime required. Most members of leadership are supportive, engaged, and actively help you improve yourself and your career opportunities. Benefits are quite good.","Overtime is consistent and mandatory at about 3/4hrs a week most every week. This gets old fast, we used to have a reprieve in the summer but lately with Covid it’s constant. Volumes can be high and job can be stressful. Making a lot of much needed technology changes but have implemented them poorly, so often it takes 2+ attempts to do a simple task which day in day out can be so frustrating. Took away some of our support systems due to organisational changes, and failed to implement appropriate solutions. We are now required to reach out to leadership for any questions on complex issues and often wait for long periods for answers while clients hold. Some members of leadership do not respond at all or engage in our group conversations. It’s often left to the same 1-2 members of leadership to support us 99% of the time. There are some teething pains since the aforementioned structural changes which I expect will be addressed, but leadership is slow to respond to our concerns and often we make the same complaints multiple times and they fall on deaf ears. We never receive any updates or response after being told something will be investigated / followed up on. These suggestions are to improve the firm so associates want to stay & clients are kept satisfied, we are not just trying to complain. Overall a good paying job & great company if you can tolerate these unnecessary and frustrating obstacles -specific to this role."

It really depends who your manager is and If they are even manager material. You can easily be chastised and put down in a Junior or Mid position. 
Throughout the interview process and during my time here I was told over and over again that my tech certifications would be paid for and to send requests in to get them paid for, when time came for me to get approved, I was told that it would be considered and it was eventually denied. 
The technology department has ALOT of catching up to do. There needs to be thorough reviews done with the managers from upper management to make sure all lower level employees are happy.

Lastly, this place is not for the “younger” <30 crowd (imo) unless you want to retire here and want to work in tech. A lot of the ideas and processes are SEVERELY outdated, you won’t grow much as a tech professional here unless you enjoy solving really really old problems that other major tech companies have already solved.

110,,Nearly killed me,2021-11-14,1.0,401k Specialist,401k was great and a generous espp.,"1. The work is so monotonous it will drive you to insanity. 
2. Management is unclear, manipulative and extremely hypocritical. 
Example: we were told we would be licensed during the interview process after hitting the floor. Once we went live we were told licensing would be provided to those interested and it became this very ambiguous date. Finally they make an announcement that no one would be licensed. Huge waste of time. 
3. OVERTIME. This is guaranteed every day. 
4. Management and advancement is a mystery. It’s not based on competence, intelligence…. Ambition. The combined personalities of everyone you hated in high school are managers here.
5. We were told we could move out of wise after 1 year of service. Soon completing my 1 year and sending out my applications they sold wise and barred all lateral movement in the company… essentially wasting everyone’s time who had ambitions past wise and forced them to go to FIS."

193,,Shockingly primitive,2021-07-22,3.0,WISE Associate,Great retirement benefits & various options for advancement. They do seem to actually care about their customers,"The biggest surprise upon starting at TRP was how backward and awful the vast majority of their systems are. Instead of having a couple of systems that are fully integrated, every minor task is an exercise in trying to combine information from four separate systems that do not talk with one another. You will also spend at least 30% of your day trying to open the various MFA systems because they seem to make the conscious decision on a minute by minute basis whether or not they are going to work. There seems to be no interest in getting any system to work consistently.

While some departments actually do have modern systems like Salesforce.com, even those departments are underutilizing aspects of the system that are actually included in what they already own. 

In my experience, most companies who preach Lean or Six Sigma methodologies are more interested in talking about process improvement than in actually improving processes and TRP is no different."

Annual bonus, 401(k), and stock-purchase program are amazing to the extent that they make it hard to leave.
Employees can send each other gift cards via AppreciateHub.
Overall the company is quite generous.
Smart and helpful coworkers.
The people are “T. Rowe Nice” with a few exceptions.
Reasonable managers that tend to care.
Tech aptitude is steadily increasing. Cloud-first.
Building up nice developer tooling.
Learning on the job.
Gave up on SAFe.
A lot of communication to employees.
Started hiring more entry-level lately.
Company’s financial products perform quite well.
Decent extracurricular activities.","Variety of programming languages includes some that need to go away.
Too much effort and time spent in certain internally built tools.
Some bad software consulting decisions.
Too much reliance on contractors (with lower technical standards), and pressure to convert them when max contact time reached, as some teams rely too much on them.
Have to go back to the office 3d/w as business wants tech to be in the office. Doesn’t matter that many teams are split across geographic locations.
Year-end reviews start in July and suck up a lot of time. 
Overreliance on metrics and incentives.
Instead of doing what’s best for the company at times we worry about visibility of individuals for the sake of reviews and promotions.
A lot of legacy code and low-performing teams from before we improved our hiring process.
Security restrictions, some of which are reasonable but some which seem like a lack of trust, hinder development.
“Open Q&A” sessions are highly moderated and many  reasonable but hard questions don’t make it past moderation to be voted on.
Too many balls in the air.
Seems like the business could be more innovative and take more risks.
With restricted flexibility it seems that those approved for WFH might be seen as less committed.
The company taking sides in political issues is getting concerning. It feels like people of certain religious or political persuasions are not welcome in management positions.
It’s possible to move teams but we can do it more and better.
Hard to move up (and yet, too hierarchical).
A lot of employee surveys, but hard to tell if leadership listens or takes action based on them.
Too often employees leave the company, whom I have worked with or known but from other teams, and I don’t know until long after they’re gone."

- Divide between employees who have spent 30 plus years at the firm and have made significant welath in doing so and the millenial generation who typically are substantially undercompensated when compared to similar roles at similar firms outside of Baltimore. 
- Most of the talent and capital reserved to pay and attract talent is focused on the investment platform, as it should be. Business Development always felt like an afterthought. The compensation I received reflected that. An ex: My territory was top gross sales and net sales across the organization. After a year of work and extensive travel I was told wait for the bonus becuase it can be anywhere from 1-100% of your salary. I recieved $23,000 dollars, not even the largest bonus on the team. The justification was I was paid out at the highest percentage of my base salary so in those relative terms - they felt justified in paying me less money than someone else despite my superior performance."

They have smart, innovative, hard worker employees who are so swamped with the day to day tasks they can’t work to their full potential and help move the business forward.

TRP literally locks elderly women out of their 401k accounts because they didn’t set up an online profile. Or forgot their password. TRP escalates calls to management that couldn’t care less. TRP makes customers go out during a pandemic and get a signed notary JUST TO ACCESS THEIR MONEY.

- Lot of opportunities for impact - big focus on leveraging tech to accelerate growth and differentiate from other firms (as opposed to just running some vendor products): exciting projects to leverage data science, modernize the user experience, distributed big data problems, etc...
- Lot of opportunities for learning - everyone is dedicating time to learn new skills, attending classes or conferences, and sharing back thought leadership with the office
- Opportunities for growth: good balance of senior and junior engineers - provides mentorship to the juniors and opportunities to coach and lead to the senior engineers
- NYC management and office is all engineers and data scientists: lot of experience building software - big focus on quality and testing, Agile and transparency.","- No proactive response of covid crisis - Everyone switched to WFH very quickly and still is but no clear guidance on what ""new normal looks like"".

- interesting problems to solve and huge client base of diverse organisations to work with 
- Friendlier hours then other buy side firms I have worked in with more of a focus on getting the job done than time spent sitting at your desk 
- Distribution team growing and an exiting place to work with good leadership 
- Great benefits (13% pension match for 3% personal contribution - employee stock programmes - private healthcare and a variety of other things) . Strongest employee benefits package overall in any buy side I have worked for but this does make getting raises or big pay jumps from promotion harder. It’s a trade off that I think still makes this a pro because of how good the overall package is","- Very US centric firm. Seems all major decisions are made out of Baltimore.

- The NY office is nice

- Smart, congenial colleagues

- Good WLB

Really has potential to be a great place to work if not for some of the glaring negatives.","- Repeated pattern of paying lip service to try to cover big blunders in decisions. There are currently a number of critical modernization initiative the company is attempting to undergo, and there is very little accountability and continued missed deadlines. When this happens, mgmt finds a scapegoat (or multiple) to blame, makes very little process efficiency improvements, and then continues down the same route. This goes on until a point of no return, at which point leaders will simply bail on the project altogether.

- NYC mgmt is truly sub-par. They are rude, 'cliquey', and aggressive. They are not invested in growth of employees, do not recognize good work where it's being done, and have no interest in building a respectful office culture. So much playing politics and continuing to reward poor-performing 'yes-men' that it's nauseating.

- The sales pitch of the office is that it has a startup vibe with the backing of a large financial firm. This could not be further from the truth. TRP is just like any other antiquated financial firm, and as such, focuses heavily on hiring cheap contracted labor instead of FTE's whom they cycle through consistently to show senior mgmt that they're making people changes when deadlines are blown through.

- Horrible culture of intimidation. Numerous issues have been brought up to mgmt, and they were ignored (and then you're put on the 'naughty list')."
437,,Marketing is Everything When You're Manipulating Image,2020-09-24,1.0,Anonymous Employee,Money and benefits are good but these are not enough to compensate for the bizarre and toxic culture.,"When companies get a bad review on Glassdoor, one course of action they can take to change their rating is to ask employees, past and current, to submit a favorable rating. From my experience working at TRP, I can say that this was also a common practice on their internal social networking. Managers frequently asked for ""positive win stories"" on Monday mornings so that they could get ahead of any negative feedback or perceptions of poor progress on projects. My experience at TRP was very, very negative. Twisted internal politics favoring long-term employees. Outright lying. Recruiting that I suspect was done so that a manager could earn a recruitment bonus but ultimately did not support the work of the new employee because it had been ignored and delayed, therefore, once the new position was filled, it was nearly impossible to make progress. In short, management was looking for a scapegoat because they sat on a critical project for years. Gossip was rampant. Managers ask you for dirt about your colleagues, then put both of you in the difficult position of having to answer for any genuine constructive feedback you'd provided. In other words, managers play associates against each other for their own gain or to cover their backs. Troubling misogyny, narcissism and bullying. Again, they are very good at manipulating image. I suspect it is because they know that if the ""invest with confidence"" image is tarnished by reports of harassment, bullying and retaliation, investors might think differently about who is managing their money."

Every day I see multiple times where customers or participants are given inaccurate information and most of the time there is no accountability towards the person who made the mistake and usually the participant is the one who suffers from the mistake. 

Personally even though I have not been with the company for long, I was promised a specific shift out of new hire training and found out they put me on a different shift without telling me. When asked I was told more or less “it is what it is, sorry.” I’ve now had it happen TWICE to where I have not received overtime pay properly on my checks through no fault of my own so I was shorted on money I was owed and should have received. 

Also, you WILL be working required overtime above and beyond your 40 hour work week. Usually about 5.5 hours of it a week, so that negatively impacts the work life balance."

-401k Contributions are great, if you can stomach working long enough to become vested
-Generally good benefits","-The overtime never ends. They promised in training that there'd be weeks where we could flex our schedules to work, say, shorter Fridays, but there's been overtime scheduled almost every week since I started.
-Limited opportunities for advancement or even lateral transfer. They require that you work in one department for a full year before you're even allowed to transfer departments. Again, we were told in training that getting a transfer is fairly easy, but you still have to interview and if the interviewing manager from the other department simply isn't interested, you'll languish in your current role until you finally become fed up and leave.
-The company is afraid of its enormous clients and as a result, fosters a ""customer is always right"" mentality. Certain policies in place reward callers who demand to ""speak to a manager;"" you may not get a fee refunded to your account unless you adopt a fake angry persona. At the same time, the company has abruptly changed certain elements of the phone tree and/or verification procedures without warning, and has consistently understaffed the department even with the unending overtime. This has resulted in many rude, angry and condescending callers for whom there is inadequate training for the handling of. You may have great health benefits here, but you'll spend the same amount on your mental health in your off time. 
-Managers love to play politics here. One manager neglected the associate development time of half his team while spending inordinate amounts of one-on-one time with a specific few. Another showered praise on an employee who quit because of the overtime; she refused to talk to the employee except to say that if she didn't extend her 2 weeks notice by another day, the company would consider her having left on ""bad terms"".

Additionally your pay rate will seemingly change every paycheck, and your work schedule will change 3-4 times a day, most days.

Coworkers are all in the same boat as you and I liked everyone I worked with.
Low-level management is nice in my experience, however there are some bad apples.","Shortlist:
Salary worst in the industry
This position is the lowest on the totem pole, the positions above it are the same job with slightly better pay.
Overtime. Everyday. If you use any PTO that week overtime is 1.0x pay not 1.5x.
It is back-to-back phone calls. Two 15 minute breaks and a 30 minute lunch. Usually you work 9-10 hour days on top of that. Expect 60-80 calls a day, you could hit 100 if you didn't blow your brains out first.
Decent amount of PTO but they changed how you can use it, so it has to be scheduled way in advance.
Very old technology, makes your job harder and angers clients.
Advancement takes forever, if you even get the opportunity.

I'm very disappointed in myself for working here. The company is very unethical and is a waste of your career. The licenses you receive are irrelevant to the industry and are used for retention. This job is on the 401k side. You will not be able to speak to the same person again, take any clients with you, or gain any licenses relevant to the industry (you can get the Seires 7 if you're there long enough, but not worth the wait and they SEVERLY under pay you for it). IF you must work here work for the IRA side (personal investing) however Charles Schwab, Fidelity, Edward Jones, and LPL all have WAY better programs."
488,,Horrible management at NYC office,2020-05-23,1.0,Software Developer,"Well run company, good benefits, market rate pay, catered lunch once a week, smart colleagues. Overall, could have been a nice place to work.","The NYC office was founded to launch Data Science related projects. If you are not on a Data Science project, your work is of no interest to anyone. 

The sales pitch of ""this is a startup within a large and established company"" is not true. NYC office culture is rigid and oppressive where feedback is penalized. Employee feedback is mandatory, but God forbid you say something you actually think, even if it is for the benefit of the company. The ""wrong kind"" of feedback is recorded in your personnel file (along with everything else) and will be used against you. 

If you are interested in joining a real startup, this isn't one. There is no room to grow. NYC office is small and is intended to stay that way. The parent company is in Maryland. If you want to be noticed and grow your career, NYC office is a dead end. 

NYC office is led by people who are not technical at all and know nothing about software development, but like to use big words and pontificate about software development methodology.

NYC management comes from Bridgewater Associates. They manage up and are rude and horrible to their subordinates. They only care about promoting the NYC office visibility within T Rowe Price and putting on a show for the upper management. They do not understand the work being done and don't care about the people doing it.

492,,II Services,2020-05-06,3.0,Client Service Specialist,Benefits are good. The firm will sponsor you for financial licenses,"Working in an entry level phone role is soul sucking. You will take 40 phone calls a day. A majority of the calls are like pulling teeth. You will consistently deliver bad news to people that call in and apologize for things you cannot control. To name a few examples: the documentation the client sent in was not in good order because a previous representative provided the client the wrong instructions, the client's paperwork got lost in the mail or back office and was never received, T Rowe Price made an error and has yet to resolve the issue because the queue for resolution cases is so backed up, or clients will complain about how user unfriendly the website is, and we are expected to know how to help clients use the website without any training or visibility of what the client is looking at online.
 The back office will send pre-generated letters to clients saying ""sorry, we are not able to process your request. Please contact a shareholder service representative"", and when the client calls back in response to the letter, most likely infuriated, you will be cornered into investigating what went wrong with their request. The back office often leaves vague processing notes on clients accounts in these situations, making it challenging to solve the client's issue. The system in which client documents and processing notes are imaged and stored is incredibly slow and difficult to navigate, which is frustrating when trying to solve an issue for an escalated client. 
 You must adhere to strict metrics (average call/ hold/after call work time, schedule adherence, quality reviews), when the department as a whole has never come close to meeting the target goals for those metrics since I've been here. You are expected to do a lot of tedious processing work off the phone, which will often get rejected because you were never trained in how to properly process it. This is incredibly stressful when trying to meet metrics and phone calls are constantly coming in. The quality control team is inconsistent in their knowledge and enforcement of compliance and policies (a quality control rep may say something that you told a client on a call is compliant, but another rep will reprimand you for it). Management pushes you to meet those metrics, but they are unrealistic to meet once you are tenured in the position because you assume more responsibility the longer you are in the role, so you constantly being transferred and queued the most difficult calls by untenured reps. You are also frequently cornered by clients asking you questions that are beyond your level of expertise (legal documents, how to certify those documents, tax advice, legal advice, financial advice) You learn how to BS and give vague answers to clients to get them off the phone because there is often not a definite answer you can give them, or nobody, including leadership, knows the answer. The longer you spend on each call, the worse you look because you are evaluated on this metric. This often forces you to act without integrity and rush people off the phone.There is huge turnover in the department due to people quitting or getting fired or inability to pass licensing. Most of the representatives taking phone calls are inexperienced and frequently providing the wrong information to clients. It is very challenging to network and meet other people due to extreme micro management by the phone scheduling team. You have to request to receive time off the phone and coordinate this allotted time with the schedule of whoever you are trying to meet/ network with. The phone scheduling group will often decline your request to receive time off the phone or give you an hour in advance notice before you can get off the phone, which is not enough notice to try to coordinate a time to meet with someone. One time I just sat off the phone for an hour without getting to meet with the person I wanted to meet with because of this, resulting in one less associate taking phone calls and T Rowe Price paying me for doing nothing for an hour. You are a puppet for the phone scheduling team and have little flexibility or freedom in your schedule. You will work 5+ hours of overtime every week, which is too much for a position that requires you to take back to back calls all day. The training for the client service role is a joke compared to the real thing. This job is draining, unrewarding, and unpleasant the entire time."

Benefits are very good, but standard in the finance industry.  401k match is excellent, this is probably above industry standard. 

Overall employee friendly culture. Work life balance is valued here, good amount of vacation days, and reasonable managers. Never felt that I can't take vacations as I needed. 

Nice office environment, expect class A buildings in all locations. 

Very strong and approachable leadership, especially senior management. They know their stuff, let's put it that way.","The culture here is a double edged sword.

Lack of desire and ability to execute change. Too many ""long tenured"" employees (middle mgt) that have no idea how rest of the world works. They are way too proud of what the company had accomplished in the past. They know what works, but no idea know how to fix the things that don't. A typical customer at T. Rowe is a baby boomer, and they don't seem to have any urgency to change that. 

Lack of transparency. Corporate communication here is basically propaganda. You'll only see feel good stories on company intranet. HR never able to actually talk about our business, super worried that employees are not engaged. 

Very very relationship driven. It's all about who you know. This shouldn't be surprising as investment business is relationship driven. But for a corporation, way too many behind the door conversations, meeting after the meeting, etc. 

Old school culture. Many HR and social media policies are stuck in the last decade. The company is absolutely having trouble retaining younger generation employees. 

Compensation on the lower end unless you are an investment professional.

It's a good place to work if you are ready to settle down, but if you are looking for accelerated learning, you won't get that here."

Pay is far below industry averages, especially given the massive work load and incredibly high overtime demands (5-20 hours a week).  They closed their Tampa site 6 months ago, and as a way to push their LEAN management initiative, have been slow to replace those people, as well as others who have left due to both negative and positive attrition. across their other two sites.  This has left those of us left behind severely overworked, depressed, angry, and looking for other jobs outside of the firm.  To say morale is low in the Retail Accounts department is an epic understatement.

Their attendance was great because as long as you had time in your time bank you would not get in trouble if you needed to leave early. The work that we did within the community was my fave part about working for T.Rowe. I was on several committees volunteering for the community and also committees for the associate’s events. T.Rowe tried to make work a fun place while still hitting our metrics.","Too much OT, not listening to associates ideas. If you work in 401k dept you have to be OK with working OT.

The company had been dubbed as ""T Rowe Nice"" because coworkers and individual contributors are professional, intelligent, experts in their job and they collaborate to do what is best for both the client and the company.   Many opportunities to work across organizational departments to understand and learn the business.","Reorganization shuffle every 6 months.  Poor planning,  frequent ad hoc meetings scheduled with no outcomes, wasted time, money and human capital resources.  All of this waste over time and across teams, does result in layoffs.  Individuals with past successes in a specialized area were promoted to management without having people-management-skills, an understanding of how their team fit within the larger future vision of the company nor the ability to lead through change."
570,,"Good company, call center job, but no time to enjoy working for the company",2019-08-01,3.0,Financial Services Representative,"They do offer a lot of options to be involved with the company (different social groups/sports teams).

They will have certain events with food, offering wellness checks, as well as massages. 

Open cubicle work environment. 

Cheap options for lunch. 

Job is fairly easy as within a few months you learn all the types of calls you will receive as well as how to answer them. If there happens to be a random irregular situation you can easily contact a help line who will walk you through it. 

Good pay for sitting and taking calls all day. 

The supervisors are very nice and available to help you on calls or stand up for you when a caller is upset and verbally abusing you.  

I felt the company and supervisors were very understanding of mistakes.","You have to be on the phones for 1 year before you can advance to another position, non-negotiable. 

Advancement is limited within the call center side of things.

Even if you've been on the phones for 1 year, it's very unlikely to really move to another position due to how many other reps are trying to advance. Highly competitive. 

Strict adherence to metrics (call times/when you're on and off). 

Due to the call center environment, you have very little time to read emails to even be informed about the involvement pros I listed above, and much less time to even partake in those activities. 

You'll be forced to work a lot more overtime than you're expecting while senior management is leaving early.

Job is sort of mundane as you get used to the same type of call and hope you don't get an angry person who doesn't understand that investments fluctuate with the market and take out their anger on you or the company. 

Some of the correspondence sent out to participants has confusing vocabulary for the recipients which drive up call volumes and often times frustrate people as they think their account is being manipulated due to fund changes or an address change being called a ""transaction"" on their account. 

Not much of an ability to make an impact on the backlines of the company and feeling like just a small cog in the system. 

The only way to offer feedback is to email your supervisor who will send it up and you'll never hear back."

Senior leadership schedule 1 on 1’s with you to pretty much ask about you direct manager and see how things are going. Only to go back to the manager and tell them, which then creates a more hostile and uncomfortable environment. Don’t think about going to HR.

It would be nice if they gave raises and maybe a nice bonus as a thank you for all this extra work but those are non-existent for most of us. Different excuses were given to everyone as to why they were not receiving a raise, so unless you have have absolutely perfect metrics don't expect to be recognized or rewarded. Even if your call quality, service and accuracy is great it doesn't matter, these things don't seem to be important to T. Rowe Price. They've fallen so far behind in hiring people that all they care about is answering as many calls as possible as quickly as possible.

- Awesome comprehensive benefits","The experience you have is entirely dependent on the department you work in. The foundational roles like account management and the phone service groups get somewhat abused with unpredictable overtime. The pay is just enough for you to manage your bills assuming you don't have several obligations. The management is not experienced for the most part or even familiar with the work so you need to be a self-starter but even then it can be difficult to thrive. The turnover rate is pretty high if you aren't meeting their standards, people can seem pretty miserable because of this. You get babysat and have to follow a strict schedule (this plays into your performance reviews).

798,,You will not experience instant success - you will have to work for it!,2017-04-12,5.0,Group Manager,"I worked at T. Rowe Price just a few months short of 15 years. During the first 3 years of my career, I would constantly ask myself ""why am I being overlooked?"" I would blame my lack of career advancement on others, in particular, I thought management was incompetent at the time. 

Shortly after that point in time, I got a gut punch. I started to realize that I was pointing my finger at the wrong person. I started to try something new, I went about setting goals. Albeit some goals had nothing to do with work, however others did. I took the step of trying to volunteer for new opportunities, however at first nothing came up. So instead of having self-pity, I started to learn more about my role in between phone calls. Instead of sitting idle doing nothing, I challenged myself to learn everything I could about my role. I started to expand myself further, I started off by reading one new book a month and that quickly grew into reading two or three new books a month. During group meetings, town halls or training sessions - I started to speak up. I started to ask thoughtful questions, I started sharing some of my best practices...I even asked for help on how I could improve professionally.  

From there, the approximate next 11 years of my career at T. Rowe Price were amazing. I had a burning desire to do more - I would never say no when given a new task or responsibility. I would never turn down a non-promotional move to another department. At times I would be overwhelmed, however I was able to work through it. By continuing to push myself personally and professional, I started to see changes. It was not overnight, it took time. As I progressed from individual contributor roles to various leadership roles, I found a new set of challenges, rewards and even failures. I was not perfect, and at times I felt that I let my staff down. However, I had a great set of direct reports and an amazing manager. When I failed at something, it was not the end of the world - it hurt like hell at the time, however the support structure I had was amazing. 

It has been a little bit of time since my departure from T. Rowe Price. When I reflect back on my time there, I have to give it 5 stars! I was able to experience so many things and was able to work in almost every department in the Tampa office during my tenure. All I can hope for is that someone who is at a point in their career where they are questioning things - take a moment to self reflect. You may be having a moment like I had earlier in my career, if so, it's never too late to reinvent yourself! If you take advantage of what T. Rowe Price can offer you and don't expect instant success - I think you will find that it is a great company to develop yourself.","If you are only focused on the pay, it is not a good fit for you. 

Don't get me wrong, it was not all sunshine. At times you will have great suggestions - and they will be overlooked or not implemented. I would say to my direct reports at times, I consider it a success if only 9 out of 10 of my ideas get turned down. I don't see that as a T. Rowe Price fault - it is just life, not all your ideas get implemented. 

Very supportive environment - can sometimes be too supportive for lower performing associates."

A contractor won't be automatically converted after six months it's more like 18 months and you will have to apply for an open position if there is any available. The management I worked for asked me about medical issues which is unethical and against the law in the states. The atmosphere is slow, prehistoric and stuffy. Professionals are treated like children and not empowered if you are contractors. I would stay away if you plan on making a change and uprooting your life and foundation.

There are a few roles within the company that allow autonomy, but not many. Additionally, the company forces the managers to support the client over the associate, which is a bad business practice. It is a relatively frequent occurrence that you will get into an escalated situation with a client based on company policy, and you inform them there is nothing you can do. Then, they ask to speak to your manager, and the manager immediately acquiesces, making you look like a stooge, and creating the habit within the client that they can only trust management, and can get whatever they want from them."

-You consistently get mandatory overtime with little notice of it so in weeks where it's OT heavy it may feel like work is life. For 8 months I was here, our department as a whole was understaffed which led to everyone working constantly and the level of burnout among everyone was palpable when I got in the door every morning.

Would recommend to a friend only in these cases.","Very few opportunities for career advancement outside of the Baltimore MD home office. 
Extremely politicized work environment, with entrenched mid and senior management. 
Company is constantly lagging behind industry with regards to client-facing technology and internal work systems. 
Company has built a reputation of underpaying employees by just enough so that: 1. Employees question the companies sense of value placed on retaining talented people. 2. Employees constantly struggle with the prospect of looking to other employers for career advancement and equitable pay. 
Company has taken an adolescent approach to metrics for employee performance. This approach has completely changed the value proposition for our clients. Representative and client interactions are now focused completely around an arbitrary metric, and no longer around the client need. The company as a whole lacks vision and a mission (and mission statement), from the top down."

The job is FAR more complicated and detailed than what it pays. You can learn one department and be promoted in a phone group much quicker. You'll also make more money on phones. It takes forever to get up and running with the studying for the licensing and learning to write on your own. Most people run like the wind after being here for a year because the environment is so toxic.

MANAGEMENT - Management is horrible! None of them are well versed in writing so they're useless. They also don't know the different departments in order to assist you with questions.

TRAINING - There really is no training on the writing part. Or the different parts of the business they support. They may put you through that department's new hire training but you're pretty much on your own. Once you learn how to do something they just keep piling the work on.

MAJOR MICROMANAGEMENT - They micro manage everything you do down to where your mouse is on the screen and how long the screen is idle. There's more freedom in the phone groups which makes no sense.

MANDATORY OVERTIME - Be prepared to work 1-2 hours of mandatory overtime most days of the week. They're also always so short staffed that you can't get time off when needed. 

PHONE CONTINGENCY - If you came from an internal phone group and phones are busy, be prepared to be shipped back over there at a second's notice to answer phones."

Additionally, you get a ton of paid time off, good health plan options and lengthy, paid maternity/paternity leave.

After a few years, most of the good and driven employee's leave to seek higher paying roles in the industry.  Those that stay for more than 5 years, do so for the great benefits certainly not job satisfaction or advancement. The employee's that are client facing (phones which is most roles) are treated as easily replaceable (which funny because it is actually impossible to fire anyone). The interview process means little to nothing, it's all about your ""buzz"". HR needs to play a bigger role in the interview process internally. Lastly, the systems, processes and back office procedures are so outdated it's impossible to get anything done, escalated or resolved.

At one point (6 years ago) T. Rowe Price only hired people with a college degree, now it hires anyone that has some sort of customer service and can answer a behavioral question on the interview right.

Historically, I would see supervisors with more years of experience and who had worked in various groups move into these roles.

I worked there through 3 holiday seasons and never once got off Christmas Eve or Black Friday off through their ""lottery"" system. Middle management is rampant with some of the most incompetent people I've met in the industry and like stated in previous posts is very political. Bonus' are not competitive and don't expect a pay increase of more than 2%. There is very little opportunity for advancement outside of a call center position if that is where you started. It doesn't help that they just closed almost all of their branches. Overall I would not recommend staying at this company for my longer than a year."
1133,,Investment Counselor,2013-07-15,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Great co-workers, great mutual funds, great company culture & great benefits!!!!",Not a lot of opportunity to advance in positions other than management or on the phone.  Pay is not great.
1134,,More Cons than Pros,2013-07-12,2.0,Supervisor,"Great culture, great looking campus, good place for building a financial education foundation.","Where do I begin......is anyone really expected to believe a review written where everything is wonderful and the writer's only Cons are ""location, heat, and traffic cops???"" Really? I had friends in HR who would tell me that HR would go in and instead of reviewing the cons to see what they could fix they would put these bogus positive reviews. There's your first problem. 

Second, dont hold forums to ask associates and management what upper management can do to help improve the department just to appease them then not act on their ideas. Your associates are not idiots and know that is all you do. You guys think you're sneaky but you're not. Next, hire more people. You wonder why you have tons of OT in every department all of the time.......well its because the company is growing. When you have 1,000 plans in 2008 and now have over 1,400 plans in 2013 yet you have the same number of associates servicing that number of customers you're going to have tons of OT. Its basic business management. I understand that there are budgets you need to stick to but if you're client base is growing that rapidly you should be able to afford hiring more people, unless you promise these clients the world with custom plan features that the company cant follow through on making it hard on the associates who perform these functions and who have to work tons of OT to make these promises happen, yet get a 0.49% increase and $500 bonus. Finally the pay is horrible. Quit saying that the benefits are great and they offset the lower pay cause it doesnt. 

Benefits are mediocre, at best. Make the pay competitive and the bonuses and merit raises something to strive for. If you have everyone working well above the department average and  they get their year end rating as a ""Solid Performer"" with a minimal raise and bonus dont wonder why they slow their production down the following year. If you worked your butt off and didnt get recognized for it wouldnt you work less???"
1135,,Depends on where you work...,2013-07-10,2.0,Retirement Specialist,"Friendly co-workers for the most part, that's the best part.  Decent place to start off your career and get ground level experience in finance.","The entire department of Retirement Plan Services (RPS).  I would highly recommend you AVOID this part of the company at all costs.  They will advertise ""room for advancement"", but your pay never gets much better and the so-called advancement is just them circulating you through the departments.  And unless you know someone, every ""promotion"" is preceded by an entire interview process, which is the sole deciding factor in you getting your new position.  Its entirely conceivable to be crushing all of your departments rating metrics and be loved by your manager, but if the current 'leadership' happen to like someone else, then so sorry, try again next time.  

In the end, even if you get the promotion, new managers working there for 5+ years will barely hit $50k, with no over-time pay.  In my almost 6 years there, I never even broke the $45k mark.  

This is the part where they will point out that if you're not salaried, then your income will be supplemented by overtime.  Boy, will it ever.  In the course of about 5 years, RPS went from occasional overtime and the ability to ""flex"" overtime and leave early some days, to constant overtime and no flexing allowed whatsoever.  In some departments, they even have mandatory early start times and shortened lunches every week.  Most weeks, you will know you have 2-3 hours of overtime coming, before you even start the week.  Add on the additional overtime, and you're looking at a lot of 9-10 hour days, more the rule than an exception. Don't expect a personal life unless you have a family.  If you have a family, you can cop out and claim you need to leave early or come in late and its usually universally acceptable.  Anybody else, you're screwed, as you have to pick up the slack for those lucky few.

The final nail in the coffin is the stigma attached to RPS.  Other departments won't hire you.  They know that RPS hires, literally, uneducated people, and people with zero experience.  So when you apply outside of RPS, your resume is often times ignored.  Being internal is a liability more than a boon from within RPS.  You might as well leave and work somewhere else, then in 6 months to a year, apply to that same position and you'll get an interview at the very least, probably even hired.  Crazy."

1144,,Solid Entry or Mid Level Career,2013-06-12,4.0,Retail Associate and Client Manager,"Benefits are very nice (Insurance, Base 401k and match, year end bonus). Salary is mediocre, but benefits help bring closer to competition. There are a lot of people that work there, so it's easy to find ""work friends"" to make the days/weeks more tolerable. Lots of group outings. They try their best to provide additional incentives, though they tend to be lackluster (Recognition program, random free lunches, raffles) in the form of gift cards, and they are taxed which is understandable yet tacky. RIS (entry level) was pretty bad, but as long as you aren't an idiot you can get promoted pretty quickly, especially recently. PSG is more skill intensive, challenging, and satisfying. PSG also has a much more appropriate salary (though a parrot could be an average RIS associate, so it's understandable).

Campus is great, parking is amazing, and commute isn't bad. There are plenty of restaurants in the area and the commute isn't terrible.

Training program was great, continuing education is decent. Every once in awhile they have interesting road shows where important people (CEO, Portfolio Managers, etc) present.

Overall I would recommend the job, especially for somebody moving into the area or just graduating college and need something solid to put on your resume. Don't expect to get anywhere substantial for at least 2 years unless you graduated from an Ivy League school. There are double MBAs with CFAs working for 50 grand. It's also not required that you have a business degree to get hired into RIS or PSC, and once you're in the company, degree doesn't matter at all.","There are very limited opportunities from RIS, one of the better would be PSG. It is very hard to get promoted from PSG to somewhere worthwhile, even if you are a ""superstar."" RIS management micromanages and has a very corporate mentality; there is very little opportunity for productive thought. Management tends to be former RIS representatives that have been in the job for a long time and weren't good enough to get better jobs, so settled for management. They also tend to get big heads about how important they actually are.

Days get very monotonous and bad clients can easily ruin days. It can be very stressful when clients have unrealistic goals or expectations. Management is also very cut and dry, so logical exceptions to policy are rarely made.

Recognition is given on a quarterly basis, but rarely recognizes appropriate employees. The winners of Associate of the Quarter, et al tend to be representatives that management like rather than those that consistently maintain high standards. I've also heard that management tends not to give a representative an award more than once, though I think that is counter intuitive.

They have ridiculous rules for promotion. You could be the best and smartest person on the floor, but still have to go through the normal promotion (1 year in your current role, rarely get out of RDS without putting in at least 2 years in various departments)."

1192,,Will hire right out of college - just don't stick around too long,2012-02-24,1.0,Senior In PSC,"T. Rowe will hire someone as soon as they graduate college, without any experience required. You get decent training to learn what you need to know. In this position, you will also get a fair amount of industry knowledge that will be helpful in future jobs.","The pay is terrible. Most associates still live at home with their parents due to the lack of compensation. Promotions are based on who management likes best, rather than the strongest workers. The job itself is completely mundane and repetitive. You do the same thing all day, every day. You are required to request days off months ahead of time and will be turned down often. Each one of your colleagues also hates their job, so the morale is terrible. Your schedule is set so if you are even a minute late, you get a ""warning"" and eventually get ""written up."" They are so afraid to fire anyone that many of your colleagues are completely inadequate at his/her job and you spend most days cleaning up their mistakes. Additionally, management tells you how great your benefits are, but as soon as you go to another company you realize that they weren't good at all.

Lesson learned: Work there for a year, get your licenses... apply to other competitors in the area. You'll make way more money and actually like your job."
