6,,Great Work Experience,2022-03-26,4.0,Loan Servicing Specialist II,It was a great opportunity to get back into the workforce as entry-level work. Everyone was easy to work with and you felt like family. We had daily huddles to discuss work but also check in with each other When we had we work remotely they were very also very accommodating. If you had family emergencies they would allow you to step away and return later to make up for missed time.,"Sometimes there were high demands and unrealistic expectations towards the end of my work assignment.

Some managers seem to discriminate against African-American employees. One BCS team placed just about all of their African-American team members on corrective action (a step from firing). For African-Americans, I do not recommend.

Some BCS managers micromanage and have no respect for the health of their reports. At the beginning of the pandemic, management tried to keep the team in the office as long as possible as our state surged in Covid cases, and only relented when teammates resisted their push to stay in-office. The managers tried to keep the team from listening to company-wide addresses so we wouldn't know the entire office was going remote.

Working inside the Jewel Osco can be uncomfortable because when the bank closes, the Jewel is still open so people customers always expect to be helped out even when the bank is closed.

Great hours for college students. 
If part of management there is monthly incentive for goals.","Many managers teach their branches to cross-sell excessively and get credit card applications in by “any means necessary”. The statement “approved to apply” is thrown around loosely despite knowing it can be misleading. Customer can tell you they’re credit is bad and the tellers will still tell them to apply knowing it will hurt their credit more. Basically, there, is no job security unless you are okay getting sales by any means. They do not care about getting volume either, they care about results. You will only get praised if you get “approved” credit cards and not just applications. Accounts you get praised if they are quality accounts, not if they get closed soon after for things that are out of your control."

A lot of good ideas.","Getting anything done takes forever, there are a few senior leaders who want to move things faster, but there is a lot of red tape.  Also, some leaders have no idea how to run their departments or functions.  They try to run the department like they ran others, and are not always willing to take feedback.

387,,Unappreciated TCF Slave,2019-05-19,2.0,Anonymous Employee,Free coffee and 16 days of PTO,"I worked in one of the departments at TCF in the Plymouth corporate center and I don’t feel they value their employees. TCF has recently merged with Chemical Bank and some weird stuff has been happening since. Like change of schedules, culture, attitudes, etc. They don’t check in with you to see how you are doing, they overwork you and treat you like a slave. It’s always about the errors that you make and not the good you do. I noticed in this department there was favoritism and certain people didn’t have to log in on phones and accept incoming branch or contact center calls because they had a high volume of alerts and they do high volumes of work. Well, everyone else in the department does high volumes of work and they have to take up the slack of other people. It really wasn’t fair. And about breaks, you have a choice because of the volume of work and you feel forced into it... You take your 15 minute break, take your lunch and fall behind and stay late OR skip your breaks and work unpaid during lunch and stay a little late. If you enjoy slavery and working so much without a break this is the department for you!! And recently, they want to change your schedules for you to work 11-8 and force a one hour lunch on you so they can have coverage. In this department you verify checks and harass banks and the maker and if you enjoy harassing people this job is for you. They also hold cash deposited into the atm until they “verify” it and that is a negative customer impact. And i feel this department is also incompetent when it comes to claims. I’ve had a branch call to check up on a claim and i asked person working on it what the status was and apparently they were on lunch, the branch personnel then yells at me and says you all have been on lunch for a long time. Then i send their information and forward it to the people working on it and they never reach out and I’m the one getting yelled at once again because of other peoples incompetence . Outside of everything that goes on in this department, it’s a negative workplace. People angrily drive into the parking lot, throw doors open in your face and act pushy in the confidence areas and they have no picnics for employees unless you pay to go and the cafeteria upstairs at the Plymouth is expensive and mediocre."

Most years I am left with 2-3 weeks of un-used vacation that does not roll over as my compensation is not enough to go on a vacation and if I do take time off I have to rely on people that won’t call my clients back.

Most of the people who have worked there 20+ years are there because they are comfortable with 1990's technology.  Worst of all is the new Plymouth location.  The commute is awful and the building is sub-par.  Very disappointed in the lack of practicality in the vision that the executives tout.  They don't 'put their money where their mouths are' and this bank is extremely penny-wise and pound foolish."

628,,Relationship Banker,2016-11-28,2.0,Relationship Banker,"*Full time positions available

*No experience necessary, apart from cash handling experience

*Incentives

*Low impact work - run deposit, transfer, withdrawal transactions - cross sell to current and new customers - open new accounts

*Social coworkers","*Nearly paid minimum wage for work that's evaluated at 12-14/hr at other banks. Even lower management agrees that TCF Bank is one of the lowest paying banks out there.

*incentive is tied to team performance, not the worst con out there, but not a fun one

*heavily sales oriented. Virtually every customer needs to be cross sold to manage reaching sales goal. If you don't make your sales goal for two months straight. You're put on an action plan. If you don't make your sales 2 months after that, you're let go. This is dependant on your manager and district manager. You need to sell 70 checking or savings account, 21 CDs or credit cards, or 42 cross sells. Or a mix. Essentially, you need 2-3 mixed accounts every day you work to make sure you stay on track. It's challenging since the vast majority of your clientele are repeats. They've heard the sales pitch countless of times. 

*TCF free checking isn't actually free. Our district /regional manager forces locations to sell a checking account with a book of checks. They're roughly 20. If you don't keep a rate of 95+%, you get in trouble. We're not allowed to sell a checking account with checks. They only way we're able to is if the customer makes a fuss and we then have to get the managers approval or the district /regional manager Ralph if your store manager isn't available. 

*Jewel locations are tiny. If you work at a bad jewels, the location can get very hot since jewels won't fix the vents near the tcf branch. Since we have to share the break room with jewels, its really disgusting and depressing. Not what you would expect from working at a bank. Bathrooms are gross.

*high turnover

*accounts are open at 90% regulation standards. We try to follow the rules 100%, but sometimes we let a few things slide. We don't explain everything, we don't give all the pamphlets. We have to juggle transactions and account openings 

*the business day cutoff is at 2pm. It's meant to maximize overdraft fees. Disgusting. When I learned this, me and manager got a bit into an argument. 

*Insurance is not worth it, especially considering it's a bank."

During a company trip that same manager slept with another employees wife. When another one of his employees starting legitamety dating someone from another office, he told him that the company 'frowns upon interoffice dating'. The lesson this manager portrays: Do as I say, not as I do, and it's okay if you don't get caught.  Favoritism runs rampant. It's not what you do or how you do it, it's who you know and who likes you. I have sat in meetings where future managers were bypassed for less qualified people based on promises made to people that they ""couldn't take back"". The culture is very centered on increasing profit and cutting costs; which explains why employees are paid so little. Company prefers to hire part time over full time to save benefit costs; even though they will often work part timers at full time rates. They even hire part time managers! Several managers running each office, left hand doesn't coordinate with right hand. Yes, I was a manager. Leaving this place was the best career move I ever made."

The company is starting to invest in technology and improving the physical workplace environment. There appears to be an initiative by Sr. Management to make the company more attractive to younger professionals as there have been surveys and organized meetings for millennials to talk about pros and cons and provide feedback on areas they feel are important.,"There are significant cultural differences between the divisions at TCF. Some have excellent reputations and attract current employees to fill open positions, others have poor reputations and typically have to hire externally to fill roles. I find the culture very old fashion in my division, where there is very little flexibility by management on working from home or adjusting an individuals daily work schedule (i.e. starting earlier to leave earlier). 

Compensation is okay, I received an increase in base salary when I came to TCF, however the benefits package is poor in my opinion. The 401k match doesn't start until you've had your 1 year anniversary, and has a 5 year vesting period on the match. The only health insurance option is a high deductible plan with an HSA, and the dental insurance is 100% paid by the employee. There is no maternity leave offered, which I feel is a big negative. With the other large employers in Minneapolis (General Mills, Target, US Bank, etc) the competition for the best talent is strong, and TCF's benefit package falls significantly short.  Not having a match on my 401k for the first year, as well as the additional out of pocket costs on the health and dental insurance almost completely offset the increase in salary I received coming to TCF. I know, my fault for not doing enough research, but I was and still am very disappointed.

-The bank is a small regional bank. So you really do feel like part of a big family and since team members frequently leave to go to other branches you have the ability to network and know whats going on company wide.

-More of a casual environment than a lot of other banks.

-William Cooper seems to be a pretty decent guy.

-Lots of opportunity to volunteer and do good things in the communities in Colorado.

-Easy to get promoted to supervisor and put management experience on your resume.","- Some in the company think that outside sales(knocking on random businesses), telemarketing, and setting up tables at flea markets and other events is an effective and profitable endeavor, and it's not.

-Bank is known as a second chance bank and has a terrible reputation and brand image in Colorado.

-Noncompetitive products in a competitive market. The bank is too big to provide a credit union experience and not big enough to be able to offer half of what wells fargo and chase do. 

-Branch Team members have so many responsibilities that they are most often jacks of all trades and masters of none. Very few have the in depth knowledge needed to do all aspects of their job well. This is also due to a very poor training program.

-Terrible technology. Simple task that are easy at other banks are a nightmare because TCF has old outdated and user unfriendly technology.

-Lack of cohesion among all the different departments and offices. Maybe it's better in Minnesota.

-Lack of quality upper management leads to misguided vision for the company and a lack of any clear sensible way to take the company in a better direction.

-Pay is non competitive for the work that you will be doing. Other banks pay better for less responsibility.

-Lack of oppertunities. The bank is small and there is no room to move past supervisor, unless your willing to spend a long time making next to nothing to get there."

No one wants to work in such a place of unprofessionalism.  Everything that you are taught in training just went out of the window. No one followed proper security procedures for the atm check or the vault count.  I hated being at that branch.  The manager already had her favorite customer service representatives established. She let them do and act however they chose.  There was so much stealing of the money by the supervisors going on at that time that at least three of the supervisors were fired for suspicious activities while I was there.  The replacements that were sent to the branch were only better in the fact that they weren't blatantly stealing the money from the vault or making bogus transactions like the others did.  But what they did do, is speak to  the employees in a very undermining manner.  There was no mutual respect for everyone as you would expect the workplace to be.  I lasted for quite a while to my surprise, because I'm not a quitter. But eventually, I ended up leaving when I found something else much more suitable.

The medical plan, Unitedhealthcare EPO works actively to try to talk your doctor out of successful treatments and they also stop coverage of medications they previously covered.  I was warned that TCF's healthcare choices weren't very good but I had no idea it would be this bad in comparison to my last employer's insurance - Blue Cross Blue Shield of Illinois PPO).

Being in a management position I  had to train myself on sales, how to manage the branch, and operations. The company is very unorganized because there are not enough departments to help with needs you cannot complete in the banking center. 

The worst part of my experience was being left to manage a branch without additional help. Once I was left as a supervisor to manage the branch for a month after my branch manager was fired (with no experience on how to take over his responsibilities). Another time as an assistant manager I was left to manage the branch for three months without a branch manager (he got transferred and they didn't bother to replace him). During this time I reached out to the regional manager who refused to send additional help).

The company is all focused around sales so customer service is poor. If you work at a slow location you are forced to go around to local business to try to get sales( almost none of them will let you come there).

As of right now everyone is on a point system in terms of checking saving and online statements. The products are competitive with the bigger banks but with a better checking account.,"Like I said sales is a BIG part here. Don't get me wrong you can advance with being good at just the operations side but from what I've seen it takes a lot longer. New hires are frequently asked to go on ""outside sales"" which pretty much means going door to door or setting up tables at places to offer people checking and savings accounts. Also management meaning upper management Regional Manager and Director change sales on almost a monthly basis. One month you can do outside sales, the next you can't after that maybe just table events. When a decision is made it very rarely is law for more than a quarter.

963,,Leave as soon as you can,2014-04-18,1.0,Assistant Branch Manager,Flexible schedule they will hire you with no experience and my old manager liked to promote with in. That's about it,They only good manager they had they get rid of for a bogus reason she gets hurt on company time and she gets fired after she's off medical. She was the best manager I ever worked for and the only reason I am still at Tcf. I will be gone as soon as I can be
964,,Good experience. Bad upper management.,2014-04-17,2.0,,Work here if you want some good experience. Pay is decent but still low compared to other teller jobs. TCF is a good stepping stone if you want to eventually work at a different bank.,If you don't meet sales quotas you will be fired or seriously reprimanded. There is often very high workload with very little recognition.

The company is really looking to be heading to the right direction at a good pace. I heard from higher management our company is working daily on catching up with bigger banks on technology and methods to keep us relevant with consumers. It is great to build your starting career in banking as they really do not require much when I started as a teller. Typical bank, but much better atmosphere with better personality for sure.",The pay is now where near as good as other banks. I compare our salaries to other banks and we are getting ripped off which is the real reason this place is not perfect. Branch managers seem to not be licensed on a lot of things anymore which is disappointing for anyone looking to be a branch manager cause that means less pay when you try to climb the ladder. Everything is a branch goal usually and tellers do not get any well paid incentive.

As an entry-level job, you learn a ton about the underwriting process and are able to choose what career path you'd like to take (career underwriter, lender, management), assuming you want to stay in the banking industry.","High turnover with this position and the bank doesn't seem to care.  The pay isn't great and after a few years in this position many people go elsewhere for more money.  There is no actual ""training"" for this position.  You're thrown into the job running, which can be good or a bit intimidating for some.  Additionally, it's hard to get management to pinpoint dates for promotion."

My branch would do just about anything for accounts. Making relationships with other companies was a big part of the job. And if you tried to make a relationship and were unsuccessful you were made to feel terrible.  Colorado just re sized their management. Meaning there is now 1 manager for every 2 branches. Which to me is just absurd!!  With all the responsibilities i had i should have been making much more than i did. Run teller transactions, open and close accounts, answer any and all customer questions, change customer information, file claims for fraud, try and explain the ridiculous fee policies. And the list really does go on.  Also if your not into kissing butt i suggest you have no intentions of moving up. I saw someone receive a write up then not a month later get a promotion. So its all about whos good side you can get on. And don't even think about getting on your Branch manager or even asst. managers bad side. I didn't complete a list complied of leads to get accounts and my hours were cut from 35 to 15."

There's no open door policy if you bring up anything they will belittle you and tell you you're opinion doesn't matter. Regional managers won't speak to you either about issues involving your branch so you're left on your own, better off quitting and finding a better job!

Job opportunities are also severely limited as they laid off half their managers in Colorado and now have one manager for every two branches. Quality managers were asked to take massive pay cuts to assistant manager while inept ones were retained based solely off seniority. There are now a surplus of assistant managers for a very limited number of managers. Promotions have stagnated at every level, as now there are too many assistants so they supervisors can't move up, and the supervisors are stuck so tellers have limited options as well."

-The NSF fees are very difficult to make customers understand, and branch employees are not allowed to reverse fees unless it was due to some sort of bank error.
-Many branch managers are extremely selfish, flaky, and overall bad leaders.  My manager was hardly ever at the branch and never took PTO for the countless weeks she just wouldn't show up.
-The pay is TERRIBLE, especially for the financial industry and for the amount of pressure they put on every employee.
-Coming back to the sales pressure, it's so intense that employees will do nearly anything to make their goals.  An insane amount of employees have been fired for practicing ""unethical procedures"" in order to try and keep their jobs.  
-There is awful turnover for hourly employees, most tellers are in college just looking for a job to get them buy, and the lower management has to over compensate for their lack of motivation to work and be professional."

The Regionals Managers know what's going on because some have worked their way up so they did it themselves or just don't care because the production gets them incentive. If a regional manager doesn't like you he/she will fire you they will find any reason to get rid of you (even if it doesn't make sense) On the flip side if a regional likes you he will protect your job and HR will listen to the Regional and save the persons job and close the case if you tell of the illegal practices. The goals are ridiculous and unattainable with TCF reputation. If you work here YOU will feel almost embarrassed to tell people where you work at. The fees are set-up to get peoples money and you wont really know how to explain to a customer how they got hit with 2 fees and there account won't even show a negative balance on their online banking or the banks transaction history. The regionals like butt-kissers to make them feel superior when in reality they are scary cats outside of work but like their titles to intimidate. Really won't take lunch breaks if full-time. Overworked and underpaid is what you will be at TCF OH YEA AND UNAPPRECIATED!! If you stay long enough and work with different branch managers and regionals you will see.
1020,,Great,2013-09-25,1.0,Sales,Great Staff and learning experience.,Lots of overdraft fees so lots of unhappy customers.
1021,,An interesting experience,2013-09-12,2.0,Bank Teller,Fun setting to work in and awesome location next to the University of Denver.  The employees and bosses were all nice and polite as well.,The types of clients that this bank brings in are atrocious.  They were typically homeless people and our upper management would want us to go out on the street and get people to sign up for checking accounts and offer them the $100.  Of course all we got were homeless people or people you would never want having a bank account.  Made no sense.
1022,,TCF Sales Position,2013-09-08,4.0,Sales Associate,"They promote within, hours are pretty flexible, and you have several opportunities for monthly bonuses based on sales production. Your goals are attainable, you just have to push for accounts. Cross sell everyone, and take advantage of opportunities that present themselves.","90 percent of the job is sales, if you miss your goal 2 months in a row you go on probation, miss again and you can be terminated. There is a lot of pressure to get accounts, but if sales is your thing it's not an issue. Their banking policies when it comes to fees are questionable, you might not always agree with what you have to enforce."
1023,,You will move up fast if you screw your customers!!!,2013-08-27,1.0,Branch Manager II,"The only great thing about being a Branch Manager is that you can make your own schedule. If you decide to be a Branch Manager at TCF Bank, just know that everyone's job has an expiration date on it! Set a plan for yourself to get out like I did! I used TCF just as much as they used me. I went an got an education and reaped the benefits of tuition reimbursement every year to help pay for it. It was easy to go to school since I was in charge of my own schedule. I now have a degree and a career making six figures. Thank you TCF for the title, helped big time on the résumé!","People get recognized by doing wrong to customers. Many of the top producers will do anything for a a checking account. For example, if someone loses their debit card, many TCF employees tell customers that in order to protect there account and resolve there issue they have to open a new account. In reality, the customer does not need to open a new account, they simply need to cancel the card and order a new one. TCF employees however will persuade the customer otherwise and make the customer believe their account is at risk in order to get a new account sale. If you do not hit your goals you feel a ton of pressure from region managers. I am proud to say I was able to hit my goals legitimately until my last year at TCF. I was good to my customers, but most people are not because of the pressure. This is why I resigned after I got my degree, I refused to lie to customers. TCF does not set its employees up for success. Instead they give unrealistic sales goals that only the best of the shady people can hit! 

The turn over is ridiculously high because they will hire ANYONE! Starting June 2013 they started hiring individuals with no work experience. Who wants someone with handling their money if its there first job? This leave room for more errors. There are so many customers who come in because money is missing from there accounts because of all the processing errors made by these 17 year old employees who are careless. TCF also has no room to be selective in their hiring because they pay less than most banks for the bank teller through assistant manager position.

TCF will ruin is not good for your health, literally!!! All my family and friends say they can tell I am much happier since I resigned. Don't wait time on your life at TCF Bank.... Unless you are good at being dishonest and hurting customers by lying to them, you may fit right in. TCF Bank has a bad reputation which also makes it hard to get legitimate sales. Everyone knows how bad of a bank it is, so when you are out in the aisles talking to customers, they do not even want to give you the time of day. DON'T DO IT!!!"

Some branches were better than others to work at.","I've worked with a lot of lazy people, tellers, and managers a like. A lot of managers are really lazy, and do the minimal to skate by. There's a lot of favoritism within the company. Upper management doesn't listen to inputs. It's ironic that TCF stands for ""The Customer First"", but in reality they're not customer focused at all. A lot of employees make stuff up instead of giving out factual information, because they're lazy."

There is no customer service here. Talking to a customer was just another opportunity to get them to open up another account.  Management has their favorites. The ones that get accounts. You have to ask about 100 people to get one maybe. I was asked on my day off to find an accounts and also constantly pressured by management to get my family to open accounts. When I said they were not interested my manager was very upset with me. I was also told to look in the white pages and cold call businesses.  There is no job support here. The business practice of this bank is very poor.  I felt that my job was threatened every dayThey suggested I put in my two weeks notice after I had barely been there for two months,"

Guess what, TCF Bank now has internet banking. Thank the greedy ne'er-do-wells on Wall Street and smart legislation for curbing their appetite for overdraft fee revenue. They would never have changed if it weren't that. What a shame that government regulation"

The pay is medicore at best and the company would rather have employees that turn and burn then pay the ones that are good for their efforts. Keeping up with all of the lawyer jargon of the new promotions that you were compensated very minimally was a headache

1046,,Great people to work with,2013-03-08,3.0,Business Banker,If you worked hard opportunities for advancement were there.  The products that were offered to the public were attractive so you always had something new to sell.,This is the everyman's bank and thus you got the lowest common denominator doing their banking there.

1049,,Good college job.,2013-02-25,4.0,Supervisor,Flexible with hours. They are willing to work around your class schedule. Opportunity for advancement is good. Great pay for a part time college job (not for a career).,Poor upper management. Most branch staff isn't given enough training to do their job. Most branches are short staffed because of low pay. They are desperate for anyone to work there so it is near impossible for someone to get fired. Also technology is poor and makes it difficult to do your job.
1050,,"I could summarize my experience at TCF as long, retail hours, high-pressure sales, and massive turnover.",2013-02-25,2.0,Sales Associate,"There is a lot of change.  Just when you start getting to know a manager, they get transferred to another branch or they leave the company.  I mean like every 2 or 3 months.  There is a lot of staff turnover, but it gives you a chance to help train new sales associates.  The constant change also opens up a lot of opportunity, so I look at this as a pro.","Sales goals are paramount.  If the store is empty and there are no customers, there is still no excuse for not getting sales on your shift, and there are consequences for not meeting daily goals, even when you are just coming off a very successful month or quarter."

1053,,Great work culture.,2013-02-12,4.0,Branch Manager,"Good friends, competitive play, decent hours make TCF a good bank to work for.

1056,,Teller,2013-01-24,1.0,Sales Associate/Teller,Pros. The operations are easy and  the new people employees have a great attitude.,"They put to much pressure  on  selling accounts that are not worth it people get sick of the scrips they tell you use. People with more experience are there only cuz they kiss butt and get all their friends to open an account, They treat new employees really bad and dont train you as they should. the  corporative training is just a trick when i got to work everything was awful."
1057,,Assistant manager,2013-01-23,2.0,Assistant Retail Manager,Great employees and good product line,Working at Tcf is like going to hell everyday and when u get off it feels like heaven. They seriously need to stop opening BS accounts. Imagine the goal is impossible to achieve and corporate knows that and Mangers push u to open bs accounts just to hit goals. The system is really old as hell and they say we are profitable by cutting down employees jobs and cost. They need to bring good management and try to re-structure the corp. They are very behind in todays technology. They are all about hitting the goal by opening 2 -3 accts for one person. They need to cut down the goals and provide good cs
1058,,Hard but worth the experience and future jobs love it!,2013-01-20,4.0,Assistant Manager,They have made me into an ideal sales person. The work environment was great and so were the employees. Incentives were awesome!,That sales was so driven and that people can get promoted very fast without knowing much of anything as long as they were good at sales! They change things frequently!
1059,,Not worth it,2013-01-17,1.0,Assistant Branch Manager,The only good thing about this job is that it works really well with your school schedule.,hmmm what are some cons let me think. Just about everything they should stop pressuring sales and at least attempt  to fix their reputation. Also train your staff properly just because a person is good in sales doesn't mean that person is able to handling other peoples money.
1060,,Could Be Better!!,2013-01-15,3.0,Senior Assistant Manager,"Working at a branch is a great place to work in terms of the work environment. In most cases, the people you work with are awesome. It's a great job for mainly college students that want to explore possible career opportunities that they would want to get into. As mentioned, the environment is friendly with awesome people and the job is generally simple.  A lot of the responsibilities is more on a ""learn-as-you-work"" situation. You learn a little bit of the operational side of the teller line, but everything else tends to be taught on the job. This job tends to be a great starting point for people that may want to get into the banking industry.",FTE is a big issue there. Some branches tend to hire too many people with the little amount of hours that they have available to give out. The sales tends to be a hassle because the pressure on sales can overwhelm employees in the scare of losing their job. Another issue is that a lot of the information is never really taught to you. There were many situations that required even managers to hop onto the phone to call on information for operational purposes or information on a customer's account. The system is very vague and can be hard to understand.
1061,,Decent,2013-01-14,3.0,Assistant Branch Manager,"Like any business there are some good things and bad things about it. TCF is a good place to work for college kids or someone looking for a decent part-time gig. 
- Advancement opportunities 
- Flexible hours
- Lots of locations
- Decent training","The culture at TCF really changed in my five years with the company. They have put more of an emphasis on sales and the bottom line than the customer and their satisfaction. They also have given an unjust favoritism to individuals that work in the branches located in the grocery stores. 
-Advancement based on sales and not any other attributes
- Pay well below the industry average
- Favoritism"
1062,,"Not the best, but not the worst.",2013-01-08,3.0,Senior Teller & Sales Associate,"- Management staff is great; we have one of the best branch managers I have ever worked with.  She is amazing and sacrifices so much to see that our branch is operating efficiently.

- Many good products & services offered to customers and employees; free checking AND savings accounts.

- The environment is relatively comfortable when the branch isn't hectic or customers aren't cursing at you.  Some customers are astonishingly courteous and understanding.

- TCF Stock Purchase Plan; investing in an above-average company.","- Constant changing of company policies & procedures; some may benefit customers, others may hurt customers.  Questionable practices.

- Employees are judged upon how fast they can complete transactions and balance.  Balancing is important, but one shouldn't place an employee in drive-thru every shift just because he/she isn't ""Speedy Gonzales"" in the front.

- Irate customers that curse profusely, even over little things.  Some are just flat-out rude and could care less about you, but just their money.

- Lackluster technical equipment & devices; stuff breaks down almost all the time and is EXTREMELY annoying.

- Literally impossible to make sales goals by being in the drive-thru; people are in a rush and do not care about another savings account, it seems.

- Too much gossip among staff about the music industry and talk about what is on TV; staff sometimes not prepared with coin or products (money orders, checks) to assist customers."

They do promote quickly IF you hit you're goal which is nearly impossible.,This job is all sales you spend the majority of your time wandering Jewel begging for accounts and even if you get them they want more. The stress is so unbearable it makes you sick just thinking about it. They trick you in the interview process and in training by saying that it's so fun n blab blah blah then you get there and realize it's horrible!!!

The company is so cheap they no longer use trash can liners and took away the radio in order to ""save money "". You will spend most of your time outside of the branch harassing people to open checking accounts, while tcf has a bad reputation and nobody wants to start a relationship with them. The pay is horrible!!! Started off with 10 bucks and some change and the company was only willing to give a 10cent raise for the next position. The branch manager does absolutely NOTHING!! There could be a line of customers out the door and the manager would just sit in his office. Bottom line if you aren't good with sales and aren't attractive you won't advance with this company.

I get to work with some amazing people.,"Tcf tends to pay on the lower end of the scale in the banking world which leads to higher turn over, you see people come in for 6 months to get experience and then move to a better paying bank causing stress in the branch being short staffed and given crazy sales goals.

fun outings
opportunity to move up if you are good in sales",upper management only cares about sales and not about who gets trampled on in the end.  they turn the other way when their employees do ethical wrong doings and also when they are breaking rules just so they hit their sales goals.  and when someone tries to report that conduct the person who filed the report gets laid off instead just so they can continue with their sales numbers.
1091,,Very poor compensation,2012-05-26,2.0,Senior Assistant Manager,"If your in school or have kid the hours can be flexable, although you will have to work weekends and most holidays.",Sales goals are unrealistic and the pay is ver low.

3. Great location
4. In my position I don't have to report to an immediate ""in house"" supervisor
5. About 2 weeks of paid vacation (includes sick days, total)","1. Staff are expected to clean the branches. The cleaning crew is paid very little so they do very little
and the staff are expected to clean behind them
2. Marketing and technology is outdated. TCF not willing to venture into new avenues of marketing.
3. Untested procedures and sales pitches. The higher up make up stupid things that the sales staff have to say, which have not been tested and do not provide any positive growth or results
4. All branch music has been turned off to save money
5. Cannot buy trash can liners anymore, to try and save money
6. TCF does not uphold it's promise to employee's for referrals; will promise a referral fee to employee's for business the employee brings in, but TCF higher ups always figure out a way to avoid paying this fee to their employee's
7. They expect you to do over 4 different positions along with your own position and still pay you the least amount of any other bank in the area; they are taking advantage of their employees
8. Bonus structure is constantly re-aligned to keep from paying bonus to their employees
9. Whenever something breaks at the branches, it takes at least 3-6 months to get it fixed
10. Most customers do not like TCF and are rude and mean; yelling at staff and cursing at them. One time someone actually pooped in the sink and another on the floor
11. They do not give raises to those deserving. One employee has been here 9 years and has not received one raise; another was promoted in position but no pay increase
12. Constant negative correspondence from higher ups
13. Constantly changing ""the rules"" on dress code, procedures, etc...
14. Make staff take silly testing on silly ""catch phrases"" stressing staff out to study their phrases that have not been tested or proven effective. 
15. The Colorado manager is always changing the rules when policy states something different

They like to hire from within so getting a job out of college would be very easy.  You don't have to stand on your feet and you get to learn a lot about the banking business.,Pay is pretty poor for dealing with so much money.  You are forced to push sales down peoples throats and have to continue to do so even though most people really don't care for TCF. Poor management.

Great place to have on your resume for future career opportunities, or a great place to continue a career.","Pay is not as great compared to other banks. TCF has constant changes to their accounts and not enough options for customers to choose from. Some upper management employees do not care enough about retention, as in taking care of the customers and doing what we need to do to KEEP our current customers. Too much emphasis on opening NEW accounts when the majority of them are not primary accounts. Too much pressure on making goals."

1107,,Lower pay but great opportunities,2012-01-19,4.0,,the employees are great and all seemed relatively dedicated,low compensation which is difficult to understand due to the enormous profits
1108,,first step to get into the banking industry,2012-01-10,3.0,Branch Supervisor,"will be able to learn to achieve goals under pressure, good way to start learning about checking and savings transactions. great way to build up banking exp.","low pay, and its all about sales, lack of communication between the emplyees and management. hours are not suitable and most of them are in-store."
1109,,Good learning retail banking,2012-01-06,3.0,Assistant Branch Manager,Training is top of the list for them.,Low income salaries and too much turnover
1110,,Overworked,2011-12-31,1.0,Branch Manager,"There are not many perks with working with this company. Security is not a top priority, only sales. The best part of this job was getting to know the people.","Low pay scale, small bank trying to imitate big bank sales numbers without the structure or process of how to achieve success. To be told to ""grab outside sales accounts"" at a bus station or pawn shop is demoralizing and a waste of time and efforts. Sales goals are extremely aggressive, and without a targeted plan for achievement."
1111,,Only if you love sales,2011-12-27,1.0,Sales and Service Supervisor,"TCF had a really great training program. The teller trainers really know what they're doing. The training can be kind of intense but my trainer was incredible. There is also a decent incentive program if you can meet their crazy sales requirements. TCF is great if your a terrific sales person. If you work full-time, you do get a vacation time right off the bat and that's nice.","The stress that comes with this job is ridiculous. There's plenty of room to grow but only if you can reach the monthly sales goal. However, that can be fairly difficult since the bank keeps changing policies making more and more customers unhappy. If you can get in the mindset of the company first, customer second, then you'll be fine. However, it's very difficult. They make it very hard to help your customers and I closed more accounts than opened. 

Also the branch managers never work their assigned hours so if you're the supervisor or assistant manager on duty, be prepared to take the heat. Customers will be very upset and you have no to little tools to help your customers. I worked at two branches and it was the same at both. You speak up against the managers and you will be shown the door."
1112,,Could be better,2011-12-20,1.0,Call Center Employee (Not Representative),Have had a few personal matters and management has been very kind with allowing time off to attend to personal problems.,"Never recognized for doing work. 
Feel under appreciated.
Does not feel like team environment. Everyone shows up at the start of their shift and leaves right at the time it ends.
Manager does not try to make you feel like part of a team.
Benefits are terrible. Each year premium goes up and services go down."
1113,,A job to get a job.,2011-11-29,1.0,Banking Sales Representative,I really enjoyed the customers in the Denver area. I was able to get a lot of good sales experince and meet some very good people with in the company.,"NO PAY! I have over a year in the banking industry before I started and I was still paid very very poorly.

TCF is very behind on technology, only upper management is allowed to have email and all branch reports are printed out then mailed to every branch (I saw a half ream of paper every week for the reports). If anything important needs to be sent to the main office in MN everything must be faxed, this creates lots of errors and makes customers wait. Overall the company is very pro quantity and very much against quality."
1114,,It was stressful and not enough pay.,2011-11-23,3.0,,The fellow employees were amazing.,The stress level was quite high due to the constant changes.
1115,,okay,2011-11-17,3.0,,I have a flexible schedule,I'm not paid very much

1118,,A great opportunity,2011-10-17,4.0,BSR,My managers are very flexible with my school schedule and can get most of the time i need off and it is also a great work environment.,"For the most part, I am only dissatisfied with the pay. Compared to other banks, TCF generally pays lower than all the other major banks."
