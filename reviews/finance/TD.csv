0,,The work you put in equals what you’ll get out of the company,2022-04-14,5.0,New Client Development Specialist,"The headline says it all. If you’re proactive, work hard, go above and beyond, and build your brand, you will go VERY far within the company. Very, very merit based within career progression. 

You don’t take your work home with you. After your shift, you won’t have anyone from work contacting you until the next day. 

Raises and bonuses are not scarce. Tons of PTO/Sick time and market holidays leads to an abundance of time off.","It is a call center, so the usual annoyances of metrics, very specific scheduling, potential for back to back calls all day. Time off not allowed during certain times (tax season, end of year, etc)."
1,,Overall Great,2022-04-14,4.0,Unlicensed Service Representative,"Management support
Company culture
Getting licensed
Company outings","Call center role
Grueling being on the phone for 8 hours
Repetitive"
2,,Great place,2022-04-13,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"PTO, Growth, Knowledge, Training, Collaboration","Fast-paced, Broad based thinking, must have ability to multitask efficiently"
3,,"Great Company, People, & Culture",2022-04-13,5.0,Retirement Plan Sales Consultant,"TD Ameritrade Institutional had a laser focus on relationships with RIAs and helping them succeed. The benefits, leadership, and culture were incredible.",The pay bands were a bit lower than some of the other competitors in the same industry.
4,,I LOVE IT HERE,2022-04-12,5.0,Stock Broker,"You can absolutely get what you put in here. If you want to push yourself and you want to do more, ask. You can. That's not to say you'll be overloaded either, you have so much support, everyone is there to support you.","Sometimes there are bad apples, and they do have them. I've had colleagues not be helpful, but reach out to another and get the help i need. I've had not so great managers, but I've had amazing managers too."
5,,Loved working for TD!,2022-04-12,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"TD Ameritrade really encouraged employee growth in the company and offered opportunities to move up if you put in the effort.
Allowed flexibility with work from home. 
Didn’t feel micromanaged. Allowed me to be productive on my own and had trust from my manager to do what I needed to do. 
Felt like I really made a difference in many of our clients lives. You get to build lasting relationships with regular high net worth clients. 
They are much more competitive with salary now than 4-5 years ago.","I wasn’t a huge fan of the change to hourly, but some employees seemed to like it. 
Not a ton of cons, never really had any issues in 4 years working there, was hard to leave."
6,,Great Opportunity,2022-04-12,4.0,Retail Trading Specialist,"Was there 2 years. It really is a great company to work for. The Chicago office did feel like a family, everyone was always willing to help the best they could (pre-pandemic). Remotely it was just as good. They offer bonuses and incentives sometimes when it comes to working overtime. They pay for your licensing and offer you resources to learn so much but you have to use them otherwise you may not learn as much as you can and they set time for you to do so, which is rare for companies to do. Learn to place trades, learn options, learn the thinkorswim platform. It is possible to move up but it will take time. Prestigious name, it feels good to say you work at TD. Great managers. Great work life balance, you have set hours and you're not forced to work more than the 40hrs you need to. *hours may not be the best when starting out, but you'll get chances to better hours.","The only reason why I left is because it is call after call after call. It gets tiring especially after years of customer service. Also sometimes you feel like the middle man because you have to reach out to other teams to get an answer and clients get frustrated. Especially when opening accounts, they should just answer those calls. TD seemed more fun and flexible before the merge with Schwab so that's a con. A lot of turnover as well. Pay is higher at other places (but it's great if you don't have experience in finance, they give you a chance)."

33,,Feedback for Virtual Workgroups of Newly Hired Employees Training Virtually as Well,2022-03-24,3.0,Financial Representative,"Virtual work is a plus if properly given tools to do one's job.

The Modules of Training were engaging, if the system was up and the employee was able to participate in them.","With a virtual class size of over 100 (The first ever to be this size) to begin with and no dedicated tech person assigned to the group.... Advocating for oneself to get the tools needed to do the training could be construed as being needy, or worse.
When the systems are down, a class of 100 moves on with the expectation of no overtime, yet somehow making the modules get completed, without missing any of the other training.
(Feedback for the company would be to correct system issues by day one or two, and have a dedicated tech person for that role.
 Catch employees up on any systems training modules missed with OT the very first or second day.)
Go back to having small class sizes, just like with a University classroom, a class size of 20- works better than a class of 100."

80,,Can't complain too much,2022-02-08,4.0,Financial Services Representative,"The benefits, starting pay, weekends off and no mandatory overtime, although it's there if you want it many times. They pay you to study for and get your series 7 and series 63 licenses","It's a glorified call center job, plain and simple. You will be taking inbound phone calls from clients every day, which can be exhausting especially when it gets busy and the phone is ringing nonstop. Also, some client issues can be stressful and although there are other departments you can reach out to for help, if you do so, your ""POCR"" score will be knocked down (measure of independence as an associate) any time you reach out or transfer a call, even if transferring a call to a specific department is appropriate for the specific situation 

The company is way too focused on arbitrary metrics like average handle time, POCR, survey scores, etc. and quite honestly it is annoying. You also have these things called GADS plans which are meant to improve your numbers, and every 2 weeks you have to come up with a ""new goal"" for yourself to improve your numbers 

I say stop focusing on the numbers so much and instead focus on the client - the company says they are committed to delivering the best in class experience for their clients, but when they are so focused on arbitrary metrics like average handle time (AHT) for example, it makes you feel like you have to rush to get the client off the phone to meet those numbers and stay competitive with your coworkers, which in my opinion diminishes the client experience

And many times you will have those super long phone calls, or complicated issues which will raise your AHT and lower your POCR, etc. so you feel like you have to try and play catch up on the next call by getting the client off the phone as quickly as possible"

I can't believe the reviews are so high. That seems very inaccurate to me. I know SO many people who quit early on due to not passing the tests and some who did pass but still quit because complicated, back-to-back calls from rude people all day without time to write notes and breathe in between is so awful. It is very fast paced and very stressful. The frontline reps are expected to own everything and know everything in a VERY complex industry with ever-changing rules and regulations. It is all about money. You aren't treated like a human. You are a robot who needs to meet ridiculous call metrics. It is soul crushing and depressing. You are glued to your chair and monitors all day long. The stock market is very volatile so it is scary for you and for everyone calling in. Schwab took them over so once the accounts and website move to Schwab so many people will be calling in really confused and mad, I am sure. I tried hard and passed the tests and gave it a fair shot, but it clearly wasn't a good fit for me and was really damaging to my health. I don't know how it is good for anyone, but I guess I just wouldn't understand. I absolutely cannot recommend it to others."
85,,relationship manager,2022-02-06,3.0,Relationship Manager,they pay for you to get licensed if you are not already licensed when you get hired.,"the training doesn't cover the amount of information you need to know to properly take care of advisors and clients.

Completely remote for at least a year in a customer facing and customer centric business. This creates a need for these roles to create excess work for the people in production, too many conference calls and reports when the data is already available.
 Senior management has no sense of how staffing models have ruined the level of service offered to the customer. Which makes it extremely difficult to sell when the product is 'financial service.""

288,,Honest Review,2021-07-26,2.0,Financial Services Representative,"Honestly, the best part of this job was getting paid to study and get licensed with your SIE, Series 7, and Series 63. 80% of the people there are amazing and truly care about you. I passed all exams first try which made me want to stay with the company, but the cons were too great. It is a great place to get licensed and leave, know that it is not a glamorous job.","You are micromanaged to every second of your day and you will have a message from your manager if you leave to use the restroom . You answer client phone calls all day, which you are bound to get a few miserable calls. These calls are back to back all day long, and it is really easy to get burnt out or hate what you do. Your calls are listened by managers and they will write you up if you accidentally give false information, which is easy after hours and hours of spewing information to clients. Pay is bad compared to what you do. While working there I was constantly stressed. It actually got to the point, where I was living for the weekends and couldn't enjoy them because all I could think about was how bad work would be the following week. Like I said, ONLY STAY UNTIL YOU GET LICENSED. The other terrible thing is that they can put you on any shift they need help with. I worked 3;30 PM-12 AM and my best friend there worked Friday, Saturday, and Sunday 7 PM to 7 AM. I read comments like this and disregarded them thinking that it couldn't be that bad... It truly is. Just know that going into it."

Benefits are okay.,"The focus on specifics metrics within the IS department should be used as guidance, not as measurement of performance. Many calls, you will need to speak with a back office to resolve an issue, however every time you reach out to another department you get dinged. Majority of the day is de-escalation. This is more a role of licensed financial secretary, rather than financial professional. The amount of bs that an IS employee has to put up with on the client facing side is soul draining in today's new investing/trading environment."

360,,Financial rep Review,2021-05-31,3.0,Financial Representative,Good benefits and room for advancement in a call center environment.,Call center/ high call volume you get all types of calls from trade related all the way to password reset. Not recommended if you want an actual career in finance.

It is a large company that provides great pay, has excellent benefits and values work/life balance.","I came to TD Ameritrade due to the acquisition of Scottrade. From an employee standpoint, Scottrade was the better company and valued their employees in a way TDA didn't. While TDA gives employees the tools to be successful, that success is contingent on a lot of factors that might not make it possible. On the surface, TDA comes across as a company that focuses on providing a service that is looking out for the client. In reality, Investment Consultants experienced high pressure to meet mostly out-of-reach sales targets that were the same no matter what geographic region you were in. This pressure caused Investment Consultants to hammer managed accounts to almost every client whether it was appropriate or not because TDA was trying hard to transition away from trading as its main revenue source. Since TDA is a firm the vast majority of clients come to for self-directed trading, the managed account sell can be a hard one. The transition from Scottrade was rocky and you consistently felt as if the ""purple"" side was never fully welcomed into the fold. I think Schwab is a premier organization on all fronts and now that TDA is becoming Charles Schwab, the outlook is much brighter."

- The place is a joke
-Management is awful across all boards 
- Going through acquisition so the talent sourcing has been a joke 


If you are looking for an actual respected career in the industry you’d go anywhere else but here. Complete joke of a company. It’s Robinhood with a suit on in short. 
“Clients” more like customers aren’t going to TD for any wealth management or actual financial advice if only management understood that. 
You will not be an advisor in any extent, your a licensed customer service representative disguised as a “consultant”.

ZERO upward mobility. It’s comical actually, you are either an FC, SFC or manager and all 3 are jokes in themselves."

Once I got my license, I left for a job at Wells Fargo where they pay employees 50% more. Of my Wells Fargo hiring group 11 of 12 were former TD Ameritrade employees. Really shows you how well TD takes care of their employees. But don’t worry, They will give you a $25 gift card once a quarter to make up for the mediocre pay.

PTO is great
Coworkers are great","Poor Management
Boring, repetitive work
The management style is to treat you like a child. Reprimanding you and watching your every move like a hawk. You need to ask to stop taking calls in order to use the restroom. There is not very much upward movement due to the company acquisition and movement of headquarters. You also get in trouble if after the call the client reviews TD Ameritrade poorly. You see they review your service and how they feel about TD Ameritrade. You may score all 10's, but they say that doesn't matter because TD still got a lower score than that and it is your responsibility to get the client to feel better about the company.... Ridiculous."

A little easier to network/interact with other departments which is mandatory if you want to move on from here.,"Little growth opportunities from here. 99% of roles you qualify for are considered lateral moves or a step back once you reach this level. Only way to move up is to go into management. Constantly busy due to lack of staffing. They have been saying it is unprecedented times for several years now and always fail to hire enough people.

460,,One of the best companies I’ve worked for,2021-03-24,5.0,Software Engineer,"The culture is one of the best I’ve been a part of.  Constant improvement, always looking to make things better.  Heavy focus on building good technology.  Not afraid to make mistakes in the process and learn from them.  Emphasis on honest and direct communication.

Development environment and toolset is pretty solid.  Technology is current.

Quarterly bonuses with set objectives, occasionally paying out 150%

Pretty high level of empowerment.  No matter where you are, you generally have the ability to make decisions and find solutions without having to go before a hundred committees seeking approval.

Good rewards and recognition program.  Better Begins With Me is a cool system for peer recognition.  Quarterly excellence awards are also nice.

Pretty laid back dress code (depends on your role and business unit).  If you’re not client facing, jeans and a dress shirt is ok.  Even a t-shirt is considered ok in some areas.

Lots of flexibility with WFH and flex time depending on your role.

Good benefits.  Lots of PTO.

Generally talented and authentic leadership.  Heavy focus on servant leadership.  Can’t speak for all positions and locations, but I have a lot of respect for my immediate leadership.","None of pros probably matter now that TDA was acquired by Schwab.

Work life balance can sometimes be difficult.  Lots of emphasis on weekend work for production changes.

Decisions and direction can be frustrating at times, but it’s not usually permanent.

Far from perfect but always striving for better."

Bonuses are being treated very differently and it's not in a good way right now. That may change in the future with some kind of salary restructuring. We don't know.
Some managers are great, some not so much. Your experience as an employee is largely going to depend on your manager, though with the work from home environment it has less impact than before. 
Best part about the job is that once you clock out you do not have to think about work until you have to clock in again. It's normally a good work life balance. Most of the people I've worked with have been great and they do seem to take diversity and inclusion seriously at least with posters and events. The office was relaxed (it's getting hard to remember after working from home for so long) and if work is particularly difficult for some reason they normally give some free food at some point.
Good dental, medical, vision, and 401k benefits.
You can get promoted a few ranks up fairly quickly but then you pretty much seem to either become a manager or stay where you are.","You will be verbally abused by clients especially when there are issues or volatility. There was a very bad stretch for months last year. Mental health takes a hit after a while. You only get 4 therapy sessions before you have to start working through insurance so use those sparingly. Sometimes action is taken against the client but unless it's a racial slur there isn't a guarantee. Gender based bias is mostly, but not always shut down. Some managers expect you to put up with more than others. If you're a female and the client demands you transfer them to a male representative that may happen. If you have an accent, particularly an Asian or Indian accent, you will probably have a much worse experience at least when you are in general investor services. If you work through electronic communication then that won't be an issue.
It can be difficult to get days off, but most managers will help you out. 
There are periods of being nearly bored because there are so few clients reaching out and we are overstaffed or there are times like now when volume is absolutely unmanageable and they removed all backup help. The work experience is very inconsistent and staffing decisions are not very rational."

735,,Years of hard work leading up to nothing,2020-11-11,1.0,Financial Consultant,I loved working for TD and was able to really shine in the company. I felt appreciated and rewarded. Awesome management and great relationships until the Schwab merger...,"I should have been promoted a while ago, but the company has kept me on, essentially getting me on a discount. Now with the merger I have been put in a position that has not only stifled my career growth but is a regression. It’s like they’re using the pandemic to be like “aren’t you happy you have a job at all?” Now I’m on deep discount. They used to underpay compared to the industry average. Now considering the changes, they’re definitely paying the lowest in the industry. A huge percentage of us who are staying on have been demoted."

742,,I would stay away,2020-11-08,1.0,Producing Branch Manager,The company used to be filled with great people until Schwab laid everyone off. Benefits were decent upper management was great. Used to be a very fun place to work,"No transparency with merger since day 1; top producers were laid off for no reason. The worst part is most individuals that were kept were given a demotion, yet the company claims all changes were lateral moves. No one was given the opportunity to choose severance or take the demotion; employee’s were forced into new roles and locations without any say. There will be many people who will be leaving as the mood has gone from disappointing to disgruntled. Workload has also increased drastically with the demotion, no one can make any sense of this. Company went from caring about their employees to having a complete disregard for people especially during a pandemic. For new applicants, you will probably be used for a year as bottom feeders before they let you go."

817,,Rest In Paradise TDA you were amazing,2020-10-03,5.0,Anonymous,"-Excellent culture (I know it’s been brought up in many reviews but it really is some of the best culture you are going to find anywhere). The company and management (from your direct manager to upper level management) is very employee-focused and cognizant of what employees and prospective employees are looking for in this era. Unlike some financial firms, high-level management is very approachable and engaged with all employees. The company makes diversity a high priority as well and it shows in the org structure.
-If you are interested in learning about the financial markets I can’t think of a better job out there. Client-facing roles at AMTD get exposure to many different types of clients and investing strategies. Whether it’s a day trader, buy-and-hold investor, high net worth or brand-new customer you’ll get the opportunity to work with and help that type of clientele. On the front lines you will also learn about and get the privilege to discuss mutual funds/ETFs, options, and fixed income with clients. This will be very valuable experience to both your career as well as provide you with personal investing knowledge that will be useful and translatable for the rest of your life.
-Unlimited OT for hourly employees and quarterly bonuses/performance reviews; If you consistently take advantage of the OT your compensation can be really good. Additionally, there is an excellant rewards and recognition program that I’ve found very motivating to excel in my roles.
-Career growth/development; in my 3+ years with the firm I’ve worked in three different departments and gotten nice compensation increases for every promotion. It’s a growing business with tons of opportunity and as long as you work hard and perform in your role you will be encouraged and supported by your manager (and their manager) when it comes career development.
-Unlike some of our competitors, TDA did an excellent job handling and managing the global pandemic we are currently in. In the span of a few days, the company successfully transferred everyone to working from home and didn’t skip a beat. Despite being in a WFH environment these past 6+ months we are fully operational and doing more business than ever!
-Generous benefits and PTO","-There is a TON of uncertainty with the upcoming Charles Schwab merger. Unfortunately there will be a lot of jobs lost.... and based on Glassdoor reviews (I’ve read hundreds of them), Schwab doesn’t look to be up-to-par with AMTD when it comes to the overall associate experience. Hopefully they will prove me wrong."

Not a good fit for someone who has trouble retaining and staying focused in a classroom setting

860,,"Great Products and Great people, But Company Owners are Cowards",2020-08-21,3.0,Senior Financial Consultant,"I've worked for this company for a long time and have seen our the company and the industry evolve over the years. TD Ameritrade has some amazing products and services, and it is absolutely a pleasure to come to work everyday. The technology offerings for the clients are second to none and we blow our competitors away with our retail trading offering. Decent benefits including good amount of vacation days and opportunity to grow within the company if you are willing to move. Front office and branches recruit some bright people and it has been a privilege to call them my Co-workers. Bc of covid 19, and to ensure employee safety, the company has been offering most client facing roles an option to work from home which is very big of the company.","No company is perfect, especially a large one. In the back office, corporate politics plays a big role which is expected. Working in the front office, your overall experience will be heavily depended on who your direct manager is. Like every company, there are good managers and bad and you can confirm this by hundreds of negative reviews which usually involves a bad manager. 

The worst con right now is uncertainty in the company since we are about to be acquired by Schwab and at the same time faced by historically low interest rates which greatly impacts our industry in a negative way. 

Now, if you are new here or work in a room in the basement of the company with no windows, let me give you a background of what happened which is all public information. We as a company, were doing great after acquiring Scottrade and focusing our business in growing our asset management products and institutional offerings. Despite what you have heard, it was the right direction under Tim Hockey before he got kicked out and we had record profits and earnings.  And then, strategically, Schwab suddenly dropped their equity commissions to $0 which caught the owners of our company and upper management with their pants down. Our stock price overnight dropped to an obscene level along with the rest of the industry and immediately Schwab offered to buy us out at that low price via all stock deal. Kudos to Schwab for the well planned execution, very well played.... 

The next step angers me; instead of telling Schwab to go pound sand, the owners of the company who don't have spines got on their knees like the cowards they are and just surrendered. 

After we fell, our fellow peers at etrade got gobbled up by Morgan Stanley (Who also took advantage of Schwab's commission drop to $0) resulting in less options in the market for retail and institutional clients. This really bothers me not just from an employee standpoint but also from a retail investor perspective myself. I was surprised when the acquisitions cleared DOJ.  When has less competition and choices in a space ever benefited the average consumer?"

863,,WORST COMPANY EVER,2020-08-19,1.0,Financial Services Representative,"Zero pros, nothing about working here is worth it","Its like having a fighter jet plane license and being forced to drive a mini van every single day. Literally a glrofied call center where they could care less about who you are as a human being. The problem with TD is they focus a lot on customers and almost nothing for  associates. Literally the worst place to work for, I honestly contemplate jumping out of my window at least twice a day working here. Ship is sinking and I fell for the kool aid more than once"
864,,A comprehensive review of the SFC Role,2020-08-18,1.0,Senior Financial Consultant,"1. Decent Benefits, 401k match is okay, health benefits are good. 
 
Not much else, I honestly tried to think of a second but cant.","1. The job is a total joke, you are told you are a financial consultant, in reality, the entire job is just calling clients to try and get them to bring money over to TD Ameritrade from other institutions. Occasionally, you can try and scare them into a managed solution but you are so handcuffed with what you can do, you have virtually no autonomy. 

2. The company seems to be run by people who have no idea what the day to day looks like. You in a small market for example, Rhode Island, are expected to compete with and are on the same comp plan as SFC's in branches in huge wealth areas like Stanford, CT, Beverly Hills, Boca Raton, etc. Then they act like the only reason you aren't producing what those reps are is that you're not ""dialing"" enough. In reality, no matter what you do, you won't be able to compete with these branches. 

3. The company is being bought out, the ship is sinking and the idiots steering the ship are still acting like nothing is happening and most of us aren't going to lose our jobs. It reminds you of the scene in the titanic where the band is still playing while it's going down. 

4. You are totally on an island, if your co-workers and manager are cool it can actually be pretty fun, if not it is going to be an absolute nightmare. This was the case at my branch. My manager had no idea what he was doing, did nothing to build team spirit, was so drunk off the company Kool-Aid it was embarrassing, and above all even though he was supposed to produce, did absolutely nothing and then got on our case about not producing. If you want to lead, lead by example. I guess there's not much motivation when you've made it to manager and think you're the epitome of success. 

5. As it's a retail job and is hourly, you are expected to be in the office at exactly 8:30 and stay until 5 pm every single day. If its a 85 degrees on a Friday, 4 pm, and you are done for the day, rather than having the autonomy to head out a bit early you have to literally sit there and wait until 5 pm. Again, there is absolutely no autonomy, you are literally a heavily monitored number, and at this level of job, you should be able to come and go when you'd like within reason. 

6. Comp plan constantly changes and is literally built against you, if they feel the payout is too high they will decrease it next quarter. It is built so a small few get great bonuses, some get decent ones and the vast majority get pennies. 

If you have read this whole review, I hope my point has been driven home already but if not here it is. Run, dont walk, Run away from this company. The fact they are hiring still as they are about to get bought out and then layoff people is a joke. Management is a joke. The job itself is a joke. Do yourself a favor and look anywhere else, realistically in a totally different industry, Finance is not the place to be anymore."

Contradictory policies On the one hand, you are told to take care of the client. Whatever you do though don't have a average phone conversation time of over 9 mins. Also, don't put anyone on hold but we won't hire sufficient staff. My past role required you to know seemingly everything (they even monitored how often you reached out to other departments, as if they were not there for your benefit). Schedules are tightly managed, so don't think about going to lunch even a little bit late. (And always tell your manager before you even breathe...)

A seeming overreaction from management to any slight infractions

Also your experience is highly dependent on whether your manager likes you. If they don't watch out...

The switch to Keurigs was nice.,"Clients are becoming more and more fearful that we can do anything we say we can do. They no longer think they can get good advice, they have been routinely burned by our international bureaucracy, and they are thinking its time to move on.

The push to get clients “serious” money is failing as the serious talent leaves the firm.

Our back office groups are either too overworked to care about clients, or too uncaring to do right by clients. The shift from servicing real client needs to covering for internal mistakes and errors is causing an erosion in the efficiency of our asset gathering efforts and causing the insurmountable outflows. This has a knock on effect on morale at every level."

The big message in New Hire Training - ""We're not looking for home runs, just base hits"".  Not very inspiring, to say the least.
TD Ameritrade had its 'secret sauce' and was a cash cow to its owners.  Management would rather shuffle papers and do busywork rather than risk change.  Needless to say, when commissions went to zero, the company's business model from 1996 imploded.  Rather than attempt to change and compete, the board decided to just sell.

1010,,Good company that's confused about direction,2019-12-20,4.0,Senior Financial Consultant,"- Associates at every level and position genuinely cared about the clients. They seemed to always keep in mind the impact their actions could have on the lives of the people they were serving, and would go above and beyond to do right by them. That kind of genuine client-centrism is heartening in this industry.

- Culture is quite good. My managers, coworkers, and business partners were exceptional people and I enjoyed being around them each day. I still keep in touch with many of them. That said, it's a big company, so this is largely dependent on your location and team.

- Educational support and resources for employees is generous. There are multiple paid training and licensing programs, as well as financial support for external qualifications such as the CFP, CRPC, CDFA, MBA, CFA, etc. Professional growth and development is encouraged.

- Great relationships with RIAs. You can learn a lot from them and make excellent connections in the industry (which can help if, down the line, you want to work for one of these top wealth management firms).

- The company provided great resources for clients, especially on the tech side. Robust website features, MoneyGuide Pro, and the entire Thinkorswim platform and its trade specialists were accessible for free, so you could feel good about showing clients those benefits.","- I’m not sure what will happen with the Schwab acquisition, but the past few years, TD was a company in search of direction. Actions and incentives didn’t align with corporate messaging at all, and were sometimes even counterintuitive. This unfortunately caused associates to view the corporate team as incompetent, uncaring, and/or dishonest.

- Overall organizational instability. High attrition among ground-level employees is to be expected in this field, but even leadership was a rotating door.

- The compensation plan changed wildly and frequently, leaving people unable to plan their work for the foreseeable future, and be forced to deal with unpredictable paychecks. Branch associates were asked to make decisions about their book of clients without knowing what impact those decisions could have in the next quarter or year.

- Mistakes in processing client paperwork or requests happened way too frequently, and communication of those issues between back office and front office was spotty and disjointed. Because branch associates were the ones who actually had to deal with the fallout from angry clients, we ended up having to micro-manage all the time; our days were increasingly spent on hunting down paperwork and troubleshooting errors, which took time away from our actual jobs. And clients had to suffer delays and problems that they shouldn't have had to go through the frustration of fixing."

1032,,If you enjoy solitary repetitive work - TD is for you,2019-11-22,2.0,Financial Services Representative,Pay was decent for someone who has no experience in the finance industry. They pay you to study in a classroom environment for approx. three months total for this position. The material is god awful and after three months you are glad that it's over. The Learning and Development team does nothing to actually help you LEARN the material. They are there to babysit and make sure that you are paying attention.  company at the time.,"First off - If you enjoy interacting with your coworkers this is not the job for you. In the year that I worked there, I just barely got to know my coworkers by name as I went through 4 different managers. Know that you will be on the phones 8 hours a day, 5 days a week at a minimum. You get two 15 minute breaks (enough to use the restroom and get a drink) and one 30 minute lunch unpaid. Oh - and if you go over on break, you are told that you are a thief and are stealing time from the company.

 Other than that you will be answering calls the entire time with zero breaks in between calls. You will be resetting passwords 60 percent of the time and dealing with ungrateful clients who have absolutely no idea what they are talking about and will tell you, the stockbroker, that you are an idiot and are giving out false information. 

I was called out multiple times for placing a trade during the licensing phase even though I worked at a broker dealer and was generating quite the commission for the company at the time. This company has a great reputation where I live, but unless you are competing for a back office role, I would avoid the call center at all costs.

Also if you are working here know that there are tons of different shifts and you are most likely to work after hours. I worked 1:30-10pm and gave the company a chance a dozen times to change before finally I left as you get depressed never seeing your family."

When net assets were introduced, the plan did not take into account the extra hours needed to maintain client relationships. Seems short sighted.

1072,,Carefully Consider,2019-09-18,4.0,Financial Consultant,"TD is a company with tremendous infrastructure and resources. Most product offerings, and especially thinkorswim, are very desirable from a prospective client’s point of view. TD has been in business for a while and has a truckload of large untapped wallet share for a representative to call on. If you’re a recent college grad currently working at a company for 80 hours a week, knocking on doors, making cold calls, all the while your senior advisor who had his book handed to him is collecting your commissions while paying you $30k, this is a great company and a smart choice for you to jump to. This company will treat you better, pay you better, and offer good benefits.","There are some major concerns here. Over my nearly three years with this company I saw my sales quotas increase nearly six fold, a lower cap on my commissions installed, and a penalty for assets out installed, even for clients I did not bring in. Obviously this is reflective of corporate intentions. 
From a corporate perspective, I observed a revolving door of executives and managers with my entire corporate hierarchy above me out the door during my short tenure, including the CEO. Like an early 20th Century monarchy, this company is experiencing political turmoil with its employees left in disarray. 
Another note, TD is so terrified of lawsuits that business and decision making will be incredibly difficult for you. Prepare to lose your industry knowledge and get ready for mindless transactions. Legally, it’s one thing to purchase auto insurance to protect yourself, quite another to not drive because you’re afraid of the 1/50,000 chance you have of an accident. Which brings us to another point when interacting with clients. 
Despite what TD tells you, there is no relationship model here, just attempting to get clients to purchase a horribly-performing selection of managed accounts. You may place clients into these managed accounts, however they will complain constantly, and rightfully so, about the lack of actual management and performance of the accounts taking you away from further sales. 
Bottom line, if you go with this company, come here from a company that’s just using your youth to exploit your time and collect your commissions. You will make more here and even more when you jump to a competitor. If you’ve been in the business for a while and have good experience TD does not currently make sense to go to."

Clients are constantly taking action against TDA. They are constantly changing the comp plan and cannot decide to pull the trigger on being a relationship model or a transaction based one. They punish the SFC and FC's for the firms failure to hold onto assets. They bought  Scottrade, then hired the sales management that drove that firm into the ground, they are driving TDA into the ground. 

Managers are weak at best, they have no clue how to manage sales teams, they never fight to get obstacles out of the way, they are too busy trying to save their own jobs. Most managers are producing managers who control the leads, conflict of interest anyone?  Stay far far away unless you want to diminish your brand. No flexibility for hours, managers tap their toes if someone comes in at 8:31, half hour lunch break. No real culture to speak of."

TOS trading platform is great and should just break off from TDA again because its practically a separate company still. TDA though, no future unless it seriously pivots its business model or raises Bank Deposit Program rates or Margin rates(Again). Short and sweet, clients are getting more and more upset with TD.

The clients are cheap nasty and we’re supposed to roll out the green carpet every time these customers call.  There is a reason why these customers are at TD Ameritrade and not full service shops. Every time you take a day off it will hurt your call numbers and production. The managers for the most part believe in using bullying tactics to manage the staff.

TDA has a solid culture for a public Financial firm.  STL is a bit of an unusual environment, large amount of young, new, first real job kids ---- but also large amount of  seasoned ExScottrade  VP's and upper brass, including Rodger, all packed in the same elevator.  It makes for a nice mix.  

STL is mostly a call center.  With that being said, it is about as good as call centers get.  Trust me.","The pay is a little subpar.  Most folks make 50k in the call center.  Again 50k for a call center is decent but with a series 7 and MBA it's pretty low.  Even top performers that move into more advanced roles at the trade desk or PCS top out around 60-65k.    Very few positions in STL north of 70k limtited to a few dozen managers  and handful of advanced IT gigs.  

Every public corporation has to do a little of the dog and pony show stuff.  TDA isn't immune to the flavor of the quarter metric push, however it is fairly insignificant when compared to the other guys.         Only other ""detractor"" 😉 worth mentioning is  in regards to TDA's merger appetite.  On one hand, the acquisition of Scottrade, thinkorswim, Waterhouse etc.. is exciting and definitely creates room for advancing one's career.  But it has also made the company slower to adapt with technology.  This definitely makes the work cumbersome and slow for call center employees.  Each merger brings an additional layer to what should be simple, routine business processes. A dizzying amount of computer systems, that have just been quickly tacked on to an outdated tech infrastructure."

In short do not work for TDA if you want a job where hard work pays off. If you work hard you get to take the long road up a very steep hill. If on the other hand you take a lot of time off, have regular emergencies that take you off the phones, and prefer to cut corners you’ll be managed off your team into a better job in no time. TD Ameritrade is notorious for passing problem associates to a new roles which leaves the hard working associates stuck in entry level positions.

Managers know little to nothing about their subordinates day to day struggles. They spend most of their time chatting with other managers and are only dedicated to furthering their own careers. 

Compensation plans change regularly as do the expectations that are never defined. Despite all of this a lot of micromanaging goes on. Lunches and breaks are policed because it’s an easy way to assert authority. It’s a miserable day to day life."

CEO has a great vision, and the focus on amping up innovation and technology is a welcomed change. Really like the direction the company is taking.","Overtime asks can get out of control due to being continually understaffed in some areas. If you're not in the call center, it can take quite some time to get resources to help your area out from a staffing perspective. Upper management can often put too much on managers and employees, need to keep a good work life balance.

Clients you build great relationships with will be automatically reassigned to other FC’s making it impossible to accomplish anything. Enjoy doing nothing but customer service work and force feeding any and all clients a goal plan or you’ll be low man on the Totem pole and constantly overlooked. You’re unable to give any advice or help to clients and you will quickly lose all industry knowledge and your quality of conversations with clients will decline quickly.

- Most fellow associates are friendly and willing to help.

- TDA has probably the most sophisticated trading platform and for people who are looking into options ThinkorSwim is the best I've used.","- Some managers are horrific, they will micromanage you to the very millisecond and will INSULT you (and fellow associates) in public for no beneficial reason at all.
- In addition to the con above, HR does not help in anyway possible. They push you to give your requests or reports to your manager and if the issue is involving your manager, that does not do anything but make your manager not help you move forward in your career path.
- The buddy system is getting to a point where it might be becoming unethical. Even if you are in the top performers for the company, you need to suck up to your manager and other departments you're networking with to get a potential of moving upward.
- Company goals with client experience is not in line with expectations set on individual stats.

Company card, liberal vacation policy and for the most part you can leave the office as need be.   The job is easy, make dials and close business.  It's that simple.  You will make $150k after year two if you work in a tier one branch.","I saw so many changes to the IC/SFC payout it was almost mind-numbing.  No matter if you are ranked first in the company or dead last, there is only one thing that matters.  That's contacts and dials.  At least in the central division that is the case.   Get on managements good side and you will be rewarded with the best BLR's and clients.   In my branch, I saw less talented people excel as they were given everything.  Do not kid yourself, you are the equivalent of a used car salesman in financial sales.  It's a widget game and you are selling to anyone that is coming in if you want to get paid.   In 2010 this job was special.  We got paid like we mattered.  Truly life changing money.  Now things are different.  Payouts are lower and targets continue to climb.  The culture has shifted from "" a place that cares about you"" to "" it's all about the shareholders.""  I remember in 2010 we were stealing Fidelity employees left and right.  All of them said "" it's like working at Fidelity 10 years ago, there is so much opportunity here.""  TD hasn't caught up to its much bigger brother but it has certainly lost its appeal.  Management will turn on you and suddenly you go from being an all-star to the bench.  Nepotism runs wild and if you work in Texas you better be a MMA fan or you will not fit in with management.   Old employees who literally gave away hundreds of thousands of dollars in fees are hired back after being asked to resign.  True Story.   Senior leadership will remind you that people are fighting for your chair.  The IC/SFC position was special and now it's the equivalent of being a personal banker.   No respect and declining payouts.   If you want to succeed.  First, act like a bro.  Second, make your contacts and dials.  Third,  keep your head down and close business.  Fourth, love you some MMA.  You do these four things and you are on your way to succeeding at TD."

Every dollar that leaves your book is counted against you unless the company NFBs the client. The company took forever to figure out the DOL ruling with multiple changes.

1334,,Worst transition in history,2018-06-25,1.0,New Accounts Supervisor,Not many.  The stock bonus was very appreciated in our way to the unemployment line.,"As a former associate of A G Edwards, I went through two mergers before leaving for Scottrade 8 years ago.  I have 28 years in the Brokerage Industry, so I feel qualified to comment.  Though devastated when AGE was sold to Wachovia, the transition was smooth. A year kater, we were acquired by Wells Fargo, and even though we had barely finished one conversion, the move to Wells was smooth, organized, and professional.  The same cannot be said for the transition from Scottrade to TD.  It was both poorly planned and executed.  Napping of data was such a mess that over 20 contractors had to be hired, but that's only the tip of the iceberg.  TD Management planned so poorly that when Scottrade on line systems were shut down, they weren't prepared for the increased volume and had to borrow contractors from another project because account openings were so far behind.  We were supposed to transition to their HR and Payroll system a/o 1/1 2018, but it was obvious that they were not prepared for the volume of Scottrade Associated residents entire system, such as PTO balances, were not ready for Supes for more than a week past that date.  While it is understood that there would be job losses in St Louis, and the severance package, thanks to Roger, was very generous, consideration to people losing their jobs and work families could have been respectful from upper TD Management, and it wasn't.  HR and Internal Communications was so inept that they sent mass communications to all associates, even those losing their jobs, for things that did not pertain to them, such as a Cardinal Day at the Ballpark --a total slap in the face--and a ""dun"" notice to open an account to accept or stock bonus --not necessary since we were receiving the cash equivalent.  A professional form would target their communications to applicable people.  After severed, although we had an agreement in writing as to the timing of our earned PTO payout, they attempted to pay us two weeks late--another slap in the face to make people who have lost their jobs to go 4 weeks without pay.  It would have been paid the same day as our severance.  Then, if that wasn't bad enough, they attempted to insult our intelligence and try to convince us that we ""misunderstood"" .  It took a Legacy Scottrade HR Associate to rectify the error and get us our money.  It wasn't bad enough that we lost all of our banked Sick Pay.  I literally thank God every day that my job was not Mapped and I was able to leave with my Severance."

Answering the phone 50 times a day gets very repetitive. It can be dragging at times. If you don't hit your numbers you wont get promoted so it sometimes is stressful when you're under performing for a few days. Sometimes I feel that the firm wants you to bust out your call as fast as possible and move on to the next client/advisor to meet the service level agreement with the advisors when if you were to spend a few more minutes with them, they wouldn't need to call back the next day for whatever reason."

The conflicts are huge, sell the in house solution it pays 6 TIMES more than anything else! Pressure the clients at all times to do business.  

Absolutely transactional based-you are not trusted in your role the company records the morning meetings, presumably because they don't trust the manager to manage. They record your phone calls and will review them to be able to NOT PAY YOU!  You are a licensed professional but you will not be able to sell or buy stocks for clients-quote CD or bond rates, you cannot even tell the client the term of a CD much less the issuer.  You cannot take any sort of a recommendation, if a client asks you if you think they should buy or sell you cannot answer.

Is it a relationship driven firm or a transaction driven firm?  Right now, with the changes and limbo that is being created, it's not an ideal place to begin working.
- TOO outbound phone heavy.  After several years in the role, it gets  tiresome to make 30+ dials a day and get 12-15 people a day to pick up the phone.  Other firms know we are phone heavy and are actively seeking out long term TDA reps.  
-  Invest more time in managers.  With all of the work needed by regional directors to get the non-TDA legacy branches up and running, bad managers will be left to falter but still have a job.   
- The maternity policy has a lot to be desired.  While the ability to take 3-5 months is nice, the policy has a long way to go, especially for sales roles.  Coming back in the middle of the qtr and being required to hit the usual FULL minimum quarterly targets is difficult after an extended leave.

Former Scottrade associates are told by RMs / DVPs to change their mindset and to retrain clients on what they can come into the offices for. 

KPIs are no joke at this company it is ALL middle management cares about! The sad part is the CEO and head of retail actually seem to want the company to change for the better and most associates from the Scottrade side seem to like the vision that is being laid out. The problem is change takes time and the company has way to many layers of middle management that is stuck in the pre Scottrade merger mindset I.E. 30 dials a day. 30 dials a day would be so easy to do if we did not have 20 walk-ins a day and did not have to check and recheck paperwork to make sure things are processed correctly. 

The systems employees use in the office are outdated and completely inefficient. There is no one to help us with so many of the systems we have to use everyday. 
Cut 50% of the staff at my location and then raised production targets. We are told to treat customer with the “right touch”  but those KPIs middle management lives by do not give credit for walk in clients that we have to help.  “retrain clients” that’s what  middle managements tell us to do! 

I refuse to let our Scottrade clients be treated like second class customers so I will not hit  my KPI targets and my compensation will be impacted. They are operating like they only have 100 offices we now have 360+ and they don’t seem to realize that having a local office is our competitive advantage BUT only if offices are staffed properly and we are able to assist walk in clients. 

There is not a single FC I have talked to that is happy working for the new company. It truly feels like we got a demotion. We have to refer clients to branch managers or SR. FCs. They have placed outrageously low caps on our gross (500k )and guidance (100k) If things don’t change soon I fear that the branch network will collapse because there are over 100 offices with only two people in them and no one in those offices is happy !"

Sales targets go up while payouts decrease under whatever regulation or conversion guideline is the flavor of the quarter given by upper management.  
But far worse than that is the inherent conflicts of interest. TDA places a heavier weighting and payout on in house managed solutions and top performers will steal from other coworkers to make quota and maximize bonus regardless of best interest of said client. For the past 2 years they have waffled back and forth on a ""relationship model"" and are still stuck at ground zero. More transactional than ever. 
Even if you are closing business with what they give you, if you do not meet their 12 mil and 4 mil Managed Solutions and KPI target every quarter, you will be on the chopping block.

1382,,TDA Lost Its Soul to KPIs,2018-04-08,3.0,Anonymous Employee,"If you work in the branches as a Sr. Financial Consultant you get to work with a lot of very interesting wealthy individuals and their families. This can be very rewording. If you are willing to work 60+ hr weeks, pound the phones and have 10+ meetings a week you stand a good chance of bringing home some solid bonuses. My team was at one time quite toxic, but the old manager did a phenomenal job fixing the issues and after that we had a very close team that worked well with and for each other","The current regional manager is the absolute worst. She is a egotistical, sexist bully with little regard for others. Also, Sr. Management doesn't really seem to care about what the employees in the field have to say anymore. Used to be the exact opposite."
1383,,TDA-Scottrade integration,2018-04-07,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"TDA offers some service features which Scottrade did not, like online check request, wire request, check pick-ups at branches, direct ACH-out from brokerage to bank, internal transfers and account linking online.  They provide 24/7 customer service hotline.  They provided extensive training to legacy Scottrade staff to learn about their products and systems.  They get top performing, experienced and down to earth staff who have worked and did best in the job, to train new people who are going to do the same job.  Resource desk staff is very helpful, understanding and patient.","Still new to TDA, but first impressions - this company's deep-rooted motto and culture seem to be - to make ANYTHING and everything simple complicated, very complicated, incomprehensible and user unfriendly, then call it ""HIGH TECH"" and be very proud of it!!  

This company has serious operations problems and customer service issues, which make processing some basic customer service requests difficult or impossible.  Management can simply take a look at customers’ reviews to understand what is going on and why customers are leaving in droves.  However, management does not seem to know what is going on or would care to do anything about them; instead, they would keep making things even more complicated and convoluted.  The company’s convoluted operations and poor customer service have been driving clients out, and they would require their front end staff to bring in more assets, to cover the outflow and to grow client assets.  And as more and more clients flee, assets gathering targets for front end staff are getting higher and higher. The company is in vicious self-destructive cycle, yet management does not seem to know the root of the problem!

What they preach and what they do in practice are totally different or are the opposite!  They kept telling you and Scottrade clients before integration, NO CHANGE, everything is the same, when in fact they have changed and are changing everything!  

While clients would find their website and applications difficult to use, new front end staff would find the internal applications worse nightmares to work with!  The internal applications and procedures are unnecessarily complex, difficult, inefficient and ineffective.  One has to click on multiple applications and go down several layers to retrieve some basic information, and what you find is a CODE, and you have to look up in the encyclopedia to decode, to find the simple answer to your simple question!  Something which could be done with a simple phone call, an email and be resolved in a few minutes or a couple of days at Scottrade, at TDA each would require navigating through their amazing MAZE of internal applications, sub-applications and sub-sub-applications, submitting a case, being subject to multiple layers of approvals, involving a dozen people and several departments, generating multiple errors along the way, and still not done after several weeks.  Everything is a case, you are bombarded with emails all day about cases updates, emails back and forth following up on updates and understanding errors created by various departments, and then involving more departments and persons to correct the errors and following on the cases .... yet still nothing gets done or resolved, and what was basic and simple has become even more convoluted and incomprehensible!

TDA does not have basic applications which are essential, but with applications which are non-essential and unimportant, they would make them big, complicated and create intriguing mazes and a world out of them!  They have too many internal applications which are unnecessarily complex, cluttered but they do not have basic, simple applications which Scottrade used to have, like Client Web View, which enabled us to view what clients can see in their accounts, Session and Trading Lookup which tracks every single key stroke on client account and tracks order entries, so when clients call in and ask questions about what they are doing wrong or dispute trades in their account, or how to navigate on their website, we can help them and resolve issues quickly and easily. 

What does it feel like to be retained, luckily, instead of being severed and got paid severance or fired without severance before the TDA-Scottrade integration?  .... It feels like having boarded a pirate’s ship, being stripped naked, tied up and robbed, and getting ready to be put on the guillotine, to be executed next for failing to hit their astronomical performance targets!

Basically retained ex-Scottrade associates have mostly been demoted, no matter how experienced or well qualified they are, they are mostly converted to being Financial Consultants, with a cap of $500K assets in each asset gathering and $100K in each managed assets opportunity, yet with higher quarterly targets to achieve than Scottrade.  There were no caps with Scottrade previously and ICs were credited for the full amounts they brought in as long as they fulfilled influence and documentation requirements.  With TDA, they can continue to close and bring in the couple of million dollar deals they have been working on at Scottrade before TDA conversion, which might have been held off because of the conversion, now they can still bring the assets in, but they will be credited only for $500K!  So who would bring in the client assets?  Wouldn't they be better off bringing the assets and the clients elsewhere?

They claim to build relationships - with clients and with associates; but what they do in practice is the complete opposite - to destroy relationships, consistently and constantly, with clients and associates.  They changed Scottrade converted associates from non-exempt to exempt, to avoid paying overtime, while directing and micromanaging them.  They randomly allocated clients from your branch you have worked with for years to legacy TDA branches 10-20 miles out, even when your branch is retained, destroying your branch's and your client base.  They probably did it on purpose to benefit legacy TDA branches at the expense of legacy Scottrade branches.  So you are stripped off your clients, basically starting from zero, but are required to bring in even more assets than what was required at Scottrade.

Many legacy Scottrade clients are lost as they have lost their local branch which were scrapped in the integration and their Scottrade staff they have worked with for years.   So the company assigned you a list of clients from other branches to call for onboarding, to welcome and to retain them, and some clients in other states you have never worked with or are not even licensed for, whereas the local clients you used to work with for years have disappeared from your branch.  They claimed such client mapping did not consider client relationships, which was incorrect and is being corrected.  So if client relationships were not considered when they initially assign and reallocate client accounts, what was considered then?  They did not consider zip codes either, and would allocate clients in local and neighboring zip codes you used to work with for years in retained Scottrade branches out to legacy TDA branches 10-20 miles away and even to other states.  So what did they consider when they map legacy Scottrade clients from closed and retained Scottrade branches? – to rob and steal legacy Scottrade clients and opportunities and to destroy legacy Scottrade client relationships, so as to benefit and strengthen legacy TDA branches??  

The company also seems to purposefully reallocate clients to various branches and different staff periodically, maybe as a policy to break established client relationships with front-end staff, to prevent clients from leaving with established front-end staff and to retain clients with the company.  And if the company cannot win clients, they would buy companies to acquire their client base or to ""kidnap"" their clients over, and hopefully they can at least retain a portion of acquired or ""kidnapped"" clients.

When clients leave, lost assets count against your branch assets.  So the company's policies and practices consistently and constantly destroy client relationships, and you working on the front end would need to repair the constant damage caused by the company, to rebuild client relationship, to retain them, and to acquire new assets from new clients to cover the outgoing assets as existing clients flee in droves!!  There are independent adviser accounts from Scottrade, whom Scottrade would not and could not contact, which had their adviser branch code removed and were allocated to your branch before the TDA conversion.  But it seems that now when these independent advisers leave TDA and bring their client assets with them, and many of them do, the outgoing assets would also count towards lost assets in your branch.  How fair is that?

Company success is built upon good client and associate relationships and client assets, which are built upon trust and quality operations and customer service.  However, they have screwed-up operations, have destroyed trust and client relationship with branches, they have taken away branches’ ability to service clients, yet are requiring branches to bring in even more assets, barely enough to cover outflow caused by company’s serious operations problems.  They are taking away from you and your branch - clients you have been working with for years, opportunities you have identified and have been working on and reassigning them to others, putting caps on your accomplishments, yet at the same time raising your performance targets or you will soon be put on the execution board next year!  They work really hard to figure out every way they can to get you to do more work, to bring in more assets, while removing your client base, discrediting your accomplishments and paying you less, yet at the same time they say they would welcome you aboard and present you with an exciting compensation plan for the next quarter for your hard work and accomplishments! 

With such ripoff policies, system nightmares, bureaucratic inefficiency and ineffectiveness, who would, and could, continue to work for such a company?  And who would remain clients with such company?  A company operating like this will have nowhere to go but DOWN, and major competitors are going to benefit enormously from this ""Successful"", legally, TDA-Scottrade integration!"

Generally the feeling on the branch side of things is that purple is better than green.

If you believe this, you are probably not that smart ...

Most of managers don't do much most of time. And there are too many useless managers. They walk around, surf internet, buying stuff online, and joking around pretty much all day everyday while associates are handling back to back calls. Seriously? is that why many people are fighting for the manager positions...

Managers pushes associates to take mandatory OT (Is it even legal?) and to take as many calls as possible while they come in late and get off early or on time.

PTO is very accessible, if there is time available you can take it - no questions asked in my experience. Taking a personal day off during the week is not discouraged if that's how you decide to use your PTO.

Management is very frank and realistic about expectations and how to improve. They are also very available, being in the same style of open cubicle as the rest of us, if not a bit more spacious.

1477,,Investment Consultant,2017-11-18,2.0,Investment Consultant,Branch was enjoyable and met some good people for the last 10+ years.  A long time ago we were charged with doing the right thing for our clients.,"IC pay over the last 5-7 has trended downward.  Yes TDA management will say that target comp has gone up, but the reality is that sales targets have gone up while payouts have decreased, and that is indisputable.  But far worse than that are the inherent conflicts of interest.  Once upon a time all advice solutions were considered ""one target/one bucket"" and thus one payout regardless of solution.  Then TDA added the INHERENT CONFLICT OF INTEREST by placing a heavier weighting and payout on proprietary/in house solutions.  And that was the end of a great era.  From that point on we no longer had conversations amongst colleagues about ""what's the singular best solution for the client"", but rather ""how can I split client asset amongst different solutions to maximize my stack ranking and payout"". 

TDA has promoted ""people matter"" and ""client centric"" or whatever the catchphrase du jour is today, but in reality it's all about the shareholder at this point."
1478,,Great Company,2017-11-16,3.0,Anonymous Employee,"- Lots of room to advance
- Great Pay
-Many opportunities","- Managment is mediocre 
- Human resources needs lots of improvement
- Can feel like the company lacks structure and organization at times"
1479,,A fair description of the role from someone who has worked in various companies...,2017-11-16,2.0,Senior Financial Consultant,"Work life balance-Our doors are open until 5PM.  I am willing to stay late and meet with clients, but it's not a requirement.  I am afforded a fair amount of PTO.  

Salary-In comparison to some other firms, the salary offered to me on was very fair.  

Lead flow-You get a book of clients and prospects as well as a fairly consistent lead flow.

My manager-I am very lucky to have a really good manager.  He's very passionate about the job, he cares about his employees and brings a family atmosphere to the office.","I am lucky enough to have been in the industry for a fair amount of time, which has allowed me to work in various companies and in various capacities.  So far, TDA is at the bottom of the list(it's not really that close actually). 

I have been with TDA for about 8 months and I have already had some early success as I have exceeded my production goals.  So my opinions aren't coming from a bottom producer who has an axe to grind.   I am fairly good at my job.  That being said, I can't imagine there is a company out there that treats their employees worse.   There are many examples of this:

1. Compensation-The way they handle compensation is egregious.  My salary is fair, but the firm will do everything in their power to  disqualify you for any and all of the incentive compensation that you are owed.  Words(at least words on this website) cannot really describe how bad this is.  Besides the blatant attempt to not pay us for work that we do, there are other compensation concerns as well:

-I have already had 4 compensation plans in 8 months.  All of these plans are completely different and have a different set of rules.  I give them a pass on 1 of them because of the DOL rulings.  So lets call it 3 different compensation plans in 8 months.  

-When I was hired, I was promised a chance to get the new hire year end bonus award.  Apparently they got rid of that in the first compensation change after I was employed.

-In our current plan, part of our compensation is retention.  We are required to retain the majority of our books.  If you don't, you lose money or you lose the opportunity to earn money.  The average SFC has to have 300 clients and 175M  AUM.  The majority of the client base is not there for you and wants nothing to do with you.  A portion don't even have working phone numbers.  You get hurt if those people take money out.  Whether they are paying for their kids school, taking out their RMD or decide to transfer a portion of their accounts to their nephew who just started in the business, you get hurt if they take out money.  This would be fine if you got the same credit for the organic money that comes in, but you don't.  

2.  Day to Day-The role itself is a really good role.  I basically got a book of business(the way the firm handles this ""book"" is poor) and my job is to manage that book of business.  It would be great if it ended there, but the firm doesn't allow you to do that.  The sole focus is on activities and some are meaningless, unproductive activities.  If you have a few long client meetings and bring in $4M into managed money, the focus is going to be on why you didn't dial the phone 30 times and why you didn't contact 11 people and why you didn't run any goal plans and so on.  Productivity is secondary to activity with this firm.  

3.  Employee benefits.  Of the companies that I have worked, this one has the worst benefits.  They just recently stopped paying for our gym memberships.  Really?  How much money are saving on that cut?  

4.  Direction of the firm.  I have major concerns about the future of this firm, but one thing is apparent, its going in the wrong direction."
1480,,Been here a while...,2017-11-15,5.0,Anonymous Employee,Pay for performance culture. New executives with a focus on being at the front of technology and the trends in the market.

1481,,Great Place to Work,2017-11-15,4.0,Project Manager,I have really enjoyed my time at Scottrade. Everyone was professional and my direct manager was a great coach.

1487,,Disappointment,2017-11-09,1.0,Investment Consultant,"-Wellness credit for health Insurance
-Nice company accessories for the clients","There are 3 major negatives about Scottrade/TD Ameritrade.
1. As an IC, FC or SFC, you will be in a transactional mindset when working with clients. Every quarter, your goal will be 12 Million + in Asset Gathering and over 4 Million+ on Managed Solutions. There will be no residual payout for previous work. Say if you work for Scottrade/TD Ameritrade for 15 years and you have closed over $500 million in Managed accounts, you will not get any residual payout for your hard work. And even with past managed account closes, if you do not meet their 12 mil and 4 mil Managed Solutions target, you will be on the chopping block. TD/Scottrade will not pay for your hardwork for the last 15 years! If you are someone who likes to do quick hustle rather than building long term relationship with clients, then join TD/Scottrade.
2. TD Ameritrade merger with Scottrade. Upper TD management treats existing Scottrade branch associates like 2nd Class citizens. Many high performance Investment consultants and managers either get laid off or relocated to 30-50 miles away from their closed down Scottrade Branches. Associates in subpar performance branches get retained while top ranked associates either get laid off or relocated. 0 Transparency in this process.
3. Layers of Lies. October 2016, TD Announced to the public that they will keep 450/600 of the combined branch footprint. 2 weeks before the FED approves the merger, Sept 2017, TD Announced they changed their mind and would only keep 365/600 branches. During this time, the TD management continues to propaganda to the branch associates about their job stabilities while they continue to mass hire at the Call Centers. Again, 0 transparencies about job security. Everyone in the branch network is a number on a spreadsheet for TD. Unless you are great at being a sycophant, I do not recommend working for a company that continues to lies and cheat their employees.

Bonus: As a Scottrade associate being acquired by TD, we are surprised on how Scottrade/TD Ameritrade is not yet sued by the clients that they send to Managed Solutions. Perhaps the market has been doing so great that client forgot that they are the boss. The Managed Account process at Scottrade starts with the Investment Consultant uncover the client needs, understanding their situation, reviewing their overall finances. Once the Investment consultant convinces the clients that they lack the time, knowledge and the resources to manage their overall finances, the Investment Consultant would refer clients to speak with a Guidance Rep at the back office for 10-15 minutes to decide for the client which Managed Solutions are best fit for the client. If anyone has financial planning experience with clients, you would know that there is no way to determine what solution is best for the client under 10-15 minutes as a Guidance Consultant from the back office who do not even know the client and has no interests in knowing their situation because they are 1500 miles away sitting in a cubicle on a headset. The end result is client gets send to a random Advisor access partner based on that 10-15 minute conversation from a Guidance rep that has no clue what the client wants!!! However, the investment consultant in the branch who has worked with the client for the past 10 meetings building that need does not get to choose which solution is best for the client. If any client reads this, think about your experience, how can someone from the backoffice decide on what solution is best for you..."

It used to be a fun place to work, but, upon change after change after change in upper management, the job has deteriorated into a bad place to work.","You earn PTO and then are criticized when you use it.  Expensive benefits.  Management by intimidation. Micro-management. Leads to the branch are manipulated. Favoritism is a heavy function at this employer. This company can't quite decide what it wants to be; it keeps talking about how the Branch role is ""Relationship Management"" but they only care about stuffing all clients into their very narrow offerings that consistently  under-performs the benchmark. Having a designation of CFP (and other designations) doesn't allow you more autonomy.

Seems like at every manager meeting we would count the people by tenure and admire the loyalty. 5, 10, 15, 20 years of service. We were different, felt more like a family than a firm.
We've been through a lot, we endured a lot. We stuck it out, hoping our hard work and transition to asset gathering would pay off. 
I can't imagine the health scare that prompted your decision to sell, but in the end, the payout belongs solely to you.
You don't owe us a thing. You paid us a salary, we did the job. However, please understand the reason you are able to sell for $4 billion is not because of you. It is because of us, pushing through and making up for one bad decision after another. 
We pushed through when, in the middle of a financial meltdown you decided to open 150 more branches and kill bonuses by skyrocketing the fixed cost. We pushed through when you decided that technology is not worth investing in. We soldiered on when you continued to allow ineptness on the executive leadership team just because a person was with you from the beginning. Not a bad person per se, but no experience running a company of this size and too proud to admit it. We stayed when you finally hired a person to lead us and then fired them just as they were starting to turn us around. At the end, we dismantled the company as it was and rebuilt as a sales force for you. You yourself admitted it was not a job you could ever do.
I remember you standing on a stage once, telling us about putting your trust into a person and not realizing until it's too late that they've had a knife in your back, twisting it slowly. That it is what it feels like right now.
We will recover, probably never trusting another leader this much again. Most of us still do not know if people being severed or those with jobs are the winners. I really hope $4 billion will do for you what $3 billion could not.","For better or worse, everything has changed."

1557,,Team Manager,2017-08-01,1.0,Team Manager,"The company does invest a great deal in to Employee morale. There are inclusion programs to promote diversity. 

Td Ameritrade has budgets dedicated to Team events. 

The company sponsors the Special Olympics, Pride Day etc. and they are constantly planning company-wide events. 

They do offer quarterly bonuses however the weighting of the bonuses can be inconsistent. 

The facilities are nice and they have an in-house cafe, but it is pretty expensive.","There are the usual gaps between associate to manager to director etc.

Management is actually not diverse in nature. Mostly Caucasian males that have association with other managers. I am not Caucasian, but as a manager I was not part of the Good Ol' Boys scotch club. Yes, that's a real thing. 

There isn't any accountability for managers' availability to their associates despite a ""required"" 10 hour work day. However I was instructed to keep constant records of my associate's attendance.

Company is still in process of implementing the Lean Process in to their operations and service departments and it is not functioning properly. Managers have lost their jobs due to their lack of support for Lean.  

For some positions, management in particular, you will be terminated if you do not pass your 7, 63 and 24 licenses. Exceptions can be made to side-step or demote an associate or manager, however this is not ""normally"" the case.

Managers are now required to produce technological advances, procedural upgrades or some sort of improvement to the overall operations or service center, if not, they too are subject to termination. This is expected in addition to your daily workload. 

You will see some illegalities taking place at this workplace as well. TD Ameritrade Inst. currently employs a Drug Dealer who actually deals drugs to members of the management team as well as associates. This person actually does so on the company premises as well as at company events. This person has avoided termination from three different teams. 

There have been inappropriate relationships between managers that have been reported and ignored. One specifically resulted in the female associate receiving a promotion and the male manager going unpunished. 

You will also see inappropriate interactions between travelling Executives, Directors and Managers when they are visiting from Dallas Ft Worth, Omaha or New Jersey and female associates.

Great, pro-active support for professional development in the form of training,etc.

The firm's approach to things like security (you can’t bake it in after the fact no matter how many different groups you have probing software post-install), and DevOps (hint: “if you have a DevOps team, you’re doing it wrong!”) needs updating.

The company’s laudable approach to not destroying the culture of the companies it acquires does lead to the company feeling more like a hyrdra (ToS, Ameritrade, TD…) rather than the single, living firm it would like to be.

When compared to other firms in the industry, TDA has a lot of room to improve- especially for the specialized departments. We have some of the most knowledgeable and intelligent talent on the trade desk and margin risk teams, yet they are compensated considerably lower than comparable positions within other firms.

Secondly, TDA is on a hiring spree to ensure they have enough staff to handle the upcoming acquisition. They seem to be hiring nearly anyone off the streets who doesn't have a criminal background. This has led to an increase in inefficiency, poor training, and unknowledgeable representatives with absolutely zero industry experience."

1569,,Good Job Terrible Career,2017-06-29,2.0,Senior Relationship Manager,"There are definitely pros to working at TDAI.  The benefits are above average, the new building is pretty amazing as well.  The new cafeteria is awesome and there is an onsite gym as well.  Both are super convenient because if you're a Relationship Manger, you only get a 30 min lunch break.  If you're looking for something steady and consistent, this is the place for you.","This was my first job out of college, I started with TDA Trust company in Denver back in 2007.  I transferred to the institutional branch in 2009 and worked my way up from Relationship Manager all the way to Senior Relationship manager.

1) The average salary listed on this page for this branch is actually largely inflated.  I was the primary service contact for an RIA with over 5 billion under management.  I was assigned what my managers acknowledged was the most challenging relationship in the building.  I know for a fact that TDAI was making millions a year solely on the firm I managed, but I was making around 60k.  Keep in mind that I spent 8 years with this company as well.  The only people who actually make real money in that building work in Sales or as Team Managers.

My manager sitting less than 5 feet away from me was making TWICE what I was making and he would leave early, show up late and surf the internet.  Tough pill to swallow.

2) Micro Management.  Every second of your day is dissected and analysed.  Your daily stats are put up on huddle board where you are ranked against the other people on your team.  These whiteboards are out in the open where everyone can see them and you huddle around them each morning.  They put so much pressure on Managers to meet certain metrics (that are often meaningless) and their quarterly bonuses are weighted to those metrics to ensure that they enforce them.  For example, they recently rolled out a new system.  It was terrible, every RM at all levels hated it because it tanked our productivity and provided no real value in the process.  It would add minutes to each call.  The new system provided no real value to your role as RM.  They tried to enforce a 100 % adoption rate by tying those metrics to your manager's quarterly bonus.  My manager openly hated the system, but was forced to make us all use it.

You literally can't go to the bathroom unless you tell 25 people you're stepping away from the phones.  Back office employees do not have to worry about this though.

3) If SR Management spent a lot of money developing a new web based application, like the one I referenced earlier, rather than scrap it and admit that it's not working as intended, they try and force the issue instead.  

4) Politics.  All promotions are pre determined, especially all managerial and sales positions because those are the only jobs that pay well.  Managers pre determine who they want to hire before they even open the position internally so people can apply.  Top talent does not rise to the top.  My advice is to make friends with all the managers and SR Managers, because without those connections, you literally have 0 chance of being promoted to those coveted positions.

5) Understaffed! The most important metric of all would be hold times.  Every team I was on, even at the highest level was understaffed.  They try and create a culture where people can create suggestions to improve processes and forward them up the food chain.  All of that and any other initiative being rolled out ends up getting scrapped on daily basis in order to shift resources to accommodate the increasing phone times.  TDAI has spent the last few years gathering assets, growing and growing, but they refuse to hire to increase the base infrastructure.  Because of that, quality has declined year over year.  The Sales team has been doing a great job, but they just haven't hired enough people in the front and middle office to handle the increase in work volume.

6) Cost Cutting.  Competitors recently announced price cuts, so TD had to cut their trading rates to match Fidelity and Schwab.   Interest rates are still low and the cost per trade dropped from $9.99 to $6.95, so they are making $3.05 less per trade now! I have no knowledge of the impact this has had, but I would guess it's having a negative impact.

7) Career Development.  There is plenty of opportunity for lateral movement, but no real upward movement once you hit Senior Relationship Manager.  Once I got to that level, I was surrounded by TDAI ""lifers"" who had been in the same position for years and years.  SRM's are so bitter because you spend years working your way up to that level, but once you get there, there is no exit plan or defined path.  To top it off, when you reach that level you're working directly with the sales team and you become abundantly aware that you're doing similar work to the Sales team, but you're making half the money.  Insult to injury is that you're trapped once you get there.  Multiple SRM's on my team had been there for 5 plus years! 

8) You're just a number.  This last one is personal for me, so take it with a huge grain of salt.  I spent almost 8 years at TDA, over 5 years in the SD location.  I had to take a leave of absence to take care of a sick family member and eventually had to resign because of it.  Not a single person from my team reached out to me in any capacity, even after I had to resign.  During my exit interview, my manager didn't even throw me a thank you for my 8 years of service.  My manager claimed to be a person who actually cared about their employees.  Only work here if you are ok being a number, a barcode on a desk."

You sit at a small desk in a crowded row and don't interact much with your co-workers, especially during high call volumes.  No assistant managers on the team to help associates on the phones; head manager is more big picture.  All help to the associates is via instant message with an internal group, which is tedious, slow, inefficient, and frustrating to both associate and client.  Also very disappointing training program.  So many important/frequent calls and system navigation not covered sufficiently during training.  Need more shadowing, listening to actual calls, even if pre-recorded, and better explanation and practice of systems.  And pay is too low; other companies and even departments within TDA pay more to licensed associates at this experience level than this department.

Through corporate ""slimming"" the workload was doubled and bonuses cut in over half.  They want you to move to a Consultant, Management or move out.  They feel you can only do it for so many years and try to squeeze the life out of you.  I used to think I could retire there and actually help the company.","The organization actually became less efficient while I was there.  I enjoyed helping clients and after a couple of years I couldn't actually help the clients.  Very frustrating especially because I couldn't take pride in my work anymore.  I felt like I was working for the DMV or the government.  All I could do was push product and hope clients didn't have issues as the efficiency  for getting things done was eliminated.  

Back office personnel that have been there a long time are awesome, knowledgeable, hard working and very team oriented.  The new people are uneducated and will lie to you or the client just to get you off the phone.  It's tough to help people when back office is speaking ebonics also.  I'm just amazed they still keep jobs in the US.  

I was pushed out due to new selling guidelines.  I didn't say the right words on the phone.  I caught my manager in numerous lies holding me to a double standard.  My coworkers told me to go to HR and report it.  Can't do that or you will be blacklisted within the company.  You won't be fired you just can't move anywhere else.  Eventually you would have to quit.

When I arrived here, it proved to be just that.","The good salary and work life balance attracts and unconsciously favors those who have a traditional Middle American family and income structure. In some (not all) parts of the organization, this can make it difficult for people who do not fit that mold.

For a 100k job this is quite demeaning. The huddles have lowered morale across the company and it is driving people away.  No one in my office or region who I have talked to enjoy the Huddles.

Comp, rewards and recognition for top 5% of ICs is excellent.","- your book of business is still prospecting (clients haven't hired you, they are simply at TD Ameritrade). 
- unless you make a name for yourself, or unless you are the aforementioned top 5%, management could care less if you stay or go.   Management is clouded by the fact that 20-30 ICs do 80% of the firm's business, and think everyone has the same opportunity throughout the country (not true).
- depending on your location, you will have a very tough time being a top IC (if you're in the northeast, look elsewhere - you'll struggle to make $100k after your first year). 
- management caters to first-year ICs to get them off to a fast start, paying them much higher than tenured ICs along the way (to try to reduce turnover), and somehow they don't think tenured ICs are aware that first-year ICs make about 25% more for doing the same production as tenured ICs. 
- branch managers (especially ones who get hired from outside TDA) are clueless about what ICs do on a daily basis, and don't care to learn.  They are more concerned with their job security than actually helping or coaching ICs. 
- last but not least, the compensation.  Comp is great in your first year, after that, you need to increase your production by about 15-20% annually to make the same as the prior year.  While most employees of companies get raises and cost of living adjustments, unless your sales growth exceeds 20% each year, expect to make less each year as you become more tenured."

Compared to other NY locations and even though consistent product sales were being achieved the $ amount was not there so instead of helping IC it's easier for them to bring on someone new and start fresh. Anytime support was called upon a different answer was provided for the same problem and important depts (New accounts, ACATs) were only available through instant message. CSS did nothing except look for new jobs and study for exams to get hired at other firms and provided no support to IC's.

1780,,Investment Consultant,2016-03-01,3.0,Investment Consultant,"If you are newly licensed and YOUNG, TD Ameritrade is a good place to start your career. If you work hard and build a good relationship with your clients, making 100K a year is not that hard. 

TD Ameritrade products are not the best in the industry however, Thinkorswim is one of the best trading platform out there. Having Thinkorswim in your arseal makes selling alot easier.","TD Ameritrade is not a career. Its a Job. As an Investment Consultant you have to built your book of business every quarter. Your job is ALWAYS in jeopardy. If your manager or regional manager does not like you, they have the ability to take clients away from you and slowing suffocate your pipeline making your miss your numbers. Fortunately, this have not having to me but I’ve seem it happen to many other ICs. This is why I said this is a good place to work if you are young. This is not a stable job. 

This is a sales job. Not an investment expert job. In fact, TD Ameritrade discourages ICs to speak high level about investments. Ironic? Even thought you have to be licensed as a broker/advisor, you do not use it. You can not give advice. Being an investment Consultant is a Financial Advisor with handcuffs. 

TD Ameritrade treats all employee has a treat to the company. Don't expect them to have your back on anything. This is a result of the company hiring poor quality people that only thinks about themselves and not the firm as a whole. I question sometimes why certain managers have their positions. Besides the Thinkorswim department, the level is education and intelligence in this firm in below average. The new hires are embarrassing. I'm actively looking to make a move out of TD Ameritrade soon because I don't want my reputation to be tarnished due to poor management decisions. This is why they have handcuff on everyone. They do not trust their own employees. Hey, I don't blame them. Hiring bad people results is complaints from clients and opens up potential lawsuits. Maybe this is why they don't hire people with brains?? Maybe that is why they hire ""yes"" people who can’t think on their own?? Are they trying to built a culture of robots?? ehh. who knows. 

TD Ameritrade recently started implemented L.E.A.N. I'm actually L.E.A.N certified. I believe is this strategy however, the managers are TD Ameritrade are implementing it all incorrectly. Its is ridiculous to watch. If L.E.A.N is done correctly it can be a great thing.

Last, The compensation plan is a joke. Yes, you can make good money, however, the plan builds bad behavior. For example: bring in new assets is 45% weighting on your quarterly bonus. The assets needs to stay until the end of the quarter. After the end of the quarter i.e. March 31th, if the assets leave the ICs doesn't care if the clients leave the firm. They already got paid on it. Same goes for advice products. If the IC sells an advice product ( managed accounts) it only needs to stay until the end of the quarter. After the quarter ends, there is NO incentive to keep the client happy or the service them. This is a HUGE conflict of interest. One of the CEO core values is ""Client Centric"" and ""People Matter"" I call BS on both of those."

So, when TDA started having a line-up huddle meeting every single morning I knew it wasn't gonna be good. Sure enough, a year and a half into it attrition and morale network-wide is at an all time low. And that should really be no suprise when you go from a company that treated its reps like adult financial professionals to treatIng them like Applebee's service staff.
I worked at this company when the motto was basically ""work hard, play hard, get paid well."" With a solid work ethic and a reasonable amount of sales acumen you could pull down 120k-150k. Further more you could check it at the door, there were ""fringe benefits"" like dinners and event invites, and you felt like you were doing good for your clients.
Fast forward just a few years and there are truly no redeeming qualities left. This is why it's so hard to fill a 100k job at this company... The tremendous amount of stress, the insane sales goals, the restrictive advisor climate, the micromanaging... Who needs it? The bottom of the barrel and they know it... It seems to be thier goal.

When clients feel a need for financial planning, estate planning, or money manangers, it's provided through the network of outside independent Registered Inverstment Advisory firms, again, the clearing firm, or custodian of the assets will be Ameritrade.  The company simply wants to generate revenues from fees and commissions. Has no interest in being the source of investing ideas.  Because of this, professional development will be limited.  After 1-3 years an an Investment Consultant selling the Morningstar stragies and setting appointments for outside IRAs, one should really be looking at the next level firms.

There is no built in time from workforce management to help these higher value clients beyond what a regular financial services rep receives that is dealing with lower value clients.

The result is more importance is place growing the company's revenue than the client's best interest. Fixed Income spreads are not competitive.

Good combination of daily work along with special projects to break the day to day grind.,Realistically you max out at around a 2% to 3% bump in base pay every year which hardly keeps pace with inflation.

Good hardworking people below the director level

Good place to start","Micromanaged-You are expected to talk constantly about your productivity (total calls and total sales leads). Your numbers are posted every day on a grease board for all in the call center to see.  And you can end up on reports sent up to the Managing Director level should your productivity drop below certain levels. 

No real empowerment.  If you have ideas, they will be put into an electronic suggestion box but you may never hear about them again.  Your ideas are turned over to others for evaluation and resolution.  

Every year the demands for more productivity are increased.

Getting a lateral move or promotion outside the call center is extremely difficult because you almost never interact with outside departments."

There is usually a 5-15% bonus every year
Business casual
Work from home is ok once every 2-3 weeks usually","The work life / environment tends to fluctuate over time. At times it is great, there is focus on good growth and useful technologies and goals.

TD Ameritrade offers a competitive salary with quarterly bonus potential.  Access to RIA firms for referrals and networking.,"This job has zero to do with investment knowledge and advice.  It is a telemarketer job and you are expected to be on the telephone all day.  Management records your telephone calls and criticizes every mistake you make.  There is zero positive reinforcement or learning, extremely negative culture.  Micromanagement is unbelievable.  Area manager was always sending me messages through internal Instant messaging asking why I had so low contacts for the day.  They did not want you having face to face client meetings because it took too much time.  They want you on the telephone contacting more clients."

1964,,A frustrated sales force that is headed for greener pastors,2015-01-21,3.0,Branch Manager,"You get to give your clients great tools and can feel satisfied that you give them great offerings.  Offerings stack up very well against direct peers.  Really no true peer from which you can't win business.  Good training for sales staff when they come in.  Advise offering is always improving.  Employess can learn a lot from the resources if they are willing to dedicate time off the clock.  Free Investools access, which is way better than any peer offers. A sales person who knows what they are doing can make a decent living pretty quickly. 

If you like company rah rah, they have a lot of it.  Lots of big company initiatives to jump on for something to talk about. Easy to find something to volunteer for outside of work (I think you get 1-2 days a year for this) because they put it in front of you.

And this could be a pro or a con, but goals are regionalized at all.   Careful where you work.","Sales comp is always going down--even when all sales metrics are going up.  They talk to sales staff like they are morons and don't understand that.  Good ideas are hard to get through. HR is literally NEVER going to be on your side.  Again, HR is NEVER going to be on an associate's side. If it's not been done before, it will be hard to get done.  Leadership doesn't care to help people advance, even the best people.  Absurdly high sales staff turnover. The worst people are very hard to get rid of.  There is not a lot of career progression from Investment Consultant role--either go Branch Manager, or move to service, which is where the worst sales people usually go.  They don't really support hiring and recruiting like they say they do.  The burden that fell on branch sales people, especially managers, for records and compliance has gone up dramatically, though comp did not.  They added more layers to reporting and made it more complicated.  The burden is not lighten by the DOMs at all. In sales world here, there is no incentive at all to share ideas, work with other managers, or do things to help the business overall.  Only the sales numbers matter.  Managers have a hard time getting paid because turnover is so high.  Management has become obsessed with Amerivest, and is not compromising fiduciary responsibility to clients by changing sales comp on Amerivest as compared to comp on competing offerings.  Top talent simply makes more money elsewhere and is treated.  Nobody cares about higher education, professional designations, etc--especially not HR, and you WILL NOT be able to leverage them in any salary negotiations.  Institutional business has grown so fast and is now the biggest part of TDA now and it's future.  Retail takes a back seat.  Mass Exodus of the top talent of TDA in 2013 & 2014.  Look at a list of top Consultants and Managers from 2013, and you'll hardly see a name left on it in 2015."
1965,,"TD Ameritrade has been a great company to work for so far. I started a little bit over a year ago in the Financial Service Representative role. This was my first phone job and my long term goal was to not be in customer service or sales so I didn't enjoy that position. However, it was a great role to start out in to get your series 7 and 63 licenses and learn about the market.
All of the managers I have encountered so far have been beyond helpful. They push you to job shadow and visit with other managers to find out where you want to go in the company. They also give you the tools to obtain the skills you need for your dream role.",2015-01-19,5.0,Financial Representative,"Career development, gym reimbursement, benefits start immediately, lots of room to grow, great management",When you are on the phones you can sometimes feel like just a number.

Fairly independent - you can't leave the office, but as long as you are on target, you will be left mostly alone","Micromanagement - the flip side to the above Pro is that if you are already a self-starter, you'll find the management of your activities tedious
Sales Focused - If you are ""consultative"", forget about the role. You'll be asked to keep a fairly high call volume and talk to many people"

In 2008 they woke up and started paying and treating employees better. They are willing train you.,While they became service oriented in 2007 from transaction oriented by 2012 service deteriorated with focus on asset gathering.  At they same time the culture became overly political correct and attacked those who voiced less than PC attitudes.  At the time I was forced out and later others who were older were forced out using small errors as an excuse to get what I can only think of as less service oriented and more sales oriented in the call center broker operations.

They promote from within and there is a lot of opportunity for lateral movement within the company and across different departments","There is literally zero training and procedural policies change weekly.
Zero clarity in terms of expectations, with emphasis on unrealistic goals
Lots of drama in the office and tremendous amount of micromanagement because the managers have nothing better to do and are generally sitting on their computers browsing the internet.
Constant talk of outsourcing so there is low morale.
High turnover 
Terrible work/life balance, with the expectation that you will work overtime every time they are in need of it, regardless of your desire to.
Very low pay for the amount of stress and pressure."

1973,,Best overall fit for financial professional,2014-12-20,5.0,Investment Consultant,"The people, the process, the investment choices, always put the clients first, EXCELLENT compensation for above average performers. Never once did I feel I wasn't doing what was truly best for my clients. Many options for clients to choose from whether they are self directed or are seeking guidance. Top notch place to work and upper level management seems to always come up with new ways to improve the client and associate experience.","Sat here for 15 minutes trying to find them and frankly I would be reaching, so not many at all. Great experience for me."
1974,,Good not great company,2014-12-12,3.0,Financial Representative,"They paid me to get my series 7 and 63, something I found impossible to find on my way out of college. Every brokerage I applied at wanted someone with them already for an entry level job. Kinda mutually exclusive the way the industry works. Definitely opportunity for advancement, most people above me right now are not much older or have only been there a minimal number of years.","Only 3 weeks vacation a year, get stuck with some holidays not as holiday pay if that is your normal shift. For a brokerage firm a .5 percent match up to 6 is pretty embarrassing compared to other firms especially being in the industry. Beginning training was tough on some of my class because they weren't prepared to handle incoming client calls. It might be because a lot of my coworkers don't have a finance backround/degree and no general interest in the market."
1975,,Pretty decent,2014-12-11,4.0,Senior Specialist,"Good starting salary, fun environment and great technology. There have been many good and fun paople that have worked here over the years.

1978,,"Consultant-driven, catchphrase bingo, no soul, rudderless.",2014-11-27,1.0,Registered Representative and Analyst,"Reasonable salary, reliable paycheck.  Perfect job for a newbie while they seek out more meaningful employment.  If you like a management track consisting solely of reviewing spreadsheets, attending interminable catered meetings, and giving cut-n-paste performance reviews, this is the joint for you.","Any company that buys their mission statement from a consultant is suspect in the first place.  Same goes for a company that uses clip-art in internal and external advertising instead of actual humans.  

Look up 'style over substance' and you'll find a photo of the HQ.  United Way, Habitat For Humanity, LEED, etc.--whatever it takes to get noticed; a PR facade covering up a soulless company.  NFL and Olympic sponsorship used primarily to impress corporate peers.  

The front-end is really sexy--whatever it takes to get a well-heeled client in the door.  The back end is chewing gum and chickenwire and it doesn't take a client too long to note the bait-n-switch.  Personally, I find it disgusting to work for an enterprise that has consideration for an acceptable amount of lying to clients and associates.  Everything is driven by 'service level', not satisfying all clients, but an acceptable, arbitrary amount.  And I remember when we used to take care of every client.

Complaints and constructive criticism is met by shining-on, cut-n-paste acknowledgement, timeframes for resolution that last *years*--and calling out this inactivity is met by more catchphrase bingo except this time management hides behind your supposed non-adherence to 'people matter' rather than your defense of 'clientcentricity'.  

Management is top-heavy with people with job titles but no accountability.  I'm not advancing the opinion that TDA management is a cult of personality because that implies there is a personality in the first place.  This company has no soul and no ambition other than what a consultant tells them to have.  Further, the place isn't overtly political in terms of cliquishness but the Peter Principle is very much in play."

Quarterly Production and bonus can be cyclical. You have to push yourself while working with irrational clients that can view you as a service person.

Goals continually increase while work load also increases the longer you have been there making it very difficult to achieve longevity in this role.  Management has no intentions of increasing longevity for this role regardless of the rah rah they spit out.  Many false promises.  They burn more resources finding ways to NOT pay you fairly in many circumstances.  Even when they know it isn't fair they say they will look at ways to adjust comp plan in the future .

All portfolios have a good portion of fixed income and can't customize allocation so if client already has fixed income outside the portfolio it doesn't matter.  You can send to RIAs but can't talk about specifics, can only set meeting and hope it closes.  TD is REAL strict on what you can and can't say, really focuses on dials and contacts instead of quality of interaction.  Once you put a clients money in one advice solution you can't get paid on the same money EVER if they decide to move it out and then ask for help again.  Employees are jumping ship often for Scottrade since the CEO of Scottrade is the old Head of Sales for TD Ameritrade back when the days were good.   Its good if you need to cut your teeth in the industry but then move on."

Well organized. Clear expectations.","In our department (Coaching) you are not conservative you might be looked down upon by middle management.

All your calls are recorded and analyzed daily; you are very limited on what you can say considering you have to have  series 7 license. No incentive to build client relationship mostly one and done. Upper management is under the delusion that it is a team work environment, it is a usually professional environment but  it is an eat what you kill compensation plan, and you are judged strictly on your individual production; there is no team production.  I am seeing good people leave every month since now an emperor wears no clothes atmosphere.  If you are not a yes man and have any individual ideas do not go here.  They are foolishly trying to create a plug and play role with weak technology that is basically a time tracking overlay for CRM software with some sales scripts.

When I started 5 years ago, the employees came first, but now shareholders come first. That'd be fine and dandy, if all employees had stock options and not just senior management. Bonuses have been declining for the last 3 years and you've had layoffs, while your CEO announces a record bonus for himself(not a good idea for moral).

Unable to really move anywhere except branch mgmt…and unless you wanted to move, not too attractive.
Even if you did want to move into branch mgmt, you better start your brown-nosing on day one
Some managers non-existent, some ultra micro managers, and the higher level mgmt didn't really offer any guidance. Branch managers mainly concerned with keeping their cushy jobs, which consisted of meetings about other meetings, being on their blackberry's, and figuring out ways to appease the IC's without actually figuring anything out and/or solving any issues.
A what have you done for me lately philosophy. They say it's about building relationships but you don't benefit from creating them. No trailers, paid to sell sell sell. If you already have the majority of a clients business, they want you to keep in contact, and you get dinged on money leaving, but there's no benefit to the IC if no new business opportunity.

The client reporting and portfolio analysis tools available to ICs are subpar.  Therefore, our presentations to clients are not as thorough as our competition.

And communication from management is poor. 

I have not been pleased with my experience at TD, other than an uptick in my total take home pay compared with my previous job. 

Lastly, and most importantly, they do not take good care of their employees health needs. I was sent to the hospital one day and was told to use one of my 15 (annual) Paid Days Off. TD encourages ICs to come into the office if they have the flu or are sick because they will have to use one of their 15 Paid Days Off. And Paid Time Off (PTO) is typically saved for vacation time.

Great technology company for clients who trade on their own with very strong educational resources. 

Strong institutional managers for clients who qualify with higher assets and need help managing assets.","Internal Technology and Back Office execution is a complete nightmare.  Which causes potential risks to clients execution and portfolios.

Company doesn't want Investment Consultants to provide any guidance to clients,, talk in gray areas, and cannot solicit or really render a true professional opinion to a client.  Be ready to talk in grays all day every day.

95% of the job is spent trying to get clients to invest with you on the phone.  Most financial advising is done in person.  They want you to close a client in 10 minutes.     

Everything that an Investment Consultant does is recorded and micro managed, where management believes on style fits all clients.  Cannot work with clients in a true developed relationship approach,  instead it's more a 'beat the client into submission' that they need help and cannot manage money on their own.  Which ironically is why most clients go to TD Ameritrade, to manage on their own.

Everything you sell and close for business is disected in hopes you did something wrong in the process and take it away.  This happens all the time and cannot be emphasized enough.

-Pay is more than reasonable for the majority of the employees.","Everything! None of the positions at this company are glamorous, however a reasonable person would realize this and accept it for what it is. You are going to be on the phone all day doing a very repetitive job that will never be fun. This isn't Goldman Sachs and you will seldom have any conversation that will breach the borders of Finance 101. That being said, there is no shame in it and it certainly could be much worse. Sadly, the average employee at the company does not understand this. Most believe that they are the second coming of Gordon Gekko. I have seen employees rocking suspenders and bowties, albeit surely from JC Penney or Kohl's. Unfortunately, the corporate culture actually endorses such behavior which only proliferates the douchery. All in the good name of fun, the company has created a culture that demeans the individual. I once had to participate in an event that involved making a bridge out of toothpicks as a teambuilding event. The odd thing is you are never really on a team, because you are all on your own on the phone!! I had 7 managers in 6 years and each one was a simpleton. They will attempt to brainwash you at all costs. You will constantly be advised to work on your ""brand"". It's absolutely unreal. Everyday I went to work I felt like Luke Wilson in Idiocracy. Now that being said, if you are someone who is not very bright and enjoys holding on to your childhood, then by all means this is the ideal place for you. However, if you have an IQ north of 85 I would suggest seeking out other opportunities. This place will drive you insane!!"

At the end of the day its not about retaining talented people, its about churn and burn and company sees very little value in individual employees.  if you leave they will just find another struggling young broker from Merrill, Smith Barney, Ed Jones etc... and give them salary and put them through the wringer for next 2-3 years.  what do clients get?  a new ""advisor"" every 2-3 years.

This means that the product mix is fair and objective and is not significantly biases by sales incentive to the associate.,"On the same token is that the compensation program does not reward experience, knowledge and years of service.  You are only as good as your last two quarters. The incentive to produce results has diminished significantly the last two years.  Internally they describe the company as a retail distribution company.  They do not operate their branches as a retailer.  There are no true retailers in upper management.  Only glorified stock brokers leading middle and upper management.

Clients are also becoming commodities.  Relationships with clients are viewed as belonging to the company, and are no longer your preferred clients.  This makes it hard to be more than a shoes salesman with a series 7."

Its a place where hard work is recognized and there is a culture that focuses on recognizing hard working associates. Benefits in-line with competitors and top sales associates can do extremely well with total compensation.
Products and compensation are developed to reduce conflict of interest with the client as much as possible and I think they succeed. Employees can sleep at night since we try to do the right thing for each client.
TDA feels like its moving in the right direction and still has that scrappy young feeling like there is more to do to be better. Management seems to get it that there is still work to be done here.","Need to figure out the branch model more to provide growth for people who have been there a while. Too much focus on front end of pipeline - let the stragglers be managed one on one instead of the whole team if they are weak.
Management is definitely political - obvious in certain areas of the country like East coast.
The compensation plan does not encourage developing relationships with existing clients. Its more transactional. Minor focus on high net worth clients but not enough. Resulting client interactions are transactional."

2129,,The most forgettable job I've ever had,2013-05-13,1.0,Programmer Analyst,Nice people in the rank and file,"This is a boring place to work.  Creative and innovative thoughts are thwarted at best, punished at worst.  Upper management is quite content to cut positions, under the guise of lean, lower benefits and anything else it takes to line their own pockets.  Their salary structure is mediocre, raises are pitiful and there is little to provide you with initiative to do anything more than show up."
2130,,I Didn't Know Hell existed on Earth,2013-05-03,1.0,Financial Representative Broker,Good medical benefit and I mean medical benefits only.  Flexible schedule.,"Where do I start?  First, don't be fooled by the reviews from Omaha because their city lacks employers so there just happy to have a job. This companies philosophy is seduce you with advancement opportunities, but you never get compensated much for advancing.  HR forgets to tell you about that part.  I started out as a Financial Rep Broker who was already licensed, which pays from 35K to 43K.  I got promoted a few times to other positions within the company, but each time I was promoted I would receive a $1,500 increase, which is a joke.  This companies annual increases are usually 1-2%, which adds to your frustration that you don't get paid anything.  My last position I was offered was a PCS Broker, which is the highest paid broker at TD.  They told me I would only get a penny increase, literally .01 cent.  I asked them why I would be ignorant enough to except the position for a penny increase, when it required more responsibility and more phone calls than the average broker on my team?  Managements justification to me was that my job title name would change.  That I should consider myself honored to have this title without pay.  I declined the job offer.  Management preys on the fact that the job market isn't good.  There are 3 routes you can go to advance at TD.  The first route is service, and the highest position you can have is a PCS broker.  This job pays around 45K plus quarterly bonuses, but they bonuses are a joke for the abuse you take on the phones.  The second route is sales, and the highest position you can have is an Investment Consultant.  IC's make around 50K plus bonuses, but most of the time you don't blow out your sales, so you're stuck with this salary.  Also, if you miss your sales goals 2 quarter in a row they let you go.  The third route is management.  This job takes an act of god to get, because you have to be the biggest brown noser on the planet.  Also, you have to be under educated to have this job, and enjoy playing solitaire.  If you have in MBA or a law degree don't even bother applying for a management position.  Managers at this company always fear people that are educated, because they worry you'll take their job some day.  The culture at this company is horrible.  Everyone that has worked at this company over a year ends up hating the company.  They keep cutting back on quarterly bonuses, but they say there going to increase the compensation you make through sales goals.  This is an outright lie.   If you're intelligent enough to do the math you'll realize you're getting cheated out of more compensation.  I received numerous Presidents Club awards at this company, and it's their highest honor they can give to a person.  I say this because I don't want people to read this post, and say oh this guy probably wasn't a high performer, that's why he's frustrated about the pay.  In my 4 years at TD my salary only increased 7k.  Compared to friends of mine that joined a competing firm in the area, I saw their salary increase over 30K in 4 years.  I resigned at TD, and immediately got a 25k increase with another employer.  Don't waste your time with this company unless you lack a college degree, like being paid peanuts,  like taking 80-120 inbound calls a day or enjoy being micromanaged to the point of insanity.  This place is hell on Earth."
2131,,Credit Analyst,2013-04-30,2.0,Credit Analyst,"The pay was good, this included bonuses. In the beginning there were numerous advancement opportunities. No need to work nights or weekends.

The pay structure is great and the training is excellent.  Be prepared to produce or get out of the way for someone else.,There is no future in the position.  The tenure among ICs is 3-8 years and there is no one retiring from the firm.  Always be prepared to resign and be on the look out for bigger and better opportunities. They will grind all they can out of the broker.
2133,,Finance Intern - good opportunity if you're from the area,2013-04-29,4.0,Finance Intern,"They do a really good job of giving you a 360 degree view of all of the company's operations at the corporate headquarters. You should get  a lot of good experience. You actually get to have time on the phone with clients, even though you have very miniscule things you can actually discuss with them. You will give a presentation at the end to senior employees which is beneficial. Access to their trading platform which you will be able to keep after the internship. Overall, pretty good opportunity if you want to get into the financial services industry.","For me, not being from Omaha and moving there for the summer was the biggest downside. Not the best town in the world, no offense if you hail from there. If you do, however, and are spending a college summer at home with your folks anyways, jump on this internship if you have the chance, it will no doubt look great on your resume no matter what, it has gotten me into several interviews I didn't feel I would have gotten had I not done this internship."

I was actually told once that the new initiative I was working on would step on one of those middle manager's toes so I should stop.  Many of us have many stories like this.  You learn to just keep your mouth shut, toe the party line, do nothing outside the box, and look for another job if you'd like anything more from your career.

I'm sure there are good areas to work and good managers at this company, but in two positions in different areas of the organization I saw the same thing.  Remember that this is a company with a history of massive layoffs, so the people in charge are the people who made it through, and so are often those who managed to toe the line and not cause any waves.

Management truly wants to help you succeed and will help whenever needed.,"Sales quotas and commissions constantly a moving target. Drives me absolutely crazy when companies raise your sales quota, cut your commission and tells you they will replace you if you do not meet them. I am not motivated by this tactic but it is one that is commonly used in this industry. I finally had to get out and start my own company. I make 3 times the money with the same amount of stress but can take off whenever I want.

- Profit sharing goes direct into 401k (on top of contributions and match) and can be substantial","- Yearly layoffs are the norm, remaining employees typically expected to pick up the slack.  In some groups tech groups that means 60-70hr work weeks.
- Pay tends to be below average for the Financial sector
- Bonuses for the non-managers cap at 15% for most, then jumps to 30% if you are at the very top of the ladder.
- High rate of management turnover (middle up to and including C levels), typical management lasts 2-3 years
- Trouble prioritizing technical projects across the enterprise, you will have 50 #1 priorities to deliver and not really know what is most important.
- Management will gut projects to get them over the line for their bonuses, workers are then stuck doing constant bubble gum/duct tape patches. 
- No resource planning for people, people get assigned to multiple projects where they may be required to do hundreds of hours of work in one week.  This makes most projects slip for obvious reasons.

-Benefits aren't too bad
-Can get your Series 7 & 63","-Politics, it's not who is the best person for the job that gets hired for promotions... it's the person who can brown nose their way into the position that gets it.
-Leadership team, especially the Senior Management Team. This goes back to the office politics, Senior Managers are individuals who don't act out of integrity and do what is right for their associates. They have set unrealistic performance expectations and continue to make them even more unrealistic and keep raising them. Why doesn't Senior Management get on the phones to do our job before they start telling us what our metrics should really look like? Yes, most were on the phones at one point, but that was over 5+ years ago and the business has changed since then and calls have gotten longer and expectations have grown exponentially higher
- Two faced executive leaders, you have many executive leaders in the Company who will be nice to your face but talk about you behind your back with others and then be able to let them go the very next day.
- Food vendor is terrible, they serve off the wall food. What ever happened to regular food?
- Communication, they say they have an open door policy, but what they really mean is don't really take advantage of this ""so called"" option because it will be a career limiting move if heaven for bid you bring up a known problem that needs to be addressed when no one else is willing to do it because they are so scared of what it will do to their career. 
-Have to walk on egg shells. They have created a culture there now that doesn't allow you to really speak up and share things that will help grow the business or make things better because if you do you may be viewed as lashing out and receive formal coaching. You always have to be careful of what you say and to who.
-Insufficient training, they expect you to know everything but don't commit the time or energy into ongoing training once you're hired
-Leadership team is like the ""good old boys club"" and have Manager's, Senior Manager's and Directors who are very clicky when you go to off site events, it's very difficult to enter into their ""circle of friends"" and is almost like being in High School again with how they treat new people, they are often times not the most inviting and not approachable. 
-Work/life balance is very bad if you are interested in trying to grow your career and advance. If you have children, forget about trying to advance in the Company because in order to advance and get promotions you have to ""Network"" and it's always the people who can do this in the evening/weekends at offsite events that get the promotions which is not fair to those with families."

The job is very stressful as you're stuck on a phone for the whole day.  You're usually have to deal with irate clients as the website regularly has issues.  You are literally managed down to the second, which takes micromanagement down to the cellular level.   The job has moved to being focused entirely on sales which has created a ""what have you done for me lately"" culture.

You had to add up every little thing you did and the amount of time it took for it and write it on progress sheets to turn into the managers.
