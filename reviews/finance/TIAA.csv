The lack of salary increases makes the bonus eventually capped. Little accountability with business partners which regularly causes a bad client experience.

People of color have to work twice as hard and twice as long for raises and promotions which less qualified white people achieve in half the time.

201,,"A good company, good stepping stone, but don’t get stuck in the call center",2021-11-29,3.0,Financial Services Consultant,"27 days PTO per year (in addition to holidays), decent health insurance, excellent dental. The company was very effective and flexible in their COVID response. We worked entirely from home for the last 1.5 years but I did not stay to see whether they will actually go through with the transition back to the office. They gave us extra PTO to vote and to get vaccinated. Made about $65k per year in the call center (base +bonus). The pay is better than most customer service jobs, but the responsibilities are also more complex than most service jobs. They pay you to study full-time for about two months so you can get your FINRA licenses. Once licensed, salary was permanently increased (not just a one-time bonus like some other companies). Next, there’s extensive classroom training for the actual job, then a gradual, supported  transition to working on the phone. Overall, the culture was open and positive, at least in the entry level positions. Your team members will be happy to help you. I genuinely liked my coworkers - great people from many different career backgrounds. You don’t have to have finance experience to get into this job. Within the call center, there is a lot you can learn and extra projects to join that will hopefully get you off the phone for a bit. The NCC consultant job is hourly, with a consistent schedule, no weekends. When you’re off work, nobody is bothering you. The senior leadership is more gender- and race-diverse than any other company I’ve worked for.","TIAA’s products and services are unnecessarily complicated, leading to frustration for clients. You deal with the typical stress/abuse from difficult customers. You have to keep up with tons of detailed company policies, product rules, employer plan rules, and Federal, IRS, Insurance and FINRA regulations that are frequently changing and not always well-documented. There’s a lot of miscommunication and passing the blame between different departments. It took 7 months to get through licensing and training to be released to work on the phone on your own. Most people agree that even at that point, you’re still not fully competent. It takes maybe 6 more months before you feel comfortable in the job. The consultant job is somewhat of a catch-all. We do not just perform account maintenance and transactions. We also have to address processing issues, educate about investments, income options, and taxes, discuss long-term planning, provide technical support, teach clients how to use the website, teach them how to complete our complicated forms, make referrals, sell lifetime annuities, asset retention etc. Some of my coworkers remarked that in other companies, they would be transferring the calls more often to specialized teams. Call center is understaffed, and that leads to constant back-to-back calls, mandatory overtime during busy season, and it’s harder to get PTO approved. EVERY thing you do throughout the day is recorded and measured, down to how many seconds you spend doing different tasks, and that gets tiresome. Upper management constantly changes the way performance is evaluated but then as soon as everyone is on board, the goalposts are changed again before we even have time to see the long-term effects of an initiative. It seems like they might be doing this to keep consultants from getting too good at certain metrics and maximizing their performance evaluations. You get reassigned to different managers frequently. They trade you like a playing card based on your stats. The associate and middle management levels are still very heavily dominated by white males. In the end, I left because of the back-to-back call burnout and because I was strung along for over a year in terms of my development within the position, plus there weren’t enough opportunities outside of the call center."

325,,A dinosaur with declining revenues and no clear direction or strategy to right the ship.,2021-08-14,2.0,Senior Director Sales,Great people who care about and believe in the mission to serve the retirement needs of the not-for-profit community.,"C-Suite decisions (acquisitions and new market strategy) will prove to be the downfall of this once strong and successful brand. The former CEO was more of an intellect (+super nice guy too) with a minimal understanding of what it takes to succeed in today's and tomorrow's retirement business. Buying a municipal bond shop may have diversified asset holdings but did nothing to address the fundamental and systemic challenges associated with declining revenues in general account, turn around the pending doom when outflows outpace inflows, or fix an outdated, antiquated and archaic RK platform. The CEO should have deployed assets used for Nuveen and Bank biz to fix RK platform (or buy a new one), develop a robust IRA platform that would grandfather rights and privileges of TIAA Traditional for use on that platform, and build-out other complimentary services to serve their large customer base. It's was the EASY button formula but the CEO missed the boat and it will cost them dearly down the road (10-12 years and it will get really bad is my guess). Some of the tough challenges are already here today when considering the financial risks of a 3% guarantee in Traditional and 10 year Treasury rates - not good. It will be a death by a thousand cuts since their only way to fix the declining revenues is through growth and scale. Growth for TIAA is a massive challenge because of reasons stated above - they put the money on the wrong horse. If they wanted to know what they needed to do the CEO didn't need analysts or professional consultants to help figure that out - he just had to look at his NUMBER ONE competitor and follow that strategy. Pretty simple if you asked me but nobody asked - then again, even if they did, nobody would listen."

801,,Score Card Hell,2020-10-04,1.0,Client Relationship Consultant,Stated values and pillars are very nice to hear.,"The score card forces people to check boxes and to mold activities so they can result in a score card credit. This takes a lot of time to think about and many physical key strokes. Managers seem to relish pointing out shortcomings, often using scorecard results. They twist everything you say to use it against you. This role is micromanaged, and you are forced to adopt flavor-of-the-day processes even if your team does not need or want to adopt. So much time wasted unnecessarily! Every day something changes, new processes. It seems as though they do not know what they want from us. It feels like whip-lash, and we are treated like children.

This is THE worst run company, at a high level, that I have ever encountered.   The return-to-office move in 2019 was a complete disaster that accomplished nothing but lowered productivity, lowered morale and increased failure.   This was a heavy-handed, incompetent move that did not do ANYONE any good.  Whoever pushed that disaster should be fired on the spot.   Ironically, the Covid-19 pandemic trashed that initiative, and I understand that productivity has now improved.   

Many departments within the company, HR in particular, are highly passive aggressive.   There has been no improvement in this area despite an avalanche of complaints over the years."

When somebody promises you a product whose benefit payments will never run out, head for the hills.
When somebody promises that your account balance will always increase regardless of market conditions, they're lying.
Maybe reality distortion is okay when marketing a product you can easily sell, but it's very bad for insurance and annuities. You can't remove your money from TIAA's non-cashable insurance products without facing major surcharges.
Do yourself a favor. If you don't want to associate yourself with fraud, dodge this place like the plague."

903,,SINKING SHIP - DO YOUR RESEARCH!,2020-05-22,1.0,Manager,"Used to be a very solid company to work for. Good pay, bonus, benefits, flexibility. That has all be flushed down the toilet.","Where to start? Well, first.....let's look at the regression of TIAA in my tenure there: 

1. A huge emphasis on TIAA India, where many of TIAA jobs have been farmed out to. All in the name of cutting costs at any cost. 
2. Two rounds of early separation packages to employees in the last 5 years. The latest was just announced that TIAA is offering **75 PERCENT** of their US employees voluntary separation packages. Re-read that and let that set in. 
3. In 2019, they forced every employee working remotely (there were thousands) to suddenly report to an office. This was a clearly veiled attempt to reduce headcount. Many people left the company. The few who were hired to replace those people are now, you guessed it, working remotely again. Quite possibly the single worst corporate decision in the history of bad decisions. 

If you are job searching and TIAA is interviewing you or you are considering applying, think long and hard based on the events of the past few years. If they are offering 75% of their employees to leave the company, they are in SERIOUSLY dire straights. I would venture to guess they are barely even a viable company at this point. 

My mother worked for 30 years for a higher ed institution, her retirement is with TIAA. I have moved her assets to another, more financially stable firm. I honestly do not believe TIAA will survive the next 5 years, they are a good candidate to get bought out by a competitor at this point so the inept management can sail off into the sunset having laid off thousands of hard working employees in the name of the almighty dollar."

912,,Review for Digital Domain in TIAA Pune.,2020-05-14,2.0,Analyst,"Good Salary, Cab Facility, Insurance Policy is very good.
These are the only good things about this company. REST is BAD.","If you have bad luck and get hired into the Digital domain then better go for other companies. There are no new projects in digital. They are just maintaining legacy very old projects which were developed by Cognizant in which you have to provide support (no development related work or very little).On top of that to kill their time, the directors will think of some ideas which are completely useless and make you do multiple POCs which are of course no value to the business. So they are scrambled very soon as they were thought of and all your work goes into recycle bin. And at those times you will be asking question to yourself “What am I doing here?”
But if you want to relax, write bunch of mails, pointing out others faults,or do some politics or impress the same directors(with very bad ideas) then this company is good for you. As I have seen most of the senior members do the above and have already decided this company as their retirement home. So they try their best to remain the favorite of their directors.
But if you are not into those things then better go for other companies where you will at least learn something new which will add value to your career and most of all it will give you satisfaction of doing something that actually matters. 

The second issue in this company is the HR.I don't even know what those guys are doing. Every time you have some queries and you try to contact them there will be one generic reply:"" Please post your queries in HR FOR YOU"". HR FOR YOU is a third party company which does the work of HR. And those guys take exactly 3 days (not more or not less than 3 days. It’s exactly 3 days).It is really frustrating to get a simple answer from them. And on top of that you are not allowed to go to their desks. It’s prohibited. Its mystery what those guys do."

918,,Great Company-Average Job,2020-05-11,2.0,WMA,Clients are great. Benefits are amazing. Products truly do help the client.,"The WMA role is somewhat of a joke. People get hired and are paid $95k base salaries and are expected to acquire outside assets. I've been in the role 3 years and many advisors I started with have never hit their asset growth goal over that time. 

Now here we are in 2020, right int he middle of the pandemic and what does TIAA do!?!?! They offer a voluntary separation agreement that pays you anywhere from 45-91 weeks of salary and your prior year bonus to leave. All Wealth Managers are eligible for the package.

Now I'm a top performer, but I have to seriously consider this package. The fat of the farm will stay because they know they aren't good and why would they pass of a $95k salary and great benefits when they never have to hit goal!

The operations at this place is straight from the 1980s. Compliance is a mess. When you make a recommendation for a client to make an IRA contribution, you must submit 15 mins worth of suitability info that needs to be reviewed by a human. It's the same amount of work as submitting suitability on a $10mm account. Wast of time, resources and money.

If TIAA had focused on making their Wealth Management division an industry leader and prioritized top performs while letting go bottom performers after a year of iffy performance. I don't think they would need to make any cuts during these difficult times.

Now I'm forced with making a decision to leave.

Good luck TIAA."

- By far, the best work culture I have ever witnessed.
- They pay good. ( you already know that one )
-Less work pressure and great work life balance ( this might not be true for some positions)
- People are really nice there. ( the technical ones and your managers. This does not include HRs )
- They have latest technologies. So even if the things are slow, you can learn on your own, if you are of that kind.","- US company, so shift hours are not really that good.( 1 pm to 10 pm or 2pm to 11pm )
- Work is slow. ( take this as negative or positive but it takes time for things to get done here )
- I really have to think about negatives while I can list positives all day. TBH, theres nothing which would be a deal breaker for the pune office. I mean yes the cafet is small but there are tons of streetfood and restaurants options nearby. Same goes for other minor issues.
This reviews goes for only my department and my position. Although, positions which are one or two level up from mine would also share the same thoughts. It might be at Dir level where things might be a bit different but yes this is department specific and I speak for cyber department only.
- Didnt have much experience with HR related queries and stuff but as much as I had, it wasnt a pleasent one. Things are pretty slow."

The program has monthly meetings to check in on how everyone’s doing, go over questions, and give any updates, so it’s been pretty transparent and organized.  It’s also nice to see the list of managers looking for TAs a few months before rotations start, so there’s a lot of time to network and try to match with managers.

Other pros: Everyone has been really nice and helpful, good company culture, great benefits and PTO policy, beautiful Charlotte campus, and it’s an ethical place to work.",Amount of work and stress level varies by TA rotation.

Before applying for a regional role, consider if you are wanting to stay stagnant for three years to get vested and then find upward movement elsewhere if you don’t live in those areas.

2.  Regarding 4 Hats, you are at a Risk for a lower rating = lower bonus
3.  We got into the business as Sole Record Keeper - we typically offer the world to an institution, without creating a platform or service.  Most clients will move away from TIAA in five years
4.  If we win a new plan, immediately we a team of FC’s, Case Managers, Relationship Managers and Directors are placed at a disadvantage and trying to set expectations on services that we over promise and under delivered
5.  Typically we underbid SRKs and we are losing money on plans and it is up to the call center and Field Consultants to “up-sell” and have assets transfer to TIAA
6.  We cannot get our own funds on Institutional Clients - big winners are always Vanguard Funds...our company helps Vanguard tremendously with contribution growth by the billions each year
7.  Lack of Diversity with mid managers and directors 
8.  Layoffs of AWS and departments in last 3 months
9.  Land grabbers, we are the 2nd largest Real Estate company in the world and continually to grow each day
10.  India,India and India - 1000s of back office / non license jobs are shipped to low wage earners in India.
11.  Artificial Intelligence / “bots” are being used to process paperwork and require IT from India to create and service.  Always making countless errors that ruin efficiency
12.  Wealth Management - unreasonable Sales goals and push clients into services they don’t need. 
13.  We love photo up opportunities with the community, in reality employees cannot participate in many events and likely only SR leadership participates.  We love to show a force on Denver’s Heartwalk or Breast Cancer awareness or Pride day...guess who are ask to walk on a Saturday and invite the family in the name of TIAA..the diverse / entry level employee

Plenty of down time to study and learn other things.,"No salary increases even if you’re a top performer, they require you to sit in a role for over 3 years to even be considered for a promotion which will only get you a $1-2k salary increase.

The bonus structure is below industry norm for roles that are not executive level. 

Management is not transparent and is at another level of micromanaging. They require you to get rated off of score card metrics based on what you enter into the system. It’s a completely inaccurate way to measure someone’s performance as many are known to falsely enter things into the system. 

Not an environment for someone that is ambitious and wants to grow. This is the perfect environment for the slacker who just wants to clock in and clock out and not work with smart people or be challenged whatsoever. 

The role is basically a licensed telemarketer. They want you calling people to set appointments. That’s it."

5.Also this place is not at all safe, as they don't even care if you are unwell,you have to stay back at office just to worsen your health. Rather they ask you, that how did u fell ill all of sudden, these types of leaders should better be terminated immediately.
6. Most importantly they lurked the candidates by showing off their work culture friendly for females , rather it was just a mere showoff, specially females should stay away from this place.
7. My only question to HR is why all that lie while hiring when you have hired the worst leadership who can't even care about their  subordinates. Companies like this should not even be allowed to set up offices if employee is not safe in office when he/she spends half of the day.
8. You want to hire maximum females possible , but how do you forget that females are more prone to illness if they do night shifts, do you even have brains to understand this."

This is a firm desperately trying to play in the big leagues and it can't come anywhere close. It is decades behind it's competitors in technology, processes and thinking.  At a time when it should be retaining its best talent, those that can are walking out the door.  What is left is mediocrity, longtimers and friends of executive. This is a tier 3 organization. 
If you are in NYC, you are damned. The firm is moving to Charlotte. It would move faster if it could, but it has run out of space on campus. Instead, they have made life for New Yorkers miserable at a WeWork location. It is a sweat shop. Everyone is crammed next to each other, there is no privacy, it is loud and filthy.  In the eyes of management, there is now free coffee (something TIAA did not offer its employees in the past) so we should be most grateful.

Unfortunately, the executives only care about the bottom line and have lost site of what the company was founded for. This is far from a non-profit that is trying to help people in retirement.  They only care about money at the expense of employees. They are outsourcing and offshoring positions left and right. They removed all working from home which impacted basically every employee and despite everyone voicing their concerns, they proceeded onward with it. The moral is so low and the environment is so toxic. Many have stuck around hoping it will return to the culture it once was but it just keeps getting worse and worse. The company isn't keeping up with its competitors in regards to flexibility or compensation. They are moving backwards not forward. Until they actually wake up, I would stay far away from this organization. 

The company has let so many individuals who are considered top talent walk out the door. They assume everyone is replaceable but they are not. They do not value their employees. The same people get promoted over and over again while very hard working, dedicated employees get passed over all the time. 

When you ask what you can do to get promoted or increase your comp and do those things advised, they then come back and say ""well now you need to do this.""

Be prepared to be marched around by someone that makes 2x as much as you do and just takes meetings all day. There is a clear status quo and everyone is too afraid to disrupt it or speak up. You are encouraged to “speak up” and provide feedback but watch what happens when you actually do. Don’t  be afraid to be PR for every mistake the company makes and the voicepiece for processing errors/trouble, then be hassled by management when the customer says they are upset with TIAA. Computers, systems, processing, and software constantly break but you are responsible. Changes are constantly made to your detriment and you will be responsible for the brunt of it. You will be coached but none of your feedback will matter. Be prepared to be pushed into a corner anytime you try to move up- no one will help you and they will fingerpoint things you have no control over about your current position that have nothing to do with you as a worker to try and retain you in a role that no one wants."

The benefits are great in terms of 401k and employee Pension Plan for retirement. Work life balance is great.,Depending on your area it is easy to reach a skill cap in which you stop learning new things or there is minimal improvment because the projects tend to be very similar and the work starts to get a bit repetitive.

These guys just announced new smart windows in the NY City office the same day they admitted more job cuts were coming. They said ending work from home was not a workforce reduction strategy but now have admitted most of those people will not be replaced. AND, by the way, there is a hiring freeze in place. This happens at TIAA about every 18 months now. So if you want a job where you can virtually NEVER stop worrying about being laid-off, TIAA is the place to be.

2. Even though US and India are stated to be same company (no consultant or child company, with every employee having equal say), but India ln management since they are habitual of licking keeps treating US counterparts as clients.
3. Management (India) needs to put trust in employees under them and back them up, instead of throwing them under the bus.
4. Pick up and drop facilities are missing. They have started  bus service, but since company follows flexible timings so, it doesn't apply to all employees. Cab drop facility is there but after a specific time. This issue is with Mumbai office only as Pune has cab pick and drop. At least they can keep it consistent in both location.

At the time of joining this organization i did some search on glassdoor about TIAA, that time there were just 19 reviews available, out of which 13 were worst negative reviews. I was in a great dilemma whether to join this company or not...but finally i ignored all negative reviews considering the fact that reviews could be subjective, however i had never thought that i would myself come up with such a worst experience with this company. 
Indian management is biased and people on higher management roles are all friends from their old company so you can never ever go against your manager even though your manager is a dumb who would expect you to always say YES to his every nonsense expectations.
If you're not a kind of bootlicker person, this place is not for you. 
No matter how hard and good working employee you are, keeping and ignoring aside all your good works and appreciations received from your US management, Indian management people who are highly non-productive/non-technical and worthless bunch of jokers so called managers would bother just about whether you nod to your management's every silly expectations or not.
If you argue even for a genuine reason there is no body to take your side, you will be harassed like hell, they will put you on PIP , create environment of job threat with multiple non-productive HR  meetings. They will give you lowest rating to make sure you do not get any variable and hike for the year irrespective of your performance.
And even worst part is that HR managers will also not help you out in any way rather they are biased towards managers as all of them are good friends and they all have learnt the art of survival in this organization with big fat salaries that too doing nothing and have to keep on continuing their survival here same way. HR managers will not intervene if your reporting manager playing with your career.
HR managers are such useless that even if there are multiple complaints about a particular manager from same team, even then those fools will not try to assess that your manager might be in fault rather they will feel better solution to fire the team members who complaint for that manager.

1158,,Great company but one bad manager could ruin your career.,2019-04-23,2.0,Senior Administrative Assistant,Amazing work/life balance.  Great hours and killer benefits.,"I set out to work for TIAA and was happy when they posted a job that suited me and when I got it I was elated.  As a woman in my 40s, I'm thinking about retirement and who better to work for than TIAA.  I really believed that I was going to retire from there.  Sadly, I was mistaken.

I worked for a brilliant mid-level manager who was so smart that no one else could ever do anything right.  I was told by someone higher up than me that of the 1-5 annual rating system, she'd give everyone a 3 which meant ""meeting expectations"".  I, like everyone else was always at a 3.  Unfortunately, she was one of those people who was an elitist and Admins were beneath her so she felt that she could talk very unprofessionally and disrespectfully to me and other Admins all the time.  If you offered up a solution to a problem, she would rip it to shreds because only she could come up with a better solution.  After all, I was only an Admin so I got the impression that my opinion never counted.  Some of her junior executives were out of line and if I brought it up to her, I would get reamed.  Meanwhile, if someone had some feedback about me, I wasn't ever allowed to share my side of the story and she would get angry and not speak to me for a week.  Very professional.  I never had a voice.  

Her boss was very senior and always a gentleman and I loved when I got to work with him.  She had one person under her and I did ALL her work.  She had been there forever and wasn't getting fired but she (as an exec) didn't have my skill set and constantly passed my work off as hers.  I figured I'd suck it up as it was better for our team.  After three years, I was told I made a mistake on her calendar and I had 30-45 days in which if I made ONE SINGLE MISTAKE, I would be out.  I didn't think this was fair and I got HR involved who treated me somewhat fairly but I was going against a very smart, valued middle manager so I had to go.  I thought if my boss was no longer happy with me or it simply wasn't working anymore that she could tell me like an adult and allow me the opportunity to find another job within the organization but that didn't happen.  I had great interviews in other departments because I loved TIAA and really wanted to stay but somehow I never got the job even when I was overqualified.  I'm not suggesting that anyone did anything to prevent me from finding another job within the organization but it seemed odd to me and the other admin who recommended me for the position.  

I loved TIAA and leaving there was the worst feeling I've ever had.  I simply had an unfair, control freak of a manager who was impossible to please and just plain mean to me.  I sucked it up for almost four years because I wanted to be at TIAA but this woman was a bad bad bad manager."

Veiled as collaboration when even if that is the goal it is clear it is about headcount also so they should just be honest. Managers are not leaders and do not mentor or teach to bring people along. If you aren’t already doing what should be done you get a bad review and a bad bonus and belittled. To lose entire teams who could commute to NYC or Boston but are told to move to Charlotte is ridiculous. Maybe there will finally be opportunities for those that are left to move into new roles and add some growth opportunities to their resume but it is doubtful- they will assign roles regardless of interest or skill set or development opportunities because they don’t care and have a mess to fix.

It became evident pretty quickly that I made a terrible decision accepting an offer of employment.  

First of all, I've had four managers in the past 10 months. The turn over and the amount of organizational restructuring is mind boggling. What further blows my mind is that my current manager was fired two years ago and recently brought back. 

Second, the company recently rescinded its work from home program and started a quiet ""strategic"" head count reduction. Discontinuing the work from home program not only results in the loss of valuable talent, but it also chips away at what little work life balance there was to begin with.  

Third, the data is terrible. I was hired to work with data, but what I actually do in-between my secretarial duties is manipulate garbage.  You will not find a single source of truth anywhere. Instead we have multiple teams reporting the ""same"" metric that never matches. 

Fourth, office politics and passive aggressive behavior run rampant.  If someone has an issue with you or your work, you'll find out about it in a group setting via some sort passive aggressive comment or when the bus is backing over you.

In a poorly veiled attempt to cut costs, TIAA is bringing is eliminating its flexible work-from-home benefit.  The first to go are those who are working-from-home on a full-time basis.  Entire teams are being eliminated solely based on their location.  If you cannot report to the hub to which you have been assigned, then you are forced to take a package.  In addition, should you choose to relocate to your newly assigned hub, there is no guarantee that your position won’t be eliminated in the near future, so there’s no real incentive for you to relocate.

Morale is at an all-time low.  Forget getting any work done between now and perhaps till the first quarter of next year.  Good, productive workers are being eliminated based solely on their location.  Who thought of this???  

Next are those who are part-time work-from-home.  While these people do have an assigned office, what is happening now is that their function is being relocated to a new hub.  

Again, absolutely no job-security and assignments seem arbitrary.

What’s more, the exceptions they granted for those who could not relocate seem extremely random or based on who you report to.  Apparently, those who work for people in the C-Suite and upper management were given an exception and not required to relocate.  Unbelievable.

When I first started working with the company it had a great reputation. However, much of that has changed over the last few years. Senior leadership is visibly incompetent and employees have suffered countless re-orgs and ""strategic"" layoffs. Instead of natural, honest downsizing, they have chosen to create voluntary job elimination programs. First was the VRP (Voluntary Retirement Package) and now, we have Voluntary Separation Package for remote workers. Who lays off remote staff in 2019??? Some of our best people are being eliminated because a few people in leadership think that the future is working in an office (LOL). This will not go well for TIAA. I suspect that they think they can protect themselves from negative press by forcing people to sign a legal document if they choose the package. The only problem is, employees have until SEPTEMBER to receive severance.

2) USA guys come to office at 9am and leave by 5pm. But they expect Indians to work from 11am to 9:30 pm from office and then upto 1am from home. Because someone has to adjust. ( No pay is given for overtime, as it is 'expected' from us Indians ). Very difficult to adjust if you are a working woman.

Individuals are great, there is a lot of diversity and the company truly is mission-driven. Paid volunteer hours are a great benefit that tie into the mission.","The incessant reorgs are bad for morale and momentum. I am on my sixth manager and third department in just four years. No amount  of ""change management"" training makes up for that kind of inconsistency, at some point you have to accept that it's the change creators that are the problem - not people's hesitance to accept the change.
Non-Charlotte and New York employees are not given equal opportunities for advancement. When HR tells you that you won't be considered for a role (that does not require on-site presence) because you aren't located in one of two offices (out of nearly 200 TIAA offices), you have a problem. People are having to move out rather than up.
The work from home flexibility has been so important for work-life balance, however they are eliminating that benefit. Work from home is going away in favor of ""collaborative"" environments... when was the last time one of the people making these decisions had to sit in the middle of a cube farm and try to get work done? People literally tethered to their computers by noise-cancelling headphones isn't going to create the energetic, collaborative environment you think it is. It's going to wear people down and likely send them running. That's how you create a culture of ""I work my 40 hours and then I stop caring."""

There is little growth in the hubs where most TIAA employees work. The lack of advancement opportunities often creates hyper-competitive colleagues, as many individuals have spent 5 or 10 years in a particular department waiting for their chance to move up to an entry level management position. Junior managers often then sit in their positions for 5, 10, or 15 years, sometimes the remainder of their careers, and are often bored and disinterested with their own careers. Many employees and managers make lateral transitions to other departments every few years just to do something different. Most employees and managers stay with the company and tolerate the lack of career development and advancement because they are afraid of losing a decent salary, good benefits, and generous PTO. 

Work/life balance largely depends on whether your exempt or non-exempt. Exempt employees often work 45 to 50 hour weeks on a regular basis. Non-exempt employees generally work 40 hour work weeks."

First of All if you have someone who can refer you there then its point to join TIAA GBS its all referral based company dirty politics management all know each other they took people whom they know and people who come through hard work and rigorous tough interview process have no value.
You will be always put down will be given low rating if you argue then you can certainly go to CEO of company they say its open door policy and CEO is approachable like any other local school or college principal.
If you goto upper management you will be given PIP and low rating then they wont give you any variable and increment for the year and suggest some improvement plans and harass ypu like anything and behave like they have saved your job!
Such a worst organization for anyone with above 10 year experience to join! I would recommend anyone not to fall into complication by getting heavy pay package which they offer because once you in your life will be screwed.

There are a lot of really good people at TIAA, and the Core Values are more than something just on a piece of paper. There is a good spirit of caring for others in the company and especially caring about their customers.

I would come back to TIAA for the right position and in the right area of the business.","There could be some things done about some of the duplication of work across different lines of business. As TIAA has grown through acquisition, they have not always looked at the true cost of leaving some of the business and support organizations in place. They are very slow to integrate these organizations and give them honest assessments and direction. TIAA also has some areas where they operate in silos that could be easily broken down. Some staff have been there for decades and are very protective and resistant to change that would broaden their horizons. It causes very good people to not take the opportunities for advancement because they believe that it will put their career at risk. This too could be addressed, although it's a much harder issue to tackle.  As with any organization, there are some areas where work/life balance could be addressed. If you are tracking how many hours people work, then look at those who are working far too much and talk to them about why they have to work so many hours."

Selling TIAA products is the only thing that matters and all you are judged on, whether or not it is right for the client.  Unethical sales practices such as misleading and outright lying to the client or withholding material information are not only condoned but forced; if you refuse to sell the way they insist, you will be managed out. Management states that they hear us and will change but, other than small cosmetic changes, the culture still remains one of fear and intimidation. Sales goals that increase 20-50% every year as your client book gets larger and larger but support gets cut every year as well so you must do more with less. 
Ultimately, you are nothing but a number:your percent to quota.  If you ever fall even slightly below 100%=you are put on performance plans and on the road to being fired, not given support to effectively do your job. 
If you are a minority, your chances of success diminish as the best leads and opportunities and training are given to white males while you get bombarded with service issues and clients that need a ton of handholding but no sales opportunity. The company has been actively seeking to hire more minorities over the last few years and I think this may be due to several discrimination lawsuits that emerged over the last 4 years.  There was a recent article in the New York Times in October 2017 exposing much of the revenue-driven sales practices to the public but we were told by management to “deny,deny,deny” when our clients asked us questions although most of the details around the sales practices and culture were true."

My manager didn’t have the first clue on how to run a project and used an outdated matrix - anything that deviated from that was wrong, even if the client was made happy and things were done on time and on budget.  It really made for a backwards environment where colleagues would say to do things one way and not tell management and management would be happy if they never found out.  If they did find out, all hell would break loose even if it had been done that way 100 times before, just because it didn’t fit inside this antiquated project matrix.

Top Management people are resigning back to back in just a quarter, and the management is failing in all possible aspects of keeping their employees intact or confident.
The Management of this firm has failed to perform in every single scenario of BCP or city level panic event, where employees were called down to the office early in the morning to perform the BAU, but were held back in the office till late night without any communication or proper drops back to home given. Most of the employees in those situations, take up the matter in their own hands and risk their lives by getting out on the street and road to reach their family and closed ones. 
The policies in this firm, be it a compliance related, finance related, reimbursement related or investment related is so dull and unclear, people have to really go around looking for that ONE right person who might have some decent knowledge on the topic. 
Cafeteria - Probably that's the biggest let down this firm could have brought to its employees. The least expensive food item to be served starts with a tag price of INR 30, and yet the quality of the food is simply unbearable. The menu has not been revised in the past year and the menu itself is like 10 items. As if nothing fancy or new is to be welcomed here, along with multiple cases of cockroach or some bug being found in the food (as if that was to bring the change in taste!!?)
This eventually leads people of TIAA to use the Godrej canteens, which are no less expensive but at least serve the good quality tasty food with some dignity. ( You can literally find most of the HR, PMO and leadership team having their lunch in these Godrej cafeterias). 
From work perspective, yes they have succeeded in bringing the work from the US to India, but they seem to have forgotten the permission and authority to do that work. Every single major or minor thing has to go through the US counterparts, and they themselves are an entirely different story altogether.

In short, if I may say- DO NOT JOIN!

They promote individuals that bully employees and don’t seem to care about developing their direct reports. They were once the ‘darling’ of pension because of their noble mission, but now they seem to be focused on meaningless details that don’t benefit the clients that they serve. The managers that make decisions are so far removed from the work that the recommendations that they offer on workflow improvements serve as obstacles and do not advance the mission of the organization. The middle managers enforcing the rules have a ‘submit and don’t ask questions mentality’ and there is not room for the free flow of ideas.

1480,,Sr. Lead Manager,2017-09-23,4.0,Anonymous Employee,"TIAA is a very good company to work for. It seems to have a very structured and communicated review process and the promoted company culture is something that is extremely hard to locate in the Financial Services sector. 

-Many programs and focus to promote ethical and inclusive environment from top to bottom. 
-Benefits are second to none in Financial Services. (or any other sector)
-Upper Management genuinely cares about, promotes, funds and enforces ethical behavior.
-Very secure environment. PII and all other forms of data are extremely secure and monitored by a world class, well-funded and customer-focused goal of securing the networks, data, and all forms of access from both internal users that do not require the access and external sources that try to obtain that data.
-Lots of opportunity for employees to learn about all areas both within and outside of their core competencies and change their career while staying inside the same company.
-Tons of great employees that want to help each other and the company to succeed while keeping the customer first.
-Work/Life balance is very good in many areas. (Not all, but most)","As with many larger organizations (17k+ employees/contract workers and many departments and subsidiaries), TIAA has some groups that are entrenched in legacy management style and require a fresh approach. 
-Security can sometimes be detrimental to getting things done in an expeditious manner. (To be fair, it is more important to secure the environment than to push things through that may compromise the security of the data to internal staff)
-Payroll is incapable of handling any type of large changes and outsources almost everything, including fielding of mistakes, to their third party provider. Would recommend a full replacement of Payroll from top-down and ask some of the contract workers that have multi-company experience for their input. There's more recurring mistakes due to incompetent senior and middle Payroll management and overworked base level staff. I've worked in companies 10 times the size of TIAA that had 10% of the mistakes per employee as TIAA Payroll, and that is being generous.
-Human resources is overwhelmed sometimes, especially when there are larger influxes of new staff due to acquisitions.
-Some of lower and middle management seem to be resistant to changing the way that they operate and have become complacent in their responsibilities to their staff. 
-Like many larger organizations, TIAA is slow to implement new technology initiatives. This is not due to the security of the initiatives, it is because many of the teams are protecting the way that they have traditionally followed somewhat antiquated processes. A more expeditious process should be developed and implemented to take things from idea to implementation that doesn't take 6-18 months. Also, consolidation of toolsets that are not redundant and costly would help. IT seems to implement tools/applications and leave the tools that were supposed to be replaced for years after they should be decommissioned.
-Work/Life balance is an issue in some specific roles within certain areas, including some IT and Payroll positions."

He is not from the gang of friends in the management group. Very approachable. But, management under him is full of friends who are working together since last 15-20 years.
One more pro is a work life balance.","1. No quality work.
2. Projects are driven completely from US team and that too by contingent workers.
3. Manager are only for micro management and 0% help from project perspective.
4. Manager doesn't even know your project name and what work you are doing. Too much of micro management on a daily basis like your entry and exit time, how much time you are away form Desk instead of asking about project work.
5. Higher management is not approachable, they don't listen to you and ask you to talk with your immediate manager and get it sorted. The reason you want to talk with higher management is because you have concern with your immediate manager. So you left with no option as no one wants to listen to your concerns.
6. Directors says in front of whole group that I don't have much work. It's shocking to hear such words from Director level person and gives bad impression.
7. Review written on 9th July which looks like review on Manager and not doesn't mentioned any pros or cons about company. 
8. Focus is on hiring only and not on getting quality work for the resource who are already on job.

Employees are expected to attend late night calls and work on weekends. Meetings/calls are scheduled on a whim of upper management. Terrible work load and unreasonable expectations in some projects.
2. No or minimum work from home facility. In some projects, managers have completely prohibited it.
3. Projects are not assigned as per experience/skills level. Several people I know are assigned with work that is not suitable to their work profile.
4. Absolute chaos on management level. No defined processes, no availability of documents, no established benchmarks. For every little thing, you need to run from pillar to post.
5. Bad quality cafeteria food.

Their pay is far above industry average for similar positions. This is because they aren't publicly traded and aren't beholden to the almighty dollar.

Career mobility inside can be slow and frustrating (but not always).  There are lots of different functioning divisions that aren't well integrated with each other.

They were behind in technology when I got there (being a millenial I am all about tech and efficiency) and at first there were like 25 different programs used in this position, most of which were 5-10 years old or more.

Like Google culture is best in product companies, I find TIAA GBS has best culture in Captive.

My Manager has nearly 60 staffs directly to report to him. He does not have cabin. He works from desk like us. 

He speak with everyone in-person, remembers their projects and their deliverables. Also, he himself organizes cross team application demo session in his weekly meeting with us, to give a platform for staffs to showcase their work and others to learn about thos apps

He is also busy managing multiple teams and initiatives. I have seen, everyday so many staffs approach to him at his desk to speak and he immediately stops his work, always smiles at them, asks them to seat, and listens to them, and guides and helps them. I personally learned from observing him how to build rapport and value employees without giving salary raise or rewards.

Recently I had my performance review with him. He set context of open two ways dialogue, explained objective of discussion, and emphasized partnership apporach in resolving issues if any that comes during review. Then, most time, he let me speak starting with my self-appraisal! As always, he was excellent at listening to me, open to different views, and to my surprise he remembered more than me about good deliverables I have contributed in my 08 months here! 

He took interest to see what I enjoy at work in addition to my core development work. Then, suggested initiatives in organization where I can meet like minded people and have win-win for myself and at GBS.

He has almost 18 years experiene, twice than my expeirence. However, when speaks with us, he is ground to earth and treats us as important people (not as important subordinates, but as talented human beings). When my wife was not well, he asked me whether I need sometime off to take care of my wife and family.","None. GBS is new in India location for less than a year.

1551,,Business Analyst,2017-06-06,4.0,Business Analyst,I've been here for a few years now and one of the greatest things that I love about this company is its diversity. There is something here no matter your race or sexual orientation. They care about the community and it's employees. There is a great bonus structure.,"Some of the cons would include the raises. The raises aren't that great and depending up on the department that you are in, there doesn't seem to be much opportunity for growth."
1552,,Amazing experience,2017-06-01,5.0,Head of Talent Acquisition,Value driven organisation and values its employees. Management really cares for you and helps you at every step.

1553,,Ok place,2017-05-26,3.0,Senior Service Representative,Best time off and tuition benefits around comparably.,Company pays for education but will mostly hire outside candidates.

Still some great people, and the building is nice.","Everything went downhill quickly after reorg of 11/2013. Senior management tries to micromanage everything instead of moving forward. They will find out what you want for your career and go out of their way to close that door for you to make you feel like you aren't important.  I thought I was the only one this kept happening to until I talked to others. It's such a weird and ridiculous tactic. 
They will also find ways to not pay for exams and exam materials!!!!"
1555,,"Great Company, Nice People - Bureaucratic and slow moving",2017-05-26,4.0,Senior Talent Management Consultant,"- Amazing benefits, bonus is almost guaranteed unless you really screw up, retirement account AND a 401k match (if over 30 you get 12% from the company if you put in 3%). PTO is around 25 days or more. Health insurance with a very low deductible.
- I work with an amazing team of very talented and bright individuals. Some of the brightest people that I have ever worked with in my career, which in turn causes you to step up.
- Great work/life balance, very liberal work from home policy as long as you get things done and knock out high quality projects, thats all that matters at the end of the day. No requirement to just be in the office or work because you are expected to put in the hours.","-The company is very bureaucratic and is slow moving. It is crushing under the weight of its own aversion to risk and focus on internal processes rather than the customer. 
-Any enterprise project that gets off the ground has to go through months of pitching it to leaders, toll gate processes, and selling to everyone (consensus driven organization), and any one member of the HR leadership team can veto a project and bury it.  
- Get ready to spend months out of your year working on PowerPoint slide decks that will be revised dozens of times."
1556,,Sr Marketing Manager,2017-05-26,2.0,Anonymous Employee,Personally- the flexibility of working from home,"- Professionally- Too geographically diverse and too many people working from home / remote. It will take 3 days to track someone down to get an answer for a 30 second question...  Very difficult to execute.
- Pay is well below market value
- Weak mid / upper management - flip flopping on strategy every two years.
- Still stuck in non-profit mindset. Difficult to compete against the Fidelity's and Schwab's of the world when the back office tech and ops is so old.
- Still ""us vs them"" b/t institutional and retail sides of org."

It is not even sure who it is: is it TIAA or Nuveen?  There have been 2 multi-million ""re-brandings"" within 9 months.
TIAA has made a series of over-priced, poorly thought out acquisitions and is having serious issues in incorporating these new businesses.
Managers are too focused on ""managing up"" rather than on managing their departments and their employees.
Despite being a non-profit with the motto ""For the Greater Good"", inside the organization it is as mean spirited as any for profit on Wall Street.
Despite talk of promoting inclusivity, there is a still an element of 'bro"" culture that rules.
The commitment to diversity and inclusion is great, but it has resulted in a very slow, cumbersome and complicated hiring process.
Too much staff turnover and instability.

Few positions to move into in So Cal other than Wealth Management. Depending on your director they can make your life great or a living hell. 
There are a lot of old school employees who don't necessarily like change so change in policy can take a while to make happen. System integration is also a real problem in that FC's rely heavily on their Wealth Manager teammates to ensure they earn credit on referred sales. But many Wealth Managers have idea how to do that. So many sales can get lost unless you are really on top of things. The way Wealth Managers and FC's get compensated is totally different.

TIAA has one of the most toxic cultures a company can have. This USED to be a great company to work for--until the last 5 years or so. Then the layoffs started en masse, and nothing has been the same since. I understand that occasionally, layoffs are necessary--but not as a first line of defense against rising expenses, and NOT as a mechanism for giving other people bigger titles and more money to do the same job. EVERY time a layoff is announced, not far behind is an announcement of promotions. So one person loses their job so another person can be ""promoted"" from Director to Sr. Director to do the same job they had been doing. And the cycle goes on and on--more and more layoffs and more and more promotions, and they wonder why they can't get their expenses under control. 

I was with the company for 23 years, so getting laid off with a generous severance package was the best thing that could have happened to me. But the hypocrisy that runs rampant through this company is disgusting.

Oh, and if you're not located in Charlotte, you can forget about the company actually caring about anything that matters to you as an employee.

- Great retirement benefits
- Outstanding work-life balance (1 day/week work from home)","- Your experience working in the division is largely determined by whether or not you have a good manager. Vastly different cultures and work-life balances between not only Audit Teams, but office locations.
- More leadership presence in Charlotte = more visibility = Charlotte employees move up faster
- Leadership in NY is totally invisible. Only 2 Director+ Level folks located in NY and they're in their own little worlds.
- Extremely top heavy; nobody above the Manager Level ever leaves. Division just churns and burns Staff and Senior Auditors who hit career roadblocks and inevitably leave within 1-3 years.
- In looking for efficiencies, they are very penny wise and pound foolish. Bonuses are nice but base salaries in NY lag the market and in general, yearly raises barely pace inflation. Puts employees at a constant flight-risk for more money and ends up costing the firm exponentially more in hiring, onboarding, and training replacements."

My boss told me the reason this happened was I had been ""off"" lately, however, there was no discussion about this prior.  I later found out that almost the entire team of people I had worked with did not have their contracts renewed or they were let go, including some of the upper management.

The leads are all done in house and there is no prospecting allowed. You are assigned random clients with account balance of 250k or more in their retirement from a huge geographic area. They limit the clients they give and most have no intention or capability of doing business. It seems most wealth managers last about 18 months which was the case with me.

I love my coworkers, some are now great friends.  Contrary to other reviews, I've never had a problem with my direct managers.  They're as hard working as the WMAs.  TIAA's overall culture and values are wonderful.  I still have hope for this place.","This job is not consistent across the country.  Depending on regional upper management, this job can be a joy or your constant nightmare.  The attitude of the person at the top rains down on everyone below them, so if you have a regional director that has a chip on their shoulder, is never satisfied and wants more, more, more, you will constantly be threatened with performance improvement plans (PIPs) for any possible thing you can imagine: lack of asset growth, bad attitude, low activity, etc., etc., etc.  Our poor direct managers are reduced to puppets repeating the threatening messages from regional upper management, and forced to maintain spreadsheets of useless metrics on their WMAs.  Work life balance is gone because quantity of meetings, quantity of notes, quantity of product discussions, is more important than quality.  

Oh, and operations is decades behind the rest of the industry.  WMAs, who are supposed to focus on sales and being in front of clients, spend HOURS of our day checking and fixing the mistakes of support and operations staff that are inadequately trained and do not feel any accountability for their actions, partially because they are not made to feel part of the team.  The client experience suffers as a result.  I am embarrassed at least once a day."

All of that goes out the window when you walk into the doors of TIAA.  The emphasis is on serving clients best interests.  There is no incentive to push certain investments or products.

Redundant systems and micro-managing mean that way too much time is spent meeting the demands of big brother (vs. the job that you are actually hired to do).

They would be much better off hiring talented professionals and giving them a little reign to customize their own practice management, vs. the current approach of breathing down your neck and zero autonomy"
1837,,WMA,2016-04-21,2.0,Wealth Management Advisor,"Great clients, great products, great co-workers, a lot of resources.  Initial salary  for the first year is fair.  Plenty of time off.  Training is above what most companies provide.","Responsibilities increase, sales goals increases, number of clients increase, expectations increase, and stress increase.  Life work balance decrease, and resources decrease.  One support staff is assigned to multiple advisors. Administrative Assistants do very little to help the advisor.  Administrative staff can not do paperwork, can not answer any questions for clients and are constantly being utilized by management for pet projects that do not contribute to the bottom line. Everything is measured and analyzed.   From how many meetings you had to how many calls you made, to what products you presented, to how long it took to close the sale.  These metrics are then shared with you at your 1 on 1 with your manager.  1 on 1's are the least productive or inspiring meetings held.  Depending on your manager, it is common for everything to be negative.  Rarely are sales wins celebrated, and if you are lucky to be mentioned during the weekly sales call.  Be prepared to give a book report on how you achieved the sale. Daily calls are held to help hone your questioning ability.  As a WMA your job is to ask the client a series of questions.  You are not allowed to provide any advice, and are limited on what you may say to a client.  You can ask as many questions as you want, but they have to follow a certain sequence and you may only use certain words at certain times. They call this CSP.     Micromanagement is an understatement.  Client interactions are evaluated through observations, and survey's and are highly subjective.  Annual goals seem to be assigned arbitrarily. It is not uncommon for your annual goal to increase by 70% the following year. Goals are the same across the board for a certain training class. Regardless of your region or what your production was the following year.  Management does not have a defined role, and seems to be redundant from the director and managing director. Overall this company does not seem to know where it is headed.  Does it want to be an RIA or Wirehouse?  Is it an insurance and annuity company or a comprehensive financial planning company?   Given the inability for their advisors to actually advise the client or provide more then a handful of products. Then the argument could be made that it is just an insurance company masquerading around as an investment company.  The mutual funds have won several awards and are very competitive expense wise, but then again so are other companies.  This may not be a the best career choice for experienced advisors.  If you are established and are currently   making more than 100k a year then I would suggest staying where you are.  If you would like to be micromanaged, have someone sit in on your meetings with clients, and critique every word you said.  Measure every mundane daily activity and assign some number or percentage to it.  Have eight different people ask you about the status of sale, and have to report to eight different people on a daily basis.  Then you will thrive here."

1873,,Wealth Management Advisor,2016-02-29,1.0,Wealth Management Advisor,"Great Co-workers, Salary, and Retirement Benefits","Everything else.  You will have absolutely no automony in how you choose to interact with clients.  From your very first day on the job, they will force you to learn an aggressive sales technique which is designed to use behavioral psychology to get clients to ""self-realize"" that they have a problem.  It doesn't matter if you have been a successful advisor elsewhere, you will have to learn and show a competency in utilizing this sales approach through extensive role plays.  Building strong client relationships with your clients is not valued or encouraged.  You will be required to use agendas in every meeting, and will spend 75% of your day documenting all aspects of your interactions with clients in an overly complex CRM.  After your meetings, you will be required to upload your agenda, complete suitability, type a 14 page client profile, enter a signed risk tolerance questionnaire, document that you delivered your advisor bio, document outside assets uncovered, upload client statements, and type comprehensive meeting notes for every interaction.  If you are fortunate to bring assets into the firm, you will deal with a back office that is completely incompetent in processing the business you are trying to bring in, and in many cases is outsourced to other countries to reduce costs.  I have gotten e-mails from these individuals that are nearly impossible to even comprehend.  It appears that they are written by a kindergartner.  They will NIGO nearly everything you send, and make up the rules as they go.  And most incredibly, the operations people are treated in a way that makes you feel inferior to them.  For example, if you forget to upload a client statement (required) for a financial plan, a terse e-mail will be sent directly to your regional director to chastise you for not following company policy.  Finally, if you are lucky enough to actually get the money over, you will spend weeks begging operations people to give you ""credit"" for the sale.  You do not automatically receive credit for deposits clients send in, even after you have worked with them for many years.  You will have to ask everyone to please notify you first before sending any money so you can enter an ""opportunity"" to receive credit.  

Other aspects of this job that will make you miserable include having metrics to track every single aspect of what you do.  Included in this are assets brought in, meetings held, retention of assets, your pipeline, how many referrals to other departments you make, phone calls you made to unengaged clients, client survey results, how many different products you utilized,  etc.  These metrics will be used as the ""stick"" in mandatory meetings that are held every week.  It won't matter if you have brought in the most assets in your office.  They just find something else to show you how much more productive you could be if you just did MORE.  

Its almost hard to describe just how miserable a working environment this place can be.  The company culture is one where they are constantly inundating you with messages of ""living our core values of putting the client first.""  You will hear this almost daily.  However, what this means is that all of your clients outside assets should be transferred into managed money.  Even their existing low cost retirement plans where they are paying 25-50 BPS should be transferred into managed money where they will pay 100-175 BPS.  It will be suggested that this is the best interests of the client and ""puts them in a better place"".  Now I understand that this isn't the most reprehensible thing in the world as all financial firms are looking to annuitize assets, however, the managed account program has significantly underperformed and is not tactical in any way.  There is very little management of the portfolio that even takes place, with the exception of occasional rebalancing.  It is simply a way to increase revenues for the firm while hiding behind ""core values"".  I've never seen one that has outperformed any comparable index.  

Finally, I must also warn you that various areas of the company act as silos and there is little to no communication between them.  Moving money into and out of the various products is cumbersome in that even if they have POA setup on their managed account, for example, this isn't recognized by the annuity division.  You and your support staff will constantly be trying to transfer money into and out of accounts and having to ask clients to send you yet another voided check because ""this division of TIAA is separate from that one.""  It creates a terrible client experience and one that makes your clients very hesitant to transact business with you, much less referring you to others.  

Bottom line is that every single advisor in my office is somewhere between miserable and barely tolerating their job."

First the firm provides a very generous base salary from the day you start working for them. What firm provides close to a six figure salary  starting on day one when you haven't begun any production? Also the individuals who complain about having to hit sales goals or that this job is a sales job and was mislead are you kidding me? What financial advisor job is not a sales job? Whether you are working on your own or at a financial firm your goal is to always sell to the client that the financial plan you deliver will provide them with financial security. I feel those who complain about the sales aspect just don't want to sell anything period and are making excuses for their failure. Why would this firm want to put you in a position to fail when they invest so much time and money into your success. If you treat this job where meeting in front of clients and motivating them to take action is imperative you will succeed, however if you think just because you have a nice salary and can do minim effort because of this income you will fail.",I do have to admit that training needs to improve for the new advisor but with the mentor program new advisors can learn quickly from tenure advisors on how to succeed. Also I do admit that the process they want you to follow can be to cumbersome and unnecessarily time consuming

While they do pay decent, it would be nice if they paid you the same as they hire new people for. A new person may make 5-8k more than you do. Expect 1-2k average as a raise per year, if that.

The word is on the street is that this company is losing more and more plans to other providers and that their advisors are running out of clients to peddle their worthless managed product to. If you are a financial professional that prides yourself on your work ethic, integrity and ability to serve clients than look elsewhere. Regardless of what they are promising you it is not worth it. Even if you are in need of something temporary find someplace else. The number of negative reviews on this site speak volumes as to the ineptitude of this firm and no amount of explaining or enticements by current employees will replace your integrity or sanity if you decide to work here."

1889,,A soul crushing hell hole,2016-02-15,1.0,,"I had a short commute. Since there is a twenty word minimum for this field, that's all I can think of.","If you look at reviews from other areas within the company, the common theme is that the systems are antiquated.  If you work in IT, and aren't of a particular ethnic background, then you know how messed up things are. 
First, let's talk about the former CTO. All her town-hall meetings contained nothing but fluff, and she couldn't wait to bolt and let others handle the real topics. How she moved up the ranks is beyond me, and really is an indictment of the very top layers of this company. 
Then they replaced her with another fellow, and belongs to a special ethnic group within TIAA's IT area. Of course, those people are hands off. 
When I first joined, I saw managers there that survived 10, 15, 20 and in one case 30 years. My first thought was ""wow.. this place must be great"" only to realize that these managers didn't have the skill-set to flip burgers, let alone be managers in an IT department.
I'll explain through 2 stories how dysfunctional this place was. My first manager , I had a 1:1 with him, and of course, everything I did sucked.  I was a director in a previous company, but to him  I was a screw-off because I took a relaxed attitude towards a number of high-visibility projects. I've done the work countless times in the past, so I had complete control of all aspects of the project, which, because of his total lack of skills, perceived this as me not caring.  He would continuously threaten the group that we were going to lose our jobs,  which leads me to question: how does someone like that survive that long, and what does it say about the company's  ""ethics""  that they claim they hold in such high regard ?
Well, this fellow was replaced by another guy who was supposedly an author and brought in from one of his buddies. As it turns of, he authored some book on some deprecated features of a software stack we were using.  How he was an author is a complete mystery because his emails were so poor and disjointed, there was no possible way he could have penned a single paragraph of anything. In one years time, I literally spoke to him (with actual words) about 5 times.  This gent was then given choice projects and he brought to his team all his favorites.  So, in summary, the cons of this place are many. From the hypocrisy of upper management regarding ""Ethics"", to favoritism and out-right discrimination within IT (just look at the ethnic make-up of IT),  working at TIAA was hands-down the worst place I've worked for."

However, this company takes it to an entirely new level and to the point where it is starting to cause some serious damage.  The multiple layers of poorly trained and incompetent middle managers not only create a stifling and frustrating culture but an inordinate amount of inefficiency – a recipe for disaster given the number of headwinds and changing trends enveloping the financial services industry.  There is no clear sense of what the company stands for:  certainly not for their clients, where any proactive service and communications face daunting impediments from lack of basic resources and marginally empowered compliance minions; or for the employees, given the dreary and threadbare mainly suburban office environments (counter to industry trends of establishing and maintaining locations in urban and downtown areas) and well below industry compensation levels and benefits particularly for those in the asset management areas.  More worrisome, senior management has no consistent or coherent plan on how to grow the company, despite the empty inspirational messages they regularly rain down on the masses.  What seems to be the top priority is keeping operating costs firm wide as low as possible, not only in aforementioned employee training and retention, compensation (excluding of course the top officers), and office space, but critically, for IT, both internal and external.  While competitors heavily invest in their client and employee based IT systems, TIAA continues to operate on shockingly inferior and out dated technology across all facets of the firm. They have underinvested in technology for so long, there is the sense internally they are falling further and further behind their peers particularly since Vanguard and Fidelity continue to forge ahead.  Areas that have been identified as growth businesses, including institutional and private asset management, are starved for resources and led by former bank bureaucrats who have no investment management experience or knowledge.  Bottom line is that this is not a fun place to work; is frustratingly slow and inefficient, and is under attack from better managed companies with a defined culture and well articulated growth plan."

Other teams/departments may be much different. I was unhappy working there - yet making great money and had great benefits. Very poor management.

While certain divisions within the firm are respected and actually a good place to work, the Wealth Management Group or IAS, is not one of them.  Work as a Wealth Management Advisor (WMA) at your own peril, and only if you have no other options and need a job, especially true of the Midwest region.  I have never worked for a more deceitful and unethical group in my life.  Management is widely incompetent and has turned the role into a “Boiler Room” type of operation focused on pushing their own managed product at the expense of their institutional clients.  They manage by fear, intimidation, and constantly hang the threat of termination over your head.  You’ll also be micro-managed and treated as a child every step of the way.  In addition, the company’s antiquated technology and inept operations are ongoing internal jokes.  It’s not a matter of if something will mess up but by how much.  

If you value a clean U-4, then this is not the place. WMAs are treated as pieces of meat and management has no problem with tossing you aside or screwing with your bonuses as they see fit.

This is a terrible organization. They do not tell you the truth in the interview process, so let me tell you the truth. You will not be advising anyone. You will be gathering statements, doing a LOT of Data entry and then you will be manipulating the fears and insecurities of college professors so they will open an individually managed account that has most of the same funds as their employer plan, but another 125bps  layer of fees for TIAA.
If you don't sell enough of the managed accounts, it won't matter if you are at your asset growth goal or if you've done the right thing by the client, you'll be put on a performance improvement plan and either forced to resign voluntarily or terminated for some fictitious reason that will follow you on your U5 forever. That IS the way they roll in IAS. There were 70 advisors in my region when I started. 18 months later, 8 had been terminated and 34 resigned under pressure or out of sheer frustration. They also pay their discretionary bonus and earned commissions only once a year. They hold discretionary bonuses over your head for everything. For example if you don't transfer all of your personal accounts including your spouses  individual accounts, guess what? No bonus. If you aren't the bosses favorite and the division is below revenue goal by summertime and you have a large earned commision...they are not above auditing all your data entries and finding any reason to terminate you and keep those big commissions.

Additionally, it seems that managers and directors fear repercussions for firing employees.

The company's motto used to be ""For the Greater Good.""  (First hint: not yours.)","Like the communist party, party hacks come first.  Middle management hands it down to lower management.  Relentlessly.  Then ... to the people who do the work in the field.  Threatening job security.  Working pain points.  Overdosed on stupid pills.  Overworking everyone for lack of computer integration but no lack of managerial screw ups. 

      TIAA-Cref rightly deserves its past reputation as a good retirement provider for non-profit institutions.  But a surge of managerial greed since I started three years ago has now lead to CYA and whatever it takes!  And what used to be for the Greater Good is sadly a retired slogan.  By the way, clients are left behind to come in second-last.

      TIAA-Cref's low-level management is rapidly metastasizing with fear that it can't overcome its legacy of latency.  It's going to die with its wonderful (but aging) clientele. This insurance agency won't escape its demise.  A dim-witted dopiness from zombie management ensures it.  They'll remain their worst enemy because they start by being yours.

       Don't be lulled by starting salaries or descriptions of generous benefits.  It's the false voice of managers after they've traded away their lives.  During my three years, I never worked harder in a 30 year-career or earned less to make impossible sales goals to earn bonuses just for managers.   TIAA-Cref was consistently unreasonable, patronizing and cheap!

Frankly, I think executive pay is far too high as detailed on the company's website.

Almost 100 years later, this service mentality persists among all the employees here. TIAA-CREF is unique among financial services firms in NYC in that there really are no mean-spirited people. It is a remarkably stable company with advantages that are unreplicable in the marketplace ensuring it will be around for a long time to come. Managers are genuinely interested in your career growth and there is tremendous effort placed in making sure this is a great place to work. Employees are encouraged to take all of their PTO every year (which is a lot), as well as when I had my child, I took my full paternity leave of two weeks and actually got questioned if I had enough time off. This spirit actually inspires people to give more of themselves to the company, and those that can manage the unique culture become intensely loyal to the firm with many people having very long careers.","The organization is very bureaucratic and consensus driven such that it can take a long time to get things done. Similarly, it has grown very large which results in overlapping teams in different departments pursuing the same thing, often in conflict with each other. Individuals generally avoid taking personal accountability (which is ironic because it is one of our values) to spread blame for things not going well among as many people as possible. The is a big logjam of middle managers who appear to have first priority for anything approaching a senior level job, which limits career opportunities up to a certain point. I will say that there are initiatives underway to address all of these issues, but whether or not they work remains to be seen."

work from home 
old folks (who been here forever)","As it goes with every big company, it really all comes to your department, your team, and your manager, so let me break each one down...
Strike 1 - Department:
My dept is fairly new. It's getting more recognition, but still new. Because it's trying to make a name for itself, often times that means other departments feel threatened so you start to have this mean-girl culture where the claws come out, esp. when you do what 2 other departments also do but your claim is that you're best at what you do.

Strike 2 - Team:
Most of the team members were old colleagues and knew each other from a previous positions. So they're kinda chummy... but not really. On the surface, everyone is polite but when the doors close, the mask comes off. Internally each group is confused what they're responsible for.. and passive aggressively fight among themselves on who did what, who owns what, who calls what shots (You start to think if there are hidden cameras and if it is soon to be aired on Bravo). Sure you have pockets of normal and nice but those are rare (and won't make for good TV).

Strike 3: Manager aka M.F.H aka Manager From Hell
Oh boy, where do I start?!? By the time I resigned, I was the last man standing, the lone wolf. Now, one would deduce that if a manager can't hold on to any direct reports, there must be something wrong with the manager. Right? right!?!? How can a manager announce to the whole team that you realized one of your new hires was a mistake on his first day when he didn't answer a question to your satisfaction?  That question should have been asked during the interview!! Ok.... I digress. To sum, MFH is an insecure, manipulative, power-tripping, overbearing control freak.  

So after 3 strikes, it's time to get out!! It took me a little over a year to realize how bad this place is. I finally left after 2 years, but it really was 2 years too long. 

My advice to others is to join at your own risk. Everyone is doing to have a different experience and its largely dependent on the above factors (obviously)."

Lied to constantly regarding training , and overall guidance. A new position means no training,no tools to do your job. Any suggestion of better ways to do your job is met with criticism, a trouble maker.  Gate keepers are always hard to remove, and it is no different here. The people who have lasted are bitter ,and just waiting for retirement. Completely sad."

* Very flexible work arrangements
* Outstanding benefits, especially retirement plans
* Collaborative, friendly environment
* Strong commitment to diversity
* Premium on work-life balance","* HR here is a nightmare and that seems to be a fact of life. They are constantly requiring managers to jump through hoops for very basic things, getting new staff on board is a real challenge when you have to work through their bureaucratic processes,there is constant pressure to rein in bonuses and salaries and HR seems obtuse to the realities of the market (and if I am forced to reduce salaries/bonuses to meet revenue targets I will lose some fantastic employees to our competitors). And HR seems completely dense to what the market really would reward, especially in corporate functions
* The bureaucracy here for employees can be really grating. Not sure if anyone is trying to cut through the red tape but it's everywhere and enormously frustrating, slows me down all the time in my job.
* For the largest owner of commercial real estate in the US, the office space is not attractive. It's embarrassing actually, HQ looks like a government office building (ugly carpets and furniture), not a Fortune 100 financial services company.

2127,,Was becoming much more sales focused by the time I left.,2014-11-17,3.0,Associate Wealth Management Advisor,Most of the people that work there are very nice and very helpful.  I worked in a field office so it was nice to know that I could call up people in the headquarters for help with any questions.  They can pay out pretty decent bonuses.,"The wealth management side of the company has become much more sales focused.  When I first started working in the wealth management division of TIAA-CREF in 2007 it was primarily focused on the client experience and by the time I left the main objective was bringing in new assets.  It became a ""what have you done for me lately"" environment and from what I have heard from employees that are still there it has stayed that way with the asset growth goals getting larger and larger every year."
2128,,Enjoying the company..,2014-11-16,4.0,,IT side is always looking for ways to better themselves in the industry.,Let's go of the most knowledgeable team players and unfortunately have to scramble to figure out the system or app works when it goes down.
2129,,Working at TIAA-CREF Investment IT,2014-11-11,3.0,IT Technical Associate,"somewhat Interesting work, business people are nice, benefits are decent (automatic contribution of as much as 18% of base) after 6 month waiting.",In investment management diversity is an issue - promotion policies are strange. Most people are stuck in their roles as not much growth. Bonuses are not that great.   Yearly goals are issued by management and are mostly meaningless.   If you like to stagnate and retire - good place.
2130,,Management needs to cut the old wood,2014-11-01,3.0,Program Manager,"Strong balance sheet, good benefits, some work at home opportunities",Management is stuck in the 70's in both style and expectation.
2131,,Large corporate company with opportunities,2014-10-31,3.0,,"The people at TIAA are very friendly and the hours are manageable and very flexible.  It is a large organization so groups vary widely and if you move among groups, it is almost like starting a new job.  Great place for a person starting their career to get large corporate experience.","TIAA probably has its share of below average performers.  In that sense, they are willing to give people more than a single chance to improve."
2132,,Actions not Words,2014-10-31,3.0,Relationship Manager,"The company has extremely generous benefits.  The retirement plan and vacation days are virtually impossible to beat.  They also pay 50% of your gym membership and depending on your manager, there is a good amount of autonomy.  The pay is okay... nothing to write home about unless you have been there for more than 20 years, or your boss really likes you.","A lot depends on your manager and his/her manager, which can lead to wide disparity.  There are no true metrics for career advancement and salary information is especially secretive, leading to the ability to maintain said disparity.  The good managers often have their hands tied and the bad ones are so busy looking for ways to look better that they take what's good out of you.  It's an endless cycle.  Those who desire career advancement have to hope that someone will eventually give them a chance.  HR practices have enough holes to rival Swiss cheese.  Advancement opportunities seem to be relegated to those from the outside and ""friends"" of those currently in management.  Middle and upper management are out of touch with those actually in the trenches."

2136,,Overall I had a great experience and the benefits are outstanding.,2014-10-19,4.0,,The company and leadership are very ethical and try to remain focused on the customer or participants.,The non-profit status of the company may be the reason the company is not as innovative from a technology perspective. The company has had 3 CIO's in the last 5 years.
2137,,Ups and Downs Over the Course of a 14 Year Career,2014-10-17,3.0,Financial Consultant,"Very good benefits including generous vacation days, company pays 50% of fitness center membership, base salary is good. They offer competitive investments that are not difficult to sell as they generally have good performance and low expenses. In my role I conducted client meetings at colleges/universities and I enjoyed meeting many interesting people and traveling to various parts of the state. I will miss visiting the colleges and meeting with interesting academics.","Metrics for Financial Consultants are difficult to attain. Sales and service goals are unrealistic and so one always feels that they are behind or not measuring up. The company boasts that consultants don't work on commission but the sales goals are set very high and not achieving them results in little or no bonus or salary increase. After dealing with this year after year one becomes jaded. Management is constantly holding conference call meetings to justify their existence. If you meet certain goals they will just raise them by 10% the next year. Unfortunately, in my office, I had to deal with a Director (not a direct report) who was an arrogant bully who, for whatever reason, did not like me and plotted to make me look bad by accusing me of various compliance violations which were either untrue or exaggerated."

Operations areas pay poorly unless you get to a Director level, the investment areas pay much better. They seem to overdo the whole affirmative action thing - minorities have advantages here."
2143,,IT Architect,2014-10-03,4.0,Anonymous Employee,"We eat our own dogfood - The best benefit of working here  is by far the generous, company funded retirement annuity which you are fully vest in after 3 years.  The company contribution rises progressively with your age, maxing out at 13% of salary a year around 50.  They also match 100% on the first three percent of savings in your 401k.  How many companies offer this sort of valuable benefit any more?  Very helpful in building a secure retirement. Anecdotally, TIAA is less ""Dilbert""-like than most companies of this size, though human resources has recently exhibited disturbing trends in the wrong direction.","TIAA is a insurance company.  It is not a high tech firm, or a company that likes to take risks.  Depending on your point of view, this is good or bad. For me, a self described IT Professional, I find it a challenge to feel like I can make a significant contribution since the ""business"" views IT as a just a cost center. The IT folks they hire are smart, but their work efforts are fractured and disorganized due to a lack of organizational maturity.

Too much focus on systems, technology and not enough of products, and their suitable uses.
 Spent most time assisting irrate clients with website access and operations/back office disasters.

Technology is hopelessly outdated, too many different platforms to work with including some dating back to 1970's and 1980's.  Training time was curtailed in an effort to get employees into pipeline quicker, this was a detriment to the employees and to overall productivity.

Variable compensation is adequate. Vacation policies are above industry norm. The 403(b) plan is great.,"Internal opportunities are minimal. Outside hiring is preferred due to perception that new talent has all the answers-they do not. In most cases, EMT leadership is excellent. Unfortunately, it does not translate down to effective senior leadership and/or senior management within departments whose most effective strategy is to create conflict in order to succeed in their own personal agendas.

-Diverse, friendly, supportive staff","-No clear career paths or role definitions.
-Not a lot of opportunity for promotion. The company needs to realize that people do not want to make lateral moves for the entirety of their career. At some point, people need to know that as their skills and knowledge increase and they grow and master new work/tasks/projects, they will be rewarded with a promotion.
-If you do get an elusive promotion, often times it comes with little to no salary increase, which is in stark contrast to prior years when a promotion typically came with a 10% increase. Results in much more responsibility with no financial reward and sometimes no title change.
-Technology is a constant struggle - our site for clients doesn't support versions higher than IE9. Internally we are constantly jumping between Firefox, IE6 and a shell version of IE8.
-Not agile. Very slow to innovate. Always playing catch up to the competition in terms of technology and services.  
-Too many ineffective and dare I say unethical managers/directors, but because they manage up well, they suffer no consequences for the way they treat their employees. 
-In my area, all new upper management are cronies brought in from Fidelity. While it's great to have new blood and new points of view, it's disheartening that there aren't really opportunities for advancement to that level from within.

2176,,A strong vision that gets lost in the details,2014-05-01,3.0,Senior Analyst,"Good benefits, strong values, customer-focused, and the training programs are incredible. I could talk all day about employees that are more than willing to become a mentor or coach, and there are hundreds of classes to help career development.

I've had 8 managers and most of them were very good at their job and are good leaders and coaches. Working with many more managers I could see the same. The company will typically hire the right people for all the jobs.

Most benefits are great like the health insurance, retirement, and paid-time off (minimum of 23 days).","While there is a strong vision at the upper level, they have a false vision of what's truly going on at all levels. There is so much bureaucracy and an over-filled hierarchy that slows progress. Deadlines are continually pushed back as there is much tape to go through. Getting excited about any new technology or process is quickly forgotten in the midst of the challenges. You can see this in everyone's eyes when you tell them about new improvements - they'll just roll their eyes. Throughout this process, the upper management is told that everything is going well when the people lower in the hierarchy see nothing different than business as usual. 

Furthermore, moving around in the company is rather difficult. Positions open and you never hear anything until months later. Typically, the position will never be filled. This has happened at least 20 times (no exaggeration) with me and several other employees. Also, the pay ranges have been restricted and many people haven't seen raises for years, or minimal raises. Many people don't think they're being paid what they're worth."

There is often weirdly worded emails sent with the consequences of not going into the office due to inclement weather. They supposedly follow the ""Lean"" process and use problem solving steps but it is not really used properly. Employees are encouraged to speak up with ideas but are punished as complainers, having a negative attitude or even having their idea stolen if they do. There is a lot of playing favorites that happens with the same employees being chosen constantly for projects and other perks. Management is constantly in meetings trying to come up with new schemes and to justify their existence. Most management has no idea what job functions their direct reports actually do. The computer systems are in great need of improvement. There are still programs on IE6. To do your job properly you must navigate through 4-5 systems for one small issue. They are in the middle of an upgrade but that will take awhile. I think the company has its heart in the right place, but some management really spoil it. The bonus calculation is impossible to understand and I'm a math major; two consultants can be rated the same and have $3-5k difference.

It is a mystery as to how bonuses are determined.  Bonuses (as a % of salary) range from 10% to over 20% for same position, same performance.  Basically, it depends on who likes you, or who doesn't.  Major politics at the very top trickles down to Senior level management and beyond, making it an uncomfortable environment, not to mention unproductive.

I think this is something they are working on, however, but it is something to be aware of if you accept a position with this company.

Having been a monopoly for 75 years of its existence gives TIAA financial stability that few other companies can offer.,"The management is generally self-serving and focused upon self-preservation. The Board at TIAA is way too involved in the business.  Definitely look into that aspect of this employer before accepting a job, The Boards is made up at least 50% of academics who know nothing about running a business. Rather, they make decisions based upon social norming. Meaning that at TIAA they would rather hire/promote a person based upon their race than performance. I have personally heard senior leadership state they want to bend EEO laws so they can avoid hiring White males."
2334,,My experience working at TIAA CREF was interesting.,2012-06-27,3.0,Anonymous Employee,Some of the people you get to know and work with at the company were very fun to work with and not to mention that they were very talented in their given fields.,The cliches were a bit too much at times to deal with.  Also while you had people who were willing to share information to help you achieve a goal there were others who felt threatened by people who are intelligent and willing to go the extra mile to help others.
2335,,Financial Analyst,2012-06-14,5.0,Financial Analyst,"I have been with TIAA CREF for 14 months.  In the time I've been here, I've seen a Senior get promoted to a Manager and a Financial Analyst 2 get promoted to a Senior.  I have also seen 4 people in my area apply for and get jobs in other, non-related, areas of the company.  So I would say that career advancement, in whatever form you're thinking of, is available.

My starting salary was $62k, which is competitive in the marketplace.  There is a great benefits package, including great insurance options, FSA Childcare Reimursement, Health Care Savings, 5% automatic infusion into employees 401k plan, and an additional matching of 3% more for a total of 8% annually contributed by the employer.  There is an onsite wellness center with doctors and nurses, which only cost $5.00 to visit.  TIAA will pay for your 1st Master's Degree as long as it supports the line of work you're in.  There are many more benefits as well.

Different groups have different abilities to work from home.  My group is very flexible and I work from home at least two days every week.  However, my next door cube mate at work is in a different group/area, and they are approved to work from home no more than once a month, and even then the management frowns upon it.  So different areas are different, and I guess the individual experience all depends on the area.

Also, it is very easy to talk to and deal with management.  It is more of a friendly co-worker relationship than a hierarchy that is unreachable by the entry level workers.  From the bottom to the top, everyone is very approachable and friendly.  Very nice atmosphere.

Overall, I would say that I am very pleased at TIAA.  I feel like I am well compensated, have a good work life balance, the opportunity for advancement, etc.","The only con I have seen so far is that when I was hired, I was told that the yearly bonus was typically 10-20% of salary.  However, when my first bonus year rolled around, my bonus was around 5%.  I was told that new employees who were not there an entire year were treated differently when allocating the bonus pool, and that the next year should be on track with what I was told when I interviewed."
