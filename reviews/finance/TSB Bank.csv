134,TSB Bank,Stay Far Away,2021-03-05,1.0,Telephony Customer Service Advisor,"1)Many of the individuals working for the company are lovely people.
2) Work experience on a CV","1)The computer systems are an absolute joke. Barely a day goes by in which something crashes or stops working. The regular ""updates"" always cause more problems than they fix, and yet employees are expected to get on with it without complaint meeting targets at all times. This causes constant anger with customers and as a result daily abuse, particularly over the Internet Banking service. Speaking of abuse, while the business advises they do not tolerate it you will receive A LOT of it because of the constant computer problems, and managers have very little sympathy. Lastly, the business may tell you that the system issues are merely 'teething problems' and that they are finding their feet, except they have never fully worked since being introduced in 2018.
2) The company is completely inflexible with working hours. Even if you have a legitimate reason to move them, they won't do it. Want time off at Christmas with your family? Tough luck. And don't trust anything managers say without checking HR policy first when it comes to anything to do with your employment, particularly pay, because you will get caught out on a tecnicality.
3) Speaking of pay, it is far too low for the expected level of knowledge, skill and responsibility required for the role. You are expected to be on the phone non-stop for all of your shift with the exception of breaks/lunches or scheduled time off, and any time you spend off the phone is timed even if you are going to the bathroom or writing emails etc. Guaranteed that any time spent off the phone will later be questioned for its legitimacy by your manager and even if you have a genuine reason they will ""coach"" you to not spend time off the phone at all. You are also expected to have very detailed knowledge in all banking products and procedures, but the training they offer is very minimal before you get chucked back on the phone. This may sound standard for many jobs but when it comes to banking a lack of knowledge can have dire consequences.
4) The opportunities to climb the ladder or move into different sectors of the business are few and far between. You will be told that if you want to work in a particular department you should talk about it to your manager, but even if you do this when opportunities arise they will not tell you until someone else has been given the role already.
5) The business will constantly tell you they value their employees, but will also repeatedly move goal posts and place large amounts of pressure onto your performance. Feeling stressed? Try meditating and get back on the phone.
6) The turn over is high and the company make little to no effort to hold onto experienced staff members.

It is unsurprising given all the above that the bank is considered unpopular by customers and performs poorly in comparison to its competitors. Do yourself a favour and stay far away from them. I certainly wish I had."

They have chosen favourites and rules you need to abide by in order to have any chance of progressing in role. Anything said as feedback or in general to them is often manipulated and turned into something it is not to deflect from real issues. Feedback is not taken on board despite senior management constantly asking for how they can change things to improve employee satisfaction. 

- IT systems. These have improved since the initial shambolic migration however they limit what the bank are able to do process wise and can be a hindrance. 

- Pay is lower compared to competitors and you are expected to go above and beyond your role with no incentive.

252,TSB Bank,Poor Company to work for if part time.,2019-12-26,2.0,Local Banker,Relatively flexible when it comes to working hours.,"I can only comment on the branch network.

You will be left behind, they promise you oppurtunities, you work towards them and then give it to someone else as they are the more 'strategic placement'.

The pay is incredibly bad especially considering the amount of work you have to do, they've since added business banking to branches repitoire of knowledge but not increased pay (frustrating since this used to be an oppurtunity to move up) other banks have much better pay. 

New starters will always be put forward for various oppurtunities which results in previous staff being left behind.

Currently not up skilling due to new CEO cost cutting.

Management is very much hit and miss. You can either get a condescending manager who patronises you into doing a particular job rather than talk to you like an adult or you can get one who is really trying to help you progress (though the oppurtunities aren't there). 

Overall I would not recommend TSB (branch network) to anyone who is looking to start a career.

Good DC pension scheme.
Good Annual Leave allowance, with the opportunity to purchase up to a week extra.","The spreadsheet bank. Post-LBG, managing processes informally using spreadsheets was acceptable for while... but 4 years down the line, really? It's just amateurish for multi-million pound organisation to not have proper systems in place. Annual leave is tracked via the 'back of cigarette-packet' arrangement, and the leavers the process is a spreadsheet, that generates an email saying ""Jane Doe is leaving"". It's beggars belief. There are small high street traders with employees you can count on one hand who are more organised.

Internal IT systems are simply not fit for purpose - literally, you aren't provided the tools to do your job properly. They threw out the working LBG laptops for shoddy new ones, on system that frequently 'disconnects' and crashes. Not enough desks in the office.

Salary is incredibly low for their City of London location - creating serious recruitment/retention issues. The whole 'benchmarking' process is broken: a position can be an easy ride in one department, whereas in another team colleagues are bled dry and burnt out - yet both are the same grade and salary. As a result, key talent regularly leaves for greener pastures when they are simply poached by competitors.

The parent company Sabadell essentially pulls all the strings. If they say 'jump', and your reply is anything other than 'how high?' your work life will be made difficult.

The previous point means a culture of bullying and nepotism has taken firm hold of the bank. Managers sabotaging their peers in petty ways, to make each other look bad... all at the expense of the bank and ultimately customers."

However, over the years i saw big changes with a cultural shift to one of bullying and favouritism. So many times my efforts for promotion were sabotaged by my own manager, examples included taking high profile work away from me for ""her own development"" (despite me having come up with the idea/workstream) and refusing me training as it was ""too career enhancing"". The amount of times I was placed on report as well for such petty minor things it was laughable, to show the pettiness when she left her final bullying act was to try and get my bonus revoked I appealed and was told her ""whole rationale for placing me on report was wrong"".  After my boss left the new one was equally bad, less than 5 years experience in the area and with no prior management experience the said person's face ""fit"" and to coin a statement many made ""was a favourite amongst the seniors as will nod head and agree to anything"". Utterly demotivating and on a personal level working there affected my mental health so much.

Not only was bullying and favouritism prevalent (my experience was not unique) the culture for recruiting the inexperienced was laughable. When the chaos with migration occurred NO ONE who worked there was surprised, hiring people with zero experience in this area on a large scale will always cause issues! In one London team alone the sheer quantity of inexperience is shocking, not just in technical ability but in people management as well! I know so many people utterly demoralised in roles working so hard whilst others do barely anything due to management having no digital knowledge as to how things should be.

Besides the expectation that you act 'human' to your customers you will never get anything near that treatment from your management. I have been told by a manager on several occasions 'MAN BEHIND THE DESK ALWAYS WINS'.  You work so many unpaid hours. You'll be bullied to come to work 8.30 and finish 6-6.30 most days as opposed to the official 5 o clock. This was a norm both in my current and the  last branch I worked at. They'll try give you as many roles as they can, keeping you on the least pay possible. Too much favoritism. Not even a single person in my branch is happy.

People get their way up by talking and not by performing well. Employees who fail to meet their targets seem to be more respected than the ones who give everything for the company.

TSB advertises a very positive behavior that there are no targets, however when I questioned that during the training, it was ignored, because there are (employee targets)

Applied for several opportunities within the company and was rejected by each of them. (Not even a telephone interview)

Shifts - I am on a 4 shift monthly rotation, one of which is 14:00-22:00. My usual shift should be 13:00-21:00, but they are constantly changed.

Call after call (average of 80 calls per day)

Most of the times you are getting marked on calls and given negative feedback without being your own fault, but when you start questioning it, the management ""reminds"" you of one of TSB Values - OWN IT.

After the new system is introduced, employee turnover will increase even more since the system will take screenshots while you are helping a customer."

456,TSB Bank,"A challenger bank with potential, but needs to address a lot of issues first",2016-01-24,3.0,Local Banker,"Managers are quite relaxed, open and approachable. All colleagues are generally really pleasant and there's a sense of camaraderie throughout a lot of the business as we are a 'challenger bank'. Although a lot of support is through call centres, the people on the other end are very helpful and friendly. Benefits are good - annual bonus (if you're good) amongst other things so can't complain. If you show an interest and you're proactive then you will go far. It's the sort of company where people get to know one another very quickly so if you work hard you will get noticed. The older generation might complain about the systems a lot but I think they're ok - like it's actually hard to do things wrong. The bank seems to be very driven and forward-thinking - never talking about the past but always about the future. It's quick to jump on anything new and gives the impression of being young and dynamic. I'm going to say I won't recommend TSB to a friend purely because I know that it's not for everyone, and if you don't like sales then you'll have a rough time. Although a day in the life at TSB is usually stress-free I reckon - you can end the day having a laugh with your colleagues and manager and that's what it's all about really.","You are always monitored, watched, observed and it creates quite a false, negative and unnatural working at atmosphere, and a lot of the training and business objectives are hypocritical and counterproductive. For example, there is an overly huge amount of 'customer experience' training which is initially meant to improve the way you interact with customers by being more natural and human, but they enforce this by 'telling' you what to say to customers and providing word scripts etc - so quite the opposite. The bank adopted a 'zero targets' policy but there is still considerable pressure to sell, almost more so than when we did have targets. Essentially, they don't really trust their employees. TSB is the sort of company where a mistake will go negatively against you for a very long time; they don't see it as an opportunity to learn - this leads on to a 'blame culture' in the bank. Training (to move up a role) is difficult - you're often promised something but it will almost never happen, and if you're proactive and prompt them, they see it as a massive hassle. A big flaw in the bank's infrastructure is most things are done through a call centre. A majority of customer enquiries cannot be dealt with in a branch, adding unnecessary time and effort and a risk of miscommunication. All of the above adds up resulting in quite low morale amongst staff which is sad because the bank has great potential."

More expectations and stress is added to the local bankers.

The world without targets is crumbling away. We now have expectations with figures attatched, and we are reprimanded in our weekly review meetings if we don't achieve them. It's hard to ""be human"" when we are also expected to plug a loan or credit card. 

Very little scope for progression. Colleagues in local banker roles are now very experienced and highly skilled. We are all expected to take on more responsibility, for exactly the same pay.
