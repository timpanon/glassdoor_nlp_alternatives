0,,Poor Compensation and No Career Growth,2022-04-14,2.0,Business Analyst,"-Low-key work environment, I rarely had to work past 40 hours/week or weekends. I didn't have too much on my plate with projects or responsibilities.
-Good co-workers, I built a rapport with people in my department before we transitioned to WFH and they were pleasant to deal with.","-Pay is way below market value. I left when I got a new job with a huge pay increase. 
-No growth within the company. Co-workers who have continued education were never rewarded with a salary increase or promotion.
-Low raises and no bonuses. Highest raise was almost 4% my first year and dwindled down every year to 2.9%. I and other coworkers had never gotten a bonus, despite being praised for performance.
-No career growth. My job duties rarely changed over time. Projects that I was supposed to be involved in got cancelled or never came to fruition."

There are a lot of good people who work there and the quality of work is actually fantastic. They do have high standards.
Work hours are reasonable, didn‚Äôt have to work more than 8 hours on most days.","This company is toxic for you all over the place. The work culture is toxic, there is a culture of blame and shame instead of fixing the issue. Managers have horrible egos, some engineers have horrible egos. Teams fight with each other instead of solving problems. 

Logging hours is incredibly strict to the point where it felt like going to school. You have to log your hours and document your work in about 5 places a day in addition to the standup updates. Even after, you might be questioned about your work by your manager or people who don‚Äôt understand it. This happened publicly in the group or at team meetings, just crushed team morale.

Managers don‚Äôt listen to concerns of employees. Instead, employees who bring up problems are attacked and silenced. Some managers openly question/insult people in front of the whole team at times when they couldn‚Äôt complete their sprint tasks in time. This seriously demoralized the team. 

They are super cheap and don‚Äôt pay for any development tools. This makes your work harder and frustrating. Access to any resource is hard to get, debugging in production is frustrating because they use outdated freeware.

They try to pay you as less as possible with no bonus, average benefits and even had a massive pay cut on top of that when we struggled during covid. Promotion is based on loyalty to the manager, no real criteria or measurement.

They have this deluded notion that they are on the same level as other Fintech giants such as Paypal. Technologically, they actually are. But there is no innovation, no new ideas and the company is too fiscally conservative to compete with them.

They use applying for H1B visa as a way to extract more work from immigrants, exploiting them with fear. Sometimes, they don‚Äôt apply for it which seriously jeopardizes their career and their lives. Some of them had to go back to their country because of this. I don‚Äôt get why you‚Äôd hire immigrants if you weren‚Äôt going to apply for their visa."

The social culture was above average; that's the only reason I'm giving 1 star.","Unfortunately, everything else. 

Departments don't communicate with each other, customers hated us, no advancement opportunities no matter how hard you work unless you stay for a decade when someone might leave or if you're a woman and marry/sleep with someone there, CEO/Executives lied about the selling of the company (the first time, at least), brainless HR that leaked the entire company's W2 information to a phisher (and an even more braindead response to it, a free year of identity security and the company showed no remorse for what happened; they waited a week and a half to tell the entire company about it...just read the other reviews), nobody has passion for what they do it was basically just a place to show up and get a paycheck and play ping pong all day for most people. No job training or advancement whatsoever; I didn't learn or obtain any new skill sets and everything I accomplished I had already learned from previous work experience. 

Oh, and the company got sold again to Global Payments; we saw it on news sites before the company even told us.

Oh yeah, and they also got breached AGAIN and now everyone's identity is at risk, for the second time in 4 years."

Specifically speaking about TSYS INTL branch (while I tend to believe from contact experience with other US/UK colleagues that those branches have such problem well adddressed). 
It took long enough for Senior Management to understand that such pain point demands to be addressed to keep and retain good people who are engaged and concerned with performing a good quality job.

Overtime was always paid normally.","Lately the company grew a lot in Brazil, but without planning and zero investments. The technology team in Brazil was highly impacted due to how the work was arranged and also due to management issues on all areas.

As a consequence, the development team became extremely overloaded as the system is complex and has zero documentation. The technical management is more focused on pleasing the upper management and clients than on the employees - there is no real career plan (the goals are completely subjective), and all the complaints raised about overload and challenges in day-to-day activities were ignored.

On top of that, there is only one person on the local HR - for almost 200 employees.

Salary used to be good, but the market has evolved and the company did not follow - a few years ago it was one of the highest salaries in the region, today it pays the floor average salary - definitely not worth the stress.

Be aware that if you join the technology team, you will be expected to work pre-arranged weekends and work overtime - it's implicit by the area management. And also expect no compensation - days-off theoretically exist but the management rarely allows you to take them.

In a nutshell, the company used to be good - so it can be again. But currently is one of the most stressful places that I've worked on."

Its constantly evolving and changing which you might think a good thing. Unfortunately, nothing is ever given notice or warning and the whole spinning plates concept isn't realistic.
It is a very toxic environment, with backstabbing throughout the business from ALL levels. And if you love an incestuous culture Tsys is definitely for you. Dealing with management who are blatantly married to another member of management and insistently trying to instigate sexual contact is not for me.
People can't even us the toilets without smearing feces up the walls and doors.

Shift bidding is ridiculous and stressful.
No room for advancement as managers are all part of a clique. Also some management positions biased as family or spouses of other management are the ones who get the positions.
How I lost my employment was that at the contract ended with a company, we were told we would be moved to another project that we had previously worked on. instead we were all laid off due to restructuring they claimed. So a bunch of people were lied to outright and then let go.
Also implemented a no-smoking on the property rule, tried to say people in the parking lot in their cars couldn't smoke. also said that vaping wasn't allowed on their property even though that's not smoking and were forcing people to walk down to the street. It's nearly impossible to eat your lunch and go outside to smoke when they force half hour lunches on you."

Spoke to manager recently after a Global Payments layoff and was told that they are only allowed to hire in India going forward. They don't value American employees at all. 

If you get hired at TSYS, chances are you won't be employed there all that long, especially if you end up working on legacy software. TSYS has started building up their presence in India and shipping most of the legacy program work overseas. There's no job security there at all, so I'd recommend finding another job if at all possible."

The agents with the most experience are trampled over and asked to do the workload of 5/6 agents meaning the rest of the team does not pull their weight, having reported this numerous times to management in the past year nothing has been done to rectify this, to the company you are just a bum on a seat there to jump when they say jump and if you dont the make sure it is impossible to stay.
Dont bother going to HR for anything as they always side with the managers in all things, if you want a stop over company to pay the bills while you look for something better than TSYS is perfect, however if your looking for a career then this is not the place for you.

+ The importance of Product Knowledge vs Technical Knowledge is (80:20). So it is not for you if you are a Coding geek.
+ Micro Management- another bad aspect. Your incomings and outgoings are very well monitored !
+ The leads are not very effective professionally.
+ Senior Management seems to lack vision and are unable to provide/structure career roadmap for the employees.
+ Majority of people are here for almost or over a decade. They are not very open to change and are mostly into their own groups. You will definitely feel like an outsider , if you're not an extrovert.."

3. No review process for management people- they are reviewed on how good relationship they have with their bosses.
4. Employees are forced to do pair programming and legacy code for 9 days of 10 days sprint and suddenly it becomes developer‚Äôs responsibility to get it done.

668,,TSYS : Worst tech companies to work for,2019-04-18,1.0,Software Engineer,No pros as of now,"1. I have resigned from my previous jobs because of my manager and not the company. I was always quite satisfied with my work but my manager made my life hell, and it started impacting my personal life. I used to stay stressed at home, and it became a struggle to motivate myself to go to office every single day. But I don‚Äôt regret resigning even once. For me, my peace of mind matters the most.
 
2. I used to slog round the clock to ensure timely delivery of all the projects, and my manager used to take all the credit at the end of the day. Once, I dared to raise my voice in front of his senior and I was loaded with double the amount of work that very day.

3. My manager loved pointing mistakes in everyone‚Äôs work, and it was against his ego to appreciate someone‚Äôs hard work. Not just me, the entire team felt really demotivated and some even started doubting their professional capabilities because of her callous behavior. Therefore, five people from our team (including me) resigned within two months.

4. My manager used to set unrealistic deadlines for every task and made me work over time almost every second day. Then, he used to threaten me with giving bad ratings during appraisals if I failed to meet deadline of any of the assigned tasks. I could not handle this pressure after one point of time, and resigned without even having another job offer in my hand."

2- Lots of changes there were meant to make the company more agile and nimble, but there are lots of issues and things just don't work as they should.

3- Security take precedence over anything, including employees!

4- They only want ""YES"" man.  If you have any ideas don't expect them to go anywhere.

5- No room for growth!  Only a few select people located at the corporate offices have the chances that knowledgeable employees do!  Forget it!  If you are part of the ""C"" circle there's no change you can ever get anywhere.

6- Employees are expected to work overtime simply because they are mostly salary.

7- There very little regard for those who take pride in what they do daily.   There's no recognition to those who really care about what they deliver. 

8- The only one getting any recognition are those connected to management.

9- Oh, yeah!  You can't contradict management as you can be written up and that would eventually be used to FIRE YOU!"

Very dysfunctional and unorganized. Low wages and slow out of date computer systems and processes. No due process or any support staff that will resolve valid complaints.

Unethical business practices and overall many Agents quit due to the stressful environment caused by Management. They will not  accept the fact for People to come to work do their job and go home. They make working conditions unbearable. Management lies constantly.  Rules and processes change with zero training or even a heads up that something change.

These employees, for the most part, are hard working, old, and will have a hard time interviewing and learning skills for a new job. Reason being is that they already invested a good portion of their life to the company. There are also layoffs now, one in April, one in October and we know more are coming.

692,,"Great place to work. Shh, it's kind of a secret",2018-12-19,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"TSYS is a great place to work. Training and support plans were in place from day one and there is a real sense of collaboration shown across the whole location. The department which I work requires collaboration and networking with multiple teams situated across the different floors and wings and I have never witnessed resistance or push back when seeking assistance on work. 

Management is approachable and open to feedback. This also appears to hold value and used to make changes when necessary.

Promotions are supported and are evidently given to people on merit - not necessarily dictated by length of tenure. I work in a busy environment and little gestures such as vouchers and tokens of appreciation are commonplace to maintain morale and recognise efforts.

The office itself is pretty impressive: TSYS York went through a refurbishment process just over a year a go and the space created puts a lot of other work places I have worked/visited in the shade. It has an amazing social area known as the Hub with a pool table and games console (XBOX One) and table tennis facilities outside for the summer.  Each floor has a bean to cup coffee machine as well as  deluxe hot chocolate machines (both of these give fresh drinks - they aren't the old school instant drink dispenser type machines).",As with any corporate company - challenges can be faced with trying to support a 24/7 operation across multiple global sites. This is not a criticism of TSYS in general - more of a common theme across businesses  and the struggle to stay aligned when experiencing large time differences and having different processes in place.

- Decent pay, as long as you don't start here out of school, and stay less than 3 years.
- A couple interesting problems to solve
- Large company meetings are generally catered, and are followed with a party
- 401k matching, bonus
- Aesthetically pleasing downtown office","This company is chock full of: politics, rampant favoritism for the most arbitrary reasons, immature executives, complete disorganization, ignorant and unintelligent middle and upper management. 
- The 2016 layoffs were based on politics over performance.  
- Very little PTO for entry to mid-level employees.
- No upward mobility for IC's 
- NetSpend is a start-up that got acquired, but has yet to move away from their start-up mentality of chasing every dollar through their marketing and sales teams.  
- They are full of poorly designed products, that are championed by an executive for 6-8 months (when the product is new and shiny, and can get them promoted), stood up to make a quick buck, then left undocumented and without maintenance.  This repeated attitude has wreaked havoc on all of their systems and processes. If you are looking at a dev position, I would run for the hills, their systems are a mess.
- NetSpend's culture revolves around marketing, and all of their work flows through ""channels.""  This has resulted in a culture where maintenance and operations are undervalued, and projects to improve/maintain systems are de-prioritized.
- The marketing team dreams up these super custom and over-complicated white label brand programs, with no thought on the resulting tech changes that need to go into them.  Then the executive team gets on board and devs are left to throw together the pieces to meet a deadline and scope that they had no input into.
- Since everything is about chasing the next big account , if you want to spend your time taking orders from a marketer that has the IQ of a golden retriever, then I highly recommend this job.

Lastly, if they don't like you for arbitrary reasons they will try and push you out.  I saw this happen to two other employees while I was there.  Although for me personally I had the pleasure of being personally victimized for my appearance by a VP.  This woman would look me up and down, and then scowl.  I was standing with another male colleague one day, and they noticed her reaction before I did.  HR even got in on the fun.  This behavior is allowed and ok,  it might not be your appearance, but if they want to make you feel so uncomfortable that you don't want to ever go to work again, they will find a way.

You can't have one without the other.  TSYS gained market share over it's Goliath competitor by offering an equivalent, and eventually better, product with quicker turnaround and much better customer focus.  

As the times, economy and management changed it seems TSYS began to view employees as somewhat of a commodity versus integral members of the Team.  Restructuring sometimes created opportunities.  But also contributed to layoffs, when some of those decisions were reversed.   Subsequent shifting of roles and positions lowered subject matter expertise of the affected areas, making it more difficult for everyone to succeed."

The people that work here are an amazing group.  They really care and want to help you out.  While this may not be the most exciting job in the world or the most fun (it is a call center after all) the people make it worth going to work.","A lot of the managers have been hired externally, rather than promoted directly up the line.  It makes it hard to get help from them if you are stuck on a difficult problem.  They often tell you ""use your resources"" occasionally those resources do help but often times they are split up between multiple places, are difficult to find and often have outdated information or are just flat out wrong.  When you get an especially irate customer on the phone demanding a manager it is usually near impossible to get a manager to help you out.  They give you an answer somewhere along the lines of ""submit a request and we will call them back in 24 to 48 hours"".  That is no fun to have to explain to someone who is especially upset.

When you first start and as you progress in the company they provide with you both in classroom training and on the job shadowing to help learn.  Often times while you are in the classroom it feels like you are getting a lot of good information to help make you successful.  Pray that you get someone good to shadow with.  It turns out that the training is often like the ""available resources"" outdated and wrong or irrelevant.  Nothing has been to done to adjust the training despite multiple employees giving advise on how these training could be updated to provide more beneficial learning.  Often times management also stresses about ""filling a gap in skills"".  Basically there are too many technical support calls and not enough technical support agents to help get the calls out of queue faster.  They will then send people through training who are not ready to take on those responsibility.  This often times results in unneeded transfer calls and upset customers.  Also just because you move up, take on more responsibility, have a more stressful and hectic work day does not mean you will be receiving additional compensation for that.  

Time off can also be difficult, you will get 2 weeks vacation time, 2 weeks sick time and 3 floating holidays.  Good luck trying to use that time up though.  There is very limited space on the number of slots available to take time off.  They do expect you to plan ahead which is fair.  However, sometimes something might come up that is two months away and the calendar is already full.  It is also hard to schedule something like a doctors appointment or going to the dentist.  You can try and work around your schedule but it sometimes just isn't that convenient and you may have to miss an hour or two of work.  Management will usually make a big deal about needing to maybe come in late, leave early or taking an extra long lunch.  Often time they make it seem like they are doing you a massive favor so that you can go take care of yourself.   In additional to not being able to get time off you had better never leave your desk unless during one of your two allotted 15 minute breaks or your lunch.  People had been getting pulled aside and written for something as simple as going to get a drink of water or going to the bathroom."

The work life balance at this company is horrible. The situation has been like this since the management has changed in 2016.  

There were about 1000 people laid off in 2016, some without any notice. Those who were left were asked to pick up the slack and work overtime to make up for those laid off.  They are taking advantage of this situation, asking employees to work like machines, this was completely demoralizing.

Those employees  who are willing to suck up to management get all the promotions and praise while the individual contributors aren't recognized for their contributions. Promotions and job offers are also given to friends and family without any reason. There is no opportunity to learn and progress in your career at this company. Most individuals at this company don't support each other or have each others back, they are all out for themselves. They often try to take credit for the tasks completed by others.  The immigrants all stick together in clicks and speak their native tongue in meetings.

Management admits to ""not having time"" to give positive feedback to employees - only negative. They love to micromanage, it feels like they seem to need to find something - anything - to criticise you for. Despite all that, you get slapped on the wrist if you go to them for help with something, & told you should be using your ""resources"" which rarely actually help. In addition, if you have a really irate caller, there is no way to get a supervisor/manager on the line. Managers simply do not take calls (probably because they're too busy micromanaging) - they tell you to send a ticket & they will call the customer back in 24 to 48 hours. No caller that wants to talk to a supervisor wants to hear that, & to top it off, management often doesn't follow through & won't call the customer back at all.
One employee did not receive his second paycheck on time, & was told all sorts of conflicting info as to why. First paycheck would have made sense, but there is no reason for the second one to not go thru since the first one did. It came down to total disorganization & lack of communication.
They want you to teach yourself how to do your job past a certain point. And when you move up & get more skills & knowledge, there is no pay raise that goes with that ""promotion"", only additional responsibilities.
In short, this is literally the worst job I've ever had, & it was degrading & dehumanizing. DON'T WORK HERE!"

I also got told before the interview that I‚Äôd be working one in three weekends which I thought wasn‚Äôt bad but upon working I found out that it can vary and you could end up working 3 weekends in a row..and that isn‚Äôt even the half of it. For the shifts,  you have to flex which means you HAVE to be available in-between 6am-11pm Monday-Sunday AND you could end up working 10 days in a row with only 3 days off then potentially another 10 days on. I‚Äôve also heard stories of people getting sacked over the silliest of things without any support or warnings so this job doesn‚Äôt seem secure. Since being here I‚Äôve found out that so many people end up leaving and barely stay here 3 months and some of the people who have stayed more have said that it doesn‚Äôt go quick.

818,,Virgin money customer services advisor in Milton Keynes.,2018-03-20,1.0,Customer Service Representative,The people I work with,"TSYS is reputable in the sense that it's popular. They moved me to supervisor and even management duties while keeping me on the same pay ¬£16,500. What a joke. I was training people on the same money as me and in most cases, the people I trained were on *more* money because they came via agency. No step up programme; opportunities would only rise if a person left from finding a better job (not difficult.) They should understand that for the money they offer, for the actual job, for the hours they make you work, the lack of benefits to the role they should at least support you. Have decent and professional management. Not a chance. They've been hiring managers who know absolutely nothing about the software and it's had an impact on our customers because no one knows anything and there's constantly customers being misadvised. The place is chaotic. If I'd have worked for Virgin directly things would have been so different. I've been so unhappy at TSYS these past few months, finding a new job about 5 mins away from the Milton Keynes office nearly ¬£15000 more per year, 9-5 instead of shift work, amazing employee benefits - what a weight lifted off my shoulders. TSYS should recognise this and value their staff more. The senior CEO of the company told me ""there's no money in the contract for an increase in pay"" absolute lies."

The latest acquisition of TransFirst proved to be the hair that broke their culture camels back. I unfortunately worked for TransFirst previously and left them to go to TSYS. I was atTSYS for 5 yrs prior to the acquisition of TransFirst. The deceptive practices that were the back bone of TransFirst were slowly being adopted into the culture of TSYS. Sad too...TSYS at one time, was the standard in the industry and now because of their assimilation to the culture of TransFirst , they have become the proverbial ""dark side"" which First Data held the title of all its own at one time."

Management doesn't care about nor do they listen to sales staff. Instead they fly all over the country for ""meetings"" while living off of their corporate credit cards. While employees can't take a branch donuts.

When I was first hired I was told I would be making $16.00/an Hour after one full year. When I quit just after 2 years later I was making $14.32/an hour. Team leads are good and fair but the directors issue many unreasonable rules. While I was there personal bathroom breaks were discouraged if they were not allotted to you in your schedule. Showing up even a few seconds late would result in a ""point"" towards receiving a write up. Working overtime would not excuse these ""points"" either. I once showed up about 3 minutes late to an earlier shift, as part of OT, and received a write up. Keep in mind this was 2 hours before my regularly scheduled shift would have begun. Also you were not permitted to listen to music, or use your phone or internet in ANY way that was not work related. A co-worker I knew got a write up for using her phone to take an emergency family call. There is a lot of push back when asking for time off, even for doctors appointments. The benefits put in place by TSYS are terrible, you have limited coverage, a high co-pay and still have to pay quite a bit a month for healthcare. Dental and Vision aren't worth their cost either. I had a lot of trouble getting my schedule adjusted for school, I worked the late swing shift and after about 6 months of working till 10:00pm every night I asked for a scheduled change. I never received the schedule change and continued working my 01:00pm to 10:00pm shift until I quit. The software is terrible. They use a program called Helptrack to manage merchant accounts which is extremely outdated and in need of dire replacement. Their program TransactionExpress is also terrible. This is the program that merchants use to run cards. While I worked there it broke down consistently about every 2 weeks. We informed development each time, but they never fixed the root bugs, only put in patches to get it ""up and running"" again. This went on during my entire employment. During my entire 2 years at TSYS we went through 4 classes of department directors, these directors where never originally a part of the merchant support team or its leads, but were either from another department, or more commonly, a new hire from an entirely separate company."

The associate managers were supportive. Periodically, there is holidays, events, or team appreciation days. The company arranges activities, goodie bags, and meals. 

The position itself taught me to have a bigger backbone. You are provided some tools and tips for retention, allowing you to broaden your skills in sales. Generally, the work was quite easy, so long as you are good with computers. This was a good entry level position.

As long as you can keep good scores on your calls and your attendance is solid, you will likely get the shift you are bidding for. Those who are slow, have poor calls, and poor attendance, get stuck with the shifts that no one else picked. If you have kids, you may want to pick a different job.","Although you are provided with two weeks of sick days per year, you're also 'coached' after the third, fifth, and seventh day missed, with each meeting getting progressively worse. 

The stress can be a lot. It is a call center, and the company doesn't allow you to disconnect calls with customers unless they swear at you a total of three times. This was unpleasant at times.

The training materials do not correlate with what is in the manuals or with what the supervisors tell you. The organization and communication through out the company should be re-evaluated.  

The politics don't allow for you to move very easily up the chain. There are people who have been there for 4+ years and are still in the same position, even though they are certainly qualified for a bigger role."

We were offered an insurance package as temporary employees (started in October flipped to permanent February). Training was great and very informative and really made you excited to be a fraud analyst. Many opportunities for overtime if you're interested. Opportunities for advancement are often if you excel and are friendly with your leadership. Ultimately it is ""who you know"" centric.","Although my schedule was 8-5 with Thursday and Fridays off some people accepted third shift (10p- 6a) or second shift 3-12a. If you accept a third shift position chances are slim to none that you will get switched to another shift. It is a 24/7 call center so only a select few get weekends off. You will also get to choose one holiday off(you can list your holidays in order of preference) if the holiday falls on one of your off days you're lucky! Scheduling is based off of seniority, so the tenured analysts choose their requests first. At one point only one person could be off (as a request) per shift, I believe this has changed since the department has expanded rapidly. Another con would be talking to the occasional rude customer on the phone. Another stressful aspect is the productivity standards (you are expected to work x amount of accounts an hour and they don't take into consideration the difficulty of certain portfolios as it is a multi client environment). Luckily, I was an Outbound analyst so all I had to do was judge accounts and call if I suspected fraud. Being an Inbound analyst is more stressful because you are tied to the phone taking inbound calls constantly. Mandatory overtime was also something we had to deal with often. Sometimes it is 5-7 hours on top of your 40 hr work week. 30 minute lunches when the portfolios are busy. Pay is also sub par..started at $10 after training $10.30 and within 2 years $10.67 I believe. Hard to survive off of that."

The staff party's are great and there are lots of employee engagement activities. If you put the work in you will be recognised for it and often promoted as this company really loves to develop people.",Sometimes not enough space to park however Coventry do have an overflow car park.
1034,,Passion for my Job!,2016-12-20,4.0,,"I have been working in the training department for 5 years and since joining the team I have been able to develop my skills and reputation within the business. 

Delivering training and having the confidence to have difficult conversations, something I never dreamt of doing before! 

Being part of this team has brought a sense of passion to me. I care about our achievements as a team and thrive on the successes we achieve together.","Working in outsourcing can mean that budgets can be tight. This doesn't stop us from having opportunities, we work with what is available."

1036,,TSYS Managed Services - Great Experience and Great Company to Work For!,2016-12-19,4.0,,"I worked in the TMS HR team for almost 3 years.  I started on a FTC maternity cover and was offered a perm role with a promotion within 6 months.  Following that I was promoted again. This is a company that strives for excellence, both for the benefits of its clients and customers and the employees.  It recognises and nurtures talent, rewarding individuals that are keen to embrace the culture, get involved and be the very best they can be.  
In respect of people- I have had the privilege to work with some truly inspirational people, each of them with a unique talent that I have been able to develop myself from.  Management demand the best, from themselves, their teams and other teams. Whilst some may see this as relentless and thankless, I consider that it helped me realise my potential and continued to encourage me to want more.
From an HR and Training team perspective, I had opportunity to grow, learn and collaborate, with constant change comes much opportunity to explore new ways of working. The teams and the management of those teams work tirelessly to create something to have pride in. They coach, support and guide but challenge when they should.","It's hard work - but what rewarding job isn't? There are targets, the pace is fast (like nothing I've ever known) but this isn't a 'con' as such.  Yes the roles are demanding, yes the procedures are ridged, yes the expectations are high - but what company constantly striving for 'better' isn't the same. If I have one criticism, it would be reflection time.  Often you work at such pace that it's easy to forget all that is achieved - and trust me, on any given day at TMS I have seen people move mountains to accomplish a task.  All the support is there - it just needs to be utilised."
1037,,HR & Training Team,2016-12-19,4.0,,"Have recently joined the business and the HR Team and have been made to feel so welcomed and part of the team, in such a short space of time. The Training Team were really informative and made my induction fun whilst also sharing practical knowledge about the company and helping guide me through my training plan.  There is a real team spirit and culture of working together as one to achieve goal together which is very refreshing.  If you are looking for a career and wish to be supported by your managers and colleagues then definitely apply to work here.","Parking can sometimes be a nightmare in the morning as the site does get very busy, however you will always find a space but might not be by the entrance."
1038,,HR and Training Culture - Great team dynamic,2016-12-19,5.0,Training Manager,"I have worked for this company for almost 12 Years, 9 of those years in Training, 4 years as Training Manager.  We are like a well-oiled machine, we work extremely well together and love what we do.  Is it challenging at times? yes, but what job isn't and would it be fun and challenging if it wasn't?  

The training team and some of the HR people are long serving employees 1 of them have been with the company longer than I have.  

I have creative licence to do my job the way I please and only need to run important decisions past my Manager.

This is a great place to work, if you put the effort in you are rewarded with development opportunities.","The parking situation could be better, there aren't quite enough spaces for everyone but i'm just being picky now."

Several sites, including international, so a broad variety of co-workers.  
Rock-steady employer with long-duration clients
Good online e-training for compliance and job skills
Good redundancy and backup / failure planning and management

They really support United Way, almost fanatically","Everyone on every team passes the buck, no one will take responsibility for any project/product or service..

Cronyism and nepotism is rampant, check out their SEC Proxy Reports for specific wage examples
Job titles are meaningless and only 0.1% of the company gets promoted in a given year
Annual raises are below inflation and not based on merit
Average age of the workforce is in the late-50s. Massive turnover soon.

1041,,Sr. Client Server Analyst,2016-12-15,3.0,Senior Client Server Analyst,"Good place to work if you are an Information Technology professional who wants to live in Columbus, GA. Compensation is decent. 2 weeks vacation after one year and 3 weeks after 5 years. 2 weeks PDO for doctor appointments and emergencies each year that carries over to next year. One week for volunteer activities in the community. Healthcare benefits are decent. Good online training opportunities to build skills.","There are limited opportunities in Columbus, GA for Information Technology professionals. Basically only TSYS and AFLAC. The majority of the IT people who have worked for the company have been at TSYS at least 15-20 years. Many aren't college educated. They received their training thru a program called ICAP where TSYS partnered with a local university to offer training for computer programming. TSYS had to do this because they had a hard time recruiting talent to come to Columbus, GA. Much of the IT staff is set in their ways. They are afraid to be innovative and think outside the box because they fear messing something up and possibly losing their job. 

I wouldn't consider any position at this company as being stable. There have been many layoffs over the years. These always happen when TSYS makes a big acquisition or have a quarter or two where the company profits don't meet expectations. If either of these happen you can guarantee they will do layoffs. The last layoff in September 2016 was especially large .

As other mentioned there is a lot of micro-management in the upper levels. Your immediate manager has little power in suggesting you get a raise. They mostly just assign you your work. The management structure was basically blown up during the last reorganization. All the managers had to apply and interview for the 5 layers of management the company went to."

Culture of blame, you can't trust what anyone says as they are only interested in covering their backs. Managers and so-called 'Knowledge Experts (KE)' are supposed to be trained, yet they provide you with the wrong information regarding customers and you're blamed for it.

HR management is dishonest, you are promised a 'star-finder' fee for recommending new staff to the business but when its time to pay up, you have to chase them to hell and back, dealing with excuses as to why they can't pay you."

We are in the Cards and Payment domain. This I guess is the most talked about, most happening domain in the industry right now.  There are lots of things to learn, lots to do, lots of worthwhile things to do. It‚Äôs a place where you can fully utilize and evolve your domain and technical skills.
Last few years all the teams and individuals have been building up their learnings/skills. Now we are on the verge on another growth spurt. Greater emphasis is now being laid on Automation Testing as that is where the whole industry is moving. We are having trainings, assessments, workshops planned. We have correct people at the correct places to make sure that we are not found wanting when opportunities in this field arrive.
Opportunity- That‚Äôs the buzzword at this place. You have opportunities to learn new technical skills, add on to your domain knowledge, improve your soft skills. To accomplish all this, you get time and support. If you have the competence, integrity, honesty, right attitude and are willing to put in effort you will get rewards.
Management support is there for any requirement. Management is receptive to newer ideas and they pull out all stops to make sure that individuals, teams and organizational goals are met. They provide support, guidance, feedback and challenge you to go beyond and achieve more. I have seen cases where hardcore manual testers have been guided and challenged to take up automation skills and have performed brilliantly. Some have been given opportunities to learn software development skills like Java. Automation testers given opportunity to learn more about the core domain. There are opportunities to learn different skills like, automation, web services testing, mainframe testing, database testing, performance testing. Trainings, blogs etc set up for all, so that everyone can learn, improve and achieve growth.

The TransFirst executive team is straight out of Goodfellas, and has made it apparent that TransFirst is in charge, and that TSYS Merchant Solutions in Omaha is going to slowly be dismantled and most likely eventually shut down.  So far two 'synergies' have occurred, laying off over 60+ employees in Omaha, with at least two more rumored to be forthcoming.  The truly sad part is that this could be simply how corporations work when two like companies come together.  This is acceptable and just part of business...except its truly sad when the company who is at least 10 years behind in technology and product offerings, and has a tyrannical top down leadership style is the one put in charge.  In 2016, Omaha has made their Financial numbers every month through August 2016.  TransFirst...0 for 8.  The TransFirst back end is hosted by a third party who literally just declared bankruptcy.  So an unsupported back end that can't implement October Regulatory, yes put them in charge and let's move all of our clients that way!!  No company or customer risk there!  I truly have never seen anything like this in any industry.  This is literally going to bury TSYS Merchant Solutions, and will drag down TSYS overall for years to come.

There is no future with this company currently.  Check out the TransFirst reviews."

1098,,middle management,2016-09-12,3.0,Anonymous Employee,"GREAT! benefits, 401K match, vacation and community service time, pdo or sick time is the best in the IT world.

If not, there are a lot of great job opportunities out there.","99percent of managers are unskilled, untrained, and unhelpful.  Run!  TSYS pays less than the industry average.

One excellent manager,"this is a turnover mill, corporate policy seems to be to get a rep to bring in business then eventually walk them out and take over the residuals. In less than 2 years, from over 100 reps to under 50, major red flag people. This is NOT a professional job, just a telemarketing position, making cold calls. Advancing to senior rep is extremely rare."
1102,,Merchant Advocate,2016-09-06,1.0,Merchant Advocate,"Work and social life balance; Time off, stock purchase program, 401 K, benefits, and location. Not much more to say...","Training lacked real life position and could have been more  in depth. 

There after, leads were ""recycled"" aka calling merchants who have already been called 100x times and don't want to talk. Self generated leads needed approval to pursue or to see if they didn't belong to another rep. I had to give up several sales because they belonged to a ""closed group"" or  another group etc...


Boarding and activating merchants takes forever and that's what pays out. After they lay off half of the staff in Omaha everything will be dealt with from Broomfield, CO. 

No inner department communication, no vision or career advancement.

- Profile offered at the time of interview different than you actually work upon 
- Rude people 
-  employees laugh sarcastically on new employees in meeting rooms also (though never understood the reason behind it )

They don't even try to hide their ""Good ole Boy"" attitude. They'll place the worst possible leaders in positions that they're clearly not qualified for regardless of the impact of everyone. 
I've witnessed cousins promote cousins over others that were much more qualified!  I've witnessed minorties with masters degrees be passed up by whites in the inner circle and a GED get promoted. 
The company line says they're all about equal opportunity but I know for a fact that's not true!  If you're white, you have a shot at advancement but even then, you HAVE to be a yes man/woman!  Do NOT challenge their way of doing things. HR is in the tank and can't think independently,

You need to close 13 to 20 new accounts per month.  This can be done, but many seasoned sales people do not reach these numbers.  Part of your pay is based on profitability of your accounts.  This forces you to price your merchants rather high and not always do things in the best interest of the merchant.  Lastly, you have to be willing to lease a $200 credit card terminal, which will cost the merchant between $1000 to $2000 over the life of the 48 month lease.  This is an old way of doing merchant services.  See www.cardfellow.com ""Don't Lease a Credit Card Machine"".  You need to join the corporate mentality to do well and advance.

-lack of communication due to environment created. 
-churn and burn culture. 
-motivation through fear, micromanagement, and almost bullying some employees.

More detailed observations;
- hired outside manager for our department. Shows me they do not care about growing and developing employees. 

- Manager of your department has say whether you can transfer to another department after meeting criteria. 

- culture of competition creates a hostile work environment, you are a group of busy individuals. Not a team. While using this to meet their given quotas it has a negative effect and majority of employees are miserable. 

- management does not care if you have to put yourself in danger to get to work. They lack sympathy, do not understand empathy and have the emotional intelligence of a rock. 

- they treat their customer poorly. This is a tell-tell sign of a bad company. Agents do not take time to provide a good first impression of the company. 

- customer surveys are poorly designed and not reviewed as they should be. Scale is 1 out of 10. 1-8 being bad. Leaves no room for coaching, improvement or developing soft skills. 

- they care more about their partners, investors, and stockholders more than employees. Guess training cost are not so important. 3 new hire employees quit since I have been here. 

-like most companies they do not practice nor value their own ethics, which are printed on posters and plastered on the wall everywhere. 

- tools and systems are unorganized. Lacks good, in depth articles for development. Training supplements the resources but on their own it is difficult to maintain alone.

Average pay increases have been 0-3% since then even with  the last three years being the best in the  Companies history and stock price up nearly 20 to 25 dollars a share. Which means as they have gotten rich the employees standard of living has gone down for nearly ten years.

I said things in private about said manager, which admittedly I should not have, and retribution was swift.

I quickly did and realized I was working at a place that was pieced together from so many different systems, procedures and techniques that it was a miracle anything got done.

I created a training program for people stepping into my role as well as a map of how all the systems/departments interacted (a first for my very large section), and soon found management wanted me to do two roles rather than one. I'd come in at 5AM and leave at 8PM. Stress levels were bound to be high.

TSYS had great, intelligent people working for them but the upper executives lacked creativity. They were reliant upon a very old IT system/product, either oblivious or ignorant to new technology (i.e. online payment systems, such as PayPal/BitCoin).

Their solutions to the changing landscape were Business School textbook: shuffle people around, apply fancy terms, rename processes (e.g. Kaizen, Six Sigma) and hope things get better.

I guess the question is, when will PayPal or some other entity buy them up and dismantle them?

1191,,Marketing,2015-12-08,4.0,Marketing,"Solid company. They care about progressing and keeping up with trends and technology. Trying to be more innovative and ahead of the curve. They are progressive in hiring, meaning they are aware of the obstacles they face and they work to acknowledge those and change them. They do employee surveys and care what the employees think. Good work-life balance. They take great strides to keep employees. If you aren't satisfied in a position, they are happy for you to transfer internally. Only two hours to Atlanta. They have plenty of options for working from home and remotely. Lots of people have worked at TSYS for 10+ years. It seems to be a career company where people come back to Columbus after college, work at TSYS and don't ever leave. TSYS is aware of this and HR is trying to recruit younger. There is a strong Young Professionals group in Columbus. First year you get two weeks of vacation and two weeks of sick leave (also to use for appointments, sick family members, etc.) and 3 floating holidays. This depends on your start date within the calendar year. Good leadership funnel. Very competitive pay for the area.","If you are in Columbus, Ga., it has a lot of obstacles. Most of the public schools are performing below national averages. Crime is centered in certain areas, but is high. Although there are several major companies based here, once you exit those circles, employment is difficult depending on your specialty. Average employee age seems to be 35-40+. Recruiting younger employees seems to be an issue because of location of corporate headquarters, although as stated above, they let a lot of folks work from Atlanta and remotely in other places. Insurance benefits are just OK. Have to work there two years to get up to 3 weeks of vacation so negotiate. You go through a lot of training: A full day where they basically just tell you about credit card processing and nothing about medical or retirement benefits and then you have to do a 1/2-day of a WebEx which is excrutiating. Most of the orientation is about learning about the company."

They are extremely unprofessional and do nothing but gossip. If they put half the effort they do into gossiping about their own people they'd actually be productive. They don't like their employees. They undervalue their people. If you are thinking about working in the call center, don't! You are better off working at the Paypal center. And they start you off with better pay and put up with less of their immaturity. The supervisors and directors are so unprofessional."

At one point they may have had smart, dedicated people but most of them have left. Those remaining are the dregs. Every company has them; the space-fillers, the job campers, the people who have been there long enough to be making some money and whose jobs are  perfectly monotonous.

There are a lot of really good and talented people that work here.,They will give you a job title that does not apply to your real position.

Focus is in new sales and enhancements vs stabilizing current functionality.  Current clients lacks the focus while new implementations and enhancements take precedence.  Biggest organization is Production Support and defect resolution.  They're overwhelmed by defects and client issues.  Attrition is high.  Morale is very low.

People worked together as a team, worked hard and enjoyed their work managing to accomplish a great deal with limited resources.","All of the good managers were forced out of the Colorado office when TSYS took final control.  They were then replaced by senior people who were not remotely qualified to manage; productivity and opportunities for advancement ceased.  Between the growing harassment from these new managers and the lazy mentality in the Georgia office, the good developers and QA people began to leave in mass.  Some of the new people hired are lazy and overpaid forcing the few remaining good workers to work harder to compensate.  This further fuels the exodus of good workers because the incompetent management does nothing about the lazy workers."

Work is focused on and organized.","Needs to be more true hardworking people with stong work ethics and morals who care about what they are doing at their job and not just there to talk, have snacks, complain, gossip about others and have affairs. Most of the employees should be focused on their work, growing the company and making the clients happy.

If there are extenuating circumstances during your employment, they will not be taking into consideration your dedication and commitment towards the job but will hassle you with meetings upon meetings. The management is bias and there is a lot of back stabbing going on. Even some experienced agents will do nothing more than just try to bully you at the slightest chance. THIS IS NOT A PLACE TO WORK. THEIR PAY IS SUPERBLY LOW, THEY WON'T ALLOW YOU TIME OFF SICK EVEN IF YOU ARE DYING.

(Outside Sales/Merchant Advocate),2015-07-07,2.0,Outside Sales Representative,"One of the top 8 payments networks, who owns their servers and payments process 100% end to end. Integration with most third party software. Decent product offerings, although too many. I have a great manager. Great benefits.","Merchant Advocate (Outside Sales) Role - The only way to make your numbers is if you have a solid bank referral partner feeding you warm referrals. With no referral partners, it is difficult, otherwise, you are cold calling 100% which gets tough after a while. 

It is difficult because merchant solutions is such a hyper competitive industry with over several 1000 ISO's (Independent Sales Organizations) nationwide and every banking institution already has a merchant services provider for their business clients. So, to be successful, I recommend you work for a bank that has a solutions partner or work for a merchant provider that has solid banking partners in place. TSYS has these, but I don't have bank partners in my area. 

Lack of Support - TSYS Merchant Solutions is going thru some serious internal issues. 
Sales Support and Customer Support  - Seriously lacking. Customer Support hold times are VERY long or in Sales Support's case, they don't bother to answer their phone or respond to 9 out of 10 emails. Customer Service has never responded to any of my emails. That's a fact. Customer Support can't sometimes trouble shoot basic issues.

No Leads for outside sales - All the leads generated from their lead sources and few marketing campaigns are distributed mainly to inside sales, thus again you are subject to cold calling 100% of the time."

If you work on something to help you or the company out, better keep it to yourself or you'll have a handful of middle managers jumping in and trying to vulture your project from you including suddenly thinking they can give you deadlines and objectives despite knowing *NOTHING* about the technology, or even the project at all you are working on and THEN attempting to take the credit and in the most egregious case try to give the credit to one of their favored employees..  This is what drove me away in the end.

The existing technology stack is a mess.  It's incredibly painful to do the simplest tasks.  If two machines needs to communicate on the other side of a firewall it takes TWO WEEKS AT MINIMUM to get the request through.  Hope you got all the information right the first time or else you gotta wait another two weeks.

Netnanny crap blocking legit sites like github.  I was promised for 7 months I'd get access to Github,  which we used a TON of tools that use it for their hosting, documentation and support.  Never happened.

Terrible security policies straight from the 1990's.  Three password attempts before an account lock?  What brute force program is going to succeed in three attempts?  This is only done to upset the employees (that was our joke anyway).  This wouldn't be so bad except you have to change your password monthly, and there are arcane rules about special characters that are so complex you have to write it down.  Completely ruining the point to begin with.

Everyone uses SCRUM but they all do it differently and so poorly that it just gets in the way.  30 minute standups, no backlogs, no story points.  The one team I was on that SCRUM was actually a benefit, the team was dissolved and moved around the company just as we were starting to gel.

The money. Wasn't bad, on the paper you only need to do 40 hrs and what you get for rather monotonous work could be worse. 
Never had trouble to squeeze in a holiday day if really required. 
Job security is another plus.","Pressure. Caught between quality, numbers and an unorganised attempt to train everyone at everything at the same time without clear structures and anybody with the appropriate knowledge and ability monitoring and improving that training errors are basically asked for. However, mistakes made or numbers not reached perfectly (or even just going to the toilet/getting water (same log out code) for longer than 10 minutes over the whole day outside your breaks) are pointed out very clearly in a negative feedback - while positive things aren't acknowledged in the same manner. Possible mistakes are often pointed out in inappropriate strength and wording in front of the whole team.

Behaviour. In the lower management level (the team leader positions) the overall atmosphere is in general rather edgy and often bad mood influences the communication in a very unprofessional way. As an example given: although overtime is never mandatory it indeed happened rather regularly that when someone said he wouldn't come in earlier for overtime he would be questioned in front of the whole team ""what more important he could have to do"" (even people who have done over 40 hrs in a month additionally were made feel guilty for not doing ""enough""). Also, as a female, you are - which is rather inappropriate - asked on a regular basis whether you plan to get pregnant (this was even asked in my job interview, I should have sensed the trouble I suppose...)

Social events etc. Half-hearted attempts, giving the example that for a Christmas meal we were supposed to pay for ourselves and then half the people couldn't be bothered but wouldn't dare speaking their minds up should be a hint. 

The dress code is extremely strict considering none of us is directly facing customers and very rarely (about twice a year) clients (with knowing that in advance)

Work place -  In a business park at the end of a bus route of a bus that stops 30min-60min with limited parking. Leaking roofs. The whole year they were not able to fix the roof!

1315,,Excellent job security in a market where financial institutions are perforning routine lay-offs.  Ethical culture.,2014-09-18,5.0,Director,"Job Security; however, salaries are not competetive so there is a trade-off, Opportunity to gain cross functional experience in many areas of the Card Issuing Business that would be impossible to gain outside a very small Financial Institution. . Our Info Security Team is top notch and although restrictions may sometimes feel excessive I feel those constraints are well worth the inconvenience for the sake of protecting data.  The culture is such that doing the right thing for the client and end customer is always supported.","The opportunity to manage teams is not given to those who telecommute full time as management does not believe teams can be successfully managed when tgeographically dispersed.  The culture of the company, top to bottom, is such that they do not adapt to new technologies such as WebEx, Live Meeting, etc. to bring together teams working from various locations.  Over reliant on face to face meetings internally and with clients.  There are peak periods where a lot of extra hours could be required.  Desirable leadership positions are often based on personal friendships or family relationships rather than qualifications"

1319,,"Great people, great location, slow advancement",2014-09-18,4.0,Technical Writer Specialist,"TSYS basically defines job security: so long as you're not a jerk and you more or less do your job, you will eventually reach a place that seems a lot like tenure, in which you cannot get fired.  They also value work life balance quite a bit, so having kids and working at TSYS works out well.","On the downside, that tenure thing has filled the company with a lot of dead weight: people who don't work that hard, don't push or challenge, and actively prevent any kind of change.  Compensation is pretty terrible."

1323,,Not sure where this company is trying to go,2014-09-14,2.0,Anonymous Employee,"The compensation package is excellent and the company has a good attitude towards work-life balance. There is a good communication strategy and use of the company's intranet to support this, as well as ther business functions.

A strong player in the cards industry (especially the US market) with a very broad spectrum of job opportunities.

There are some very talented and dedicated people in this business who are a pleasure and a privilage to work with.","This is a very political and nepetistic place to work. The company has, by way of various business decisions and practices, become silo-based with each area, by necessity, protecting itself against others. When working within a team this can be invisible to an individual worker (although some middle and senior management decisions might seem a little odd). When working with other teams this can be frustrating, obstructive and demoralising. Due to this evironment it becomes vital to develop a network of contacts who can help and guide you in their area of the business. Sad as it is to say, you cannot assume someone in another area can/will/would want to help you.

The current company motto ""Up To Me"" is intended to inspire people to take personal responsibility and encourage a culture of shared ownership and accountability. Unfortunately, to me, this seems like a very pesonal motto to buy into at a company level. Those that live by it did so anyway, and perhaps feel a little patronised. Those that do not have, perhaps, been handed a tool by which they can cajoul and shame others into action.

This is a very US company, which is possibly a con to those with a very UK or European mindset. It also has a number of leaders and managers from a military background (especially in the US), which is again a possible con for those who find that mindset and culture a challenge to work with."
1324,,"Flexible company with a good future, but career advancement can be difficult.",2014-09-12,4.0,Business Analyst Senior,"TSYS encourages work/life balance by offering flexible work arrangements including remote work, alternative work hours, and job sharing. I'm able to work from home if my child is sick or I'm waiting on a repairman, etc. The benefits are good, but I wish maternity leave was longer than the minimum 6 weeks required to meet FMLA regulations. There is a childcare subsidy through the company's partnership with Bright Horizons. Overall, it's a great company if you have a family. TSYS is an industry leader, and I'm confident about the future of the company.",Upper level positions are occupied by people who have been with the company from its start 30 years ago. There is no overall effort to find and develop young talent. You really have to be lucky or know the right people to make the jump to leadership from being an individual contributor.

For anyone looking at TSYS as a potential employer and for a solid career, do NOT hesitate to sign on!","Some micromanagement from a director level and above. Definitely not the worst I've ever seen.

They executive management truly cares about the employees and the success of the company as a whole.  The beneftis packages are fair; not the best I've ever had, but certainly better than most.  The company is also very flexible as far as work locations and schedules which is extremely valuable to me personally.  TSYS also has an eye toward the future, and is doing everything it can to stay viable through innovation.","Let's just be honest, nobody is ever going to think they make enough money, and everybody thinks they deserve a promotion.  TSYS pays fairly, but they are not going to make you rich most likely.  There is a lot of competition for promotions and pay increases, so you're not going to fly up the company ladder like you could potentially do with a young, upstart company.  This is an established company, and you're going to have to be patient."
1329,,Very Satisfied.  No Place is Perfect.,2014-09-08,5.0,Senior Director,TSYS has a very family-focused culture and people here genuinely care about each other.

I felt this was genuine and really the foundation of TSYS's success and longevity with many employees, customers and partners.  However these core values from Columbus, GA would, at times, get lost in translation on their way to Omaha, NE where TSYS Merchant Solutions is HQ'd.

TSYS Merchant Solutions offers services to merchants that are valuable and fair-priced within the industry.  Additionally, compensation is comparable to other top 10 processors (primarily bank owned or operated).","There was no formal career path and very minimal internal promotions.
The senior-most leader promoted a clique-ish environment of among his industry cronies that he brought into the organization.  ""Groupthink"" and in turn, universal acceptance and conformity are prevalent.  This isn't a great environment for someone that wants to grow professionally as an individual.  With that said, it is possible to to keep your head down, focus on your individual production and succeed at TMS.  This is assuming you hold no desire for professional or career advancement and don't mind just one way of thinking."

Many times one rule would be implemented for one, and not for another. Trying to book time off would depend on how management were feeling that day. Incredibly two faced. Completely miserable, soul destroying place to work. Management would often base their reviews of staffs performance depending on if they liked them or not- same way with disciplinaries. Got an illness? Prepare to do battle to get time off for needed and vital appointments. Enjoy 2-3 phone calls on a sick day to ask if you're coming in or not (despite already calling) and should you have any additional needs- forget it."

That means the best people are badly overworked and leave the company.  Turnover is above 20% per year.  Many leave due to health problems due to the toxic environment (micromanagement, back-stabbing, and poor decision making of middle management).  Egos out of control at the director level and above.  Cronyism is a huge problem.  Management is old school in the wrong ways.  Too  much emphasis on seniority and not enough on competence.

As my time at TSYS progressed, it became quite evident that this is a 'good ole boy' company, stilling operating in a 1980s mindset. Pay is notoriously horrible and management can be very unprofessional. I've found no great level of satisfaction or accomplishment in any of my projects/initiatives; and the bureaucracy in every aspect of my day-to-day activities is exhausting. Trained animals can perform the work that is required here. I dread going to work. Columbus is an embarrassingly backwards, dangerous town; but with such little pay it's hard to move elsewhere. Additionally, people on the business side of things are really quite dumb for the most part. Favoritism is blatantly acted out and rewarded.

I thought for so long that it could have been just me. First, the favoritism is so blatant, I'm surprised there aren't name tags to identify them. But why be the favorite, when that just means you will have to work 80+ hour weeks? 

What was ultimately so sad to me is that my personal life was so impacted during my time here. I feel like I lost a few years of happiness. Two primary reasons for this: 1.) I was constantly watched. Reports showing when I came in and out of the building were captured. I felt guilty for my vacation time (""you are going to take a whole week off?!?! was the response""), and was asked ""what kind of symptoms I had"" if I called in sick. 2.) Every new idea I brought to the table was immediately squashed. I tried to present my ideas in multiple different ways. The method wasn't the issue. It was that heaven forbid I was trying to change something, to improve upon something. It made me so sad. 

I talk with ex-TSYS employees now and we all chuckle and wonder what we were thinking working there. One friend compared it to ""getting out of jail"". Please please please - don't ever work at TSYS. It's not good for your health."

- Excuses for non payment of commissions for activated merchants were as follows: broken revenue model, report errors, up to 5 different managers said that they had looked into it and were waiting on answers but 6+ months later none were provided. *NOTE: number of signed deals and volume surpassed the minimum for monthly compensation- millions in processing volume for more than a dozen merchants was signed in one month.
- Micro-management at times with no management at others. 
- Claim ownership of Ethisphere award for ethical business practices but do not operate in such a manner with their own employees.
- Company with held some compensation to which I'm legally entitled and which I am owed."
1379,,Bad Support and Bad Compensation,2013-09-24,2.0,Merchant Advocate,"It paid less (yes, less) than unemployment, but at least you had benefits (not great benefits mind you).","TSYS is not a place to start a sales career unless you have have a lot of money saved up AND you have an entire portfolio of merchants processing someplace else willing to let you resign them under TSYS.  You will not be given leads of any kind ever.  Most TSYS markets do not have banks to partner with either.  If you do, don't expect them to provide any legitimate lead sources either.  

New hire training lasts a week, but then you're basically on your own.  Sales management is very hit or miss, but more miss.  I was informed I had the best sales manager.  It that was the best they had, I can't imagine someone who was mediocre or plain bad.  There really was no support from management and management was often unavailable and unable to handle their work load. This was odd because they only have about 10 reps each.  

You will be extremely micromanaged.  You will have daily conference calls when you must go into insane detail about what you did the day before.  If you did not sign a deal, you will be publicly degraded in front of your peers.

Compensation plan is not good.  $35,000 base.  If you live in the middle of no where, fine, you maybe can live on this until you start seeing some residuals in a years time.  if you live in an urban area, you do the math.  Even if you have a portfolio you can bring over, know that you will not see a dime of those residuals for a long time.  The ramp up period/bonuses were bad as well.  No one made plan after month three.  There is a very high turnover rate here.

TSYS doesn't have a solid reputation in the MPS industry.  They think they do, but they don't and cannot compete technologically.  If you interview and came from the industry, go with a solid list of questions about compensation, employee retention, merchant retention, and platform capabilities.  They can't even offer true next day funding to most merchants.  These things matter when you're selling to savvy business owners.  It seems TSYS would rather stick with low brow uninformed merchants to better take advantage of them.

It seems TSYS has a higher than normal amount of people from operations to management that do not have formal educations or industry experience.  At least that was my perception from conversations I had with anyone I met at their corporate headquarters in Omaha.  Sales Management was also pretty unprofessional at our functions.  A lot of heavy drinking and inappropriate behavior.  I was very unimpressed.  A lot of used car salesman types."

They really look after their staff (they call them team members) and pay very well (no yearly bonuses, but the basic salaries are great) and they seem to promote people very quickly (they call them 'at desk' promotions). The company also seems really solid and has some robust relationships with big-name clients.","Downside is that with it being an American company, you do have to get used to that culture - a lot of congratulatory emails, pats on the back etc which gets a bit tiresome, but at least it's nice if you get one yourself. Also, the pace is pretty slow, so if you're used to a regulated financial services firm, it can be a shock to the system."

I feel like it's a big family and I also love the amenities!","It is very difficult to think of any cons for me.  I do hear other people who have worked here for years complain about things here and there, but I think that is because they have not had the opportunity to work for other companies to make a fair comparison.

Employees and their ideas or opinions are considered extremely insignificant (specifically in software development team). In fact you will not be consulted on anything.

1434,,Under worked and underpaid,2011-12-29,3.0,Business Analyst,"Benefits are okay although many things were cut after 2009. If you're in Columbus, there is the Campus which has a cafeteria, gym, bank with ATM, store, and it's right on the river walk. Also, if you like to be involved, there are tons of United Way activities, volunteering with the elementary school across the street, and during Employee Appreciation week, there is a lot of relaxed time. Most managers are very accommodating when you need time off or if you have personal issues; One layoff while I was employed but not a ton of people were let go. In general, if you don't like to do a lot of work, you'll be safe here. Many people have been there for over 15-20 years. Also, if you need a job after graduating from college, TSYS will hire you with no experience.","This is a company of families and everyone is hired because they know someone who works here. Because of that, there can be a lot of favoritism and nobody is fired, regardless how well they do their job.

Compensation is VERY low. Most Business/ IT positions start out in the very low 30's and it takes years to move up from there. If you look for another job, keep your salary private because other companies won't take you seriously when they find out what you're making.

Even if you're a slacker or very incompetent, you can get great reviews. And there is never any threat of getting fired. This is very discouraging for people who are competent and hard-working. And those people have to take on the work of the ones that can't perform. It's depressing to know that the people who are viewed to be the best employees feel unchallenged and under worked. Pushing papers and attending useless meetings.

If you're not at the Campus in Columbus, you don't really feel like a part of the company. This is especially true for the Kennesaw office. Job opportunities are slim to none if you're not in Columbus.

3 reorganizations in the last 4 years and the methodology is still not right. People complain every day about the lack of communication, the disjointedness of the team and how the methodology supports the confusion. 

Middle management is easy to talk to, but have the same amount of power as regular team members. It's discouraging when you're unhappy for years and management has known about it, but nothing is done to make it better. Performance goals are a joke. Nobody looks at them until they're forced. And if you take the time to have a conversation with any of the employees, you'll find that they're all miserable and are looking for another job."
