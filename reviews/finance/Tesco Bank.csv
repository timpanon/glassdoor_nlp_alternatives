- No scope for progression. You will start on a rubbish salary and stay on that salary. Promotions are rare and when the do come along now they are given to managements best friends. 

- Very little chance for time off or for mental health breaks. Management make you sign forms when you come back from being off for a mental health break and berate you in a meeting known as a return to work.

The business lags behind its competitors in almost every regard and the gap is widening. Tesco Bank doesn't have the leadership, vision or talent needed to become a successful business.

Pay and benefits are uncompetitive which has lead to poor recruitment and people being promoted above their ability as the business cannot attract the right people.

Workloads have increased considerably in many departments while staff numbers have been cut. Its not uncommon to hear of people working weekends or 10-12 hour days on a regular basis.

External consultancy is sought to the point that Tesco Bank seems incapable of running its own affairs. I don't know if the senior leadership team lack faith in their own ability, the ability of their employees, or both. 

Decision making at senior levels is slow. Relatively minor decisions often take so long that the time wasted causes more damage than if the least optimal path had been taken at the start.

Discriminate at Tesco for being a certain gender. Harassment is a problem but they don't do anything about it but blame the victim. Manager will gang up to get you to leave even when you are the victim. Customer are rude and horrible and they just tell you to man up. Lie to you about everything. Make you look bad when you are suffering. Anyone thinking of applying for a job at Tesco shouldn't just walk away from the chance they should run. The shift patterns aren't good and the assign car parking spaces to favourites. Gerry Mallon need to start firing people.

287,Tesco Bank,Zero Compassion To Personal Circumstances,2018-12-28,1.0,Customer Service Representative,My manager was fantastic and really made me feel welcome. My trainers were also very supportive during and after training. My colleagues were all very nice and when I needed help they were always there for me.,"I was told not to return to Tesco Bank after an old employer was found on a bank statement that I had unintentionally not declared due to ongoing health issues that have been ongoing for most of this year which has largely affected my memory. I suffer from multiple mental health disorders and only worked for this previous employer for a few days before going off on long term sick. I made an attempt on my own life at this time and after this have tried attempting suicide again. I have been on an assortment of different medications, been to many appointments and overall my memory of a lot of this year is completely blurred. I unintentionally left the employer out due to not remembering it as at the time all I can remember is being sectioned and dealing with trying to get through a very suicidal and depressive state of mind. For my time period of being off sick Tesco Bank asked for bank statements to prove I was able to financially provide for myself and the employer came up once they had the statement. Upon being probed about it I was completely honest about working for this employer and despite explaining my circumstances which for me is very hard to speak about, the bank did not take this into consideration. Under the Equality Act an employer is meant to make reasonable adjustments and no consideration was given to the situation and the reasons behind it. To be told at this time of year not to return to your work and then given no chance to explain yourself or meet with somebody to discuss this is absolutely repulsive. Also, the day after being told not to return to work I received a very aggressively tone phone call from a worker within the agency I got the job through being accused of turning up to work when I shouldn't have. I did not even go near the site and this was very triggering for me. As someone with mental health issues, firstly losing your job is horrible. Then to have someone calling the next day stating someone within the bank has accused me of turning up to the building and requesting me to be removed from the building is just so unprofessional. I was already very distressed from being turned away and felt the miscommunication and the phone call about me turning up to the bank again when I didn't was something that could have been prevented entirely. I also found it extremely unfair that I was allowed to work within the company for 6 weeks and then only given a days notice. A decision which was made off of 3 days which I did not declare due to mental health reasons. A decision made by someone higher up who did not know me, had not spoken to my manager or knew about my performance. A decision which did not take into account the immense amount of suffering I went through during this time period and this was why I made one simple mistake. I'm very, very disappointed in how Tesco Bank has handled the entire situation and the emotional upset I was put through and how mentally triggering it has been for me. If you want to work for a company that takes care of employees with mental health disorders, do not go to Tesco Bank. That is all I can say about them."

This makes it harder to get time off without using up holidays and also if you just want to do extra hours. Overtime is available but it is limited.

All senior roles seem to be recruited from external sources meaning no internal promotion, leading to a greater issue with more junior staff not being able to move up to a new role. This is down to the inflexible, and highly unfair flat structure that exists. 

Lowest levels of staff (level 1) are treated appallingly at times, unrealistic time scales set on tasks and no clarity given on purpose. These types of tasks are usually handed over and the ‘do a good job and this may help with the level 2’ promotion grade carrot is dangled. 

Development across the bank appears patchy and dependent on who you have in your corner supporting your application, if development isn’t deemed role appropriate you get no support at all.  Internally the training offering is poor, leadership courses have halted for the time being, general ‘softer skills’ training happens on an ad-hoc basis and is often offered following results of a poor staff survey round."

343,Tesco Bank,Bank being ran as a supermarket,2017-11-26,1.0,Customer Service Representative,"Locality of office in Glasgow City Centre
The genuine hard workers that work there.","A ""bank"" being ran as if it's a supermarket. Policy and procedures the same as in stores. 
Everyone who starts at Tesco ""Bank"" is given a CSR title regardless what role they work. This is no accident, this is so they can do what they please with you and give you a nominal CSR salary.
When Tesco ""Bank"" first started hiring they got it badly wrong, they would hire people and offer them whatever it took to get them in the door. No structure to pay, no reasoning to paying someone more or less for the exact same role.
That had now created a huge discrepency  in pay throughout the company.
They have now realised this but it's too late but still haven't sorted it. 
You still have people starting on a wage higher than those who are in the same role for years.
Also you have employees who tuped over from RBS on over inflated salaries which isn't there fault but causes a culture of lazy self intitled workers.
Management has no structure to it. No actual support for managers or development program to train them. I don't blame Team Leaders for being as poor as they are because they don't get the support or help. Most of them have been cherry picked by ex tsb managers to do there work for them in the team for ""development"".
The majority of managers are not capable of there core responsibilities, coach, mentor, develop and motivate. 
Disaplinary policies in the company are decent but not being utilised correctly by management, main the absence policy. If you are ligitamily unwell for more than 3 days you could face a formal sanction. No support for unwell colleagues or colleagues with long term medical problems. 
Mental health issues is a huge issue in the company. 70% of absence is attributed to this and the management team do nothing to support this or make a difference."

Poor systems which they wont fix I have errors daily which effect how I can do my job. This also has effect on customers security and has been an issue since Feb they still havent fixed that. A person was recently promoted not on merit but because they allowed a manager to stay at there house. There are 2 seperate contact centres which leads to an us and them divide. They tell you there are no targets at interview (they still do a year down the line) and then say they have indicators. If something can lead to you loosing your job its a target. The call queue is king but they dont aknowledge that they have created it by sending confusing letters to customers and failing to close products correctly.

Why split from RBS if you just keep hiring in senior positions?? That's right, there has been a big drive to hire ex RBS staff. If this continues, business will fail as RBS did and still does.

Again, the CSR'S keep this company going. There are the only point of contact for the customer. The management in Edinburgh are completely disconnected from the customer and are dreaming up business cases that make no sense and have no bearing on what really happens. The research on the customer is minimal to none.

441,Tesco Bank,The Bank that can't grow up,2015-11-01,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"Potential to be great but only if it gets its act together

Work Life Balance is good

Benefits can be good","Strategic management  and vision is weak mainly in Product Commercial and Marketing, No obvious desire to be different. The teams below have no compelling projects to work on.

The Insurance Business is in complete chaos, namely their Marketing function due to very poor leadership, ethics and values. 

The Bank side is not   really a bank, it is still only a Financial Services provider, which uses price as its key tool to remain competitive. As they say in the industry- a race to the bottom. No desire to introduce the 'every little helps' within each product that stands them apart from the market.

The Bank can't catch up to the big banks. Unless it executes a leapfrog strategy, they will continue to be behind the latest innovation as the big banks are now innovating very well and have scale to test things and fail and still make money. 

It appears to small a business to offset any loss. Products must make money in their own P&L which make it impossible to be competitive and profitable

There is no genuine product innovation to get behind,  which causes the rest of the business to trip over itself reworking poor marketing creative and price adjustments that make no real difference as the market just responds, cancelling all the hard work by the teams out.

It is essentially a Credit Card business which make up the majority of its customers.  However,
a congested Credit Card portfolio and offer  poor ClubCard rewards on the cards given they are still part of Tesco Retail 

The current account has failed. Will take a year+ to rebuild a better one. The product is just a weak copy of the bigger banks without the actual cross sale strategy in place as most customers have already got the cross sale product given they started their relationship with a loan/card/savings account etc. 

It really is still doing the same things Banks did in the early 2000's to a large degree. Churning out DM, leaflets and occasional press ads and alot of emphasis in stores, none of which can be measured properly and contributes little to their volume given the effort that goes into producing it.

 A clearer website or digital vanity projects like a community or an Insurance forum based on a very poor and Bike forum can't hide the lack of strategic digital innovation.

There is no genuine desire to create an obvious commercial relationship with Tesco to give customers good incentives to buy from Tesco Bank and get access to the best of Tesco. There is so much unrealised potential but commercial continue to drop x basis points on price or go for quick wins.

The Tesco Bank brand is non existent now, has never been encouraged or pushed. Direct Response is a fickle world where brands are still very important yet where the bank spends its awareness money or otherwise is in the wrong places. The brand team have nothing to do except pick blue or pink for the latest creative going under their nose for approval instead of empowering the marketeers to use their own judgement. Their is no appetite to fail or get it wrong, make a mistake but let people fix them and learn. Training is poor and essentially half of marketing can't learn more about offline marketing, all want to do digital but are not allowed to do it properly. 

WL3 management are quite poor generally with no Charisma and leadership stand-out qualities-  all hand picked into roles they have no or little experience of and do very little in terms of leading and just collect the working teams work and pass it upwards to look good or busy. I rarely saw a WL2 being promoted to a 3 for genuine effort or was deserved.

A serious issue is the congestion caused at all work levels mainly WL2's and the 3's which creates tension, insecurity and a business with no advancement prospects. All WL1's want to be 2's despite the role just not being justified or they are not acquiring real testing experience to merit it.
  
All of this creates a poor working atmosphere, constant challenging, aggression, delays to make decisions, lack of accountability, with everyone trying to out-do each other to get noticed as the business has very little going on 

They do not live the values they preach. Never has a company placed so much emphasis on Values yet the leaders create a culture which has no regard for genuine values. Taking people with you, empowerment, management accepting challenges from their teams. None of that actually happens.

Very little chance of promotion. It is all about looking sideways. Learning to be rounded. All HR sayings for you're largely going nowhere unless somebody vacates a job.

If you ask people if they enjoy what they are working on, alot will tell you no but it's a job. What a shame as it doesn't have to be like that,..."

This was followed by 2 months of uncertainty over Xmas before lower level redundancies. The knock on effect has been far more people leaving voluntarily - including myself.
