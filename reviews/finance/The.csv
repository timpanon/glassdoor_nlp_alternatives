It's very political and it feels more like you are selling the idea of structural change more than making it. It's also a fairly toxic environment which leads new bright recruits from good schools to leave after two years. Those who stay do so because they like the status of working at the Bank, which adds to the toxicity. Navigating egos at the Bank is like walking through a minefield. The Bank has a lot of potential but it is ineffective primarily because they advance people motivated by self-aggrandizement, who were never taught how to manage teams effectively. Managers are also in a pseudo non profit environment where they aren't forced to learn or grow because they are rewarded more for creating the image of transformational change than actually doing it. The company rewards intellectual excellence and snobbery, not actual results. The ambition of the teams is always high level, but ungrounded.

Also heavy tax burden on American citizens. 

They are behind the times on flexible work arrangements. Working from home arrangements are only available on an emergency basis. In the city with the worst traffic in the country you would think they would provide more flexible arrangements to combat the burden of commuting. The IT infrastructure is sufficient to accommodate remote work but the old style of face to face meetings and chummy side conversations are a culture that will take time to change. The organization is simply unwilling to accommodate talent living outside of Washington, DC which reduces the talent pool when the 21st century lends itself to a migrating workforce. 

There is a false sense of a balanced work life balance. Vacation time is  often left unused and late evenings and weekend work is a norm.

Not a lot of accountability sometimes - too often emails disappear down a black hole. If management and operations can be improved, this place can do twice as much for development given the capability of people it attracts. Managers may say one thing to you but mean another but don’t say it to you directly because confrontation."

749,,Too big to be an efficient organization for a clear career path,2018-02-20,3.0,Consultant,"1. Great Intellectual environment - In any given day the bank has  events going on a several topics. The speakers in some of these events are exceptionally high profile.  Such a rich intellectual environment is unparalleled even in the most prestigious universities in the World. 

2.  Smart colleagues to learn from - Majority are econ PhDs, but you also have engineers, lawyers and MBAs.  I had the opportunity to work with a few MBAs who have a management consulting background and that was one of the best learning experiences of my career at the Bank. 

3. Opportunity to travel across developing countries. Access to Developing countries' policy making space - opportunity to work high level government officials such as Ministers, Presidents etc. This is  unparalleled by any organization.   

4. Opportunity to work on a wide range of public policy topics.  The Bank covers almost all topics one can think of in the area of international development. This is because the Bank is big enough to afford it unlike other aid organization that are relatively smaller and have to specialize on certain topics only. 

5. Reasonable salary and benefit package but only for staff","1.  No clear career path. Compared to management consulting firms where employees' career trajectory is clear from the very beginning, at he World Bank you have to navigate a complex office politics to even get a well deserved promotion for your work.  Considering this one can safely say that there is no HR strategy for career development.  This poor HR system impacts employees differently depending on their contract type. For young professional, which is an elite entry within the Bank, there is relatively better career progression plan. For short term consultants career progression is the worst and the most uncertain. 

2.  Perverse incentive here and there along the organizational structure probably because of the big size of the organization which further accentuates the lack of competitive force from outside as it would have been in a private sector setting.  Because of this perverse incentive, hard work is not necessarily rewarded. Sometimes it is even penalized.  As a result the best way to advance is to play the office politics well. 

3. Chaotic management system -  again because of the big size  and the lack of outside competitive force which would have forced management to set clear strategic directions, for transparency in decision making and in general for an efficient business operation.  The organizational structure is too complex with multiple layers of managers (too hierarchical)

4. Although the Bank has huge financial and intellectual resources, these resources are  not always invested wisely most likely because of the perverse incentive system that has no place for accountability. So sometimes you may work on projects that you know do no good to the supposed beneficiaries in developing countries. This may demotivate you a lot if you are passionate about your work and come in hoping to do the right thing always. 

5.  For short term consultants, the payment is too low, no insurance coverage and no clear path for career progression.  If you are young, energetic and impatient to grow, I don't recommend this except for a very short period of time if you want to test working in International organizations."

International work atmosphere.","From the inside, the World Bank can seem disorganized, bureaucratic, and unnecessarily convoluted. 

Due at least in part to its dwindling competitiveness, it cannot offer adequate benefits to 40% of its staff (and decreasing benefits to the rest). These are called 'STC's', and they receive no healthcare, no sick days, and can only work 150 days a year. This means that most of them are unemployed for about 2.5 months a year. While STC roles work well for some (especially retired folks - who earn about 3x as much as their younger counterparts + retirement benefits from the World Bank), the rest are effectively subsidizing benefits for the other 60%. It is a perverse two-part caste system - especially in a place that lives and breathes equality and equity for the world's disadvantaged.

Most people under the age of 30 are 'STC's', and many leave. So it makes me wonder: where is the World Bank going? If it cannot recruit  and keep talent like it used to, then what's left for its future?"

1006,,SR. PROGRAM OFFICER,2016-04-16,1.0,Anonymous Employee,The work itself is very interesting and global. The topics are extremely relevant for the world and there is a feeling that you work in the center of the universe. The work is quite sexy.,"The processes at the WB are their own worst enemy and the management could care less about their effectiveness and/or pain points. Almost everyone there has sold their souls to the organization in order to live in the USA. The king of every day is always the one who is the better politician.

Additionally, at the WB professionals become de-skilled very quickly. The tasks are menial and there is a tremendous compression of work everywhere and in every field. You have PhDs oftentimes doing clerical, menial tasks. They are there for the prestige and living in Washington. The environment is also very classist and some feel like slaves. Managers are very angry, narcissistic and controlling. Consultants are treated very poorly and they have no benefits. Once you look closely, it's all pure show. You have graduates from Oxford, MIT and Stanford typing and doing data entry day after day. But they travel around the world and they think that's good enough. The glamour of the organization dazzles many without giving any consideration for how their pitiful, menial tasks are hurting their careers.

DC. Folks, it's a world of economists. Almost everyone else there lacks value. I don't believe I would ever return to a place where my spirit and soul would die every day I walked through those doors. By the way, I'm a US citizen so I didn't have to sell my soul to the organization just to live in this country. I've also had REAL job in corporate America and US government so I have a basis for comparison as to how much my own career suffered and lost by staying 4 years at the Bank."

Compensation is great (especially those who don't want to be held accountable to goals)","The World Bank is a poor place to spend 3-5 years on a fixed term contract if you have 15-20 years of professional experience under your belt, particularly if you are coming from the private sector.  You will be working alongside and perhaps supervising staff who can be negative and belligerent, working with bosses who are outright bullies and dealing constantly with politics and optics between Directorates and Vice Presidencies. I learned nothing technically, aside about how to write in a Washington DC tone which is not an appreciated skill elsewhere in the world.  I view my time at the World Bank as a complete waste, and time that I will never get back.  Sure looks great on the CV, but if it is true professional growth and development that you are looking for, then look elsewhere. Working for a Fortune 500 in a senior role, I have had to relearn many managerial skills unappreciated, downplayed or even belittled at the Bank:  pragmatic and quick decision making, explicitly scoping out what is in and out, execution based on plan-do-check-act (versus the Bank's plan-plan-check-plan approach), open and transparency with my team members and strong internal networking (without having to go to the VP first)."

My manager and team are supportive and I get along with them fine.","For applicants, do your best to get in and don't mind the little people that man the online HR Operations. I'm quite new so I'm still figuring out how these HR operations folks who only identify themselves with their first names in their email responses get hired by a prestigious multilateral organization, given my experience with their unprofessional customer service, poor writing and condescending tone while I was requesting help with issues re my documents while I was an applicant. I have a feeling they outsource these jobs to a certain part of the world who, ironically, do not have professional culture-sensitivity training. The low star rating is for this experience PLUS the WBG's crappy and unintuitive online application portal and interface that is stuck in 1991.

2. Ties that bind! Almost every senior world bank manager is now a consultant for the World Bank. Why? because its hard for them to find any other place that will take them. 

3. Nepotism in selection and favoritism, are too often the rule, rather than exception. Front line talent is not recognized. But currying favors with HQ level staff and Board members, results in faster promotions. 

4. The Bank is like a guild. You have to belong to a trade and be certified or else you don't get promoted. Outside talent is hardly ever allowed in. It would be great to see mid to senior level managers rotate out of the bank and get back in. So that it proves they have fungible skills and can bring the outside in as well."

Working  with country clients is challenging and exciting. Colleagues are intelligent and every day is a great learning experience. The work itself can be extremely engaging and challenging. Work life balance can be good if the travel schedule isn't too onerous.,"1. Unbearable organizational hypocrisy and highly unequal work place, while touting shared prosperity. STCs have been sidelined in the reform process, although its a major HR problem. STCs, particularly those with G4 visas can only work for the Bank if based in the US, but are excluded from mailing lists, have no benefits, sometimes have problems getting decent rates approved, and often end up working for free given the 150 day limit per FY. Management seems unconcerned about addressing this or even integrating those STCs who spend their full time supporting the goals of the Bank and its clients to the process. Young people have a hard time breaking in. The young professional program is seen as the only way in, but excludes young people who have passed the age limit for entry. Furthermore, the Bank is very top heavy and this hasn't seemed to change with the reform process. 

2. The Bank seems to be becoming more centralized, with decision making being centralized with Global Practice Directors (some of whom are really out of touch with regional nuances and have limited understanding of client engagement) and senior management. This is highly inefficient.  

3. Too inward focused: Many staff  believe the Bank is the end-all and be-all of existence. This is particularly true of senior staff who have worked at the Bank for most of their lives. There is little engagement with other agencies on the ground on some projects. Some senior management staff are really out of touch with country contexts, but are responsible for determining work programs and budget allocation. Much could be learnt from what other development partners are doing, and while there has been some improvement recently, more could be done beyond a brown bag lunch here and there. 

4. Working on internal bureaucratic procedures can be time and energy consuming. Persons working on projects end up spending most of their time on Bank processes. It gets quite boring and frustrating when the bulk of your work involves Bank bureaucracy.  

5. Some of the people I work with at the Bank are the brightest and best in their respective fields. However, having worked at several organizations, I can safely say that the level of gossip and trash talking other colleagues I've experienced here surpasses anywhere else I have worked. You really need to be careful with what you say to colleagues."
1222,,Still a pretty incredible place to work,2014-10-30,4.0,Lead Specialist,"Definitely in operations, it's a fast-paced environment.  At this level, there is opportunity to work on a range of things- managing staff, leading complex or high-profile initiatives (country and/or regional), representing your global practice on corporate WGs or the like.  Despite the current environment, there are still so many incredibly talented people from pretty much every corner of the planet.  No single day is routine.","Senior Management, including some leadership in the Global Practices are incredibly tone-deaf and imposing new processes or measures that boggle the mind and frustrate staff.

Traveling to the client countries and engaging client governments made the work more meaningful.,Uncertainty of what to do after the experience.  The JPA was a non renewable contract.  It is a shame that one has to leave the bank after learning about the organization.  Some of the work is not transferable outside.  There was some favoritism /bias towards people whose countries had trust funds.  They tended to get nicer projects and more high profile opportunities.

1243,,Overall a stimulating and rewarding place to work,2014-08-15,4.0,Operations Officer,"Much of the job satisfaction derives from the fact that it's a mission-driven organization whose goal is to reduce poverty and raise the standard and quality of living in the poorest countries of the world. And, it is a stimulating intellectual environment - the multitude of issues that the institution works with alone makes it an interesting place to be. It's full of very smart people, very well educated, most of whom are genuinely engaged and care very much about fulfilling the organization's mission. Many, many opportunities to learn, super interesting colleagues, travel, a truly global environment, excellent benefits - maybe not as good as in the past but still in the top tier, including leave policies that model the Europeans more than the Americans.","One's experience here can vary considerably depending on who you're working with. I had almost without exception excellent managers who genuinely, actively supported my professional development. But I have colleagues and friends who didn't have such good fortune. Additionally, it relies excessively on short-term contractors and consultants, it is very difficult (or at least it was, at the time I left) to get a permanent, full-time position. There's also no getting around the fact that it's a bureaucracy, which all large organizations inevitably are, but this one perhaps more so than some corporations because it's literally political: the board of Executive Directors consists of representatives of the member countries, who meet not just once a quarter like many if not most corporate Boards, but rather twice a week in full committee. Geopolitics inevitably drives a fair amount of what happens here, but that's also partly why it's such an interesting and stimulating place to work."

Potential resources for individual projects
Potential to affect large scale impact.
In various countries, the bank has enormous influence and often have a seat at the table.
Some incredibly interesting and talented people.
Some incredibly insights that few people in the world are privy to.","Culture: at it's worse -hierarchical, politics dominates, cronyism, rent seeking behavior, and even bullying, sexicism and racial insensitivity. 

Institutional behavior: top down, top heavy and not open to change, nor dissent. Incentives encourage individualistic behavior to the extent where development and country objectives become secondary to the priorities of furthering the individual's own interests - particularly persistent amongst those who have made being 'a banker' their career objectives vs development. Particularly noxious when these people get promoted to or are in high levels of the organization.

Professional development: non existent in the substance - flows from the persistence of individualistic behavior. No incentives for mentoring and team work, and the environment can get close to predatory - people stealing ideas, taking projects, blocking projects, creating obstacles or using other people's work in their name to further their own careers.

Lack of strategic forethought as to how to manage and develop teams, people and resources.  Reverts to cronynism, reputational effects and gossip. Opportunities given along those factors (vs merit or skills). 

Inflexible and bureaucratic:  In reality, being able to process product through the institution takes more precedence than developing the project idea. Lots of paper pushing.

Some incredibly incompetent, and unprofessional people: Some, just plainly there for the benefits and taking the bank for a ride.

Lots of talking and not enough doing.

Accepting the Status Quo: having to accept: 'this is just the way it is', the wasted opportunities, the waste of resources, the misuse of people's skills and talents, the departure of talented people, the irrationality and the frustration in a non-merit based world, the potential to be better faster more dynamic in fulfilling the mission - and not doing it.
