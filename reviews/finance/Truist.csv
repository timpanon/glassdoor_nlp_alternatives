1,,Good Company; Experiencing Growing Pains,2022-04-14,4.0,Universal Banker,"- Lots of room for advancement
- Good fit if you enjoy working face-to-face with clients
- Pay is good and generally competitive
- Good access to benefits and professional training/development","- Bank just recently formed due to a merger, and many systems and departments have been slow to adapt to the new size of the bank
- Customer service is not yet able to handle the growing needs of the bank, so you often end up dealing with issues in person that should be handled over the phone with other departments."

But that's not worth the stress.,"There is a great falling away from Truist. Upper management says they want to understand why. But when they’re told, they come up with a politically correct excuse and try to discredit the reason. Teammates are extremely overworked. One person leaves, no one is replaced. An already overworked teammates gets those old teammates responsibilities. We see this time, after time, after time.  There have been many teammates that went out on leave because of stress induced events. Anxiety, cardiac issues. It's not right.  Can't tell you how many Fridays afternoons I've been on a call and not even asked if I could work Saturday, it was ""well this is when something is being ran, and you need to work it."""

Been there 2 weeks haven’t even been told of all the benefits. I feel like I am being set up to fail. Learned that Branch Leaders/ Managers are expected to be individual performers while also responsible for their team and managing the branch. I mean opening Accts, opening loans, referring to partners, servicing client accounts while hiring, coaching, operations, managing angry clients etc all while not even being trained properly.

22,,"Good people, poor pay, deceptive recruiting",2022-04-07,1.0,Collateral Management Specialist,"The people I worked with were great and my manager was supportive, though strongly limited by policy.","Biggest cons are poor pay and recruiting practices. Pay is generally well below market rate. The annual increaes max between 2-2.5%. This is below the normal rate of inflation. Over time, you are effectively paid less as a result.

My experience with recruiting was even worse. I have been studying IT and applied for an IT role internally. When I was sent an offer, it was for a lower job title than what I applied for, at a different location, and at a substantially lower pay. The recruiter even told me that the title they offered normally pays 10-12k over what they offered me. When I countered asking for the location I applied for at what they admitted was the normal rate, they refused.

I got an offer the next day from another company, at the market rate for the job."

52,,Straight downhill in the past 18 months,2022-03-29,2.0,Anonymous Employee,"The money the past 2 years or so has been great, but it doesn't make up for the way we are being treated.","I came from BB&T before the merger with SunTrust to form Truist. We had a fantastic team. We had a rhythm, got our work done, were trusted by our management and had some fun along the way.

The ""new"" mentality is teammate (employee) = stupid, lazy, inept. High priced consultant= smart.

I have seen outstanding employees with decades of experience who are leaders in their fields completely marginalized in favor of bringing in high paid consultants. The consultants don't know our systems, history, business, and in many cases don't even know the basics of the tools they were hired to implement. They deliver sub-par work then they move on to the next 6 or 7 figure project that we hire them for and the teammates are left to sweep up the poop off the floor.

During a recent go-live our contractors did the bare minimum then dropped broken incomplete work on the employees as they moved on. We put in 80+ hour weeks including some 20 hour days. We missed weekends, holidays, evenings, medical appointments. Just keep working. Unacceptable.

The culture of BB&T is gone and the new culture is one that I am not interested in working in."

57,,Edge $ell,2022-03-24,1.0,Branch Leader I-III,"Working here you will get to meet a lot of people. It will give you the opportunity to keep an eye out for recruiters in your area at other companies, local businesses with open opportunities, maybe a bank area leader from a smaller bank that cares is a client ect.","Working while short staffed year after year can be frustrating, especially when there's been requests for more help and they are denied. Additionally, there is a lot of confusion because the bank does not offer training or up to date resources. If you receive training, they will expect you to force yourself through it and guess while taking clients. You won't remember a thing you trained on. Training time would take you away from your ability to sell and the bank is short to begin with. No one knows what they are doing because we are all abandoned with no clear direction. The wait times are so outlandish that all you have to do is make 2-3 calls with a client and your day is over. During the wait times, you can update your resume in the background. The only direction made clear by higher ups is to sell and sell more. Most of the time you just want break maybe one meal/facility break during the week, or maybe you want that pto day approved that your boss tells you not to key in the request, because it is too short to let you use your pto. The bank will say that they are about work life balance but they never tell you the ratio of that balance, you'll find that out yourself. The bank will go over metrics, spreadsheets all week for sales, but as soon as you provide them with metrics like how their pay isn't competitive enough to the market or how other branches might be staffed more who happen to be chummy with their leadership, they clam up and no longer want to use metrics. I would say overall morale is going to be one of the biggest cons, if you have worked here for a while and people trust you, they will openly tell you that they are considering or planning an exit regardless of their tenure. No one feels appreciated no matter how many generic e-mails come out saying that they appreciate the thousand recipients in the e-mail."

This place is just like Wells Fargo, they only care about pushing products and not for the benefit of the client. Upper management, especially the area president and the regional president is so far removed from the daily operations that they have no clue what is going on.

We are not agents to this company or even treated as people, all they care about are the numbers they can report to corporate. Constant turnover due to this, no agents are held accountable for mistakes, meaning other agents have to solve problems caused by other different agents when they arise. Have never felt less respected by an employer"
76,,Hard,2022-03-15,1.0,Branch Leader,The pro's are that you have a job.,"It is very frustrating when you come into work and the same problems persist every single day for months and years. It is hard to have your voice heard although you receive generic emails to thousands saying that ""Truist Cares"" although you never feel or see the caring. Your clients have normal expectations although the company does not give you the resources, support or motivation to meet the needs of customers. The processes are so unclear and procedures changing daily, you'll never know what is right vs wrong, nor where to check, who to call ect. The systems are constantly broken and things getting moved around. You are left abandoned with very high and unrealistic goals. There is no incentive to reach these goals because if you do, they will get higher and you won't get paid for doing so. The incentives are so low compared to other banks, I am surprised they call them incentives here. If you perform better than everyone then you will be rewarded with the same reward as everyone else. The low performers may even be paid higher than you in most cases. The pay is not worth the amount of work and torture you will succumb to. There is always turnover and the new people have less training than most banks, they are set up for instant failure. The existing people have no voice and are unappreciated to say the least, so morale is very low no matter what you are trying to get done. The bank is extremely high paced with upset clients due to the issues and you will have to be that person to fix something that maybe someone else messed up because they just don't care anymore. It becomes very frustrating when this goes on for so long. The new Truist company does not send anyone around like the previous heritage organization did, so you can never share your sentiments and frustrations. They are afraid to see or hear the truth and would rather hide. The teammate surveys don't even come out anymore after they got so low consistently, they just don't want feedback. It is very difficult to obtain a break or use facilities because every location is extremely short, I don't even bring water in to drink or food anymore because of this and this is years on in. Nothing looks like it will ever get fixed. Sales goals continue to go up as customer service score goals continue to decrease. The expectation is that you sell and when you do, the person you refer to may be on their way out or just bogged down and not motivated themselves because the lack of appreciation is not limited to one department. If your sale goes a few weeks before your person works it, you are lucky and by then the client is not interested anymore and found another bank. If for some reason they happen to be interested, then the sale might not book properly because the bank has issues with sales reporting properly and you will be asked to fill out an excel sheet remembering any sales in the last 3 months that have not posted which is an impossible task being that you can't even take a break due to the staffing shortages. In short, you basically will not get the sale anyways and it will reflect your performance and pay and advancement ect because the bank does not know how to run their company properly and keep everyone happy. You will also be lacking significant training and continue to receive more and more tasks and responsibilities with no pay. When ever changes come, you will never be made aware until you have a live client in front of you which makes bad client experiences. Someone will say oh that was in an email like few months ago, meanwhile you have no time to read emails because you are so short staffed and the bank can't afford to allow you to be away and take training. The low pay for the work is going to have every recruiter in the area reaching out to you if you make a linkedin and say that you work here. Every place knows that Truist is not doing well and pays very low so you will receive constant offers to interview elsewhere. The call times at Truist will drive you insane because you may not even be calling the correct department and the clients are upset about them so they come inside and you literally have to tell them that you call the same number and they want to flip over your desk. It is a very tough job for the pay, if the pay was a fair wage I would say come to the bank but it has all of the headaches of a big bank but lacks the pay to a significant level that you would rather panhandle on the streets than work here. The short staffing is unbelievable and it makes your team cry. I try daily to make sure my team doesn't cry. I would say look elsewhere if you are considering working here"

Bunch of caddy women with their noses up making any one entering the bank as a employee miserable. Within a couple of weeks there, was told I must use any PTO I have that will accumulate through the end of the year. It was mandatory- must enter it immediately. Now, because I left before I accumulated the PTO, they think I’m going to pay them back for it lol. The merger is a disaster. Everyone’s online banking and debit cards are screwed up and the bank isn’t giving the employees the tools they need to be successful. NEVER GET LUNCH BREAKS- PLAN TO WORK A 9 HOUR DAY WITH TWO RESTROOM BREAKS IF YOU ARE LUCKY. Extremely outdated decor, equipment, and methods of working. BOPs are a joke with no responsibility, they just give direction (which isn’t always good) and get no accountability for incorrect guidance and it will fall on you. When the big wigs come in, all the ladies pull their high heels out of their drawers and change shoes so they can be cute for them. Was about the only time I saw them even smile. Was never compensated for all of the opening and closing procedures throughout my time here. Hours of sitting in the parking lot watching for signals that I was never paid for."
83,,Client Service Agent II,2022-03-11,3.0,Client Service Agent II,Great Benefits. Great with location.,Communication and organization sucks with the supervisors.
84,,From Best To Worst,2022-03-11,1.0,IT Manager,Bonuses and remote work are the only two pros.,"I was a long time BBT employee. BBT was the best company I had ever worked for and I felt like there were unlimited career opportunities as well as outstanding support for employees across the entire organization. Unfortunately, the company was taken over by Sun Trust. Two years into this merger (takeover) and Truist is now the worst company I've ever worked for and there are ZERO career opportunities. Truist does not promote, there have been none for two years, and the company does not give raises to managers. Hundreds of employees have jumped ship, most of them excellent BBT managers who have been forced out via early retirement. Suntrust (Truist) is a company run by contractors at many levels. They do not understand nor do they care about process, best practice, or standards. The former CEO of BBT, once beloved by his people, is now looked upon by his ex-employees as someone who just destroyed not only the company but his legacy and left us all holding a big steaming bag. Kelly King got his golden parachute and in the process BBT  is history. His legacy is that he betrayed all of his employees and he is no longer much liked or seen as anyone who accomplished anything. If you're looking for a career or an organization where you'll feel supported keep looking. This place is a disaster. Many managers have between 20 and 200 direct employees because they've eliminated so many management layers to save money. So many careers have been destroyed by the takeover and I don't know of anyone who is happy here."

105,,Merger Blues,2022-03-03,1.0,Relationship Banker,BB&T was a great company because of the consideration given to employees and the over-all atmosphere even if they were somewhat understaffed.

The pay is super low in comparison to other sales jobs, merchant or general account executive jobs.

116,,Not a rewarding experience,2022-02-25,1.0,Assistant Vice President Investment Analyst,Work life balance is acceptable,"Compensation is not competitive - I personally received $0 in raises or bonuses my last 2 years at the company. 
There is very little action taken to foster the career growth of junior / mid level employees. In this role specifically, there are no performance benchmarks to measure up against and your evaluation as an employee is purely subjective.
Post merger, the reporting structure is disjointed. From my seat in New York, I had a manager in Virginia who reported to a manager in Pennsylvania. Leadership was hard to come by.
Company technology is so far behind that even simple tasks are convoluted and time consuming. It is hard to appear efficient and productive with the tools you are provided.
Teams are consistently short staffed across the company, making life difficult for everyone.
In my opinion, working for Truist has all of the drawbacks of working for a big bank (beaurocracy, etc.), with none of the prestige."

122,,Wishing on 5 Stars,2022-02-23,4.0,Branch Banker III,"My work family, my long term clients and the connections I have made with the community.",The pay is a HUGE one. The work load and expectations that are placed on one person when they can barely afford daycare for their child on what they make. The being yelled and cussed at by clients when they find out I’m not a miracle worker or they actually have to pick up and call a service center.
123,,Very Strong Company to Work For,2022-02-22,5.0,Internal Auditor II,"Benefits are above competitors in my experience searching jobs as well as my wife's.

The banks are understaffed to the point of working 1 or 2 people per branch and closing others (even though 1 person  working violates branch policy). You are always expected to work over your hours but they don't want to give raises. Branches are so busy most days you can't get a lunch break or even go to the restroom. Upper management will do anything to keep branches open including slaving employees for months of overtime with no breaks. In my 3 years we have been constantly understaffed and eveytime we hire people they  quit after a few weeks or months due to exhaustion.  You are still expected to make perfect survey scores and meet goals. DO NOT WORK HERE.

They withhold information and will not share it to the detriment of customers and shareholders.
The two cultures couldn’t be any different. And management does nothing to improve the situation."
212,,Work/ Life balance is a joke!** Except for managers and leaders.,2022-01-19,1.0,Specialty Service Team Member,Co-workers are cool. Good rapport.,"They sell you these dreams of paid vacation time off or sick days. 
In reality coordination of your PTO is a maze full of obstacles. Every time you ask for a day off you get an immediate flat “can’t be done “. No matter the time of the year. Even if it is way far from traditional holidays you’ll be denied. So you end up accumulating lots of pto hours that you’ll be losing at the end of the year. You won’t get them paid if you leave either. So basically the system is set up for your “cease and desist” in regards of your vacation (what a joke). This was my experience in Orlando. Bilingual care is overworked. They force you to train in different skill even translate calls and don’t get paid extra for the skill you already have. That said, brace yourself you’ll be paid way more elsewhere. There is no benefit in working with the company. Also leads and management will determine if you can move or branch out to other areas. Most of the time the answer will be no. 
That means that YOU WON’T GROW WITHIN THE COMPANY. Managers will even crush team coaches opportunities to grow. I witnessed that."

Leadership knowledge and help is not there
Inconsiderate Area leaders, Region Leaders,
Blended branches were the worst experience 
Technology sucks
Slow branches don't have chance for incentive but they expect you to work long hours. 
If salaried they don't care how many hours you work and try to force working as long as possible. 
No work life balance! 
2 weeks standard time off is ridiculous
Staffing is horrible 
Leadership doesn't know how to listen for understanding 
Your branch can have 2 or 3 people working but they constantly bug you about the many 100's of expired calls instead of focusing on your team and clients 
Sales, sales, sales seem to be more important than anything 
No development 
Old school leaders 
Feels like a true example of modern day slavery
You won't feel like you matter unless you suck up to the right people
Even though BB&T had more equity in the merger it has been a Suntrust take over and Suntrust has been known to be horrible from all my years in banking. 
We lost Kelly King this year as CEO and got this generic, impersonal, guy and uncaring Leadership .
This place is a circus where they ""talk the talk""
One region leader said he wasn't concerned with losing people and that attitude was the beginning of our current environment. Most leaders don't have the time to listen, there are few who care but still can't do anything about it... not a good environment. 
If 1 person says 1 bad thing about you they automatically believe it with no research. 
No trust, no support, no values although they lead every call with purpose, mission and values
I'll be leaving soon.

244,,Decent Stability,2021-12-29,2.0,Senior Relationship Banker,"All in all, bankers live a very stable and comfortable life. The only pro I can think of is that Truist pays slightly higher wages for new talent, than their competitors.","Where to begin......for what it’s worth, this bank did not seem 100% ready to merge. It has not been a smooth process for the clients, ESPECIALLY the employees in the South Florida market. A lot of BB&T employees have a really bad culture, bad attitude and bad habits. Most of the employees both at Suntrust and BB&T have had the same job titles for years. You’ll find people that have been relationship bankers for 10+ years and are fine with that. That could be because they are lazy or it is unlikely they will receive a promotion. Also, C Level management went around asking employees for their opinion as far as “What should our new name and slogan be?” “What color scheme should we roll out?” All these minuscule questions that shows us as employees that they probably weren’t very ready to merge. Honestly, the only good thing about BB&T is they have an outstanding commercial RE lending product and Suntrust has a decent home equity line product. If you are looking for an institution to to spend 10-20 years at, if you’re 10 years away from retirement and wants pension, or if you’re young and just need the banking experience, then this is the place for you. But if you’re considering switching employers in South Florida, stay far away. Also, the quarterly bonuses are a joke!"
245,,Consider other options,2021-12-27,3.0,Retail Team Leader,thankful to still have a job.,"Hours, they nickel and dime your time during the scheduling to work 6 days a week. But they preach work-life balance. Insurance costs are high. Lack of vision(forethought) abut how the branches would actually be affected by the merger, especially blended branches. That was one of the worst decisions they could have made. It was confusing all around for customers and staff. If you are single or right out of school this is not a bad stepping stone but if you have a family run. I dont see myself buidling a career here."

[]: Company’s basically being forced to value infosec, not because they want to, which means you can count on paying for your own training while not getting any work time to work on it
[]: Leadership all the way up doesn’t have realistic expectations for technical teams
[]: Last boss was good, but got a new boss during the summer and he did the following things:
1.	Stopped tracking most of the work and then accused us of not working or not working hard enough
2.	Stopped the QA process and then said our work was sloppy
3.	Clearly hadn’t led any technical teams: didn't even know the certification I was studying for

253,,Terrible Work Culture - High Risk for Burnout,2021-12-18,1.0,Financial Risk Analyst,"The main, and depending on your department, only advantages of working at Truist are the health insurance offerings and build-up of vacation days over the years.","Horrible work culture. I have experienced a non-stop overload of work along with my colleagues. Prior to Covid, they would fire committed workers regularly and without warning, citing budget cuts, creating an insecure atmosphere for all workers. Now they are facing an extremely high turnover rate because workers are quitting, no longer willing to work under the same conditions. With limited human resources, they put never-ending pressure on employees without considering their capacities and risk for burnout. It is simply growing inhumane."
254,,Servicing specialist,2021-12-18,3.0,Consumer Care Representative,Great Benefits such as vacation and insurance,It is hard to get days off and they are not flexible with schedules. If something comes up that's not preplanned they do not accommodate your only option is to call out.

257,,Consider Your Options,2021-12-15,2.0,Relationship Banker,"The only pros I can give are decent benefits, with the option to purchase vacation time, and the set hours Mon-Fri with weekends off.","The cons outweigh the pros for me, the work life balance and turnover make it extremely difficult to succeed in your role. The current merger is hard on both employees and the clients. They promote a toxic environment. The pay is not great especially considering the changes that are taking place, and the amount of responsibility you 'll have. Can only promote after a year so if you come in at a less than desired salary expect to be paid that salary for at least a year. To promote up you have to be consistent in your performance which I explained can be hard to do depending on the environment you work in. I am looking to move on from the company as soon as possible."

Engineer's are treated as consumable resources working multiple nights a week to ""meet timelines"". Double work planned (and hearing of triple in the future) to ""meet timelines"" when we don't have enough staff for what we have. ""Pay for performance"" touted last year fell flat due to limits/quotas on the higher ratings. Salary has essentially been frozen for 2 years, even if you took a promotion.

Executive management literally sold out thousands of hard working, great people and did it under the guise of being ""better together"" with SunTrust. I'm not just a disgruntle former successful leader of a large team, I am one of THOUSANDS of people who got the shaft by a company that I had poured myself into for over 16 years. I know there are many former employees at SunTrust who feel the same way. The issue wasn't the idea, it was the execution by executive management. Smartest guy in the room during merger discussions was Bill Rogers (CEO of SunTrust and now of Truist). This is a masterclass in how not to do a merger. BB&T bought SunTrust and yet Suntrust literally runs Truist and all of BB&T."

The whole Idea of “At Work” or “Financial Wellness” or Whatever you want to disguise account pushing as, is nothing but a sham. The strategy has proven to be ineffective in almost all markets, which has caused major stress on the teammates. You’re told that as a consultant you do NOT teach Financial Literacy.. Instead your job is to move the individuals you speak with  to “Take Action” (opening a product). Then you’re told to present the program to Decision Makers and their Employees in a manner that seeks to Help the employee better understand their finances, and focuses on modules and resources for financial literacy? Basically say anything you need to say to get in with these employers & get checking accounts out of them. Leadership did not have the ability to support, because they’re not actually able to do the job that their teammates are expected to do. The executive leadership established catastrophic goals that are absolutely unachievable, and then they attempt to hold you accountable to them. Take a look at the data, and see how many consultants are hitting goal even 10% of the time…. It’s not difficult to see that you have a group of consultants chasing down branch opened accounts to put their names on & take credit for the sale. All the while you’re being told that you’re just doing it wrong…But if you present the program the “Right Way” you will hit your goals 100% of the time. Good luck."

375,,Lots of potential but lots of flaws,2021-10-03,2.0,Senior Software Engineer,"Truist has some amazing workers that are as talented as they are friendly. While leadership often played politics the people you interact with each day are very supportive. I will genuinely miss my coworkers and wish them well for the future.

Technology lags behind industry trends but the company is making strides to improve. In recent years there have been significant changes to modernize systems including CI, Cloud, and Data. This also presents unique opportunities for those with modern skills. Their website and app are among the cleanest of the big banks too.

The retirement package is impressive with a 6% 401k match after a year of service and a small pension plan starting after five years of service. The pension works out to a yearly payout in retirement of 1% of your salary multiplied by the number of years you worked at Truist so it isn't enough to retire on but should provide some extra spending money in the twilight years. Health insurance has several options and can be reasonably affordable though this comes with a catch. Benefits information can be easily found through a public website so you know what to expect when going through interviews.

As a whole the company is in a strong position to be a major player in the banking space. The brand is respected as is the CEO and they have offices in hot areas like Charlotte, Raleigh, and Atlanta. If the company can make some key pivots in their approach to technology and their treatment of technology employees then there is a lot of potential for success and growth.","Overall compensation for technology jobs needs a major overhaul. Paid time off is an embarrassing 10 days and doesn't increase to 15 until five years of service. Some recent hires have negotiated for 15 to start but the idea of people having to negotiate to get the industry minimum standard is sad. Employees do get 10 sick days a year but good luck using more than half without getting an earful. Health insurance is only affordable if you participate in an intrusive health monitoring program that regularly checks everything from your bloodwork to your body fat percentage to your eating habits and even your oxygen levels. Vision and dental plans are middle of the road.

Salaries are 10-20% below the industry average. In early 2020 senior leadership hired a firm to evaluate the company salary bands and promised that changes would be made based on the findings. Though the study was completed in late 2020 the data has still not been released to employees in spite of leadership saying that it would be transparent. The only changes made were updates to broaden job bands which led to less descriptive job titles and wider salary spreads with even low level engineering roles in the same area now having a spread of over 30k. Meanwhile leadership claims that the study found the company salaries to be fair without providing proof. Leadership has also ignored any questions in town halls about the study or low salaries and even angrily announced at a call in the spring that they were tired of being asked about low pay and wouldn't answer those questions again. In this same frustrated exchange the leadership person talking accidentally let it slip that the study had found most employees were within 20% of the industry midpoints. Realizing their mistake they quickly tried to put a positive spin by pivoting to the benefits and claiming that the 20% figure was really good compared to some places. Bonuses are also misleading. If you qualified for say a 15% bonus then really you'd get 10% as a good performer. Along with the salary study leadership had also announced that bonuses would be revamped to be more competitive but all they really did was make it look nicer without being any better. Instead of the old 15% bonus you now qualify for a range of 0-30% so recruiters can tell prospective hires they can get up to a 30% bonus but really it's still a 10% payout. Don't expect to catch up with raises either. Recruitment and senior leadership constantly talk about pay for performance but raises barely keep up with inflation and the difference between a high and low performer will be a fraction of a percent. Pay for performance here really means that you'll pay for good performance by being asked to take on more work.

Nearly every technology group is being stretched to their limit and then a bit further still. Expect to work at least 50 hours a week in a more reasonable group or 60+ in more critical teams. Certain key contributors and backend support teams are regularly putting in over 80 hours. This can include nights, weekends, holidays, and vacation days. What's most frustrating about the overwork is that there isn't any clear reason for it. Senior leadership keeps using the merger as an excuse to come up with crazy deadlines but they aren't consulting with the business side or with the employees that know the products to determine if a date makes sense or if mandated work is necessary at all. When people question a deadline senior leadership says it has to be met because we committed to the date but they gloss over the part where they created the date and the project in the first place and committed the team without asking. Of course when teams miss a deadline they get chewed out by their boss's boss and in the event a team succeeds then their boss's boss takes most of the credit. Coupled with the low pay and lack of vacation time many groups are facing a high degree of turnover that leadership refuses to openly acknowledge. In one town hall when someone asked how leadership was addressing the burnout and churn leadership responded by saying that they work hard too and we should think about the impact our work will have for the customers.

The handling of the merger and Covid have been messy. There were cases where teams were told that they'd have to relocate then after half the team had moved or quit the teams were told they could stay put for the moment and even then leadership refuses to take a firm position on whether future relocations will or won't be needed. Some teams have had several managers within the course of a year along with changing priorities each time. Suntrust and BBT were two very different companies and leaders from both keep trying to make power moves leading to a lot of confusion and backpedaling on projects. Prior to Covid the company was expressly against any remote work and while the stance has shifted somewhat to a hybrid model leadership has yet to define how this hybrid will work and is still against any permanent remote possibilities. Senior leadership keeps claiming that they're hearing from everyone about a desire to go back to the office but I've yet to meet anyone outside senior leadership that is eager to go back. While other companies have gone the extra mile to make sure that employees feel appreciated in these trying times Truist has taken a decidedly different approach. Instead of extra days off, impromptu raises, or meaningful gifts employees here instead have gotten items like a book about the history and importance of Truist or a little Truist pin that we're encouraged to wear on our clothes to show our Truist pride. The most embarrassing was perhaps the pamphlet every employee received touting the culture of diversity at Truist yet on page two there was a picture of the executive team which is almost exclusively a bunch of old white guys in suits.

Adoption of agile is the typical scaled waterfall approach. If you've had even a cursory training on agile principles then you'll recognize that much of what teams are told to do doesn't make sense. Need to size a story? The agile leadership group tells teams to use a chart that directly equates points to a set number of days. Team struggling to get work done in a sprint? Let's close the old stories and open new ones for remaining tasks. Want to increase velocity? Double the team size then wonder why so many meetings run over. Finishing a Big Room planning? Instead of putting dependent stories on the boards for other teams it's better to use a series of confusing excel documents in Sharepoint. Looking for agile training? Agile leadership are too busy trying to look good to senior leadership to do any real coaching so here's a brief Powerpoint to review instead.

While the company is slowly improving it's technologies it can't seem to let go of old practices that slow everyone down. Each month there are several hours of mandatory eLearnings that have nothing to do with your job role. Assigned laptops are mid spec and only get replaced after five years of use. Developers can only have standard access to their own machines, no Admin or Elevated rights, and can only have software installed through a dated ticketing system. Getting new software added to the list takes months if the request gets accepted at all. Little to no money is approved for personal development like certification courses or local conferences. A mandatory Outlook plugin forces you to select a risk classification every single time you send an email. Perhaps the biggest issue with process is the compartmentalization of product components. Within the same product there can be separate teams for web, web services, backend, and database and while most people get along every team has it's own separate and often contradictory processes.

The senior leadership at Truist is out of touch. They think that building a positive culture means coming up with fancy statements without having to change how the business operates. They claim transparency but prescreen town hall questions, have a system in place to track who asked a particular question, and avoid any touchy topics. They say we're all in this together yet can't be bothered to set up a skip level or send a legitimate gift to express gratitude as we're expected to work late nights, weekends, and holidays to meet the awful deadlines that they imposed. While the company pulls in record numbers and leadership gives themselves big bonuses or promotions for successes achieved by our hard work our already low salaries stagnant under disappointing raises. The same leadership team that insists a software developer who never interacts with clients has to come into the office several times a week and is unprofessional wearing anything less than khakis and a tucked in dress shirt also wonders why the company has issues recruiting developers in some of the hottest locations in the country or why anyone would leave."

I can say big departments can work on better morale and motivating in stressful job atmosphere. Would benefit the client and our teammates. We need to encourage as well to stay strong and as ONE TEAM.

411,,Teammates come first!,2021-09-10,5.0,Branch Manager,Throughout the Covid-19 pandemic they company put their teammates first by giving out a one time bonus to all and gift cards as a thank you/ token of appreciation!,"Not quick enough to hire people when resignation letters are handed in, causing staffing issues at branch level."
412,,Review fr former Employer Truist,2021-09-10,3.0,Relationship Banker,"The company had great hours, teammates that were pleasant to work with, had great vision, mission and values.",The thing this company lacks is great management. They do not truly listen to the concerns of their employees and make the work environment hard to work under. When employees feel unappreciated then that's where you see turn over.
413,,Micro-Management by managers that do not know what are doing,2021-09-09,2.0,Operations,There are some very good people in trenches with you.,"Managers are totally unfamiliar with what is needed to get the job done. Preen around and micro-manage….and cause chaos and drama. They really do not know a lot. Is quite a shame as it could be great company, but everyone pulling in different directions. Sales oriented to a fault."

417,,Hoped for better,2021-09-06,1.0,Branch Leader,"The teams in the branches are amazing, grow very close primarily due to having to rely on each other in order to overcome upper management's terrible decision making.",No synergy between BB&T teams and Suntrust teams. Regional leadership is non-existent. No branch support. Short staffing. Branch closures and talent leaving from “voluntary” severance packages. Training for new Truist sales systems and teller systems is horrible. A lot of talk about culture and values but it is all fluff and no substance or meaning just something management has to say. Very disingenuous way to attempt to hide the real sales pressure. Fake leaders with a lot of back stabbing while jockeying for roles at the end of the merger.
418,,Great moral company,2021-09-06,5.0,Bank Operations Specialist,CEO is very positive and in touch with employees.,The pay could be better.
419,,Truist Bank,2021-09-06,3.0,Branch Coordinator,Decent pay and benefits. Opportunity for future growth,Poorly executed merger. Two cultures two banks under one roof. Short staffing makes long days
420,,Too much work for the pay,2021-09-03,1.0,Senior Relationship Banker,"401k match, dental, vision, life insurance, and retirement benefits.","They expect you to do the job of 5 people with the pay of one. As a banker, you have to be in the teller line and at the desk area back and forth. At the office, you have to answer the phone as you were working in a call center for customer service because customer service transfers all clients back to the branch. You are expected to perform and the manager is always in the office with his door close making personal calls while you are slaving away. You have to go to DMV to perfect liens yet! something that must be done by the loan department, also you have to deal with HELOC and customer service. It was better before when it was BBT. With the merge, everything is getting worse. The company pays high salaries for useless positions that are only doing conference calls all day long instead of being productive. Horrible!"
421,,Very good,2021-09-01,5.0,Licensed Mortgage Loan Originator,Best work environment and supportive supervisor,Pressure not enough time to pass final exam
422,,Needs to adjust priorities,2021-09-01,1.0,Anonymous Employee,salary and the clients if you enjoy working with people.,"Training is bare bones to say the least. After a few days doing virtual training and 2 weeks of web based training you are expected to take clients with no assistance. if you are in a blended branch there is a chance you won't have any guidance from leadership because they know about as much as you do. the training is no help. you learn how to talk and make a sale ""barely"" but no actual assistance with using the systems and learning the policies or procedures. you're supposed to have all of these one on one meetings which do not happen because everyone is too busy for you. but time will be found to scold you if you didn't make a sale or greet 1 person. very predatory in my opinion."
423,,Diversity & Inclusion is a joke,2021-09-01,1.0,Branch Manager,Good environment along footprint BUT not in CPA,"Lack of leadership, upper management does not have an idea of what is going on at branches level. Mission and values? Are a joke / do not exist. Teammates and leaders discriminate clients and bankers, unless they are white men. No option to grow for women, unless you are one the “favorites” and of course white. Poor management, poor training, low pay, any reason will be good to do not pay you your incentive ( like motivator is not accurate) HR is a joke, will not be for you, they are there to protect the bank’s name reputation. If you speak up you are fired. Leaders love to “coach out” those who tell them their weaknesses."
424,,Sink or Swim pretty much!,2021-08-31,4.0,Client Care Specialist,Pay wasnt bad although most financial call centers pay more now. Good Benefits PTO plan 401k,"THE CLIENTS THAT CALL IN FOR ASSISTANCE! You can be a top tier worker, numbers great etc but if you dont know the right people you WILL NOT move up. No work life balance you will burn out quick in this position. Take care of yourself because in the end, you can and will be replaced."
425,,Benefits,2021-08-30,4.0,Branch Operations Officer,Health Benefits are very competitive,Merit raise and overall pay for the amount of job responsibilities
426,,Mixed,2021-08-28,4.0,Financial Crime Analyst,"Back office is great, relaxed atmosphere on specific teams, expanding benefits outside work.","Retail is treated poorly, required in person positions primarily in company,"
427,,"If you’re in State College, PA do yourself a favor and look elsewhere",2021-08-27,1.0,Financial Service Specialist,"Benefits 
Pension after 5 years
401k with 6% match","Terrible management. Makes excuses and will blame everything on the team. Never holds themselves accountable. Higher ups don’t care, although they chose pretty words to make you think they do. Believe in creating an environment of “happiness” but do absolutely nothing to ensure that. Doesn’t care if people quit. They consider one person running two drive up lanes and the lobby by themselves over staffed because it fits their “truist model” You will never get praise for your work. No recognition, but will criticize you over everything. No chance of promotion or raise. Will promise you a promotion, wait months and when asked again they say it won’t be happening. INCREDIBLY TOXIC ENVIRONMENT."

Been working there for 8 years and have had lots of career growth.",No negative feedback. Have had a great experience with SunTrust and now Truist. If I had to pick one thing is incentive but I think once the merger finishes they will go back to giving more.
435,,Bank with an eye on IT,2021-08-18,3.0,Infrastructure Analyst,"- Values it's IT and puts heavy funding on Infrastructure
- Tends to hire full-time workers instead of contractors
- Excellent management staff that seem to care about your day to day life
- Good work/life balance","-Still very much behind on IT in several technology areas, using equipment that was retired by Microsoft years ago for example
- Change process can be very slow and rigorous
- Requires work from office, even though we are in the middle of a pandemic and even though it has the capabilities to support all teammates for work from home, for lower level employees."
436,,Great place to start out,2021-08-18,4.0,Associate I,Very focused on junior talent development,Merger related activities are meticulous—however should subside as soon as fully integrated
437,,Great place to start a career,2021-08-17,5.0,Analyst,"Good pay, hours and people","Limited opportunities, high turnover and very political"
438,,"Big on Talk, Not So Big on Action",2021-08-17,2.0,Learning Facilitator,Job security - seems to be a ton of work due to the merger/conversion needs.,Leadership severely lacks diversity (although they like to act like they are leading the charge). Compensation is probably 10-15% below industry average. No focus on development of relevant skills in professional roles
439,,Work with many great people at Truist,2021-08-16,5.0,Capacity Planning Engineer,"In the IT group anyway, Truist has flexible hours. You get to work with good teammates. Many of my team mates have been with the company for more than 10 years. That should say a lot.",There are many organizational restructurings. This may or may not be a big deal to some people. Personally these really don't effect me very often.
440,,Toxic and exhausting,2021-08-16,2.0,Universal Banker,"Decent pay and benefits, and you get your birthday off. Everything else has gotten pretty awful","Very negative environment with toxic coworkers who make fun of people and complain all day every day. Favoritism is rampant, and staffing shortages going back years have gotten much worse with the pandemic, so now a skeleton crew is stretched even thinner by having to cover multiple branches at increasing distances"
441,,Great Experience,2021-08-14,4.0,Senior Relationship Banker,You gain great experience and training to develop a strong skill set. Great culture and some good incentives if you meet yours goals,"Not much room or programs for advancement, advancement is self paced.

442,,.,2021-08-13,1.0,Currently Unemployed,BB&T was great before SunTrust took them over.,Everything - Exec Management is horrible. Terrible culture.
443,,Great place to work,2021-08-13,5.0,Business Analyst,Love working for Truist. Amazing culture and benefits. Been with them for 8 years and there has always been opportunity to grow my career.,There’s a lot of uncertainty due to the Merger but I think once that is done it should be back to normal.
444,,Salary,2021-08-13,3.0,Relationship Banker,Starting salary is good coming in.,Growth in the company is slow
445,,Avoid the Greensboro NC Contact Center,2021-08-13,1.0,Contact Center Representative,"From my experience there are very few positives to working at the Greensboro Contact Center. At the very least, It’s a pay check and ample employee parking.","The cons definitely out weight the pros to working here, this place has a severe racial problem, BB&T-Truist may do all this talk about being inclusivity, but it’s just a fake front. On my first day there, I sat down at a table of other people in my new hire class, everyone at the table just got up and immediately left. Expect to be isolated and marginalized the entire time you are there. And the training is shoddy at best, I would a ask a question to my team leader, and would be told “You figure it out” or go YFIO. And one worst part of the job, is the call auditors, who contributed to the improvement of the calls, they complained about the way I said hello, they want everyone to sound like Madea."
446,,Toxic,2021-08-13,1.0,Administrative Assistant,Decent pay if your new there you start out making more then current employees,"No teamwork, impossible sales goals, no flexibility, managers talk about you when your not there, not proper training, lunch breaks cut in half"

I really enjoy working with people and the upper management takes cares of its employees.
448,,Ok,2021-08-10,3.0,Financial Specialist,Great for trying to get loan for home or vehicle.,Merger policy changes make things difficult for both employees and clients
449,,Look elsewhere.,2021-08-09,2.0,Client Service Representative,Same benefits as other banks. 2 weeks vacation with the option to purchase more.,Sick time. You cannot use all of your sick time or you will get fired. Training is not good at all. Its trainers read from powerpoints and throw you into the water without help. You learn as you take calls.
450,,Good place to work with poor benefits,2021-08-07,3.0,Software Engineer III,"Work life balance, Work environment, flexible with remote work, good technologies, encourages to learn new things, supportive leader ship, recognizes your efforts","Poor health insurance

I’ve been challenged quite a bit and I really see a lot of career progression.","Nothing really yet. Everything has been really good and the work has been challenging. Nothing else to mention really, it’s amazing."
455,,Horrible Experience,2021-08-05,1.0,Relationship Banker,Nothing to say here that is positive. The experience working at BB&T now Truist quickly became worse and worse over the almost 4 years I worked here.,"Management is essentially non existent and the ones who are present don’t have any more knowledge than relationship bankers. I had a Suntrust manager and essentially trained him, with no pay ofcourse. Since the merger the dynamic has changed entirely. More work load and no money. I was fulfilling the role of three people and being paid like a new hire. I was the sole reason that the branch I was in was even able to function. When we finally received another banker on staff she was vocal about her pay and stated she was paid 10k more than the salary I was receiving. I had the work load of three people and was expected to perform and hit goals. I have never been so mistreated at a company. For months it was just me and one teller. We couldn’t take lunches, breaks and could barely have restroom breaks. I could go on and on. Worst work experience of my career thus far."
456,,Retail Banking - Personal Banker,2021-08-04,2.0,Relationship Banker,Interact with the public and always something to do.,"Ever increasing micromanagement, having to deal with the public, sales position with sales goals."

Teammates are competent in their roles and largely collegial.","Management has established a cannibalistic culture due to nearly annual major strategic shifts. Each year employees expect cuts and will step on your head to prevent it being them. The constant strategy shifts also create whiplash for clients with constant changes in what it takes to form a successful relationship. In addition to annual reductions in force, Truist Securities suffers from additional turnover of good employees because management is dishonest about bonus pay. I don't say this lightly, but the management of Truist Securities lies about bonus pay and what is required to earn it. If you point out their dishonesty they fire you."
459,,Bank Operations,2021-08-03,3.0,Operations Specialist,Great Health insurance benefits and 401k match. You have the chance to Work with some pretty amazing people in different departments. Team work based environment that allows for great networking and personal development,There is a salary cap that makes mobility and career growth difficult.

Fantastic maternity leave benefits, fully embrace and support expectant mothers, also help support families by helping seek out child care, give parents tools to assist with care.","Since the merger occurred, emphasis is on doing more with less, which means less resources to complete an even greater volume of tasks. Senior managements bottom line is meeting the expectations of investors and shareholders, it went from a focus on quality to quantity."

466,,OK for Starting a Career,2021-07-23,3.0,Information Security Analyst,Great to start a career,Job titles are adjusted to suit the Market value of the title.

The general mood is so sour.","With the merger, there are plenty of opportunities to shift to a new team/role since they’re doing regular re-orgs to account for the fact that things are so disorganized. The best part, is they shift teams BEFORE figuring out what the new function of those teams are going to be. But the second people finally realize what their new function is, there’s another re-org to solve the lack of progress due to the last re-org. It feels like an endless cycle going on 2 years. Mergers in general are chaotic, but this is a whole new level.

The diversity within SunTrust was amazing. The culture was amazing, and sr. Leadership was amazing. Since the merger, it seems you can only thrive if you’re a straight white man. There are leaders who have said and done things repeatedly that would easily get anyone fired on the spot if they weren’t in the “boy’s club”. The culture and diversity is almost non-existent now, but they cover it up by acknowledging corporate articles on black history month and pride month. It’s a joke."

Not clock in or out, just record at the end of each week, which is strange. Even though I would work 41 hours let’s say, I have to record 40 because overtime isn’t allowed.

655,,This Bank Does Not Give Equal Consideration to Women's Well-Being & Misrepresents Their Benefits,2021-03-15,2.0,Analyst,Overall working at Truist is fine but I was very disappointed to see how they misrepresent their maternity leave.,"The company claims to give birthing mothers 16 weeks maternity leave. What they mean by that is that you can take UP TO 16 weeks, if you wish to take longer with your PTO, you need to get special permission. Also, no matter how long you take (16 weeks or less), you are forced to use ALL of your sick time (which is impossible following corporate policy since you will have doctors appointments and need to log that time away as sick time). Since you will not have enough remaining sick time to cover this 2 week period, you then have the choice of using your PTO or going unpaid. When you return from having a baby, if you do not have PTO or sick time left, and if you get sick, you go unpaid. The bank does not quietly misrepresent their maternity benefit for birthing mothers; they proudly socialize it as 16 weeks. 14 weeks is still a good benefit time for the US but the fact that Truist forces one to use their sick time, PTO or going unpaid for 2 weeks, is the problem. 

Truist is fostering an environment where expecting birthing mothers will most likely avoid taking their allotted PTO before giving birth or use their sick time when sick. Since you do not know how much sick time you will have by the time you give birth, due to the numerous doctors appointments one needs to attend, and the fact that you may get sick, you need to reserve your PTO. And since whatever remaining sick time one has left when they give birth HAS to FULLY go towards your maternity leave (as if giving birth is an illness/sickness or a disability), one needs to save their PTO in case they do get sick or their child gets sick- otherwise you go unpaid. The company preaches financial well being and setting people up for success but are more than comfortable putting new parents in a situation where they can go unpaid when they potentially need their paycheck the most. They are also giving no thoughtfulness towards the mental well being of their birthing teammates, one should have the option to take time off and get a break and not have their entire year dedicated to giving birth. 
Another interesting factor of using your sick time towards maternity leave, is if it occurs on a public holiday, you still need to use the sick day, even though the bank is closed. It is standard to not get holidays during your leave but when you are requiring personal sick days to be used (which is only required for birthing mothers- not any other parental leave) and the bank isn't even open, it is absolutely ridiculous. 
Also, Truist isn't creating opportunities to help their parenting teammates or help retain their talent. If you would like or need to take additional unpaid time off, you will lose your job. I understand the company has absolutely no legal obligation to hold your position but a manager should have discretion that if one wants to potentially extend their parental leave, that the company does not have to lose you. Potentially the amount of extra time you wish/need to take, might take the company just as long to replace you and lose even more months of productivity getting a new person up to speed.  
The company prides itself as being an innovative, new age bank and is (understandably) proud to be one of the top 6 banks in the US but they are not reaching their competitor's standards on benefits. Case in point the complaint above, nor do they offer adequate family planning, such as IVF, which has become a standard in the banking community. It clearly still has the mindset of a regional conversative bank. "

706,,Rapidly becoming Wells Fargo,2021-02-11,2.0,Branch Leader,You will appreciate your time away from work more. You will have more patience with your children. You will not be upset when stuck in traffic.,"The conglomeration of two giant entities has created so much bureaucracy that it's difficult discerning between Truist and working for an actual government body.

The retail community bank is so desperately short-staffed across the board that teams at some branches consist of 2 people for weeks at a time--meaning no lunch breaks, no break of any kind, furious customers, and exhausted staff. Truist is obviously consolidating at a rapid pace and the effort appears to be intended to have people quit in order to prevent Truist from performing additional or at the very least as many layoffs next year. 

If you are used to old school banking or even a former BB&T employee, you will not recognize this bank. Suntrust leadership has and continues to fill leadership roles on the community bank side. Their branch leaders haven't keyed loans in a decade. They let an actual small business specialist talk to clients over the phone. They are the epitome of tick mark chasers, are so out of touch with how banking and finance work they it is scary, and they, because they are unable to do anything themselves, have really increased their corporate koolaid rhetoric and displaying fluff when the BB&T counterparts have actual production goals. The staff at Suntrust branches are lazy, rude to clients, refuse to help clients without an appointment, routinely don't answer the phone, and are the robots Suntrust turned them into. If you like chasing tick marks, having no understanding of how loans or really anything having to do with banking, then a heritage Suntrust opening might be for you.

The effect of Covid has pushed retail CB leadership to the brink of becoming 100% lemmings from an expense perspective. Here's a great example: an RBM decided his region shouldn't buy dog treats for pass back in the drive thru. Now, no one can order them through our requisition system. Tellers are going out and buying them. Tellers, making $15/hr, have to buy their own dog treats to hand back. If you hate animals or like making people who work hard for the little they have use it to promote the best interest of Truist, then this bank is for you.

Truist took the income made of the PPP loan program at the corporate level instead of at the region or branch level, in spite of the community bank (branch leaders) processing them. Over 100,000. Great news though: they did give out a gift card to BLs who worked for months, often through the night and on weekends: $500. The bank collected almost $600 Million in fees for the loans, so that seems pretty fair. The issue is that months of focus on PPP loans takes away focus from the branch, and while they did reduce goals slightly, the PPP Loans definitely impacted overall production and consequently payouts.

Pressure is already huge this year. BLs need to call 50 small business clients a week, with branch staff making 20 dials each a day. Even with branches with 2 people. If you don't have an equity line keyed by Wednesday, you have to Stay for a call Thursday in which an execution leader, who has nothing better to do than send 50 emails a day on how you're bad at your job, and your RBM have you call 10 clients to pitch HELOCs. You can have 10 last week... But 0 through Wednesday and you have to join. Certainly more examples but this seems sufficient a description.

Lastly, human resources, branch information, and certain other back office groups are so short-staffed that it quite literally takes hours on hold to accomplish anything. This isn't being dramatic: it truly takes hours."

875,,Banking and Investments,2020-10-08,3.0,Anonymous Employee,Among very Dedicated talented teammates,Management does not listen to process improvements. There is no system in place for employees to enact change or voice concerns. Many new processes are made from the way top from people that clearly do not understand how the processes will play out. The bank side and investment side do things differently and it can be difficult to work together with each side having their own rules. Wish there was better functionalities to promote teams and collaborations among different departments.

3. Innovative culture","1. Lack of governance and structure with processes and methodologies. Compared to other large banks and corporations, the culture here is quite disorganized which causes significant stress for teammates.

2. Long hours. Regularly work 55-60 hours a week

3. Lack of leadership with management. Several issues and risks with dependent teams were identified early on with the platforms we are building out. Rather than work with management in those respective teams, our management takes a sidelined approach and accepts whatever outcome may arise, even when it results in substantial risk to our platforms and causes milestones to be missed and capabilities not being available to our clients"
