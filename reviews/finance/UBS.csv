Also, the archaic systems make it impossible to do any real analytics work. A lot of systems were built by external 3rd parties, and as a result they are overly complicated and inefficient. If your someone working in analytics do yourself a favor and look elsewhere. I was lucky enough to get out before wasting much time there. I had no experience in Finance but the amount of meetings these people have its astounding to me that any real work gets done. I sat in on a 5+ hour meeting my first week there. What could possibly be so important to talk about for 5 hours? The answer is nothing. I could hear the stress in everyones voice, I could tell that my manager was being overworked, nobody seemed to be enjoying themselves. They would just sit in meetings for hours and hours talking about how everything is awesome and the numbers are great etc. -- lots of red flags and life is short folks.

The pay is 50% less than any other company, you are belittled by management. You are told you are not good enough no matter what you do. This company gets at least 5,000 complaints by clients every week. Every time you answer the phone it is a 70/30 chance it is a complaint. Management does not care about you, they only care about making themselves look good to directors. Upward mobility is definitely not even remotely an option here. UBS loves to pigeonhole their employees to the point where they leave. Any furthering education is on your own expense. Bonus’s and commission aren’t even enough to pay your fuel to get to the office every day. Trust me, don’t go here. If you work here, leave and go work for a NYC top 5 investment bank and make 6 figure base and stop waiting your time."

Even if you decide to apply for another role in the same company.

Depending where you are, UBS has highly skilled employees and you can (and have to) learn quickly.","No wedding congratulations, no card for the birth of our child, no happy birthday (never, not even an email), no good bye card or wishes.  That describes how they care about employees and what happened to me.

Average Bonus salary was around 50k CHF. If you work in IT as an employee and are a normal performer, you get maybe 4-5k max. That means 95-96% have been distrubuted before it reaches the normal employees.

Be ready to work cut off from business, working on jira tickets one after another.

UBS still has forced ranking. That means some team members will always be ""low"" or ""under"" -perfomer.
Be ready to be ranked worse as a new joiner or if you switch teams. 

You will meet older employees that dont give you any responsiblity or share all they know (seen it all over the place) because they are afraid of a bad rating and this fear became part of their DNA. 

Also this enforced fears lead to information hiding and a general elbow mentality is common practice. 

Also most people try to stay under the radar and not speak out if something does not feel not right regarding inter-personal or organisational problem areas.

Mobbing happens and stays undetected and unsanctioned as the ones who mob can be higher ranked, well connected managers or leaders who can and are ready damage your reputation substantially if you speak out.

At the moment: STAY AWAY no matter what they offer"

766,,"A security job, but not a great one",2021-12-01,3.0,Project Manager Officer,"A few: 
- They are recruiting a lot in Poland.
- The coffee machine at the office is awesome. Really.
- It feels cool to work for a Swiss bank. They have a nice logo, a nice new office in Krakow, you work with Swiss/German directors with interesting accents. 
- The working hours are well respected, you probably won't work on evenings nor weekends. Over-hours are well followed. 
- You can work from home some/all days of the week.
- They organize pretty well their Confluence/wikis","Many: 
- Ask for a high salary when you join: the company from what I observed gives absent/low raises each year. They will promote that promotion is the way to go if you want a higher salary, where only a few internally get promoted after years and years of working. You'd better change job after a year or two, and come back after some time if you want an honest salary that stay competitive. A worker might feel over time like they are not valued/appreciated, until they might realize they might just be part of a big Swiss ""Squid Game"" where the main goal of the company is to make the 1% of the world richer, and it might not imply paying correctly and sustainably their employees.
- The turnover is pretty high, and you might wonder when the company decides to stop hiring in Poland for a even cheaper country. 
- There might be a lot of directors, hierarchy, divisions changes, so you might have multiple team leader in a year
- The whole security/ecosystem to log in and work is very bothersome. It looks cool at first, but you will quickly realize how annoying it is for the worker.
- All the money on equipment/training is being funded/refunded over a large period of time : you buy your laptop to be able to work (no laptop provided), you get a bit of its cost back every month for over 30 months
- The training provided internally is pretty bad/absent. You will probably work on topics you don't fully understand, but ""that'll do""
- Working at a bank implies having to do frequently a lot of security/compliance trainings that take a lot of time, energy, and focus
- There is a lot of information a bit everywhere, intranet, confluence etc. When you want an answer (HR, tools, rules etc) , it can take a while to find what you need."

2. Some real bullies here. Most people here are nice and polite, but I have come across a manager who was a real bully. She frequently shouted at me, humiliated me in front of other team members, set unrealistic goals and kept moving them. Upon reporting her to her line manager and HR, no actions were taken, as they would do what they could to protect the interests of the management.

- UBS workspace will log you out of VM when you're inactive and you will have to do 6-7 steps again to connect to workspace and VM
- Sometimes business people don't know what they are doing, thus you do not have clear requirements or mocks
- A lot of security layers literally kill your passion for software development
- There is dedicated team who develops React component library for internal use but all they do is to import and overwrite styles of Ant Design
- This makes hard to use those components and basically I would say those developers are waste of money, you can use Ant Design and assign those developers to another projects instead of hiring new ones
- You cannot even update VSCode because of security layers

- good brand name (but my advice is to look last the brand name and at the job scope more) 
- relatively high starting pay for corporate centre GTP","- pathetic increment (bosses will justify it that GTPs already get more than full time employees)
- pathetic bonus (2 weeks is default)
- cost cutting everywhere, from benefits like staff celebrations, even OT claims need to be approved before hand, outsourcing to lower cost areas 
- need to do 'CCA' to get 'noticed' and promoted..resulting in many promotees focusing on 'CCA' and organising all sorts of events, but disregarding their core work. Management claims these extra activities are the way to make you 'stand out' in ops where people have less obvious KPI versus e.g. Sales
- Ops management claims to be suporotive of internal mobility but if it involves mobility out of Ops, it's a different story. 
- even a senior Ops management once commented to Ops interns and potential GTPs to 'not consider Ops' and go else where, which says a lot about the kind of work and culture there.

1599,,Bonus and Promotion processes are very political,2021-06-09,4.0,Client Relationship Manager,"UBS is a good employer with generally good benefits. If the section you work in is important for the bank (higher client segment, generating or protecting cash) you can, usually, expect promotions after your first 2-3 years with (more often than not) increasing intervals for the next one due to rank and increasing responsibility.","UBS has a very irritating bonus+promotion system called PMM. You have to achieve goals, your manager has to put you on a long- and then on a short list and fight for you if you want a promotion. You will be compared to peers (sometimes in completely different teams) and it feels like they want to find a reason not to promote you on low levels (the higher ranks always have priority for bonus and promotion). You have to hit your targets the entire year - if you slip, you might risk your bonus and promotion.
Also, you have to be very strategic in this game: If the manager knows that you are leaving the team or if you would never ever leave the team, they have less reason to fight for you and will rather distribute the resources to the 'strategically important' team members."

1618,,No increment and poor bonus. Asia is always the second class region.,2021-06-04,2.0,Director,Colleagues are nice but manager could be horrible. Less political as majority getting no increment and pathetic bonus anyway.,"1) No Increment. Many in group functions (previously known as Corporate Centre) has no increment. Management will give you different excuses such as: 
a) It's your first 2 years , very rare for someone in first 2 years have increment despite market and industry data supported at least some adjustment, they will just ignore the ground. 
b) They will also give reason saying you are not at the junior end of the rank so no increment. Increment is giving to people at the bottom end of the band or people outside the band.
2) Pathetic bonus 
 - No matter how good you are, bonus is less than 1.5 months and some even less than 1 month. When they give you bonus >1 month, please expect to slave yourself and management will emphasize they are doing so much to fight for this good bonus for you and you need to do 2 - 3 persons job just to make it count. 
3) Poor people in Singapore always being compared with low cost location like India. They always bring up topic that India can do the jobs in Singapore and people in Singapore is high cost and need to work double, triple hard. But they never look at SG vs. HK or SG vs. the other business hub like US, UK , Switzerland from which we are lowest cost location and better corporate tax environment. 
4. Many conversion of work pass holders , and fair considerations is just a tick in the box exercise. Look at how many EP holders they hired in last 24 months."

1679,,Swiss Cheese,2021-05-24,3.0,Former Employee,"UBS supports work from home and encourages flexibility for family and personal considerations. Post pandemic it appears UBS will be very liberal in its WFH policy, most likely making office visits largely optional. Don't need to take Fridays off because most of the firm isn't really working after lunch on Fridays. and therefore nobody notices if you're not around too.","Typical big bank mindset in the divisions, overwhelming bureaucracy, outdated systems, inefficient processes. Very low salary increases, often zero for many people. Giving a direct report a 4% raise takes an act of Congress, i.e. don't bother because you're only annoying your management by asking.

Senior leadership is generally clueless about the business systems and processes they oversee, leading to big disconnects between hands-on people and strategy leadership. Inefficiency permeates the organization in every dimension. 

Employee benefits are expensive and mediocre compared with other firms in the industry.

Hardly a day goes by without some self-serving internal announcement congratulating the firm's exemplary commitment to diversity and inclusion. Then look around and you see almost no people of color. Seem to be really committed however to promoting women, although in most cases those women promoted are Caucasian ""old boys"" steeped in the ancient culture. Anybody who tries to radically change an outdated process or system will probably fail and leave the organization in frustration."

If you are innovative, and successful you can get promotions and extra responsibility very fast. Managers are generally good at circumventing HR's absurd bureaucratic promotion requirements.","The risk aversion stemming from the 2008/9 crisis, plus the rogue trader, has led to a bureaucratic and risk averse environment that is stifling all innovation. The new CEO is doing nothing to correct this, and instead focusing on defining his 'purpose' - which if anything makes the situation worse."

1919,,Don't Trust UBS | Look out for yourself as UBS does the same,2021-04-09,1.0,No Title,"- medical and 401(k) benefits (but they aren't great)
- large company so that can be good for job stability","- Consulting companies' benefits are noticeably better than UBS'. This is strange considering the company takes over 50% of what the advisors manage (even the largest teams). The licensed staff on the advisors team has benefits worse than consulting companies. Even when they have been at the company for over a decade.

- Large company = bureaucracy

- Late adapters with legacy systems and intranet needs an entire overhaul. They are 10 years behind in most areas of the technology they use. Not all but most areas.

- when in an advisory role, its mainly sales first. UBS (along w any company you work for) will take a massive cut of what you manage. 50-67% give or take. 

- marketing support for advisors is very poor. There isn't a legitimate department dedicated to helping advisors generate and execute marketing plans. There was a single person across 3 office locations who helped teams with marketing. Considering UBS is primarily a wealth management company, dedicated marketing teams should have been around 15 years ago. The industry, as a whole, shares this similarity but that does not mean it's a good practice. Usually only the largest producers can afford to hire dedicated employees to market for them. Most advisors need help from UBS to do this but UBS has not taken any steps to address this issue in the past 20 years. UBS clearly favors its highest producing teams/advisors.

- The non advisors on a team may be overworked at times while having to cover for other staff members who are out of the office. Sometimes other staff members do not get replaced for extended periods of time. (months, many months)

- Compliance department/HR has rules more stringent than SEC, and FINRA. Get your own private lawyer for any issue you have, should one ever arise, and do not speak with the company unless that lawyer is on the phone or present. It is a fact that UBS will look for reasons to terminate your employment regardless of whether or not you have taken the proper steps to mitigate an issue."

1921,,Loyalty Tax,2021-04-09,2.0,Compliance,"Flexibility, even pre-COVID, offered flexible work arrangements and permitted WFM at least a day or two a week.","Salary -- They DO NOT give raises, not even basic cost of living adjustments, unless you actually go up in rank - which is nearly impossible once you get to the Director level. This means you can go literally 10 years without a raise. It's known as the UBS loyalty tax. While they actually have a team called ""FA Recruiting AND RETENTION"". they unfortunately don't care much about retaining any other talent. Add to that, they are not backfilling jobs as people leave, so the work load is just astronomical and unmanageable. Unless you negotiate a big starting salary and are content with staying at that rate for years -- stay away. 

Also - while the senior most management is decent, they basically promote whoever based on ""accomplishments"" - without regard for whether they have any business managing people. Not everyone who is good at an individual contributor role belongs in management."

2463,,Good Culture Company,2021-01-22,4.0,Operation Analyst,The managers and the working environment are nice. They allow most of the employee to work from home.,"Low bonus, Hard to be promoted if you do not have connection"
2464,,"Average Company, above average benefits, no room to grow",2021-01-22,3.0,"Director, Digital Strategy",Benefits are great and PTO is generous,No room for internal growth and salary is locked in making it notoriously difficult to get a raise
2465,,Read before applying to Wealth Advice Center (WAC),2021-01-22,1.0,Financial Advisor,"1. Will pay you while you get you licensed for a career in the investment industry and pay for the study materials

2. Doesn't care about previous investment work experience

3. Young coworkers and some young managers so there are fun days if you can avoid certain managers and can easily make friends if you're moving to a new city for this job

4. There are advisors that make over 6 figures each year in their mid 20's. Downside is that, unlike working at a branch or many other investment companies, you won't be paid commission trails. You'll get, or not get if you don't meet your total sales goal that quarter, a one time payout on what you sell. Start from zero the next quarter and good luck

5. When you quit, they'll ask you to leave the premises immediately but still pay you for the two weeks that you would've had to work somewhere else. Everyone's favorite day","Everything else

1. It's a call center. Managers will say it's not a call center when they want to motivate you to sell more Advice Portfolio but will not hesitate to remind you that it's a call center first and foremost to get you on the phones if the queues get backed up. As an employee at the WAC, you solely work with the accounts that the local branches didn't want (i.e not enough money, temperament issue, etc.). You'll be able to figure out why the branches didn't want many of these clients very quickly. And you can't enroll new clients so you have to tell anyone that may want to invest at UBS to drive themselves to a local branch.

2. You'll spend the vast majority of your day updating email addresses, mailing addresses, phone numbers, etc because although clients of every other major financial firm allows clients to update this on their website, UBS believes that it is important that these people call in to do it. It's not a secret that UBS is aware that this is the only way that many of these clients would speak with an advisor at UBS but it's not a good look that the clients' statements may be mailed to a complete stranger for years unless they wait in a hold queue for 20+ minutes to speak with an advisor who is much more focused on trying to sell them something they don't want. Countless clients have transferred their accounts for this reason.

3. You'll be asked to do a ""call night"" every now and then. Call nights mean that you are asked to be in the office as soon as the office opens until the office closes so that you can call as many clients as possible that are avoiding your calls on any other day. The amount of call nights depend on your manager as these look good for the manager but don't frequently benefit you as the advisor.

4. During the interview, it was explained to me that the goal of the WAC was to train the advisor and move them to a local branch in 3-5 years. This very rarely happens. I've seen managers refuse to provide recommendations to move to a local branch on an occasion or two to those that are highly qualified but aren't a favorite in the their eyes

5. If you decide that you no longer want to be an advisor, there are two options for you. Become a support staff/sales manager or leave. No room for growth

6. Management says that they care about diversity but, as far as I know, the first female and non-white managers weren't put in their positions until 2019 although the WAC was created around 2010. It wouldn't be a stretch to say that the office was ~80% white men at the time I left

7. Get ready to only try to sell one product, Advice Portfolio (a UBS managed account that neither you or the client can choose any investments in), for your entire time there as that is one of two products that goes towards certain sales goals that you must meet a minimum of in order to be paid anything on your quarterly bonus. Although if any client does a little bit of research, they would see that this product is of lower quality at twice the cost that what they can get at Fidelity, Vanguard, Schwab, etc. Those that do the research are smart investors and I stopped trying to convince them otherwise pretty early on because they are right and I couldn't convince myself that my bonus is more important than their retirement.

7. Most employees that I'm still in contact with are actively looking for other jobs. Of the ~10 sales managers, there were 4 that left within a two to three month period in 2019-2020. Managers leaving en masse is a bad sign.

8. Having UBS on your resume may be a hindrance outside of UBS. There's a reason most people I know at the UBS WAC are looking for jobs instead of at a new job. It took me over 9 months just to get an interview somewhere else.

If you are looking for a job in the investment industry, there are countless companies that offer more growth opportunities and better investment products in both Charlotte, NC and Weehawken, NJ/ New York, NY"

2706,,Front Office? Yes. Back Office? Please don't.,2020-12-08,3.0,Associate Director,"I am trying to be very honest and (one of) the fairest reviews about UBS HK on glassdoor.

1) Big-name - indeed, with UBS Investment Bank's brand, you can get an interview from almost everywhere on the street. Sales/Trading, IBD, PE, or even front-office developer role.

2) Nice Health Plan - cooperate with BUPA, really, really, generous medical plan for you and your family. 

3) If you joined UBS IB as a junior/graduate, you will have a lot of learning opportunities about their business/products/trading. Ppl are friendly and patient to teach, you can always ping them and they are willing to schedule a catch up with you. Most importantly - If you make mistakes (as a junior), no one will blame you - as they treasure graduate talents a lot.

4) UBS IB Global Markets, in terms of cash equities space, it is just doing so well in APAC with the most powerful China franchise - high touch/electronic/advisory/financing.

5) If you don't have an ambitious/large goal, quite a comfortable place to stay until 40s/50s because of work-life balance.","There are way more things to discuss when talking about cons...

1) Internal IT systems (raise tickets, travel, hr system) are just jokes - old, slow, 100% user-unfriendly (click a button and you will have to re-do everything). They never have plans to upgrade them - guess that's will be the case forever.

2) hierarchy issue is very serious in this bank - Swiss/Who speaks German surpass everyone. Front office guys generally ignore support/back office guys (it is not rude. It is just making you uncomfortable with the wordings they use). High-rank guys ignore low-rank guys.

2.1) As a result, the inter-relationships between teams (business/support/IT/management) are generally bad. Not a cooperative environment IMO.

3) They outsource many operations/supports back to India. It is quite easy for you to encounter a case that you are recommended to contact 5-6 guys and still don't find an answer to your original questions.

4) This firm lost $2B in 2011. Starting from then, it imposed a ""risk"" culture, which means - many compliance training, many risk talks, many procedures to follow, many calls to attend in order to reduce risk.

5) The base salary is above streetwise pay. Front office bonus can be months, while back-office bonus is in weeks (i.e. less than a month, you will get used to it)

6) Rank - I know most ppl don't care about these but I do see a bunch of Associates in ~40/50 years old. That's the general case for back-office."
2707,,They claim vision-driven culture and deliver blind mundanity,2020-12-08,1.0,Sales And Trading Analyst,flexible hours and decent holiday policy,"pay and difficulty of use: not only did they nickel and dime (dont even ask about benefits), there was a chronic underpayment vs the street. this was largely driven from poor managment, more concerned with art basel bookings than investing in techology. worse, they have corporate-imposed restriction s on their markets business, making it impossible to compete with peers during the course of business. overall, it was a very poorly run company always tossing a bandaid on somewhere."

-Busy and challenging environment. In IT and with the pandemic, I began my employment at 110%. I was thrown right in but I had a team that was willing to help out (when they had time).
- The benefits are good compared to other larger companies I think. 
- All remote work and company is super flexible, allowing employees to work remotely at minimum until the end of the year and also not forcing folks to come back to the office if they are not comfortable.
-Progressive company and responds to current events.
-Plenty of employee resources and diversity groups.
- Town halls from global address to regional ones. These are consistent in nature and provide good updates.
-My leadership, at least, fights for employee training & development. Training resources internally are available but also allow you to go outside and find training and propose it.
- There are a bunch of unified processes and automation which seem to work pretty well.","These are some cons I have experienced:

-Onboarding in general is pretty hectic. There are multiple moments when you have no clue what to do and no direction. This occurs from HR to your own team. It seems there is no larger directive to make onboarding a more cohesive and enjoyable experience across the region or the company. Multiple times your team has no clue what is going on and HR does not know. It takes a lot of independent work and ""click and find"" to get everything going.
- The interview process was somewhat unorganized. At one point, I thought I was out of the running and then I get an email one day, about a month later, saying I was in the final round....
- All the different teams and their names. Teams have odd names and there is no real directory I have seen to be able to figure out what people actually do. UBS has a ""Who Is Who"" directory and it is cool to look at that but it does not truly provide team names and explanations about what people do. Would like to see something added that spells it out more."

Good diversity, really clever with impressive backgrounds. Nice building in the City with canteen and gym. When I started in 2013 it was great because turnover was low, and people really built their careers there and stayed a long time. They moved around jobs but this gave it a great feel of longevity as a place to work.","The Swiss home office micro-manages the UK, and when you add this pressure to UK regulatory scrutiny it can be a maze of rules and regulations. Then the worst is when your Swiss bosses don't understand UK rules and you get in trouble with you boss for following UK law. Far too controlled by Switzerland, which allows for little creativity or enablement in London. Also now beset by reorg after reorg so the turnover is too high to get to know people well or build a career there."

2. Free transport (but the people you travel with are the most rude as they will act like children who want their house to be the first drop)","1. Toxic management, right from the MD it begins and flows down. Forget your work, even if you come to play politics and drink coffee and watch tik toks all day, you will get promoted. Otherwise you won't..forget about it.
2. No useful trainings will be guided to you, even if you ask/beg/request. They don't want you to grow.
3. Insecure people in the whole office who don't speak to anyone except to flaunt their big pay cheques. Maybe 1-2 good people are there but I have seen them leave in 1 year. Also high attrition rate. So forget having work friends or people you can smile to...no one smiles or is even happy.
4. If you don't not know Marathi (Maharastrian regional language) then you will be discriminated by you manager and team. And there is no HR action that will be taken even when reached out. So if you don't know Marathi in the Maharshtra offices then you will probably get 1-2% increment and tortured all day with taunts. Basically you will be punished for not knowing the langauge as it is always spoken on the floor and on calls as well.
5. No Diwali and Christmas bonus/gifts. It is a small thing but if startups can manage a small gesture then obviously a Swiss Bank can. But nope.
6. RACISM- if your boss is out of India (America's mainly) then get ready to face subtle racism in form of ignorance and favouritism. My last boss didn't even acknowledge my work or my existence. This is a firm where you need to cut throats in order to sit in office and spill venom."

If you want a role where there discrepancies between people are obvious, some are treated with more “privileges” than others. Where there’s absolute no compensation for working in the shifts, night shifts and even in the 12h weekend shifts, then this is the place for you! If you are used to work from home, also forget that too(they will tell you it’s possible, although two times per month, when you are doing business hours shift and there’s plenty coverage in the office) it’s the flexibility to work from home ! Also forget public holidays as you will not get any compensation for working on those days. For training, didn’t met anyone that got external training.

No bonuses, no raises. Whatever you negotiated--this is what you will make for the duration of your time at UBS.
-extremely unprofessional rude people. I worked in Management Consulting Group (MD was a joke, his favorites would yell at people and disrespect others--nothing will be done) and I worked with MDs and Directors across the bank--same story: just push your work on others, humiliate them, promote culture of fear and bulling--and eventually, in 10 years, you will get promoted. 
-backstabbing. If you dont know how or cannot do that--this is not a place for you. You HAVE TO be rude, push work on others, turn things to put other people in trouble, go to the highest manager and tell lies about other people--all to make sure management never looks at what you are doing 
-Zurich and London management is a joke too. They make you fill out a monthly survey. which is NOT anonymous, then a manager from London calls you to ask why you are unhappy and softly hints you--you are free to leave
-very toxic culture, stay away
-no promotions, like i said above--it takes on average 7-10 years unless you are the favorite one. They also constantly tell you at the yearend review that you are a step away from being fired, but they will give you another chance to keep your job, obviously you are not qualified for a promotion.  
-insurance is very expansive and the worst I have ever had, and I worked at other big banks and corporations"

Work life balance
Good Relocation Bonus (one time)

It all depends on the team and Project Lead.

Learning comes in phases
I was unlucky in the first six month and got really old tech stack JSP and struts. Later after change of the lead I got chance to work upon latest tech in the industry. 

Leaving Senior Management all the people are really helpful and nice. Nearly all teams have their own social activities and events.","Join only if you don't care about money and growth.

Fixed yearly bonus for EE and AO, not even 5% assuming employed for the full review cycle. 

Hike is very less mostly single digit below 10%.
The salary are not even close to what other banks offers in India.
Leaves will get lapsed at year end. No option to en-cash them.
No gifts on Diwali, New year. No other added benefits apart from salary and cabs.

Favoritism will always win over hard work, effort and talent. Everything is already decided for year end review. They are just doing it for name sake.

Senior management have very old thinking. They can push you up to any limit to get their year end goals completed, and they will not even give any credit for you. They will talk about ownership and strategy in front of you but will do nothing.

They have very old tech stack. 
Most of the tech is dying and unmanageable. There is no point in learning it, as you will not find any opportunity in the old tech.

Production release is a mess and you may not even get paid extra for doing it on weekend. They have a very complicated process for prod release and very few people are aware about it. 

Application owners in USA just want to get work done they don't think rationally on the time the effort it will take."

New dedicated building in the City","I believe I got unlucky with the team at UBS. The manager and 90% of other senior people and BAs were originally from India (I was in a Front Office IT BA role in London though). The culture felt drastically different to most of other Financial Services firm in the City I worked at. Overwork, understaffing, burnout, constant attacks from management, army-like bullying are the norm. The head of the IT department came from the trading desk and he brought the cut-throat competitive desk culture into IT, where it's very harmful (I doubt it can be helpful in any business really). More of it, this place will attempt to drain all of life out of you via giving you 5 times more than you can handle. This will to make you so weak, that they can start changing your very personality. The management likes meek, obedient workers who never say No to anything, who never challenge things. Staying below the radar and only thinking about your own political interests was the only viable strategy to survive and to avoid attacks. When I felt I started becoming part of the system, I left."

3672,,"Great company, lots of bureaucracy and cost cutting",2019-09-03,3.0,Registered Client Service Associate,"- Access to cutting-edge financial research, market data-- you can learn anything you put your mind to. If you want to learn about UBS's  different investment platforms and model portfolios, the research is there.
- Wholesaler lunch meetings to get their perspective on the markets and various products.
- Very smart and amicable co-workers who are willing to help you with any questions you may have.
- Lots of the financial advisors can be nice on a personal level.
- Open door policy with management, you can go to them with whatever issues you have and they will do their best to help you solve them. They have lots of contacts with local attorneys, home office, and other advisors who may be able to provide some insight that was previously lacking.
- Management pays/sponsors you for your licenses and exams.
- Great name on your resume.","- Bureaucracy is huge-- can take a long time to get answers for certain client inquiries.
- Advancement is nearly non-existent-- you will discover that management and financial advisors are at odds with how they pay you. Most likely, your salary will be split between the two, and both sides are trying to operate as lean as possible. This will cause you to stay stagnant. There are reasons why this overall nice office bleeds talent. There is no room for growth or advancement in pay, no matter what they tell you. In both sides (FAs and Management) not agreeing on what to pay  you, you will stay stagnant and be told during yearly reviews that ""there is less money this year for raises"" or to ""go to your financial advisor""  if you want to negotiate a higher pay. They also believe in a very traditional, corporate, antiquated ""pay your dues"" style to advancement, where you could be working there forever and a day before seeing any sort of advancement. Sure, there are some dues to pay, but this approach simply isn't the way it works in today's job-hopping world.
- Lots of cuts/going lean has resulted in many lay-offs. This has been reported on in various financial literature, as well. For instance, there is ZERO reason why a Registered Associate who is taking trades for their advisor's clients and wants to learn more about the markets should be switching on and off the switchboard. They are not being further compensated for taking on receptionist duties, or for covering various teams in this lean office when people are out sick or on vacation. We are told that we need to be ""pre-approved"" to work overtime and request it, when 99% of the time that's not how it goes. CSAs who sometimes stay late, stay based on NEED and aren't exactly planning on it. It's just the workflow of the day. Again, there are reasons why this good environment bleeds talent. Maybe more people should be salaried instead of hourly?
- Your experience can vary greatly depending on the financial advisor(s) you work with and their client base. 
- It is up to you  to stay on top of your team and management for advancement/pay raise opportunities when they come up."

3676,,Honest Review for Wealth Advice Center (WAC),2019-08-27,1.0,Financial Advisor,"1. UBS brand name, people assume you're a big-time financial advisor (but your not)
2. Young team, most people here are straight out of school in their early 20s so it's fun to work here if you're young and energetic.
3.  Work/life balance: you work on an 8hr shift; no overtime.
4. A good place to start and get licensed if you have no financial background.","1. No Growth. The whole team basically handles small accounts or garbage accounts that '' real'' UBS advisors don't want.  You don't own your own book and you can't get new clients on your own. The only clients you're allowed to service and do business with are the small/ garbage accounts mentioned earlier.

2. High turn over rate: Because of the first reason, turn over rate here is one of the highest in UBS. Not a lot of people work here for over two years. 

3. NOT a finance job: Most financial advisors here have no finance background or basic knowledge of finance or economics.  And that goes for most sales managers here as well. Because all they want you to do is to sell managed portfolios and nothing else (this is the only way you get paid).  It's kind of ridiculous because how in the world a recent college grad with a non-finance related degree is going to help clients make some of the most important financial decisions? 

4. Lack of diversity: 90% white male. No female or minority in management.  Frat house environment, you have to be boys with your manager and drink the kool-aid to be promoted, personal performance doesn't really matter. Ladies thinking about working here?  You will be one of the 5 female FAs working here among 50+ twenty-year-old guys. Just imagine that...

5. Nepotism: I don't think this is a big surprise for most banks, but this place takes it to a whole new level.  You'll be working with a lot of senior management's kid here because of an inter-generation program they have, and these kids can do anything they want with no repercussion. They can miss their sales gaol and still take vacations to Europe.  And at the end of the day, they will still get promoted ahead of everyone. I've personally seen these kids got promoted ahead of a team's number one performer and sales managers are afraid of confronting them.  

6. Mediocre pay- base salary is 50k plus bonus,  normally after 1.5 -2 years you'll get promoted to a more premium team earning 60k base. However, bonuses are taxed heavily so you're not putting that much in your pocket. For the amount of $ you're bringing in and products you sold, it's really not that much...

7. Low morale:  morale used to be okay... after a lot of good managers left, morale is at its lowest. They also changed the way advisors get paid so it's harder to get your bonuses now.  At a team meeting, they even asked to rank our morale from 1-10, and no one scored more than a 4."

Better to be with the Front than back office. Low morale hence explain the high turnover, which result in losing of the knowledge and expertise. Unfortunately, loyal long time employees are not properly recognized- external hire getting higher compensation than one who chooses to move within org or got promoted Internally. Low morale, lead to poor performance. Vicious cycle. Non performing seniors just sticking around waiting to get their golden handshake. 

Culture- not wrong to be proud of your achievement, but should be humble enough to admit that there is actually things that can be improved. And when highlighted, they make you the owner to drive change while the rest just want leach on the benefit. 

Red tape, also too big to for any fast implementation. Stakeholders are working in silo.

It is a very risk averse culture where there is no accountability and no one likes to make a decision that might impact their comfortable salaries and bonus. Promotion criteria are not clearly defined and discretionary to management and only happen once a year where very few get promoted. Even though challenging status quo is part of the mission the minute you challenge anything you will become persona non grata.

-compromising quality for quantity: mgt would rather overwork their staff than hire new staff to assist with the growing workload- and you would get blamed if you are not able to cope with the unrealistic workload that is constantly growing. They do not take into consideration that you are human and that you do get tired too. They expect you to be accurate and consistently fast at all times for every single work day. Be prepared to get questioned if you slip for just 1 day.
-favouritism abounds: only people who are considered close to the line manager would be noticed and praised regardless of merit. The mgt here is a bit blind to who is actually contributing. 
- achievements not recognised: this leads me to continue on to this point where only those who are recognised by the line manager would get acknowledged for their contributions. 
- old mindset: for a company that apparently embraces diversity( anything different etc.) and keeps harping about it all the damn time, the line managers here still utilises face time to gauge the quality/value of an employee. Bottom line is, if you dont ot, you aren't a good employee. 
Absence of work-life balance: since your line managers expects you to OT, you can bet that work-life balance is non existent. I wont even rate it a zero. It's actually a negative."

The absolute worst part about this job is the upper management.  There is a 100% focus on making money (obviously), and employees do suffer because of it.  The teams are understaffed, leading to planned holidays being cancelled, and if someone is out of the office, the other people in the team are expected to do required overtime.   To leave on time is to leave early.

Employees are often encouraged to offer our ideas of how to improve the workplace, but those ideas are consistently shot down because they will cost too much time or money.

There is a palpable lack of respect that comes from the upper management and onshore colleagues, which at times boarders on harassment and racism.

Once a year, after your performance review, you are invited to sit and receive information about whether or not you will get a raise and/or bonus.  This is no negotiation.

Honestly, my advice is to stay away from this place."

I received numerous endorsements for two separate programs from many well regarded advisors, however HR seems spitefull of those seeking greater advancement and opportunity. There seems to be a Stark divide between the advising and support sides of the house. While eventhough advisors can recommend you for open positions, the HR would rather keep you tied on the support side and hire outside. I feel like I've wasted time pursing an opportunities that were closed by someone simply either not hire another for my position or because of the old ""buy your time"" card. The advisors are aging as the business is changing and many see that in order to keep up with online/discount broker firms they must adapt and bring in ambitious younger talent to seek new business and be taught the art of the relationship, but this is not allowed by HR and you are better off coming directly into UBS from the outside.

Managers hold tight to the people who work for them and you are left on your own to find your next job.

There has been a lot of turn over on the team,  people leave or the line manager finds a way to fire them. I think there is a major problem with the line manager that HR is not taking seriously. I believe the line has a connection HR where she is allowed to get away with her poor behavior and it doesn't help that their line manager is in other state making it hard to see what is really going on. The line comes into the office anytime they feel like it if they even come in at all. Often times I have experienced not knowing where the line manager was and couldn't get a hold of them because they was't online. I have experienced where you don't hear from them at all or see them in office with no email communications from them. The line has threaten not only me on the team but other team members, the line manager is a bully, talks down to you and overall has a negative impact on the team. The line manager loves to pull you into a conference room and yell at you, threaten your job and talk to you like your a child.  The line manager isn't open to hearing what you have to say, they prefer for you to not say a word and take orders. I got the impression while there that the team was scared of the line manager because when she'a around no one speaks to each other.  I have asked why haven't the other team members reported her to HR and I got the reply of ""I don't want to lose my job"" because they have seen her retaliate against someone. This is a terrible way to be a line manager, I have been working since I was 14 years old and never have I ever came across a manager like this one. Not every line manager at UBS is like this line manager, this one is by far the worse one I've seen and UBS needs to get rid of this line manager instead of going off what this line managers says to get rid of good employees. There is a reason why the turnover is a lot on this team."

It’s not the very top of the league tables, but in general there’s a lot of M&A and financing activity. I would say that compared to what I’ve heard about other banks, UBS is also pretty relaxed and less formal than other places on Wall Street. Depending on your group I guess your experience might be more intense and serious, but I would say the culture across the bank is pretty positive. Banking in general is a lot of work, but if you know what you’re getting into and still want to do it, UBS is a good place to get the experience you need when entering the finance world.","Junior people turn over quickly, so it can feel at times that senior leadership doesn’t invest in the development of analysts. Also within groups senior people/staffers play favorites and give all of the best projects to their favorite analysts.

- Insensitive/ignorant/discriminatory colleagues: have received rude and flat out ignorant emails from entitled financial advisors who think they are the greatest thing since sliced bread. Some people can't tell the difference between me and a colleague when we look nothing alike. 

- Terrible HR: Insensitive to real issues (like sexual harassment that happened to me...was asked ""are you sure that was meant for you"" and ""do you think it could have been a joke?"" The onboarding process (or lack there of) would probably make any new hire regret their decision to make the move here. 

- No diversity: there are always talks about making UBS a more diverse place but that's a load of bs and apparently there's a ""quota"" they need to fill with POCs but no transparency of who sets that quota and what efforts are being made to actually fulfill on it. All of the GTPs (basically internal trainees that spend limited time in different rotations) look the same - white, privileged, children of employees that seem to get promoted faster than others..hmm....

Despite talking a lot about young talent and innovation, management are extremely sluggish to change and terrible at talent retention. The younger, more talented employees come and go constantly.
They encourage a 'challenge' culture, yet I've never experienced anything less than hostility whenever I challenged status quo. 
A problem I'm sure typical of many big banks/firms: it's tough for women to rise and get the respect that men receive. Again, UBS make a big show of valuing women in the workplace, but I have experienced and witnessed quite the opposite on many occasions. Including several issues that were escalted through HR by colleagues and resulted in disciplinary action.
I was at UBS for 5 years, and was still having the same meetings about the same challenges and issues throughout. How does this place function?

Overall, a great place to work, and also a good deal of workplace flexibility.","Many changes in strategy at senior IT organizational level, can be  disruptive. For a number of years in a row, you would have a complete overhaul of the IT organization, goals, reporting lines, job titles, which lead to confusion.

- Health insurance is quite expensive. You get to pay a substantial fee if your spouse has access to insurance and you decline it

- Very limited opportunities for growth at the Utah office. Both because of limited availability or roles, but also because of limited exposure to senior management which mostly operates out of the NYC, Stamford, and Weekhawken offices

- A general culture in UBS where a large part pf the focus is on cutting costs instead of growing and seeking excellence. Senior UBS leadership takes a deliberate passive approach towards certain significant issues that could hamper the business in the future

Good time for apprentices. Many teams are recruiting apprentices instead of experienced staff because it is cheaper and the cost is taken from the apprentice budget pool.

My previous Manager was flexible with working hours.","As an experienced professional, your job is safe as long as you are needed. Otherwise, be prepared for the worst. The company seems to be full of divisive or incompetent management. My own team suffers from lack of communication. Staff are expected to know new procedures / duties which are not communicated. Some team environments are extremely toxic. If you are not on good terms with the right people, they will find the smallest excuses to victimize you.

With regards to personal  development, it depends on your relationship with the Manager.

Moved all employees to a high deductible health plan in 2016. UBS's monthly contribution to our plans went down, mine went up slightly, and our benefits got a LOT worse.

I pay extra for the ""Plus"" health plan. $3500 deductible (no copays for office visits, you pay 100% until you hit the deductible) and $6000 out of pocket max. This plan costs me $800 per month and costs UBS $103 per month.

401k match is a joke. UBS will match 100% of your payroll contributions to the Plan, up to 6% of your eligible
compensation, subject to an annual maximum match of $3,000.

Vacation days do NOT roll over.

Unfortunately, the technology we use makes the benefits look great by comparison. Most systems are built on top of systems designed in the mid to late 90's. Everything is built to run through Internet Explorer. The managed account trading platform is built with FRAMES! Frames were briefly popular in the mid-nineties before professional web designers discovered all sorts of issues and stopped using them.

The Swiss are not ideal to work for in the US. They love to tout their values and integrity, but the same small group of kook-aid drinkers are the only ones to get anywhere, don't see much integrity there. Management insists on using performance evaluations that have been cast aside by every major company, including GE who started it. Doesn't matter how good you perform, someone has to get the bad grade if too many already have high marks."

5270,,Overall a great corporate culture.,2016-10-05,4.0,Associate Director,"UBS has a great network. It's all what you make of it. Culturally, the people are great. Overall people are motivated and team-oriented. Essentially, the people. Also, work life balance: roughly 24 vacation days + carry overs and personal days. Not crazy hours depending on what part of the bank you work in.",Budget cuts. Upward mobility for more junior employees. I think many people get frustrated as the firm seems to be penny wise....

It has been a really valuable experience working at UBS, I was able to contribute to the company and learn a lot of new things.","Us interns needs to be proactive to find out what exact to achieve during the 9 weeks mainly through our own effort, which is not so easy as a new joiner.

The underlying ethos of the firm is good and the IB CEO is inspiring even if he is letting his senior guys run amok.,"UBS investment bank can't seem to work out what's for (this is probably true of a lot of investment banks though). As a result all it does is change. Any radical idea from senior management is implemented as long as it is seen to be ""change"" and no one can speak up against it. As a result the franchise is being destroyed. Good people been fired on a whim or because they push back slightly on some new crazy idea. Others just see the light and leave. 

The effectiveness of the salesforce has been hit by various intiatives which seem to change year by year. You sort of get used to one, explain it to your clients and so on - and then a completely different one comes along. This devalues the franchise with the client base. Macro research is a mess, with new managers having ripped out or driven away all the good parts of it in favour of their much less capable friends. Trading is a little better, but everyone has been told not to use balance sheet so it's difficult to get a good price any more and the firm seems to be losing market share continuously."

They have provided me with a wealth of industry knowledge, friendship, and hundreds of laughs. I will remember the company events and bizarre moments I shared with great coworkers.","UBS Asset Management is a San Andreas Fault of systemic issues.

The dysfunction is unlike anywhere I have ever experienced in my entire life. There's a terrifyingly large portion of the office that still believes it's 2007. There are no consequences for an employee breaking protocol. You’d be more likely to get fired for wearing shorts on casual Friday than for losing the company money. There have been significant cost cutbacks to make the appearance of being a responsible and forward thinking member of the banking community. The cuts have hit bone in certain departments. It’s not feasible to do any job effectively or accurately. 

Some business essential software hasn’t been updated since before the recession. You’ll use your talents to surmount these shortcomings and implement process improvements with what you have. The condescending executives, will make careless and disturbing mistakes habitually. You’ll put their confusingly immature attitudes aside and work with them anyway. You’ll even show them how to operate their own trading platforms. You’ll be rewarded at the end of the year by a conversation such as “I know UBS made $5 billion this year but you won't be seeing any of that. It’s not how it works here.”

You’ll put this aside and work even harder the next year, motivated by what you think will be a one-time disappointment. You’ve held the pieces, figuratively and literally, together for a little longer. Your mental and physical health have declined. Your friends and family will “hardly recognize” you. 

Another year has passed. There are now permanent and complex issues fixed due to your hard work and creativity. “This is it, UBS will finally show me that it values me as an employee”, you say. 

Last year’s disappointments have taught you to manage expectations. With a little luck, you’ll get a small promotion or a small raise. Heck, even a cost of living adjustment will be enough to keep you going.

Your review begins with a manager who you haven’t seen in the office for six months. The conversation begins, “I know UBS made $6 billion this year but you won't be seeing any of that. It’s not how it works here.”

If only I had listened to that Glassdoor review from years ago."

Many CAs are productive and perform despite negative headwinds of weak ineffectual DHs and CTHs who go missing everytime an important decision needs to be made 
Defacto decision making is to sit on something and let the situation take care of itself so no head needs to put their head on the line.
However, these CAs are not given opportunities to develop their book because their own bosses are not favoured by senior management 
Even new leads brought on have to be given up as the weak bosses do not want confrontation with the power bases like HNW South Asia, UHNW North Asia etc 
This weak middle management is evident across all divisions and if you discern hard enough there will be a few long serving D and ED who are the backbone of expertise and know how in their specific teams (IPS,WP, etc) headed by yet another clueless head parachuted in or up in the management role by virtue of their presentation skills, ability to lunch with the top or by being so good at showmanship they are promoted into incompetence. Not many are cut out to be managers. 
Being a manager requires sacrifice and a mindset to groom all your people equitably. Most managers leave the work to the backbone one downs and happily go on junket trips or creating their own pyramid schemes Competing with their own team members for limited leads, resources, support while cherry picking best of books for themselves when good bankers leave.
Low productivity and shallow skillset from long standing Swiss staff who serve as puppet custodian Bankers with no hold over the relationships but no one has dared to make decisive redistribution of these sacred cows choosing instead to flog the peripheral books and Asian bankers.
At some point, clients are bearing too much risk on behalf of clients who have learnt for many years that it is fine to keep millions of cash in custody with UBS and still get F1 paddock tickets and hotel bookings for the whole family.
No amount of ""red carpet""will change this as wrong clients were onboarded and spoilt rotten for decades to a point of no return. 

General consensus among staff is that Singapore base is treated like a stepping stone for successive leaders to gain more visibility and power thus, plans are devised for short term goals to maximise the leader's showcase before they get promoted into regional and meatier glory."

Some good managers
Decent health coverage for emergency purposes
Apparently compared to other banks, we are consider ""better"" in terms of culture
Use to be a good company and friendly culture... but the last 6 to 7 years have been brutal...","Terrible structural problems. Very Low Morale. High Turnovers. Long Hours. A ""poppies that stick out get chopped"" mentality. 

Senior managers are really cold and calculative. Company is highly political. All the good senior manager who actually care about people were all slowly forced to quit in my department in the last 3 years, as certain political camps won out (department and geographical merging to cut costs).

A massive trickle effect downwards to manager and junior managers is easily apparent. Most are cynical managers really abusing (passively I mean) their staff, rather then fight senior managers for work-life balance or even fair compensation. Mentors often advise (be less ""cheery"" and avoid being ""noticed"" and to be ""fortunate"" to have a job)

An unfortunate result are genuinely nice people are literally quietly begrudging walking dead. Angry, peeved off, but desperate to keep the jobs. Senior managers takes advantage of this....

Example: Recent promotions (with 1.5-2x the responsibility) are rewarded with pay raises less then 5%. This is not an exaggeration, with 5% at the upper range (with also a very low starting base to begin with). 

I and a few colleagues have declined the promotion. But, I suppose they served their purpose of ""trying to promote"".

All other staff have pay raise freeze for all others (some colleagues saw no raise for the past 4 years). Therefore real earning wages has actually declined year on year.

For my market that actually is a decline of 12-16% of real income after accounting for inflation. 

Previous years 2013-2015, a strategy of ""natural attrition"" was employed to reduce headcount by ""freezing"" almost all promotions (on top of pay). 

A good point to note, that strategy was effective in pushing some folks out. But us average individuals with limited prospects in a tightening market... it is very disheartening to see good friends leave and replaced by very young, very inept graduates (if they choose to replace staff at all)"

UBS is still a bulge bracket firm with a good reputation on the Street, and you get to work with top notch individuals.","None of the improvements in financial performance have translated into additional benefits, pay raises, or better bonuses UBS seems to be perpetually in cost-cutting mode. Too many people are overworked and under-compensated.  There seems to be a general lack of appreciation for employees, which in the past would have been overlooked with good compensation.

Now, don't get me wrong. Pretty much all of the big investment banks are on the same boat. If anything UBS is probably one of the better ones out there.

Of course, if your only concern is how to be properly dressed at a company Christmas party than the actual work and the risk to lose your job (by being eventually replaced by Indians contractors in the next few years?), then it is not surprising that the wake up call will be extremely painful in a few years when these people will be replaced by cheaper labour somewhere else! No training given, no team work. You cannot ask a question to your colleagues without being rudely pushed back to your desk . No communication. The manager does not make any performance reviews in order to properly judge your actual work. You are only judged as a worker based on what your colleagues think of you as a person and not as a professional! This is embarrassing and unacceptable.

5896,,UX Designer,2015-10-19,1.0,,"Normal hours, larger than average pay, and for the most part, very pleasant co-workers.","If you are a UX Designer, do not take a job here. 

The only 'user' UBS management really cares about is UBS upper management. Every project is waterfall method (they call it ""4D"" - don't be fooled). Agile? Lean? What are those? Your superiors would not know a good design method if it slapped them in the face. 

They launch interactive projects and are confused when they don't succeed. Maybe because they are being driven by analysts who want to show they are experts in their field, with a complete disregard for if any users would be interested in what they're pushing? There is a lot of 1980s machismo going on here. 

Even basic things, like requirements gathering, are a nightmare. No one knew what they were doing until the cult-leader-in-charge would give his stamp of approval. 

Communication is also horrible. There's a lot of internal wrangling with one on one competing discussions. You will never get all the stakeholders in the same room at the same time to hash it out. Even if you did, 'you're just the UX designer' - your voice would 100% not be heard. You're like an exotic animal at a zoo surrounded by ivy league suits.

I looked back through my notes after leaving and realized that on literally every project I worked on, there was a clueless middle manager who pushed aside best practice designs I worked on in favor of his ideas, which stakeholders always hated. We would waste 3 times the time and effort working this way. This guy would also parrot any expert level advice I told him one on one and present it as his own to his superiors. I'm quite sure that's how he stays employed there: stealing others work, and creating bad ideas that he can then blame on others. And no, you'll never be in any meeting or situation where you can defend yourself. 

Remember - everything here is top down, and you're 'just the UX designer'.  Your skills, experience and training are worth nothing here. They would call you a ""wireframe monkey"" if they actually knew enough about design to know what that means."

Don't bother with UBS if you're an IB true-ist. There are places with more exceptional MDs that pay better and have far more prestigious exit opportunities.

This person was so scattered that the Global Head of Communications got on a plane from Zurich personally just to fire her.

There were many times when I was the only woman in the room but I wasn't overlooked or disregarded.  I had many different bosses and, yes, some were better than others.  In general, though I thought that my contributions were recognized and that I had a chance to discuss any disagreements.  There were times when I had to go along with a decision I didn't agree with but I was listened to and I understood that another area, project or department had to take priority in that moment.","The company is big, huge and has a process for everything.

6062,,Investment Banker,2015-07-31,4.0,Anonymous Employee,Lean industry teams provide a phenomenal experience for junior bankers. There is also a wave of talent that has been brought in the past 2 years that should provide the much needed deal experience that is required to build a career in IBD.,The recent hiring spree (~20% YoY growth) at the senior level is pause for concern though. It feels reminiscent to the hiring spree in the early/mid 2000's. There will be culture clashes as groups grow under new leadership.
6063,,You need to work hard and may not always be rewarded with a promotion,2015-07-31,3.0,Associate Director,Salaries are very competitive and the benefits are great!,Promotions beyond Associate Director are almost impossible if you work in Operations and are not already managing a team.

6065,,Hollowing out a firm in decline,2015-07-29,1.0,Senior Software Engineer,One of the top paying companies in Switzerland for employment.  Title heavy in appearance.  Director level has annual guaranteed minimum expense payment.,"Company is involved in the long term process of slowly hollowing itself out.
Investment Bank division in highly outsourced with cheap foreign contract staff. On-shored contractors are brought in on a temporary basis, rotated out frequently. Technical roles are typically off-shored (Poland, Singapore) to contract workers. Higher compensated permanent staff are targeted, laid off to facilitate the off-shoring.  Technical staff for IB and WM divisions are parked in Corporate Centre division. From my observation, the CC division is structured to run at a loss; this strategy minimizes staff salary increases and bonus payments, as attached to division profitability.
For all appearances, the Swiss government looks the other way, facilitating this Bad Actor company."
6066,,Summer Internship,2015-07-28,5.0,Investment Banking Summer Analyst,Great no face-time culture; much better hours than most of wall street; very optimistic and friendly culture,"At a junior level, there's really no cons besides the typical corporate hierarchy."

Great for entry level (then leave).","The company itself is appears awful due to the fact all decisions have to be run through Switzerland. Super cheap especially when it comes to their compliance department. They don't make counter offers...not even to their top employees. Been her four years and the CEO has had two raises (20% and 4%) while my salary has stayed the same and my work had nearly tripled. Literally only promotion per compliance team is permitted. No growth here. Compliance is not where you want to apply, not unless you take more work and pats on the back as bonus currency. Let alone many of the jobs are transitioning Nashville. Seriously they will hire less experienced people with higher titles just to bring their pay to a competitive market salary and leave the current employees dry and disappointed. And remember what I said about promotions. Essentially there is no reason to be a rock star employee here."

Some really smart people, who you can learn a lot from if you put in the effort to mine the information from them.",You have to know people in order to get anywhere - smoozing is part and parcel of progression. It is definitely still a boys club - interviews are usually only a formality as roles are often already promised to someone before it has even been advertised. Lots of fundamental issues with processes but people don't want to hear anything about it until something goes wrong. A lot of senior managers have never actually been given management training and have no idea how to develop their teams. It's cringeworthy.
6078,,Wealth Management Intern,2015-07-17,2.0,,"My coworkers are very friendly and helpful, and you get to meet a lot of well-connected people in your area.","The position is not particularly demanding nor is it that rewarding.  It's difficult for interns to do the roles of a financial analyst or help clients since we, as college students, probably don't have certifications and/or licenses.

Competitive benefits package with decent vacation and sick days, several health plans to chose from. Vision and dental plans are good also, plus optional life, accidental death and long term disability insurance. Predictable 9-5 hours with no weekend work.","You deal with lots of politics, like any large corporation. The guys at the top make the big bucks while we get poor bonuses and zero salary increases year after year. The company doesn't reward people who get the job done, rather you have to know who to kiss up to. Finally, they take a socialist approach to salary increases bringing the rookie salaries up to the level of senior employess, so that everyone's at the same level.

Therefore your get some opportunities to switch job inside the company with relative easy. You meet a lot of different people and get insight (depends on your role and job) into many different kind of business fields. I worked there as a Business Analyst for a central system and therefore got in touch with a lot of stakeholders and my personal network growth was kind good.,"The wage was under the regular market price. I guess you get better paid in many other companies. But maybe it was just this job-position that had such a bad wage. Anyway, the management lacks commitment and you rarely get any help or support from them. Furthermore you don't get much time for any education since the work-load is quite high."

6452,,Java Developer at UBS Investment Bank (FX),2014-09-24,2.0,Java Developer,Salary was good. People were generally very clever.,"Organisation of projects was pretty chaotic - projects frequently got cancelled after significant effort had been put in.
There was no real process in place - There was a release every 3 months or so, but it wasn't very well planned and frequently targets were missed, or changed throughout the cycle. That was about it really as far as process goes.
The project I worked on was enormous, on its last legs, had zero unit testing, and was therefore totally unsuited to any refactoring. Most of our effort was spent on bug fixing. The delicacy of the code meant that implementing even the simplest new features took an age."

Their contributions go above and beyond.,"Management's sight on lowering cost footprint at all levels leads to exodus (willing and unwilling) of people with decades of subject matter expertise.

Can be very fake and political in some teams, heartless at times
Unfairness and bias within teams lead to low morale or unhappiness
Tend to penalize fast and efficient people, by giving them more work without distinct better compensation / recognition as compared to the less productive. Capable workers are take for granted."

Too much involvement of Business in technical decisions. Most of the business people don't have any idea about technology but have a huge say in how an application should be designed. Software engineers who actually build these applications have no respect. Business managers and Program managers take all the credit

Facilities were nice enough.,You kept your job and was promoted based on who you knew rather than how hard you worked and what you know. A lot of politics needed and boot licking needed to work here.

The work life balance for women of higher ranks is good. Senior management is open to alternative working situations. E.g Work from home once a week, work from a UBS office in a different location for several weeks.
The culture of teamwork and integrity is prevalent. However, there are always outliers.","Career development opportunities are few. Even when an employee tries to drive their own career development, effecting the change seems difficult. Lack of transparency in advancement opportunities and career paths."
6493,,PM at UBS,2014-08-06,4.0,Project Manager,Greate freedom during work. lots of responsability. work at home. nice co workers. no fix start time for being at work.,Compesation is not good. end of year rating process sucks. they have fix rates of good or bad performar and a very low promotion rate. so you have to wait long for a change.

Had a good hiring process so perms are people you can respect.",Far too much emphasis on cheap outsourcing. Little apparent interest in building good pipeline of perm staff.

6501,,Good opportunities await.,2014-08-04,3.0,,I was at UBS AG for one year. I really enjoyed the people I worked with and the breadth of experience that were available to me as soon as I stepped through the door. The training is solid with assistance in either the IMC or CFA qualification if you so choose.,The markets weren't kind to UBS the year that I was with them. Cut backs and redundancies plagued the bank. This greatly affected the moral of the team and subsequent departments.
6502,,UBS = U've Been Screwed,2014-08-02,2.0,Anonymous Employee,"Solid benefits, good salary/pay if you are in the right department.",EXTREMELY POLITICAL.  Bonus system that invites corruption and unfair bonus awarding.

6504,,IT Manager with several years of service,2014-07-31,3.0,Associate Director,"The staff are generally friendly, supportive, cooperative, in other words a good bunch. Work-life balance is reasonably flexible, and compensation is fair in my experience, but with wide variation apparently. Get yourself on the right IT project(s) and you can have a great experience here, but make sure your projects have business-visibility and an appropriate budget. For some, including myself, working in a highly distributed and culturally diverse environment is a bonus.","In general the business regards IT as simply an expense, to be minimised. This culture can lead to frustration for any ambitious IT staff in terms of project budgets, creative opportunities, renumeration and promotion prospects. IT management lacks direction, has low visibility, and staff turnover is high."

6507,,Good Company to work for,2014-07-29,3.0,Anonymous Employee,Great people and depending on the department great atmosphere to work in.,The organizational structure is confusing and you have to talk to a lot of people before getting any of the answers you need.

Good work is no longer valued and they are frequent management changes."
6510,,Good place to get a start.,2014-07-28,3.0,Senior Registered Client Service Associate,Office will support you getting licenses and certifications.  Good place to to learn and get some experience.  A lot of the long timers are very nice and helpful in sharing knowledge. Good amount of vacation time for new employees.,Poor compensation. Limited amount of positions available within the wealth management division. Some of the past managers didn't make it easy for individuals to apply for other jobs and move around within the company.  Sometimes it takes forever to get something done because it has to go through so many strings of approval.
6511,,Good Job,2014-07-26,3.0,,"Decent technology, good work life balance",Culture can be unnecessarily unpleasant

The firm is so large you can always find an area or niche that fits you.  Work life balance depends on the area","Because it is so large it can be challenging to find the right request system for whatever access or tool you are seeking out.

6537,,"Great people, but process is king",2014-06-29,2.0,Software Developer,"All teams I have worked with (IT back office) were full of very good, very nice and helpful people. Many of them were also extremely dedicated, putting in the extra effort to get stuff delivered in the timelines posed by the business. All of my immediate line managers (UBS Directors, so VPs elsewhere) were down-to-earth, pragmatical people. All of them cared for their staff and were trying their hardest to develop them. The whole culture of the company encourages helpful relationships based on trust and respect. However, that is most prevalent between peers and line managers and subordinates, relationships of other kinds are not always so great.","First of all, the processes in place do not help but hinder development. L1 production support can only copy files and click ""restart"" buttons (and even then they make mistakes far too often), which means that dev teams get woken up in the middle of the night on a regular basis. Release process is excruciatingly painful, because of the aforementioned production support, as devs can't have access to prod. There is no notion of break glass scenarios, and mentioning it is met with immediate refusal.
Work-life balance is appalling if one wishes to get promoted. And when that happens the compensation is not nearly enough to cover for the sleepless nights.
Business has no idea how IT works and pushes back on any technical changes if they would mean longer delivery times for functional requirements. This leads to tremendous technical debts and poor quality software which is bolted on rather than built. Furthermore, business manages to forget about regulatory requirements and only highlights them at the eleventh hour, causing even more ""tactical"" solutions to be put in place."

The only tools you are given are from the disinterested, checked out person who had your job before you did. The only thing anyone cares about is money and climbing the corporate ladder. There are some really slimy people working here. The company does not give cost of living raises, and most employees have not had a salary increase in 5 years. There is a huge lack of morale in the home office, and getting a competent, timly response is impossible. Not to mention the fact that half of the back office is in India now, with more to follow.

6551,,Cost reduction is the mantra.,2014-06-15,1.0,Executive Director,"Work life balance - there are a lot of flexibility and people do make use of it since accountability at UBS is nonexistent. 

People and team collaboration were the best thing at UBS before I left, but this is gone as most of the good people have resigned and majority of the jobs moved to cheaper locations.","UBS used to be a good company to work for, however nowadays the only focus management has is cost cutting, so management spends most of time figuring out a way to reduce costs and the staff worrying about when their jobs will be moved to a low cost location (i.e. India, Poland, Nashville-TN, etc). The current CFO is a job killer who only thinks about UBS's share price, so he and the rest of the Board can cash in their millions. 

For the past 4+ years the only thing management has focused is cost reduction - benefits are gone, and compensation is now below market, as a result the good people continue resigning in bunches everyday. The moral is so dismal that people really do not care about anything else anymore - they just come in for the pay check until they find another job.

A few years ago the Head of HR came up with a non sense employee performance measurement that destroy whatever was left in terms of moral, but he still employed by UBS so you get an idea of how bad management really is.

Career growth at UBS is a thing of the past. Management keeps saying that the jobs in the future will be more interesting, however the only thing people will be doing in a few years is managing the mess created by the offshoring people who have no clue what they are doing. In order to remediate such low quality work provided by UBS's offshore ""partners"", UBS has more people in Operational Risk, Internal Audit and bureaucratic functions, than actually people doing work and really advising the business and dealing with regulatory issues. If you want to deal with bureacratics who do not understand anything, UBS may be the place for you. 

In addition, a lot of Senior Management has resigned lately, but instead of promoting people who are competent and have been loyal to the firm for years UBS continues to bring people from outside, so when they tell you that there is a career growth opportunity think twice about it.

The bottom line is Management does not care about anything other than cost reduction, so if you want to spend most of your time dealing with cost/operational plans, and have stomach to say ok to everything they say that's the perfect place for you."

- Great brand name for clients
- Decent systems (though London platform is relatively antiquated)","Everyone wants to leave because:
- Bonus, what bonus? Your bonus is to be employed here! People were amazed to hear that the gross bonus pools were up - and the largest in the industry and then everyone receives zero bonuses - clearly the pool is skewed towards the very top.
- Process driven, risk obsessed culture - you will be rewarded for NOT booking business
- AML, Legal & Compliance are literally prison wardens - it is very easy to get into huge trouble here and the punishments are severe - to deter others.
- Opening accounts takes ages (3 - 6 months in London, vs. 4 weeks in Zurich) - many cases clients simply go to Zurich for the business.
- Obsessed with getting new AUM at all costs and then driving clients into low return, expensive discretionary mandates above any other business. In practice we end up with lots of clients who generate no real revenue.
- Culture of victimisation against whistleblowers - speak up, be fired
- Siloed business model - your biggest competitors will be UBS Zurich, UBS Geneva, UBS Singapore...
- Psychos for managers - please see Alec Baldwin's scenes in ""Glengarry Glen Ross"" - its hard to believe, but this is what our weekly sales meetings are like.

But no one can leave because:
- They hide restrictive (if legally unenforceable) provisions in their employment contracts - e.g. you cannot work for another competitor or potential competitor in the UK for 3 months after resigning! No you will not be paid during this time.
- If you are on an employer sponsored work permit - you only have 2 months to find another sponsored role - which is not possible because of the restrictive covenant.
- Don't bother going to HR - it's a ""cloud"" service here (I am yet to meet anyone from HR who is not in external recruitment). All HR engagement is via the intranet or by telephone.
- The only way to avoid this is to go through redundancy - so everyone is putting in their worst possible work so they can escape via the prison sewer system!

The general atmosphere is one of fear and resignation - people are literally tricked into the bank and then trapped and resigned to a life of legal slavery. If offered a role here, please watch ""Glengarry Glen Ross"" or ""12 Years a Slave"" they perfectly describes the situation within this bank."

Managers are required to force-rank employees by titles even though functional roles may be completely different.

The particular office I was in had a great atmosphere, very team-oriented, nice people, and daily perks.","As a new financial advisor (trainee), you are put in the Unregistered UBS Corporate Training program. You have 2 remote calls per week with the corporate office, and everyone is so negative. They talk down to you, and you're basically an adult in grade school (getting picked on, called out in front of everyone, threatened that they'll talk to your manager if you don't do an assignment right). They are basically re-inventing the wheel with these sales tactics. The first 7 weeks are devoted to studying for the Series 7. You are given a 24 chapter book and a set of practice tests, put in a corner, and told to study. No one really pays attention to you - you do not exist until you pass that test. I was told on multiple occasions that what you learn for the 7 has nothing to do with what your real job consists of. However, no one mentored me to actually get a feel of what I'd be doing. I thought I was completely prepared for the exam, but unfortunately, I did not pass. In that case, corporate is required to let you go."

From year end evaluations and promotions to vendor selections, decisions took too long and were always under political scrutiny.

If you are studying or have evening lectures, managers will make it difficullt for you.
There have been wage freezes across UBS for several years, cheaper employees are brought across from support teams without pay increases. They churn through interns to save costs (higher bonuses for management)."

People tend to attack each other instead of help each other at work. There are changes from senior management every week - they seem always able to justify the reason for changing A to B then back to A again."

Trapped in aged IT processes and disparate systems. No application standardization. OS platform is standardized to a fault with little or no flexibility for specific business unit challenges. PMM process has zero correlation to promotions or compensation. IT priorities change along with Upper management changes which are often. New management has little time to implement any vision as a re-org happens typically every 6-8 months. New technologies when implemented are rarely communicated. Offshoring usually eliminates younger technical staff in favor of keeping older upper management. Many layers of management some with no direct reports. Issues usually prompt a deluge of conference calls with focus on finger pointing and ""witch hunts"" creating a culture of ""not my job"" thinking."

6746,,Mediocre organization killed by bureaucracy.,2013-11-02,2.0,Director,It has a strong brand that is perceived to be world class by others so it looks good on your resume.

I was givewn a lot of flexibility by the head of trading to develop my models without distraction.  I was also given the unofficial ability to direct IT to implement my models very quickly and efficiently for use in production.,Not enough investment in technology.  Outsourcing everything and contracting out the technology made it hard to accomplish some tasks that would otherwise be relatively easy to get done - this was especially true with regards to data/speed of data retrieval.
6753,,Good work life balance,2013-10-25,4.0,Associate Director,Many Swiss in the bank so work life balance is well respected.,The recent bad news coverage from overseas branches.

6761,,Ok company to work with,2013-10-17,3.0,Senior Software Developer,The work environment was flexible and I used to get comp days off for any extra work I had done.,Did not see much growth potential. Hard to get any trainings relevant to your field of expertise. Needs improvement at Management level.

Global reach / capabilities
Very good electronic trading platforms - especially in Equities
Very client-centric approach","Significant turnover in management levels across the IB as well as in Support areas
Strategic reduction in staff has lagged and attrition is a concern
Focus on Career Development and Compensation has lagged since '08"
6766,,Horrible,2013-10-10,1.0,Applications Support,"- They don't work you too hard
- If you're good, you can work here indefinitely, that is, as long as they don't decide to axe your entire team","- Lack of IT practices
- Technology is from the stone age
- They hire inexperienced graduates through contracting firms who know absolutely nothing, so you learn nothing from them
- Very bad IT practices
- A place where there are more managers than there are workers
- Incredibly hierarchical
- No transparency
- Tons of paperwork to make the smallest IT changes"
6767,,Awesome work,2013-10-09,5.0,,"Brand name, Excellent work ethic","Selection process, lenghty background checks"
6768,,Good place to work,2013-10-09,4.0,,"Good people, good work-life balance",You may get stuck with way too many rules that end up not serving proposed objectives and slow down service.
6769,,Positive experience,2013-10-07,4.0,Associate Director,Global reach combined with excellent training make it a good post grad starting point for gaining a strong working skill set,Long grueling hours and distance from he make being in a regional office tough to progress further at the firm

6772,,diverse work environment,2013-10-04,3.0,Business Analyst,"Diverse work environment, great opportunity for new recruits to work with very senior management
good mentor ship programs and volunteering initiatives","role allocation not based on employee's education/skill set
too many changes in senior management
big initiatives get scrapped with changes in senior management"
6773,,"Neutral environment, some opportunities / risks",2013-10-03,3.0,Associate Director,Love the European culture (4 weeks vacation is the standard) and for the most part fairly flat hierarchy structure allows access to senior management. There are pockets at UBS that are doing fairly well esp in Wealth Management and front office roles.,"Offshoring / outsourcing is very discouraging and lowers the quality that everything UBS used to stand for. I must say that technology is not even close to where it should be. As far as career growth, it is an absolute joke. Bonuses are not even close of where they used to be and the training is subpar."
6774,,Overall great experience,2013-09-30,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"I worked very hard, put in long hours and was compensated for it. Great large company benefits-health insurance, matching 401k, events, etc.","Even though UBS is a massive global company, career growth isn't always supported - depending upon what position you're in when you join them."
6775,,"UBS like many employers, looks better from outside than inside",2013-09-29,2.0,Anonymous Employee,"Global reach for a bank like UBS is always good. It has also the particularity to pay better than market as UBS is just an hungry consumer and not a people riser...
Still a few fantastic professional and very knowledgeable persons (who are trying to leave the boat unfortunately)","Middle management is absolutely crap. 
They are always on the go to new project (i.e. often pre-run processes or systems or business approach in other institutions or industries) and they will always need to have an extremely formalized approach that takes for ever as mid-mgt does not decide anything...At the first hick-up, they would stop everything and find someone to blaim (usually the very last one in the chain who has no clue whats going on)...lots of evil people and cowards on top of it ...plus no vision at all... many bankers who have less knowledge than beginners sometimes.. (many people managing something they reaaaally dont understand and just try to compensate with communication - meant wind here - ridiculous indeed)
As a consequence, absolutely no people management or career enhancement...
UBS good at personal marketing, good at talking about innovation but not open to change through innovation and hence killing in the eggs is a 'national sport'
Hiring process: they want best of the best, launching job description that more than 80% or UBS employees cant even dream about accomplishing it once in their life...so they pay at high rate and later, once you are in, either you've got a very musculous tongue or you are off the page
UBS is doing good in business at the moment, but this does not impact yet career development (horizontally, vertically and/or geographically)"
6776,,A good company living through difficult times,2013-09-26,3.0,Software Developer,"Very nice, knowledgeable, hard working colleagues. Can learn a lot here. International exposure: working together with colleagues in many countries on all continents.","The bank is in a survival mode. It lost a lot of money. Shrinks and cuts operations. Layoffs all the time, from a very top to a very bottom. Four CEOs and four chairmans changed in 4-5 years. Every one is very bright, is an outstanding executive and has excellent ideas, every one changed strategies cardinally - but it is hard to execute and especially to tune up all the strategies so often."
6777,,My best working place in life,2013-09-26,5.0,Associate Director,"Great people
A lot to learn
Nice office
Opportunity to work outside

-Still a pretty capable bank, some decent deals and exposure 
-Analyst classes are filled out pretty well - diverse, smart people. Usually best thing about joining is the analyst network after","-Terrible management at practically every level. Everyone is looking out for themselves, do not care to develop junior staff and frequently throw them under the bus. 
-Upward movement is based more on politics than it is on merit
-No direction besides cost cutting. Senior management provides no guidance, tells their bankers to cut costs but then punishes them for not closing deals. Result is a free-for-all amongst all the bankers, severe politics to stay afloat, and no consideration for the long-term
-any major talent has pretty much jumped ship already after a series of poor management decisions and financial blowups due to poor risk management and a culture that encourages immense risk-taking"
6781,,Financial Advisor,2013-09-25,4.0,Wealth Advice Center Financial Advisor,World class firm. Great benefits. Good experience.,Lack of opportunities to move up. Pay has been stagnant. High Net worth focus contradicts with accounts who are below High Net Worth. Trading fees are very high. No online platform.

6786,,Too much nepotism,2013-09-20,1.0,Senior Analyst,Provide a good amount of training. UBS has a good offering of courses you can take to further your knowledge in a variety of subjects.,Meritocracy is not a priority. Employees were rated subjectively with bias. Employees are evaluated by managers that do not know the duties the employee is performing.
6787,,Lumbering from one accident to another,2013-09-18,2.0,Associate,"- You get a shot at doing the stuff only senior folks do at other banks, because senior people leave at an amazing rate.","- The bank has had heaps pf problems in the past years, rogue traders, fired CEOs, rotating cast of senior management.
- The bank most notorious for over-hiring and over-firing (ask the FICC guys)
- The bank will soon have no FICC or Investment banking businsess to speak of, so unless you want to work in wealth management, look elsewhere."
6788,,A very cultural place to work,2013-09-16,4.0,Senior Client Service Associate,Great people to work with,Upper management not on board with employees all the time

6792,,worst place I've ever worked,2013-09-13,1.0,Director,The desk heads are talented people.,'Industrialization' has made everything horrific.  Nothing gets done.  It's actually written in the policy that they do not give cost of living increases so most people have not gotten any raise in 5 years when the salaries are known to be below market to begin with.  There is not one person I know who is happy there.  Everyone thinks they have to be prepping for sale cause there really can be no other reason that things can be run this poorly.

The systems are outdated, everything is siloed, and for the most part nobody knows what anyone else is doing.

6824,,A true love hate relationship with UBS,2013-07-17,2.0,Associate Director,"The technology of this bank is outdated, between the 1990's to 2000's, and the bank is far from perfect (what company is?), however instead of looking at this from a negative point of view, I saw the positive side of it.  The nature of my position and the lack of resources available allowed me to utilize my creativity to the max, which also helped me improve my computer programming and communication skills greatly.  The people were nice, mostly open to suggestions, and seemed to appreciate my work for the departments.

Of course, the nature of my position was made possible by my boss who was fortunately very open minded.  He let me do my job independently with minimal supervision.  If I have had anything less, my viewpoints would have been very different and my creativity would have been limited.

In my particular department, there was downsizing and this occurs everywhere in every company at some point or another.  Thus, I can't put this as a con since this is a part of life and business restructure.  Again, I looked at the downsizing as an opportunity for myself and utilized my creativity to the max to help offset the lack of resources through innovation.  This is a pro because the company let me be creative, listened to my suggestions, let me execute my decisions, and overall had been very accommodating.  I know a lot of people complain about the technology there (and so did I my first few months), but there are some things we can't control.  I learned to focus on what I could control, and turned the negatives into major opportunities.","There are definitely cons to working at UBS.  Unfortunately because of these cons, this fact had pushed me into looking for new employment about 1.5 years into the company.  I am not one to criticize management or to give my personal opinion about how they should act, mainly because I do not have the full story.  But I will say this:

Although the lack of resources as I mentioned above allowed me to be creative and work smarter, the lack of resources also affected my personal growth at the company.  I had expected to have a small team working for me by the end of the 2nd year, and I still had no support.  Think about it, if you are the only maintenance and support technician on site, what happens?  You can't leave your position, ever.  There would be no way for me to personally grow at this company since any promotion would indicate I would no longer be available to support my original duties.

The lack of any salary increases also was off-putting.  Most people will say ""but no one got a raise"", or ""you haven't been at the company that long"" but we shouldn't think that way.  Everyone is different and has different achievements and time frames.  Why should I have to be at any company for even 5 years to see a promotion if my work is truly valued?  I only look at my own achievements, and if the company is not giving promotions or salary increases throughout the department despite individual contributions, there really isn't much one can do but to either take it, or move on."

3. Wasteful - people spend a huge amount of time doing things for the sake of doing them, knowing no value is added
Some senior employees (e.g. ED/MD) are dissatisfied with the IB CEO, given that he was hired directly from outside and was paid $26m to join amid turbelent times at UBS. Also, they may not work together or even work against each other in different teams/departments, thereby leading to lower revenue being made
Junior employees (e.g. NO/AO/AD) may not work together to solve issues and may hide what they know/what they do. It's understandable that one may be ingeuine at work, but being fake all the times and saying non-sensial work to be of high value is truly disgusting."

Also, top management is too involved with one particular political party and I believe that is poor judgement as our leaders represent a large diversity of employees."

While certain groups may not meet the same level of diversity the firm boasts as a whole, UBS is recognized as a market leader in every financial hub around the world.","UBS tends to have a very conservative work environment.

Not much scope if you are in the investment banking dept.,"Working on old and crap homegrown frameworks and technologies! Management expects you to work for 50+ hours regularly. On our team there had more managers than developers but the expectations to deliver was like they were developers too. Everyone seems to want to become a manager and no one wishes to write code. Heavens forbid if you are in the Investment Banking IT dept. The Investment Banking business as of now is a non profitable business area, so expect meagre pay raises and bonuses. Absolutely not worthy of an investment bank. Don't take up a job in the Investment Banking IT dept unless they pay you extremely well for sacrificing on a decent work/life balance working on old technologies.Full time employees in the team were leaving regularly every few months. Most of the work is done by the offshore vendors' onsite resources who are offcourse much cheaper.

Mgmt had layed off a couple of full timers on the team (offcourse as a larger decision to increase shareholder wealth). Was pretty brutal. You get taken into a meeting room, are told the news and are asked to leave the premises then and there. Doesn't matter if you have been working there for 6 months or 3 years, you won't get to say good bye to your colleagues.I guess it is the ""Wall Street"" culture, so can't blame one company for that."

7057,,Workplace Cultural Fit Adaptation and The Competitive Advantage,2012-10-21,4.0,Associate,"Globalisation has made this worldwide organization into a more collaborative and diverse, informed workforce that seeks to deploy a framework that goes beyond normal efforts to help accomodate, assimilate, and accelerate any new hires, internally or externally. Recently, the relationships between people and systems were managed through a close coupled environment allowing the individual employee the capacity to work at the specific task in which they specialize but there was always the growing potential to shifting to a loose-coupled environment to allow the possibility of progressive employee improvement and contribution beyond internal agility and individual flexibility in the workplace.","Conversely, the competition among wealth management businesses and increased regulatory climate has forced this large organization to seek a cultural fit with its employees that defines how they feel about the organization's attitude as a whole and how they communicate with each other. A more peripheral vision and alignment of key stakeholders( read employees) as well as the pay and reward mechanisms of the current culture can and should nurture the fundamental changes needed to effect a change that will involve employee self-accountability and commitment to succeed."

Fantastic if working directly with clients in branches or offered position directly into the Investment Banking segment (not good in lower corporate office functions - advancement rare and not based on performance despite what all the intranet sites say).,"Rigid hierarchial structure that stifles the improvement of internal procedures that, if structure were flattened, would create cost efficiencies and more transparency.  Instead, higher positions (higher in salary and name, but certainly not because of efficiency which is ironic for a Swiss firm) are maintained and lower positions cut or outsourced when a quarter gets too tight."

7069,,Downhill,2012-09-25,2.0,Director,Work life balance can be good.  Accommodating management.,Performance reviews are a farce - objectives are set and can be met while performance reviews are relative to your peers.  This leads to subjective reviews where management favorites are rewarded.  Culture is poor as employees who are part of a cost center are viewed as a liability as opposed to value add to the organization.

7074,,Getting on the right foot,2012-09-20,3.0,Anonymous Employee,"Recent turnover means there are often opportunities for junior people to take on larger roles. While this is not applied across the board, someone who is sharp and opportunistic can often make things happen for themselves.","By the same token, high turnover means that bankers do not have as much traction with clients relative to their competitors. Frustratingly, those people who build the strongest relationships all seem to leave after some time, leading to the perception that the firm has a rotating door."

Most of the work revolves around project and relationship management. Given the brand, it can be a little tough to truly push the envelope for getting marketing collateral created. However, when big projects are completed and you [hopefully] get feedback on how it helped an FA build their business, it can be extremely rewarding. Great colleagues help to make the work environment less stressful","Pay is definitely not competitive with the rest of the financial services industry (verified with numerous friends, ex-colleagues and recruiters with knowledge of similar job roles within the industry), too much emphasis is placed on pleasing the FA and not necessarily remaining compliant with Firm/industry regulations, career options within your department can be limited"

Probably the best place I have worked for training and courses and if you want to take on more work they will heap it on you, but you have to perform, and as long as you fit the profile you will go far.","Its all about playing the game @ UBS. You make the right noises to the right people you will go far. They take you for granted after a year or two so if you haven't been promoted or looked after in that time I would say move on. This was probably the worst firm I have seen for management self promotion, and people being entirely self motivated for their own gain and to hell with everyone else."
7082,,This is a company in rapid decline,2012-09-11,1.0,Executive Director,"There were a lot of positive things about this company before 2007, but sadly I don't have anything positive to say about this company today.","1) The only lever available to the company is ""reduce costs"". The current staffing level is beyond ""cut to the bone""/at the stage of ""removing limbs"".
2) Vast amounts of talented people (quants, front office, IT, control functions) have either walked out the door or wiggled into getting laid off. Management is disconnected from the reality of the work that is required to keep the company running and constantly dumps more onto staff without concern for people's existing workload. This is not how you make a challenging and stimulating environment.
3) UBS has an uncanny ability to be in the press constantly for one or more scandals/lawsuits.
4) The execution of the stated culture and values is disingenuous.

This is a call center and is the bottom of the barrel at UBS.  The Investment Center takes everyone's trash and management is full of Yes-Men who offer no value. As a CSA your work is mundane and boring you gain no transferable skills and if you get promoted to a ""Financial Advisor"" you become a call center customer service rep.
Management is a joke.  They play favorites, do not reward hard work and are unprofessional.  Days go by without your work getting approved or processed by the operations manager.   If you do not agree with management they will hold a grudge.  Management will also make it difficult for you to make any type of internal transfer within UBS.  Management will be very spiteful and make sure you do not leave.
