CEO, Andy Cecere, really does try to do the right thing, even when it's not easy.","Despite many awards for diversity, there are major issues. For example a recent article lauded the Legal dept for its diversity when there wasn't a single black person in the reporting structure. Like many corporations, ""diversity"" often means white women. While community outreach initiatives are admirable, internal racist attitudes are abundant despite a face of politeness, and retention and career progress are impacted. Despite DEI programs, many employees resent it and do not engage (the company makes it optional). 

Can be difficult to move around in company without a personal rapport."

175,,Wow - that was not a fun rollercoaster,2022-03-03,2.0,Human Resources Advisor,"I worked with a newly developed group called Human Resources Advisory Services. The pros of this team may also be cons. There was little supervision in our roles and little accountability; meaning that some on the team could skate by with having to do little work at the expense of others on the team drowning in work. Leadership never quite figured out how to balance work between employees. Secondly, working from home was a plus (albeit this was due to COVID-19, and less to do so with leadership promoting WFH). Third, you controlled the cases you received, meaning that you could prioritize your work day the way you best saw fit.","Oof where to start. Going back on the little oversight by leadership - it got to the point where I felt like we were managing our leaders rather than them managing us. Sometimes I truly felt that leadership didn't quite understand what we even did. I had biweekly 1:1's that sometimes my manager didn't attend or would forget about. One point in time my manager cancelled 4 of these meetings in a row, meaning I didn't once hear from them about my performance or how I was doing for 7 weeks straight. It was like I was just on autopilot for those 7 weeks. 

Then came the pay discrepancies and title discrepancies. US Bank tried to RIF roughly 80 members of HR in attempt to be more ""agile"". Part of this RIF caused about 30 members of other areas of HR to join the Human Resources Advisory Services team. These 30 new members joined the team all with varying pay and experience handling this type of HR work. This led to the team creating a tier of HR roles that were chosen based on years of experience with US Bank rather than experience with actually working employee relations-type work. Some members within the same team, doing the same job in the same location were making anywhere from $5,000 - $30,000 more or less than their peers. This pay inequality and experience gap also caused a revolving door of HR professionals quitting and constant backfilling. It was a nightmare keeping track of who was still even with the company and who was on their way out or had already left. 

All in all - I felt like all of this caused such a distraction from us being able to do our best work to support the company. It was an experience I would never want to experience again.

I could go on but I'm running out of characters to type."

Over the 8 years I’ve been here, never felt more disconnected than the last few. My job feels meaningless, my managers are good talkers that don’t actually know how to run a business, my team doesn’t work together. 

The CEO is an accountant with no backbone and is pushing HRs progressive political agenda to get us to appreciate, and almost worship, people of any color or gender that isn’t white and male. Communication from Corporate makes no sense half the time it’s like they’re speaking to any random group of people. There is no cultural identity we are less than cogs."

4. Administrators who call in can treat you like complete garbage and you are not allowed to respond. Management does not stick up for employees.
5. You are expected to know everything about an impossible amount of systems and departments. Management often does not even know the systems you are expected to know. You are set up to fail in every sense, and punished when you inevitably do.
6. You will work your tail off day in and day out, and the raises are pitiful. You do not get fairly compensated for the work that you do.

Poor Training- all done in Ad-Hoc fashion by employees on the floor who are way too busy with their own responsibilities to take the time to thoroughly explain anything. 

Work-Life balance is non-existent (expected to work 50+ hours weekly with no overtime pay)

Company culture is to put the company before your health/family. If you aren’t willing to do this you will be treated like an outsider.

Over worked and under paid. Minimal bonus offered and compensation well below industry average. 

Continue to take on new clients, but don’t hire enough workforce to handle new workload and don’t offer raises/incentives to employees taking on the additional work/hours. 

Management is dishonest and always looking to get over on you.

Management retaliates and treats employees poorly because they can easily get away with it. (With 70k plus employees HR/Employee Services take months to process claims for ANYTHING).

Management harasses employees.

Department is too busy to train properly, but will then get upset if you aren’t producing at the same level as tenured employees after only a few months."

667,,Watch your back.,2021-10-16,1.0,Visual Interaction Designer,"You will learn to recognize a fundamentally toxic organization after working here. You will get multiple ""goodbye"" emails each week with subtle jabs about how horrible the environment was. You will be restructured every 6 months at minimum, more likely every 4 months. If you are at all successful, you will be attacked by mediocre employees who have worked here for years and can't get hired anywhere else. You will eventually be replaced by a parallel outsourced design team who works 10 hour days at a fraction of your salary.","This is the worst place I have ever worked and can't wait to leave. I've been here for a few years but finally have another offer. I was restructured yet again and have been relentlessly bullied by coworkers in my new department. These ""coworkers"" are on a project where it seems there were too many people and not enough work. Even though I was on a different project, these people have attacked me and anyone transferred to the dept. 

Things were supposed to change with all of the new executive leadership. The bullying has worsened since they arrived. I am also now being forced to work with the bullies because they are merging our teams (more restructuring!!!). Some of us tried to escalate the issues but we were ignored. 

All the executives have done is talk. They do things that don't matter right now, like set up ""cafes"", instead of solving real crisis problems. We need real leadership. We need a zero tolerance bullying policy. This place will be burnt to the ground by the people who have been rotting here....chasing away all the new talent. One person left this summer, said in a group meeting that she lost 15lbs in a month from not eating due to the stress. There was another person who left shortly after the new executives arrived because of the spiral downwards of leadership in the design department. These are huge signs you can't ignore. It is not only grunts like me leaving...it is managers and directors because even they know they can't fix USB now. This is an abusive culture.

But wait, there's more. So much outsourcing. They have parallel design teams in India that are supposed to work with you. Except how do you work with them when they are asleep when you are awake? USB keeps saying they are not our replacements. Yet they have the same number of employees and are working on the exact same products. I started out as a contractor and at the time, my agency said that in about 3 years USB would stop hiring in the U.S. and not backfill...so that the outsourced contractors could take over the design work."

There are monthly, no-monthly & quarterly meetings with management so that you get to know what is happening within your area.","Since the corporation is so big it is hard to move (switch from Default to Performing). Management are suppose to be able to help with career advancements however they only know so much and have so much resources at your finger tips. It is somewhat hard to get notice for outstanding accomplishments, they do have have where do-workers & management can nominate you for an award but sometimes people are so busy with everyday work life they don’t have time to nominate for any good that you have done.

671,,Wouldn't Recommend to My Worst Enemy,2021-10-15,1.0,Customer Service Representative (CSR),- The benefits are nice,"- Might have been just me, but my manager sucked
- Terrible recovery of 401k and it would take 2 weeks before I could even start the process to recover my account and an additional 2 weeks to receive my funds
- Timing is terrible. I quit back in August, got 4 threatening letters at once about their equipment (even though I didn't have return slips and refused to pay $200+ for returning their equipment) and it's currently October 15th with no update aside from ""You'll have to wait, you're at the end of the process,"" although I contacted HR on October 4th (after repeated contacts from September 1st thru 20th regarding these slips) 
- If you ever need help for anything HR related, expect a hour and a half hour long wait just to get basically told ""Welp. We can't do anything,"" or ""Someone else handles that,"" and a further hour and a half wait to be told the former 
- Please, honestly, unless you need money, never work here if possible. Maybe I got unlucky once again, but I would rather work at McDonald's than here ever again in my life"

I was also in college full time and working full time, but my manager at the time was very flexible with me. There was the ability to work part time, full time, or ""floater"" hours, which were to cover lunches and Saturdays.

Overall, I truly enjoyed working for this company.","Upper management seemed helpful in the beginning of the 3 years I was employed there, but after about a year I noticed that they could be two-faced and a passive aggressive. Not all of them, but a select few were just mean. I think that's probably something you face in almost any job you'll have, but this is just the biggest downside I had when I worked there. Otherwise, I truly enjoyed working for this company."

I have wasted 5 months of my life proving that I shouldn't be working in the department I started in. Had a job opportunity, I was still over qualified for, nullified by this rule.

During the interview process I was told that they were restructuring their positions. They were doing away completely with teller positions and wanted to move towards their bankers fulfilling both roles. This, based off what I know now working with them seems more like a move to save on the amount of people they had to have on payroll than anything. We have been understaffed, not just at my location, but at most of the other branches in the local area. This for my branch in specific, all started to be most prevalent after we lost five members of staff within my first six months. It was then left to four members of staff, including myself to manage a high traffic branch, keeping appointments, managing sales goals and somehow getting people through the teller lines. There were not and still are not enough of us to maintain this pace and function. It is taxing to say the least. Most days it feels like I live in the branch."

- They do make all attempts to listen to employees on most things","- Comp/benefits are quite meager, even for banking. We get generous time-off, annual bonuses, and a pension. But salary, insurance, commuter benefits, etc all leave much to be desired.
- Remote culture is poor (prob depending on team). Most employees would prefer to WFH for life but upper mgmt is pushing everyone into the office this year, causing mass unhappiness.
- Recent focus on offshoring has resulted in layoffs/early retirement of long-time employees with a ton of invaluable business knowledge. These individuals were taken care of, via generous severance or finding another internal job, but team morale was hit very hard.
- Holy technical debt, Batman!
- Rushing very important, and massive in scale, technical changes. Such as cloud, Git, Maven, CI/CD. DevOps/Infra teams are generally understaffed and come off as unhelpful to dev groups.

1286,,Worst Company To Work For!!,2021-04-30,1.0,Universal Banker,4% 401k match and good benefits.,"To give a little background about myself, I have been with the company for 4+ years. I have gone above and beyond for U.S. Bank. For the first two years (2017-2019) the company was great to work for! Unfortunately, in the last 2 years (2019-2020) the company has gone down hill. 

First, management like set goals for promotion, then when goals are met, they change the goals without giving promotion for past work. Management also adds more responsibility repeatedly without increase in pay. As of the beginning of 2020, U.S. Bank changed their incentives policy and will also not be paying out commissions or bonuses from here on out. 

When branch is short staffed they refuse to provide sufficient coverage even provide a lunch. When the branch manager requests to hire more people to compensate for short staff, their request are brushed aside and request is terminated. 

Lastly, the computers and programs that we use to process transactions are awful and go down continuously. It is a daily activity calling IT with system related issues. 

I have formally submitted my resignation. I do not recommend working for this company!"

1295,,Client Relationship Consultant,2021-04-28,3.0,Client Relationship Consultant,"decent pay, gain banker knowledge",bad management and bad leadership
1296,,** Avoid at ALL Costs! **,2021-04-28,1.0,Deposit Banker II,There are not any pros,"- Abusive leadership. My original supervisor was incredibly condescending, short, and overall a huge displeasure to work under. I could not bring any question up to him without it having a sarcastic joke or ill-placed emoji placed to make it seem like ""yeah, you should have already known that"", despite me only being on the floor for maybe a week or two. I've been yelled at on the floor several times for asking questions or my PC not working properly. When I brought it to HR, they didn't reach out to me until I was transferring teams (weeks later), and even then they encouraged me to let them know what was going on, despite it no longer having an effect on me anymore. I told them I had no interest and didn't feel comfortable in going forward with the complaint, but it was too late - I still had to talk to them about it.
- No HR support and needing to get in touch with any other HR related department is seemingly impossible. See the above point, but also, for my last 2 weeks, I had used vacation time I didn't earn and was billed for the difference, which I expected. I paid the amount that I was told to after not being able to get in touch with their Employee Collections team for almost a week until they returned my call. They then sent me a check with a difference on it (despite paying exactly what I was told to), but the check itself was printed on printer paper, not check paper - a mistake I was appalled go see happen at a banking institution. I've been in touch with HR for the past few weeks, where they give me the run around about how they could help me when this initial problem happened, but now can no longer do anything and I have to call the Employee Services department for more information ... A number that has a continuous 1+ hour queue and will auto-disconnect at the 1 hour and 10 minuet mark.
- From Deposit Banker I to Deposit Banker II is a forced promotion where you take on all call queues, despite you being trained in any of them. For example, we were not trained in PPP Loans, which would be a business class transfer, but the queue was so overloaded with PPP Loan inquiries they were continuously being forced to the Deposit II queue and we were told to ""just look up"" any information the customers were wanting to know. Also, being trained in Business Class has a raise associated with it - Something we were not given during this ~3 week long ordeal.
- Constant Technology and PC Program Issues. U.S. Bank relies on several systems to function at any given time to properly handle calls. Within my time working there, for any possible reason and without fail, there would be at least ONE constant issue running throughout my programs that hindered me taking calls (my softphone system would be forced into ACW despite it literally showing me that I'm Available. I'm not able to pull up accounts with customer-given information despite their SSN / Account number being exact and needing to close out of my software to restart it. Not being able to file disputes because our disputes platform received an error, and will not be accepting disputes **for that specific account** until the following day at least. When this issue is forwarded to management, nothing is filed and the call ended up being for nothing). Constant tech issues impacts my AHT, which then impacts my surveys and the rest of my stats, and I receive horrible stats because of something that was out of my control and nothing would be done about it. This then caused me to not be able to leave departments because of my numbers, and essentially got me stuck in a dead end job.
- leadership is hired externally. Once your begin as a base banker within the CCC environment, that is you position to stay in (plus added training for different departments), but for everything else, including management / promotion within departments, those positions are filled externally despite having strong, tenured candidates that are ready for something more bring available.

I could easily go on, but these are the top few horrible constants that I had endured at U.S. Bank. Think twice before wanting to work for a company that hinders you by giving you faulty tools and limited access for personal growth."

Nobody seemed to really know where to assign incoming helpdesk tickets, so that users could get the assistance that they needed. I felt that more training and guide materials would have made things much easier to streamline the ticketing escalation process.

When we first came on board, we we encouraged and energized but now are defeated, sad, disheartened.... and the $$ that he spent on some strange ""change management"" firm to tell this utterly bizzare tale would likely pay the annual salary of most of us. Very wasteful.

But hey! It paid to eliminate a whole bunch of HRBPs who were utterly loyal to the business. The HRBP function was centralized and now it takes literal days to get a response on an HR issue that would take no more than one hour previously.

On the 22nd of April, a gigantic slew (12+) of dedicated, caring, thoughtful, motivating managers were also eliminated. I do understand that we were a bit ""top heavy"", but to eliminate the direct managers who motivate and inspire your recruiters, who basically are the lifeblood of USB?

I guess that's good job security for the rest of us?,"Outdated software, policies and procedures get updated and then you have to battle with people who don't keep up to date and try to use long past expired guidelines. Training is a complete joke, the 'learning &development' teams don't understand the jobs they're expected to teach and the videos we have to watch largely don't pertain to our specific role but exist to keep the bank out if the regulators cross hairs. They 'merge and transition' support teams with no plan for the work that the removed team was doing so when we're already overworked we get more. Raises are less than inflation, even in a record breaking sales year, and we're told to meet production goals 'no matter what' so there is a lot of stress and anxiety and cutting corners."

*High moral standard concerning treatment of customers. 

*Anecdotally, U.s Bank has consistently bent over backwards to accommodate issues and needs of myself and others around me (both personal and professional) during the 2020 pandemic and before. 

*Anecdotally, management is a balance of understanding, supportive and accommodating while being knowledgeable and professional. I have 22 years in various customer service and management positions. I have, genuinely, never been more impressed by managerial staff.

*Insurance implemented immediately after successfully completing training. Decent benefits. 2 weeks vacation with the opportunity to buy a 3rd.

1572,,Got back stabbed by Supervisor,2021-02-26,2.0,Quality Assurance Analyst,Was able to pay my bills for two years,"My supervisor told me that I could start learning a new skill unrelated to my position but still helpful for the company. My manager asked me why I was spending working hours learning this so I told her my supervisor agreed to it. My manager asked my supervisor if that was true she denied it. I got fired because of it.

I also remember one instance where we were trying to get approved one day working from home, asked the Vice President of the office if that could be possible, he said that more companies were walking away from that benefit and he didn’t see it as a possibility, even though he worked from home from another state! I also asked why our bonuses were below the inflation rate (only 1.5%) and he said they were saving the money for the outstanding employees."
1573,,Terrible company that doesn't care about its employees at all,2021-02-26,2.0,Client Relationship Consultant I NMLS,"Good benefits, opportunities to move up, and off on all bank holidays.","I can literally write a novel about all of the cons I ran into during my time at U.S. Bank. I'll just list out some of those things. Starting out with how the company went to trash the second covid hit last year. The company decided to go on a hiring freeze and stop current employees from applying to different positions within the company. That caused a lot of branches to be short staffed and it also caused a lot of stress on the current employees. You were literally stuck in your position and you couldn't do anything about it. The employees I worked with were all lazy, loved starting drama, and would micromanage me nonstop. Literally it got to the point where I was being questioned about everything I was doing. The branch manager that I worked for had no backbone and would rather not get involved with what was going on inside the branch. He would sit behind his desk all day and never wanted to help us on the teller line during busy hours. U.S. Bank decided to implement an annual payout on incentives instead of a quarterly payout. The incentives were based on the branch numbers, not individual numbers but then the company turned around and said the incentives were based on the district's numbers as a whole, not just the branch you work at. This caused for a lot of people to not get any incentives at all. Literally all of the sales we made last year meant nothing and no one got paid for them. This company is being ran by crooks. I don't recommend working for this company especially if you want to keep your happiness and sanity."
1574,,Decent for a call center gig,2021-02-26,4.0,Inbound Fraud,"DISCLAIMER: Company culture varies widely between the different call centers. My experience is only for the CDA center. Pros: Transparent expectations and pay scale. Pretty good dental/medical/vision available on day one. No call scripting, aside from a couple small legal disclosures. Extremely flexible work from home options during COVID, and strong in-office policies to keep the workplace as safe as possible. Yearly performance based bonuses/raises that you actually WILL get if you work for them. And U.S. Bank has hands down the best environment I have ever been in for LGBT employees (including really solid corporate wide policies for trans people to work under preferred name/etc without any hoops to jump through).","When I started the Fraud department was the place where they trusted us to have a brain and some common sense - compared to the customer service departments, there were fewer inane checkboxes and a larger focus on just getting the job done, and as long as it was done right that's all that mattered. Within the last few months executive decisions from on high have been slowly chipping away at that independence, starting to dictate in increasingly specific ways how calls should be processed. Local level management is fighting back against it, but they're slowly losing the battle."
1575,,Mediocre,2021-02-26,2.0,Teller,The only pros were some of my branch-level co-workers and it pays more than some other banks.,Management is not good. Higher-ups do not care about tellers and lower positions. They only pay attention to you if you have a lot of sales.
1576,,A lot of work to do at the top,2021-02-26,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"The nice part about US Bank is its size, they have resources that smaller companies would not","The new executive leadership lacks transparency, and they are very much in it for the money and themselves. I know it sounds like, that is no different from any large bank, the issue is that it used to be different under the former leadership. This bank has lost its way and its turnover in roles reflects it new goals."

1739,,"Overall, US Bank is a good company",2021-01-29,4.0,Client Relationship Consultant,I had great people to work with at my branch. I would feel comfortable going back to work for US Bank.,"My immediate manager was very checked out for over a year and did not motivate or inspire us to do better. Most of us just did what was necessary to get by and keep our heads above water. Due to staff cuts, we were too understaffed to make efforts to go above and beyond sales-wise."
1740,,Good place to work but some issues,2021-01-29,4.0,Product Owner,"U.S. Bank has the highest ethical standards of any American bank, and it stands out for its decency and fairness. I never once felt looked down upon by management, and over my 13.5 years with the company I felt like I myself, my customers, and my co-workers were all treated fairly. There are lots of opportunities for hard workers, and I miss working there. (I was laid off in October 2020.)","I have only minor complaints from my time working at U.S. Bank.

1. U.S. Bank may be nice, but it's also a ""no frills"" place to work. No fancy holiday parties at this company, and awards to outstanding workers are few and far between. Cost cutting never seems to end, and can be demoralizing.

2. Healthcare coverage with United Healthcare provided by this employer can be a challenge at times. The plans seem appealing at first for their low deductibles and low costs, and the employer sponsored FSA is nice. But if you want to make use of healthcare services you may find yourself fighting with United Healthcare on a regular basis. For example, the bank's mental health plan generously provides $0 co-pay outpatient services once individual deductible is met. But UHC does not code this into their claims processing, and that can mean numerous monthly phone calls you shouldn't have to make.

3. U.S. Bank has in recent years gotten into the bad habit of reorganization through layoffs, and I think they are still learning how to make the process humane. I didn't like that half of my severance payment came with significant strings attached. I especially didn't appreciate the lie told by the bank that laid off employees are favored for job openings. Not only was I turned down for numerous positions for which I was well-qualified, but absolutely no one I know who was laid off was able to successfully get back into the bank. I've only heard of it happening one time. In truth, getting laid off from the bank actually appears to be held against you when applying to get re-hired. The bank's outright lie about opportunities for laid off employees cost me a lot of valuable time."

1754,,My Honest Review,2021-01-26,2.0,Senior Business Systems Analyst (IT),This is a good place to work if you are looking for a stable job.,This is a terrible place to work. The bank has horrible insurance that doesn’t cover medical expenses at all due to the high deductibles. Management does not want to compensate with raises or bonuses fairly to reward good work so the politics are bad. The pay is ridiculously low for the industry standards for the same type of position or work at the bank so they want cheap labor. There are no opportunities for career advancement for employees.

Most of the upper management expects you to want to work 80hrs/week for bad pay when they just clock in and clock out and don’t care. Denver office needs some work.

You will learn things you can learn in other jobs like looking at numbers, team leadership, how to be resourceful, the ability to multitask and more! I learned a lot about things due to having amazing managers. My role now is in a different industry and I feel some of the soft skills I learned really helped me.","It can be difficult to move up.. its a matter of what district you are in.. if its a merit based one you will be good, if it goes more on hierarchy you may be stuck in your role for longer then you would like. It really all depends..

I've brought these issues up with both my manager and district manager.

This opportunity created great relationships with coworkers and customers alike. I gained a massive amount of knowledge within banking and the financial industry as a whole, some from the company learning center, even more from long-term employees. U.S. Bank's good employees are what makes this place great.","It's a massive company! Retail banking technology can have its issues, but they do their best to continue updating. Communication between departments can be time consuming and sometimes inefficient. The worst part is the turnover rate within retail banking - since the Banker positions are more of a stepping stone, they seem to be too slow to promote to the next level, therefore talent goes elsewhere or to a different department sometimes causing branches to be short-staffed. For example I went through 4 Branch Managers over 3 years."

All they care about is driving customers out of the retail bank world by forcing digital on every warm body! Including the elderly and disabled that I LOVED to help.

Branches are closing and they're getting rid of older employees to pay new ones less. The branch focus shifted from customer experience to sales focus, making us lose long time clients. I had to leave because my job title was being eliminated across the company. Tellers don't exist anymore, and they turned everyone into bankers for sales numbers. Incentives are low or non-existent. One of our rewards for reaching a top sales goal were -pens-. PENS. For a multi billion dollar company, seems pretty ridiculous that our systems were down half the time and computers were broken. Management had no communication with employees."
2487,,Room for improvement.,2020-02-06,3.0,Social Media Specialist,"- Good benefits (PTO, sick time, etc.)
- Loved my extended co-workers.
- Flexible work location culture.

I appreciated the updates made to company policy to include more sick time and to also allow sick time to be rolled over. You have the ability to purchase additional vacation days. Vacation days are use it or lose it, so plan accordingly.

The team I worked on has employees located throughout the states (in other offices and also 100% remote) and is very telecommunication focused. Presence in the office was rarely a necessity. Even when the entire team was in the office, they  met via virtual meetings and not in-person unless it was for a special training.

The team had an 'always a student' culture. I was empowered to take continuing education courses as well as begin my Master's degree with assistance from the education reimbursement program. I also had the privilege of attending multiple conference (local and out of state) which I will always be thankful for.","- Poor management checks and balances.
- Low pay increases. 
- Low focus on camaraderie.

My largest grievance with U.S. Bank was that I rarely felt appreciated and think there's a large opportunity for improvement through employee recognition. My communication and recognition styles, while asked for and communicated often, were disregarded leading me to feel a low sense of morale and essentially no camaraderie with my immediate team members. 

When accepting this position, I was an internal hire transitioning from another team. It gave me a leg up in getting hired but was a hindrance when making a case for an increase in compensation. I was told there was a cap on what my pay increase could be, a policy which I heard was either overturned or never existed shortly after accepting this role. It was very he said, she said so I'm not confident in any of that information. Regardless, during my time in this role,  I provided research on compensation for similar positions in our geographical area, completed continuing education courses and became a niche subject matter expert and instead of being rewarded and empowered through this proactive growth, my position was ultimately eliminated and I was laid off from the company."

Loved my customers!!!,"Where to begin? Corporate restructuring called for eliminating the incentive package for bankers - not managers. In between the Monday when it was announced and the Wednesday mandatory cheerleading meeting I touched $3.2M of influence and was given a .21 an hour raise to compensate for the incentive being withdrawn. I guess they thought bankers couldn't do the math? A couple months later all banker positions were eliminated with encouragement to apply along with everyone else living in the area scrambling for a lower paying position. There is a lot of hoopla about the ""someday down the road"" that truly is a dead end. Management puts so many unrealistic obstacles in place and then if you do by some miracle meet or exceed them, you are told it is not your time yet. Bla bla bla. The branch itself was seriously outdated with plumbing problems in the restroom regularly, heating/cooling was a guessing game, the furniture was cheap and beat up, and the flooring, fixtures, woodwork, paint etc was all pathetic.  Cheap! This for one of the most profitable branches in the region and sometimes in the nation. Big question? Where did all the revenue go? You guessed it -- upstairs to the important people in management and the beloved share holders - who btw have no idea, none whatsoever, what it actually takes to generate the revenue they enjoy by cultivating real live relationships with customers who trust your judgement. I'm pretty sure they haven't worked with the public because they are so insulated from reality and believe a dumb script written by a recent college grad right out of the frat house will be just the magic to do the trick.  Speaking of tricks, if you want to have statistics, matrix and goals run at you in so many directions you won't be able to decipher where to start - this is a job for you!!!!  I have a sense they create confusion so you really can't figure out the shell game being played. Then don't forget the ""power days"" when it is mandatory to stop all the work you have in progress until you sign customers up for the mobile app - all the while getting hundreds of emails crowding your inbox from those in the region boasting ""Just got my app"" - peer group pressure at its worst. Then waste an hour finding the one email you NEEDED to close a loan. Yup - given a choice between getting a mobile app or a $500K mortgage refinance I will take my dose of shame as a loser and close the real deal - sort of how grown ups do things. FYI when a customer came in to lock their interest rate on a HELOC (a three keystroke process) I would very often turn the deal into a refinance, wrapping the mortgage from another financial institution into it.  Even so loans were a nightmare to get through because underwriting is a bunch of idiots in remote locations (picture kitchen table with their slippers and pajama's on?) who can't figure out a P&L or SFP for anyone who isn't a straight W2 wage earner. You know, the folks spending the real $$ with skyrocket high FICO scores and strong equity positions. Ya those guys who after 10 days would be turned down for a simple 15K boat loan because the dealer didn't describe the onboard motor completely. How embarrassing when the same customer then shows you the  US Bank website advertises it can be closed in one day if done online instead of with a banker and also reminds you they could have put it on a credit card with 0% financing for 20 months. But hey, I could get them a mobile app with a very low transaction limit which defeated the whole purpose since they rarely do anything for under $100.  Technology? What another nightmare. On a bad day, the whole system would go down for hours so you couldn't use your computer. On a good day, you'd only have to spend an hour or so on hold with support, take your chances on if you got someone who could actually help.  Total time sync.  But the real problem is, you won't get paid nearly enough to even live in the same area where your COI is. Don't forget to pick up your dry-cleaning on the way home so you look like a banker when you come back into work tomorrow. No one should have to wear a suit who makes under 35K a year. For this I went to college!"

My current job role went from being great ... to very competitive in terms of having everyone fight for customers in order to meet your monthly sales goal. The company is very sales goals oriented and it can very exhausting. As of now, there used to be one person who every opportunity went to and that was great because it was great commission for that person but now with all the company changes, all those opportunities that went to that one person is now divided to every employee in that branch because we all have the same “job title”. This wouldn’t be a problem if we all didn’t still have to meet the same goal that “one person” had to meet. But the company has failed to give employees details on the changes and what to expect. Some people were just told a month before that their jobs will no longer exist. Some were demoted but most were promoted to a job that basically requieres you to SELL and if you don’t, then bye bye. I love this company but with all these changes.... not so much. Also, branches are sooooo short staffed that all you get are complaints from very rude customers because certain branches have closed near them and now have to go to a farther one.

2683,,I didn’t know bankers could be so creative and fun!,2019-09-01,5.0,Administrative Assistant,"My last year of employment was actually 2001 bu t, Glassdoor didn’t give me that option. This was my first “real job” out of college. Overall a great experience.

Great benefits
Managers recognize talent and promote from within
Culture of Teamwork
Collaborative environment
You could spend your whole career here and experience all the professional growth you need.","None really. Big companies aren’t for everyone, though. I enjoyed it."
2684,,Universal Banker 1 NMLS,2019-09-01,2.0,Universal Banker,"Excellent work experience at entry level, looks very good on a resume. Moderately good pay for an entry level position. Ability to transfer to other branches across the country is nice, if you can meet your numbers. 

Generous sick leave policy (especially for those who work a lot of overtime, like I did).

Get a good, understanding manager who knows what they’re doing and you’ll go much farther. 

NMLS licensure while you are with the company.","Having worked both, In-Store and traditional branches could not be more different. The absolute inconsistency across state lines, between LOBs, between managers, makes it extremely difficult to transition jobs within the company and makes banking there difficult unless you go to the same branch consistently. 

Upward movement is almost nonexistent unless you get extremely lucky. I was a top performing banker in my region and was with them for three years. When I left, my hourly wage was $15.38. Their minimum wage is $15.00.

Training was one week on a computer then a month of absolutely useless conference calls that caused stress to everyone in the branch, as it took you off the teller line. You will learn by seeing and doing in this job. 

Depending on the area, the customer base can be friendly to downright hostile.  I was eighteen years old when I started, and in my first week I was cursed out and led to tears. I quickly grew accustomed to this and thickened my skin in turn. 

The incentive plan is mediocre at best and bankers are constantly pitted against each other. As a top performing banker, the most I ever got in one quarter was some $550, on average it was ~$100/month. Some branches in particularly fraud-heavy, low population or low income areas are incredibly difficult to meet goals in. Do not expect to make as much in the middle of nowhere as in a major metropolitan area. 

Do not rely on managers. Your experience with the bank is 99% reliant on the quality of your manager. In three years, I had three managers. One of them was excellent, and the other two were so terrible that I was more or less running the branch myself (including pulling management reports, ordering supplies and other duties that were expected of a manager or assistant, not an 18 year old who had to learn banking from the ground up). 

If you work in an in-store, your days and time are gone. You may or may not get two days off in a row every week. The days can be up to twelve hours and every in-store I went to did not allow their employees, other than the manager, to even have chairs. Many branches are open Sundays and/or very late on Saturdays, and you will be the one working them, not your manager. On many occasions I have worked more than ten consecutive days, (on one occasion, I worked from open until close (9-7) for 14 consecutive days with no lunch breaks). Some states allow you to refuse lunch breaks, and that will be exploited. But the overtime pay was nice. And it’s hard to keep branches fully staffed because nobody wants to work there."

Senior management doesn't know their left from their right. They dont know there are people who work for them and not robots. 

Basic communication is non existent there. 

Management encourages a toxic work culture by playing heavy favorites and pits people against each other. 

Sick time policies were not employee friendly. If youre sick and dont have sick time dont plan on keeping your job much longer. 

On the flip side, people who cant do the job, are kept through a convulted hr process that had so many obstacles it was easier to just keep the employee.

Schedules flip every 90 days. 

They consistently score low the same things over and over again on the year end employee survey but they just plug their ears and keel on going.

Employees are given lots of vacation time if you are able to use it.,"The culture of the bank has shifted dramatically since Richard Davis stepped away from U.S. Bank. It went from a people centered company to a numbers centered company. It is very easy to tell that the current CEO and his managing committee do not care about the little guy. 

Community/retail banking has turned into an awful place to exist. Branches are expected to run short staffed with this ""hiring freeze"" that has been going on for 3 years now. Everyone is burnt out and stretched to their limits. Employees feel guilty to take vacation to unwind because it adds more stress onto their already stressed co-workers. 

The company does not roll out projects or systems in an organized fashion. They have taken an ""Agile"" approach to improvements but move things out too quickly. Systems are commonly half done and rendered useless because they were never stress tested and we are constantly promised tech that will make our lives easier, only to be told it is not in the budget this year."

Give them all the loan numbers, credit card numbers, and checking account numbers they requested and they come back to you with ""well that's good but you need to be better at your investment referrals"".  You are just a number to them. Your number is only as good as today's sales. I worked for the company for over 11 years. I got to be a experienced sales person and did well with my sales goals. But every time you start making money off of their ""incentive program"" they see that their employees are making money doing what is asked of them, so they change it drastically or take it away completely. 
I am a person who enjoys selling products and found that it's so draining when you are just never enough, no matter how many sales goals you meet and even exceed 
It's just so stressful that upper management, half of whom haven't worked in a branch in years, if ever, think that we are robots who can focus on 10 or 12 different sales goals at one time. Oh and achieve 150% of those goals too...cause 100% is just not good enough for upper management at this company."

2878,,OVERWORKED & UNDERPAID,2019-05-03,1.0,Loss Mitigation Specialist,Took my a few minutes but...Potlucks.  I really enjoyed those!,"Ever wished you were a character in a soap opera?  Do you like being stressed and depressed everyday?  Enjoy working around incompetent buffoons who take pleasure in gossiping and discussing the latest reality tv shows?  Or perhaps you’ve always dreamed of being on the Jerry Springer show!  Well great news..this is your dream job!  


 Now for the fun part!  Let’s get into some specifics for the Loss Mitigation department!


You will be expected to do your job AND everyone else's in unreasonable amount of time while receiving no additional compensation.  There used MONTHLY bonuses in the amount of $500-900 dollars IF you met all of your monthly goals (which was tough).  Not anymore.  Now you MIGHT get a whopping 1% of your salary as a YEARLY bonus if you meet the ridiculous list of goals management sets throughout the year.  Good luck!  


Members of the Loss Mit team will handle a PERSONAL portfolio of 100-200 loans AND assist daily in the following departments:


Liquidations - Because that team was laid off and we do not have a REO department. 


Bankruptcy -  Because no one in that department knows what they're doing. 


Collections - Because there's not enough staff to manage the high call volume so you will be thrown into their que a few times a month. Also, the collections team has to get people off the phone in under 1.5 minutes so be prepared for a high volume of transfers from that department.


Foreclosure - Because our foreclosure department is ""non-customer facing"". 


In addition, be prepared to manage your teammates portfolio if he/she is out of the office for the day.  Their work will be divided up amongst the team.  And don’t you dare miss a deadline on one of YOUR loans while you’re assisting everyone else because you will be reprimanded.

 

Last but not least, you have 2 minutes to document all of your calls and you MUST get a 95% or better on all QA call/case scores. Yes, you read that correctly... a 95% is the LOWEST score allowed.  Don't worry though, if you make a mistake on a call or case,  management will advise you to “bury it” and pray that QA doesn’t find it.  


In conclusion, apply somewhere else unless you are desperate and REALLY need the money.  It’s not worth it."

You know to the countless employees who were let go that spent working 60 hour weeks and decades working there. No big deal was the  message.  While I was working for my two month departure, had peers treat me like dirt ( I did absolutely nothing wrong in my role ..was promoted three times in six years) and had my new leadership act like I had the plague due to me being laid off.

2932,,Masquerading as a Company that Promotes Employees' Best Interest (this review is specifically for USBank CDC),2019-03-28,1.0,Financial Analyst (LIHTC),The only thing is work-life balance tbh. And even this varies based on the team you're on.,"1.  Cliquish - if you don't fit into cliques/are not ready to kowtow to certain people, you will remain in a lower level for ever. While working here I saw people come in and be promoted twice within less than a year while others who had been here longer, had more experience, and had greater productivity stayed in a lower position. This is the best place for you if you play corporate politics well, if not, you are better off working for a different company.

2. Meetings/Events - If you just want to get work done and get on with the rest of your life. THIS IS NOT THE PLACE FOR YOU. There are several meeting in a day and events that you have to participate in, most of which can just be an email. I dont think in my 7 years of experience of corporate work, any job has had as much unnecessary meeting. (People here just like to hear themselves talk). At a certain point it begins to hurt productivity.

3.  DEI - Where do I start. USBank CDC holds several events (meetings, talks, book clubs) all in the name of DEI. The point of DEI should be economic opportunity for all people in the company. However, instead of simply hiring a person of color/woman in the C-suite, they would prefer to continue to merely point it out and say they are ""working on it"". Ha! As a white person, it has been ridiculous seeing this go on and on.  Also the company is lauded as a great company for WOMEN, let me just clarify that it is a great company for WHITE WOMEN. This is important because it draws a lot of women of color into the company, who end up leaving because there is no line of promotion into management for them. Its ridiculous.  This doesn't directly affect me but I think its important."

2944,,"U.S. Bank: The SHAME, The HYPOCRISY - THE DISGRACE",2019-03-21,1.0,Technician,Any pros are blown away by this company's stunning and sweeping breach of ethics.,"I sent an e-mail to U.S. Bank CEO Andy Cecere in late '18, documenting a toxic culture within the company in which two managers brazenly committed wrongdoing against me, including defamation and retaliation, and three internal ""investigators"" reflexively advocated for them under the guise of a neutral review.   As a result, I implored Cecere to order an exhaustive external review.

Exactly two weeks later, I was fired from the company without reason - while ill, while on paid sick leave.  I was not allowed to retrieve my possessions and not all of them were returned.

Compounding these stunningly unethical actions, USB then refused to return my earned and unused vacation time, which amounted to almost $2200.  They claimed, falsely, that I was not in ""good standing.""  In truth, I was consistently an exemplary employee and they fired me in direct retaliation for exposing the wide-ranging wrongdoing.  The company's wildly conflicting  responses, and inaction, sturdily support my position:

-	Two working days following my abrupt termination, I requested in writing that operations manager Ryan Jewison provide a reason for my termination with specifics.  
-	USB failed to provide a written response to me within 10 working days, thus violating statute 181.933 which requires a “truthful"" and prompt reason for my termination.  
-	One day later, in a phone conversation that I recorded by legal right, Jewison claimed that I was terminated for a COMPLETELY different reason than that given by USB to the Minnesota Unemployment office.  Both reasons were absurd and hurtful – and the unemployment office properly ruled that I committed no misconduct and was eligible for benefits.  The company did not appeal.

U.S. Bank not only builds its brand on ""doing the right thing,"" it has sought over the past 5 years to use this empty mantra to distinguish itself from other scandal-ridden banks.

The truth and the reality could not be more different."
2945,,Disorganized and very political....,2019-03-21,1.0,User Experience Manager,They have recruited some very nice smart people.,Department is very micro-managed and political.
2946,,Okay company but lacking in so many areas,2019-03-21,2.0,Accounting Specialist,U.S. Bank doesn't lay off people in masses like other companies - it will cut in other areas first (e.g. benefits and retirement); plenty of departments in case you get bored in your current (and you will); company seems to care (at least somewhat) what employees think - it sends out a yearly survey to employees and has them collaborate with their manager to determine which areas need the most work; bank offers a pension and 401K match.,"Energy Park building is outdated and dingy; low pay; U.S. Bank is waaaay behind in technology; health benefits were not good -better than nothing but not by much, especially for as large a company as the bank is; the bank hires poor candidates and expects little from them; the bank drives away good talent; managers have their hands tied by H.R. and cannot fire slacker employees (of which there were plenty in my last department); low standards for new hires; plenty of departments within the bank but not many open positions at any given time; bank didn't offer much in the way of perks employees wanted - onsite child care centers and fitness centers or gym subsidies; there was no corporate lactation program and I had to complain constantly to get the ""mother's rooms"" cleaned regularly and updated (e.g. get the holes in the walls patched) - not a very ""parent-friendly"" company; telecommuting is basically only for the privileged (i.e. managers and salaried employees) - we hourlies had to trudge into work no matter how bad the weather was; raises were paltry at best (standard of living - 3%) - where's the incentive to be a ""go-getter""? The bank offered separate sick time and vacation instead of combined ""PTO"", and you had to earn your sick time - you would get something like one sick hour for every 30 hours worked - as a working parent I NEVER had enough sick time to use. Very little in the way of encouragement and incentives offered, at least in my department - we ALWAYS heard about it from management if we made errors but never heard anything good from them or received any kind of awards for outstanding work; my immediate manager and site manager were inept and had no control over the problem children; site manager chose to only work at our building three days a week and the other two days (Friday and Monday - how nice) at home - she also would never ""jump in the trenches"" and learn and understand what we actually did all day long, nor did she care to get to know any of us on a personal level - we all felt like numbers to her. I could go on and on but you get the gist - you may find a good department at the bank if you stay long enough, but it does take a long time to gain ""seniority"" when it comes to vacation and so on, and by that time you will likely be sick of your colleagues and your work. And one last note - if you are looking for a job in a department called ""ARP"", DON'T DO IT - you WILL regret it!"
2947,,Doesn't allow room for growth within the company,2019-03-21,3.0,Mortgage Processor,You're able to purchase an additional 1 week of vacation.,Upper Management won't allow their staff room to grow within the company.

Davis who was a respectable, humane person that created one of the best working environments I have ever had. Mr. Cecere, unfortunately, is a different story. A piece of me died when Davis stepped down.

I worked under the TOS umbrella doing software development for almost 7 years. I was in between jobs and had no intention of staying long term. I am ambitious and took on a lot of work that my co-workers would not, and I was reworded for it. I got promoted twice and wound up managing the department I was hired into. Unfortunately there are a lot of shakeups and reorgs at US Bank. I went through 5 bosses in my time there and most of them were good people that I enjoyed working for. My department was eventually dissolved but I felt like upper management worked hard to find me a new gig, and they did. They are slightly behind on technology but they are huge and take lots of time to turn things around. As an upper manager once told me, ""We are in the money business, not technology"". 

I eventually decided to leave because of an offer for more money but more importantly, better benefits. I still miss the fun environment, the Columbia Center and all of the people I made friends with while I was there.","Minnesota is the center of the universe. You just have to accept that if you are going to work here. The benefits are not good. Most employees have a spouse that works and you'll find that they are not on the Bank's heath insurance - for good reasons.

A surprising amount of my former coworkers have been laid off under Mr. Cecere's leadership."

2983,,Call Center Focused on Metrics,2019-02-27,1.0,Customer Service Representative,Good benefits for the salary,"By the second or third week of training, you'll be taking every type of call with very little training.  The scenarios in the classroom hardly apply to the actual phone calls you'll be handling.  The majority of the cardmembers calling in are elderly, upset and angry ready to yell at you, or hardly speak English.  There is no time to breathe between phone calls, and your success is measured by your extension out, after call, hold time, and survey take rate.  The ""coaches"" during training are giving incorrect information, which only leads to more mistakes.  Your break time is monitored down to the minute, it feels like the military."
2984,,Good company,2019-02-27,4.0,Banker,Company does a good job of developing employees who want to stay with the bank. Fair pay and good benefits. You get rewarded for the work you do,Technology is outdated. Upper management makes promises they can't keep

The employees chosen for positions were less than qualified with poor attitudes and it felt a lot like high school most days.  A lot of drama and you really can't trust anyone.  Have to be ""in"" with the right crowd or you will not advance in your career. Not so great benefits, terrible vacation time and people treated you like you have done something wrong when you wanted to use your sick/vacation time. Encouraged to work off the clock if I wanted to ""pay my dues"".  When dealing with anyone other than direct management it really just felt like I didn't matter at all. TERRIBLE technology, so very very behind it makes it extremely difficult to do your job efficiently.  Felt like a penny pinching company.  In the last 6 months I worked there, they were laying off entire departments and people that had given their lives to the company.  Being here just really showed me that at the end of the day, you, as an employee and a person were completely expendable to them.  No years of service, hard work and dedication could save you if they don't feel they made enough money to line their pockets with.  They loved to preach how much they cared about employees but at the end of the day, actions speak louder than words."

3016,,The Most Disrespectful Company I've Ever Worked For,2019-02-07,1.0,Collector,"The best part working here is the pay, with the shift differential it's roughly three times the federal minimum-wage, which is a lot since it doesn't require college. All of my coworkers and my supervisor are extremely nice. I was also adequately trained, so I knew what I was doing when I actually started.","Upper management has shown an astonishing amount of disdain for both their employees and their customers. As just one example, just 2 weeks before we get our annual bonus, they decide to lay off 6 people, forfeiting their bonuses. One of them had been with the bank for over 15 years. That’s some way to gracefully respect their commitment to the company. This wouldn't be so bad except for how they constantly preach about how much they care about their employees. Yeah right. They also “accidentally” involuntarily repossess cars that aren’t supposed to repossessed hundreds of times a year. 
There’s extreme micro-managing. If you spend just a few minutes not taking calls suddenly you’re bombarded by messages from supervisors, even if you have to go the bathroom. You’re not allowed to hang your coat in certain places within your own cubicle or on your chair. You used to be allowed to have plants and other things, now no longer.
Their benefits aren't exactly competitive either. You don't get the company match on the 401k until one year in, and even then it's only 4%. Then guess what? They don’t even match every paycheck like every other company, they only match once per year. So if you’re unlucky enough to get laid off, you’re not getting your annual match or your annual bonus. 
Their technology is also horrible. We operate on an ""auto-dialer"" so we collectors don't even control who we call. So guess what?  Too many times every single hour of every single day we call customers who already did their payment yesterday, or customers who already paid off their vehicle, or customers we already spoke with FIVE minutes ago. It's such a joke. That's some good customer service right there. 
Another huge gripe is the extreme lack of consistency. You can't go more than two weeks without something major changing. From the types of accounts that we call, from scheduling, from what to say to the customer, from how you can dial the phone, from the way to take a payment, from how you can even hang your coat, it just never ends with the changes.
Management even admitted it themselves that they don't bank with US Bank, and they actually graded themselves a D! At least they're not delusional. 
My coworkers in other departments aren't exactly nice. All too often they ""cold"" transfer a customer to you. Many a time it's the wrong customers, so now you have to waste time transferring them to the right area. 
And of course this is a customer service job, needless to say, many customers are simply mean. 
This is a TERRIBLE company, do everything you can to not work here. They obviously don't give a **** about their employees. 0 stars."

- Survey every week on random customers who come into branch and get scored individually on 6 or 7 questions on their experience and the sad thing is that if you get all 5's and one 4, then it becomes an automatic fail and you get a ""non-top box"" which is the most stupid thing ever.

- 90% of the job is showing up to work for the required hours

- Allowed to work from home","- Every position is a function, operating outside of your function is perceived as a threat.

- The management system is based on time & tenure.  Every meeting started with introductions with title and number of years at US Bank.   You don't speak to those above your ""title"" without permission or a direct request.  I was told many times not to question decisions from SVPs, regardless of how poorly those decisions were made.  We lost many deals due to the decisions of ""seasoned professionals"" - who understand the marketplace.

****Note to self:  When everyone repeatedly tells you how smart they are, and how many years they've worked in the same position, that's a really bad sign.   Smart people don't need to boast about their time and tenure, they should have the confidence and knowledge to lead, to make a business case.  If it's too complicated for you to explain, and you've got all this time and tenure, it's likely you don't understand and therefore cannot articulate a response.  

-US Bank prides itself on never losing money.  Risk adversity is so high, the bank will forego revenue opportunities -- yes, we lost many deals to other banks due to risk aversion.

-US Bank is in the dark ages with respect to technology.  There are initiatives to bring the bank up to speed, but there is considerable resistance from the old guard to accept technology.   There is a general ignorance of how technology can and should be applied, and a great deal of ignorance in technology decision making.

- I received training on US Bank's waterfall technology development ""best practices"".  Wait times to have anything developed are abysmally long.  The irony is the practice is called the ""Agile"" practice!  Why I state this isn't the agile methodology, the response was ""it's our way of moving quickly"".   In the 18 months I was at US Bank, I wrote more usable code than any of my IT support.  

- Decision making is top down, and so are approvals on all deals.  US Bank does not trust employees to make intelligent decisions.

- Very passive aggressive culture.  Watch your back.  I cannot tell how many times I received a call from my manager to make sure I was at my desk at 4:55 PM."

3176,,Recruiter,2018-11-01,1.0,Recruiter,"Remote opportunity, which can have its benefits.","Unpaid Over-Time: Working remotely involved a never-ending work day. I would get up before 6am and not log off until after 8pm. That was only because I had to take care of other responsibilities.  As a salary employee, I was not compensated for any of my OT hours. 

Disorganized: US Bank is on a whole new recruitment model. Everything is a disorganized mess. Their recruitment procedures and practices changed on a weekly basis. Scheduling of candidates was a disaster, the Recruiting Coordinator would double book me at times and also fill up my entire calendar, to where I would not have a lunch break. 

Culture: Management tried too hard in shoving a 'fun and collaborative' culture down our throats. We were actually belittled on weekly team chats, forced to work long hours to 'beat the other teams in interview numbers', and treated poorly overall by HR, Management, and anyone with any ranking above us.

Technical Issues: I read the reviews before I accepted an offer, and true enough tech issues are a constant thing. What makes it worse is they find ways to blame the employees (not management though, even when they are experiencing IT issues the same day). It was completely disruptive  to your workday and flow. 

False Representation: When I took this Recruiter role, I was told I would be an interviewer. What they don't tell you is that you have exactly 15 mins to go through a script (the same questions every time, a minimum of 12 interviews a day), record all answers, then 15 mins to attach to their ATS, email resume/screen notes/selling statement to hiring managers. It was a joke, and totally took away a true personal touch with candidates. Many candidates would have answers that exceeded the 15 min limit, and this would snowball to where you would literally become behind in your whole day. I had to work weekends because of this as well. 

Accountability:  None. Integrity is lacking from team leads and 'managers' to HR and above. They can all hide behind each other because it's such a huge corporation. In even the small things such as candidates lying about being interviewed (no record or proof), they will be believed over hard-working employees without question. You will be punished if you are not a favorite for things not even in a set process, favorites who are doing the same thing will not be questioned. 

Management: This will be the longest, yes it has a personal spin, but if you want the truth here it is for you. The team lead for our  West Coast recruiting team that became a 'manager', was a seemingly sheltered individual who had been nothing but a US Bank employee her whole career. She was newer to recruitment with less experience than myself, and even less experience managing people (it really showed). She would offer to assist with questions or trainings, but then as soon as you asked or brought items up she would dismiss you. She knew how to smile and fake it for team video chats, but unfortunately no authenticity in her 'leadership'. As I continue to thrive towards my next promotion, I can look back at her to see the type of manager I would never want to be. Her male superior and leading manager of our team, was not any better, constantly trying to support 'diversity' yet harassing female employees publicly, calling them children and insulting their intelligence. He knows how to post a lot of diversity and inclusion event photos on his LinkedIn though."

Management at Elavon was great if you need a cheerleader mentality....and we all need that sometimes.  If you have a real issue that needs solved? Forget about it. It will get escalated via your manager hitting forward on their email and then you have to stalk people throughout the company to get an answer.

Only those who support Vice Chair's (those reporting directly to the CEO) are Executive Assistants. Had I known this, I never would have taken a job there. They found my resume online and since I wasn't looking for a job, I negotiated a signing bonus because I would miss out on the bonus at my current job. Because of the signing bonus, I had to wait a year to look for another job or I would have to pay the signing bonus back. I left the job I had because I thought it would be good for my career; it was a huge step back. Their technology is backwards (at the time, they were still on Lotus Notes for email). The buildings downtown do not have wifi so you can't use your laptop unless you are hardwired. There's a lack of large meeting spaces so hosting larger meetings is highly difficult. They're located in many different buildings downtown Minneapolis and technology and capabilities are not the same across the board. Offices are also shabby, outdated and depressing. Because the bank is so large, the talent they hire can be lacking.  There was an employee in our group that came in the office once per month; she worked remotely the rest of the time. She got away with it because her manager was in another state and it was never monitored. This was allowed despite the fact that she had 3 direct reports in the office. They also encourage employees to volunteer your time. If you've been there under 6 months, you're supposed to have manager's approval to volunteer time away from work. In our department, it was totally abused. Manager permission was never requested. Plus, the same groups tended to ""volunteer"" all the time and never invited others. They would do their volunteer gig and then go to happy hour.  I stuck it out for almost 2 years and then got out as soon as I could."

Leadership is quick to point fingers and throw people under the  bus when things don't go as planned, hence little training and no support.

There is no documentation to help you  when you start, and if you ask too many questions you are seen as weak and it is counted as a check against you.  It takes a while to figure out who you can trust to help you and who won't.

Management wants only employees that are carbon copies of them and their work style.  If you have your own work style that is different from them, you will not survive."

The old way got the company out of multiple audit findings.  Employees are not valued as a whole.  The company would rather hire contractors than hire in it's own town.  They preach employee satisfaction and how much they care about the employees and the community but when it comes down to it, if it doesn't fit the pillars of their large city views, you can forget about it.

They also raised the minimum pay to $15 an hour which is awesome - however, they did nothing for those making above that already.  So years spent working to move up in the company ended up meaning nothing.

They are laying people off left and right in Owensboro and other communities, but spending millions on management expenses such as travel and very expensive and lavish meals when the managers are traveling to a different town."

3. Competitive starting salary 
4. Good PTO. I started with 3 weeks, plus the 10 bank holidays, 8 sick days & you can buy an extra week of vacation. 
5. Involvement opportunities","1. Benefits aren’t the best. They’re competitive for what is near by but for example, for the 401K match, they wait an entire year to put in the match so if you end up leaving mid-year you don’t get any match from the company. 
2. Office politics. They’re the worst I’ve ever seen 
3. Management is forgetful and it seems as if employees don’t matter 
4. Employees have to pay for parking which is very expensive downtown. You can participate in the metro which US Bank will reimburse partially. 
5. Bonuses and increases in salary are terrible. A standard increase is 1.5% each year with small bonuses ranging from $1,000-$3,000 before taxes when you’re at a lower grade level. Companies nearby offer higher percentages plus bonuses up to a percentage of your salary as well as recognizing great work and providing bonuses when it’s earned. 
6. It doesn’t matter how talented you are or how bad the company  wants to keep you. If there isn’t an open position, they won’t create one for you. You may have to transfer to do what you want."

When I began with US Bank the sales were rigid, but not pushy. As my time went with US Bank, upper management raised expectations unrealistically and we were forced to be pushy and actively sell to customers who may not benefit from our products. I was a top banker in my region and was rarely recognized. Benefits are okay, but commission is pretty terrible. Random customers are given phone surveys after transactions and the questions are ridiculous, and can definitely cause bankers and tellers alike to suffer. Hours can be wacky and are very unresponsive to work/life balance in some cases. PTO is absolutely tragic, given 2 weeks and a mandatory one week full week off. You will regularly be asked to work at other branches, which may be great sometimes but I worked at a few branches that were horrible. Some managers would not allow me to sell, which is how I make my money, and instead forced me to work at the teller line all day. The branch path is super linear and only really leads to branch management roles and sales coach roles. If you're looking to work in the back office, start somewhere else. Nearly no culture in a bank branch, HOWEVER I love the people I worked with and still consider myself friends with each of them ."

I started my position here 8 months ago and quit about a week ago. Before US Bank i was over at Wells Fargo for 2 years.  Since leaving wells fargo and looking  for other companies to interview with i was making sure I WAS the one interviewing them to make sure its a great fit for me! So i had multiple questions to make sure the branch i was coming into the work ect was the right fit and would be a predicament that would make me happy. I decided to give this company and branch a try even though they only had 20 hours and i was working well over 40 hours with Wells. I ended up taking the 20 hours because it was very close and convenient and i figured i could wait until something were to open.  Now, come to find out in the actual positon when i start  Which wasnt mentioned, id be answering account inquiries over the phone which to me is a security breach and their excuse is  they spoil their customers when they clearly have a 24 hour customer service line *this was not mentioned* also, cold calling clients to obtain credit cards ect which was also not mentioned to me. I also asked if id have time to close up organize things ect come to find im doing the lead tellers work so she can get her crap done and my transactions double that of everyone else. I honestly felt like a slave and robot working for the lowest possible hours and pay so this way they dont have to pay benefits ( i get it). Not to mention half the time its only like a couple people in the branch with no security or ANYTHING. When i started this position my manager my managers told me the tellers prior to me had left in a shorter period of time (which to me is a red flag).There is also no bandit barriers here and no security ect so dont expect to have privacy when having conversations with other customers, other associates ect. i was ALWAYS PERFECTLY IN BALANCE AND DID A GREAT JOB, this company is just ridiculous.

-We are always walking on eggshells around management. It's a very intense enviornment. MGMT doesnt want you to celebrate birthdays, holidays, or special events as a team  but are surprised when we barely know the names of our co-workers. 
-Certain new hires have been given career opportunities solely because they know one of the VP's - instead of people who have seniority, a related education background, and/or experience. Sometimes, we dont even get notified that there's a position available to apply.

In the In Stores you work  an 11 hour shift and they will expect you not to take a lunch or to work through it by sitting in the back and if a customer comes you must be interrupted never to return to that lunch. Impossible to take sick time with the branches being massively over staffed and I think it’s by design. 2 people to a branch is all they need so you can never call out. There is some problems between in store and traditional branches so if you ever want to leave and your a good employee they will not recommend you or try to “coach you out” The technology is lacking as they want you to be full service all in one banker with no support.

+You are able to purchase an additional week of vacation through the benefits package which made the work/life balance a little more manageable when I got married and moved.
+I know that this can vary from department to department but I lucked out and had an amazing manager and a very supportive team","+People making decisions about what needed to happen were not familiar with actual day to day procedures of the position

+You  get ""written up"" for being out sick for a full week: I had laryngitis in a phone based position there was no way that I would have been able to do my job without a voice but that still was considered a ""disciplinary"" issue

+I worked in a department that was a hybrid between customer service and collections. Towards the end of the time there was more of a push to focus on collections  which started to come at the cost of quality customer service which I struggled with because up to that point I felt like my department was focused on doing the right thing.

-It will be highly suggested that you move most client assets into fee-based accounts, whether it makes sense for them financially or not
-You will be held accountable for every customer complaint, no matter how crazy they are
-You will be questioned on every trade, guilty until proven innocent
-You will be responsible for timely money movements through fax, overnight, and web.  Branch didn't tell you about that client check that came in?  It's on YOU.  Insurance company didn't process that faxed distribution request and customer complains?  On YOU
-Your thoughts and ideas will be shut down by management because you'll be nothing but risk to them
-You will pay outlandish premiums and deductibles for Health Insurance that's pretty much catastrophic coverage only
-Your prescriptions will be through Express Scripts, worst company in America winner multiple times
-You'll be inundated with e-mails about training, compliance, meetings, activity, branch employees, and everything else unrelated to helping clients manage money.  E-mail is the gold standard at US Bank with employees because it's ""documented"".  Your client e-mails, however, are all monitored and you will be at fault if they word something unknowingly suspicious.

Most advisors from other banks may find these items as commonplace.  However, for those that are thinking about joining a bank for the ""introductions"", there's always a catch (above).
I'd think long and hard before you brought over an existing client base or book.  Most new hires, however, seem to be those without a book hoping to catch lightning in a bottle"

At the San Diego central district the bank openly allowed racial and religious discrimination at unbelievable levels. With solid and exceptional performance and dedication to work I personally experienced firsthand the most inhumane treatment of a middle eastern decent employee from the district management to HR. I was told in one instance in 2014 at an interview for branch management that I had English literacy issues which limited my abilities to perform.

Given the responsibility of tracking tens of thousands of dollars and the risk of getting robbed (this happened often), I probably should have made more than $10/hour. I was under the impression when I accepted the position that the benefits were paid for by the company--this is not the case. Working part-time, the health insurance deduction consumed my paycheck.

After some discussion with upper management, they accommodated my breast pumping schedule and provided me a private room to do so. The facility I worked in also had a cafeteria in the building which made lunch breaks convenient since you didn't have to leave the building.","Parking was a pain. Show up 15-20 minutes extra early to find a spot. They play favorites here. Management will tell you they cannot change your schedule NO MATTER WHAT, but will change it for some people if you produce enough sales. Its pretty much all about sales and pushing credit products on customers and less about customer service."
3868,,US Bank is more concerned with stockholders than employees,2017-09-28,3.0,Personal Banker,Most colleagues were team players.,Goals were often unobtainable for many bankers. Gallup score rating of all 5's  to succeed and obtain bonus was unreasonable. Benefits need help.

The benefits are decent, not the best but are okay.","As a teller, I had to stay on my feet all the time, even when I had 10 hour days. The aching feet just made me feel like I was working a fast food job or something, not in an office. 
At my particular office there was a manager who was pretty demeaning and intolerable, but was a kiss up to everyone superior to them. So when there were complaints about this person, the superiors couldn't see it and it wasn't taken seriously. 
Also, huge emphasis placed on sales. I get it, it is how the branch makes money. However, this pressure was put on at the most inopportune times. We would be completely short staffed with a line to the door for a large chunk of the day and then would be asked why we didn't sell any credit cards that day... it was kind of silly. 
Speaking of short staffed... the same amount of work is expected of a short staffed branch. That may just be what employers tend to do these days though. But yes, if your employees keep jumping ship then it is your responsibility to pick up their slack and senior management won't hire anyone new to replace them."

There was some top down sales pressure at times that seemed uncalled for and a few times managers suggested less than above board practices but I never had issues when telling my bosses I was not willing to cut those corners simply for sales.

3873,,Proud to work here,2017-09-26,4.0,Personal Banker,They are highly supportive throughout the training process and continue to invest in their employees throughout their career. There is lots of room to grow & progress within the company.,Pay could be a little more competitive but I feel like I'm fairly compensated for the work I do. The technology needs to be upgraded- the software is outdated and holds us back a bit.
3874,,Great if your dream job is a dead-end hole of mediocrity,2017-09-26,1.0,Reporting Analyst,Steady paycheck; will sometimes pay for you to get professional certifications if it relates to your job.,"They underpay compared to competitors & they are extremely tight-laced with amenities. At our office, some employees pool resources to go get Costco coffee for the breakroom because -nothing- is provided by the bank. I'm surprised they don't charge us for toilet paper.

They have annual internal surveys that are mandatory to take & they make a huge deal out of everyone taking them, yet every year they ignore all of the negative points & instead we get treated to a time-wasting conference call where they tell us to focus on 'communication.' To foster 'communication,' they do things like make bulletin boards where employees can post 'two truths and a lie' about themselves for other employees to guess, they have 'tie-dye shirt day,' and then sometimes they'll have team togetherness days where you do things like construct gingerbread houses to display around the office like it's an elementary school.

Management is highly ineffectual yet never laid off. They just get moved to manage a new team while their employees who did all their work for them get told how there isn't enough in the budget to give them a cost of living raise this year.  You get promoted based on how long you've been toiling away at your dead-end job & who you've made friends with, not on merit.

Healthcare is a complete joke, like all their other benefits.

Their technology is years behind. This week they literally proudly announced that they are implementing an initiative for customer account files to be 'paperless' so people don't have to run around trying to find files anymore! (Yes, there are emails daily from someone trying to find file #XXXX) They also took 15 minutes out of the latest quarterly meeting to explain to a few hundred people how MICROSOFT OUTLOOK works because apparently such new-fangled email technology is just too darned hard for everyone at the bank to figure out (they just rolled it out this year).

Speaking of rollouts: be prepared for your entire computer to stop working any time they decide to force an install of something new on your machine! And don't expect tech support to be of much use either."

Someone who has worked a full days 10am-7pm  with a brand new employee who can not assist with anything during the busiest time of the month. Someone who is reliable and dependable.

Health benefits are horrible, the worst I’ve ever had, and they get worse each year. The health plan pays $0 of anything until you hit your 1,500 or 3,000 deductible. So you have to save that or just not go. Dental is OK but not great. There’s quite a big division between “sales” and “everyone else”.

The company is pretty relaxed, overall. They try to provide as much (reasonable) flexibility with hours, attire, working from home, etc. But really, that's mostly up to your manager.","Lack of funding (which has been the excuse) makes it hard to keep your team engaged when you're paying out of pocket to give them any kind of compensation or reward for doing amazing work. 

Every team, individual, manager is becoming more and more micromanaged because the Mortgage department is trying to cut waste at all cost, so everything you and your team does is reviewed. It makes sense, however it is hard to breathe at times."

There's really nothing else that's positive about the company.","It's a jumble of departments stepping over each other in the retail banking world.  Investments, Operations, and Retail all working against each other.  The District Managers are a joke.  They expect the same results from branches in low income areas that they expect from high net worth exclusive communities.  Branches in areas that can only get payday loans are expected to crank out credit cards and loans.  Get real.  You can't cross over into another branch's territory, but there's no clear boundaries.  Constant conference calls to state your numbers, which only shames the low performing branches and makes them feel inferior.  Branch managers are only trained in sales, but if they don't have a customer service manager they become responsible for the operations of the branch.  Operations they were never trained on.  If you lose an employee, God help you because you won't get to hire another one.  You're expected to be at weekly and monthly meetings, but must have 2 people in the branch at all times.  Can't hire anyone even if you're down to 2 employees.  Employees never get 15 minute breaks, just a lunch IF they're lucky.  Be prepared to spend your entire paycheck on your health insurance and still have to pay the full doctor bill."

U.S. Bank doesn't trust people to behave like adults. U.S. Bank allows upper management and HR to bully their way out of problems. They are constantly asking employees to complete training on  harassment, safety and government compliance issues, yet all those rules don't apply to management.

Everyone you ask has a different answer on policy and procedure, US Bank pushes ""pride"" for lgbt down your throat...whether you support it or not. They are SO short staffed and won't send help.

I'm sure at the highest levels, they feel they are doing the right things to avoid the inevitable class action lawsuit, but those in the Regional Management positions are doing the same unethical things Wells Fargo did.  For example, in an effort to get out ahead of the new minimum wage requirement for salaried workers, US Bank made Assistant Branch managers hourly.  What those in the ivory towers making a quarter mil a year either fail to realize or care about is that those employees were working 50 hours a week.  Since they refuse to pay OT for those 10 hours, you either try to get done in 40 hours what takes 50, miss something and get fired, work off the clock and get fired or bring it to someone's attention and get fired.  Any way you slice it, you're getting fired.  So, just like Wells Fargo, people are choosing to work off the clock and others are pretending not to know.  When it's found out, they will all get fired, hire an attorney and it will be in the open."

Most managers in 24 hour banking are good, decent people, albeit just robotic head nodders who sacrificed they're ethics and soul to get to that position. Upper management are pitiful. This job will make you hate your life. Seriously stay far away.","In tech support the handle time goal is 330 seconds. Think about that for a second. Five and a half minutes per call on average for TECH SUPPORT. Your availability goal is 97%. You have to take calls 97% of the day to be at goal. The calls don't stop. You will never have time between a call. And you have to sell!  Imagine apologizing to customers all day long bc they got transferred 5 times prior to you, getting them off the phone on average 330 seconds, then selling them a credit card. Everyone in 24 hour banking or at a branch is inept. Company is technological still nibbling on the dinosaur bone. Upper management in Cincinnati come from non financial backgrounds and they are purely numbers people, work in the office behind closed doors, no clue what happens on the floor. They could care less about anything positive you do, it's the new plantation there and you will ever escape. You could be the best banker in the world, a customer service super hero, making the company mad revenue and it still doesn't matter. 24 hour banking is the bad kid of the bank, you can never escape detention and you can't graduate to the next department.

If you get the 12 referrals required, and hit the highest score for their customer service surveys as a branch, then you get $300 for the quarter.
However, if you only get 11 referrals, you get nothing. If you get 12 referrals but the branch does poorly for customer services surveys, you only get $75 for the quarter. 

They try to reward the branch with silly rewards rather than actually paying the employees a decent wage, such as Starbucks, or a ""jeans day"".

It's borderline harassment within legal limits of course. This is all done in the name of making delinquency on a majority of accounts that would have never gone delinquent. The computer system interface is 1980's looking, very archaic and out of date. I am surprised the public's money is safe. Oh well, I guess people always have FDIC to protect them..

Even when promoted, there isn't much of a raise. My bonus has shrunk the past 4 years, even though US bank has grown.

Coworkers were great to work with.","My ""Teller"" position was a sales/retail job in disguise.  As a new employee, sales quotas are pushed upon you as soon as you complete the on-line training, (about a week or two long), ready or not.  You must promote credit cards, new accounts, etc.  at every opportunity whether inside the bank, or at your personal social functions outside of work.  Most of the general public I dealt with didn't know or didn't want to know their bank account numbers or how to fill out a deposit or withdraw slip so they are not prepared when stepping up to the teller window for their requested transaction, so you must fill out the papers for them every time.  Beware because there are so many other aspects to this job than just deposits, cashing checks, and counting large amounts of money than people realize.  Also, I do believe in the concept of ""know your customer"", but the way my branch went about it was overkill.  The branch manager would jump out of her seat and engage in conversation with every customer whenever one would come in the door and I felt that it was too personal and too involved most of the time while the other tellers are trying to do that customer's transactions and sometimes needed assistance.  This job reminded me a lot of working for TSA with the micromanagement, constant on-line training (it never ends), many daily incoming US Bank e-mails that focused on any topic imaginable and you had to read them, the power and control that management has to fuel their egos, and, although I was part-time, I felt like this job required more and more of my time in order to attend necessary Webinars, meetings, and US Bank participating community volunteer activities.  It seemed more like a full-time job for part-time pay some weeks."

By the CEO's own admission there is a perception that this is achieved on the backs of its employees, who are expected to do more with less. Morale was low and employee turnover was high during my tenure there.  At some point, management stopped announcing employee departures in order not to focus attention on them.

When bank branches revenue is low branch managers will terminate you sighting low sales volume in order to improve revenue.

District managers damage moral by constantly reassuring you that your are replaceable and that there are hundreds of people looking to fill your position.

Terrible review given by manager: literally told me I was ""amazing"" and would be a ""future manager"" but then gave me a written review which said I was mediocre; and he said this was standard for employees.  When I asked about  my great sales (referrals) quota he had hardly anything to say and it wasn't in the review although it was a required sales goal which I not only met but exceeded!

Sales quota structure is barely adequate $$, often I found managers were forcing employees to comply instead of employees actively searching for and obtaining sales referrals.

Pay is low, on par with the retail industry like big box stores, in spite of working around thousands of dollars in cash, home mortgages, etc.

Benefits are as cheap as can be, and employees will have to contribute a lion's share to keep them.

You're the frontline for all the tomfoolery the company engages in, including customers inquiring about why they've incurred fees. In one such case the bank decided to discontinue a checking account type and so they changed the customers account type which resulted in fees. Of course the customer was informed by a tiny brochure sent to their home address in size 9 font.  I had to handle obviously misleading/predatory actions like this and placate irate customers.

Upon promptly leaving the company after a terrible (untrue) review I was informed that since I was not ""actively employed"" the company wouldn't pay me my sales bonus for work already done as state law only requires ""active employment"".  This is the kind of company you work for when you choose US Bank.

5307,,Pros and Cons of working for U.S. Bank,2016-01-12,3.0,Anonymous Employee,"There are various reasons that employees stay at U.S. Bank.  First, because layoffs and job eliminations seldom occur,  job security is good.  The bank is financially conservative, which means that the company is financially secure.  Because of the constant changes in fraud and security, and consistent competition with other banks to stand out, projects are consistently created and work is steady.  

Secondly, because it's a large company, there are a great number of job opportunities, and it's easy to transition from a position on one team to another team.

Thirdly, employees like the larger number of bank holidays that other companies do not observe.  In addition, they are currently still on the separate vacation and sick time policy, whereas most other companies now offer PTO.  Also, discretionary bonuses are awarded for average to outstanding job performance.

Lastly, most managers are flexible and allow telecommuting.","The bank is notoriously tight-fisted.  This means that salaries and merit increases are typically mediocre as compared to other companies.  Health benefits are very expensive and restrictive--employees pay a large amount of the cost in premiums, deductibles, and co-pays.  Only generic prescriptions are covered--others must be paid entirely by the employee.

The bank tends to be years behind in technology. The bank prefers to use collaboration and productivity tools which are not mainstream.  However, the company will be transitioning in the near future to mainstream collaboration tools.

For large projects or new applications developement, a team of contractors is often hired to complete the work.  Unfortunately, this often leads to poorly designed or difficult-to-maintain applications."

Compensation is below market, and the name of the game is do more with less (although as they reduce staffing, technology doesn't keep up to automate or empower the customer to pick up for what is sacrificed. And, the company, especially in Los Angeles, has some charismatic and dynamic leaders, who are great at earning employee loyalty. Because much or the organization is made from people who value being ""comfortable"" and less pressured in their work, but also take less compensation for it, there is tremendous opportunity for the ambitious and responsible person to grow quickly in the organization. The company is  very supportive of career development conversations.","As alluded to above, the company has a deeply ingrained DNA that doesn't trust their business lines to meet revenue targets with sales. Those who have been around for years know the joke that the ""year end hiring freeze"" is coming, which happens regularly to ensure shareholder dividends are met. Although there is a strong value on people development,  there is a very real awareness of the ""Corporate crunch,"" where team sizes are reduced, and technology is not invested in up front to shoulder the lost work. This results in it being difficult for many to take vacation/ enjoy free time, because there aren't enough bodies to go around. Also, pay is significantly below peers like Chase and Citi, and small regional banks."

The mid-level managers DO care about their team members.The more senior management levels mostly see staff as a set of widgets. There are too many examples of higher level managers bringing in their team from their previous employer and not bothering to get to know the existing team's capabilities first.

Senior management often surprises me with the implementation of employee-friendly and forward-thinking policies. 
They seek feedback from personnel with a periodic company-wide survey. 
They encourage community involvement by paying you to volunteer for one or two days. 
They changed their company mission statement from ""let's make money for our shareholders"" to ""let's empower potential and put people first"" (I am paraphrasing.) 
They encourage a friendly work environment by strongly supporting an e-card appreciation program. 
They reward good work by giving tiny bonuses for successful individual or team efforts. (There are yearly bonuses and profit sharing too.)
They extend many of the same banking perks that millionaires receive to their employees. 
They have a yearly event in (the bitter cold of) January that celebrates employees.

In our current political environment where demagogues frequently demonize the banking industry, U.S. Bank walks away fairly unscathed. 
As a super-sized community bank, senior management has steered away from taking advantage of the repeal of the Glass-Steagall Act to invest (some would say gamble) bank deposits through an investment banking arm. 
When the subprime and mortgage-backed security crisis laid low the titans of banking, U.S. Bank hardly came under pressure because they maintained a sensible balance sheet. 
As a rule, senior management avoids morale-busting layoffs (I should mention that furlough is not widely loved, but most accept it to be the lesser of the two evils).

As a software developer, I like a lot of what my job has to offer. I like working with my teammates and solving interesting problems. U.S. Bank - specifically the technology department - is becoming more friendly to telecommuting. Quite a few of my colleagues work one or more days from home. Some work exclusively from home.

I feel that U.S. Bank has treated me very well and that I have a promising career path ahead of me at this organization.","Like many other large organizations, the U.S. Bank technology department (i.e., Technology and Operations Services) attempts to tame sprawl by creating more hierarchy.  As such, I believe the salient driver of U.S. Bank's problems is that it is a simultaneously hierarchical and sprawling organization. I will focus on how this affects internal communication.

Communication is difficult because the organization is very hierarchical. Your manager's manager's manager is going to have three more managers above her in the org chart.  So, when policies and agendas are communicated from the top-down, they may not make it to those at the bottom of the employee pyramid.

Communication is doubly difficult because the organization sprawls more than LA's suburbs. Technology teams are organized around supporting a certain area of the organization. One team may support consumer banking (think mobile banking application.) Another team may support internal processes (think HR application). This scales poorly because the bank has hundreds of specialized teams that support its many business lines.

One aspect of communication - sharing knowledge - is valued at U.S. Bank. But it rarely happens across team boundaries for a few reasons. 

First, although teams are often great at taking ownership of their applications and processes, they rarely step outside of their comfort zone to collaborate. 

Did you just lose a team member and are falling behind on a project? Good luck finding someone that is willing to step in and lend a hand -  they are busy working on their own agenda and putting out their own fires. This seems to be a cultural issue; I think it is slowly shifting for the better, but it is still prevalent.

Second, there are just as many ways to contact a team as their are teams.

Need help finding a spot on a web farm? Go to *this* Sharepoint site. 
Need help setting up authentication? Go to *this* intranet site. 
Need help creating a database? Fill out *this* Word doc and email it to *this* shared mailbox. 

Requesting help from these myriad teams is frustrating in part because you cannot move forward without their help (or sign off). You must dance to their tune (submit documentation with their proprietary methods) and move at their pace (which could be very fast or very slow). Communication methods are so disjointed that some of our company's most precious resources (people) are fully dedicated to the sole purpose of coordinating these disparate groups. 

Third, documentation is atrocious. U.S. Bank requires the creation of lots of unhelpful documentation. Due to the volume of the documentation, it is difficult to find the information for which you are searching. And, if you are lucky enough to find the right document, it may be too generic and verbose because auditors are the target audience (though, we have plenty of auditors at the bank, so maybe the documentation helps some employees.) Many of the project managers, business analysts and programmers will quickly dismiss U.S. Bank's idea of ""documentation"" as busy-work.

Resources are often tight and ebb and flow with market conditions. So, when head count is restricted (as it often was between 2007 and 2015), there is too much work for too little people. This exacerbates the communication issue because people are too busy working on their own projects to lend a hand to other teams.

On the bright side, I think that senior management is aware that these issues with communication exist. Cultural change is very difficult. It *is* happening in TOS, albeit slowly."

They offer bonuses and commission based on sales.","The buildings lack renovation, the income is lower compared to local credit unions in the area, they do not allow overtime, to grow with the bank you usually have to move out of the are you live in where there are opportunities.

Commission is difficult to get (based on point structure). Example: 6500 points a month... checking account = 100 points. After you meet the goal, then you get commission. Not a lot of bankers can meet this because customers are poor (or smart not to go through bank). The training program is overwhelming during the first month. They make you read a ton of rules and regulations on the computer and print-outs. Then you go through 90 days of more training. This is more computer training, mostly you read words on the white screen. Occassionally there are color diagrams and videos. There are calls during the training, but that is just to answer questions and practice ""talking"" to other bankers as if you're a customer. There is NO physical class you attend, there are no paper quizzes. Most of the computer web-based trainings have quizzes where you click the answer and you can keep trying over and over again until you get it right. The management expects you to remember everything and then go straight to the customers and apply what you know. You are held liable for everything that you do. Homework is daily, training is repetitive, and there is too much to remember. Managers typically are too busy to help you when you have a question or need assistance ""on the spot."""

Your experience in the Chicago location will depend solely on who is your direct manager, some take the time to provide guidance and support, others look at you as a completely replaceable part of the machine. Low morale, low pay compared to industry norms. High turnover rate. Lack of retention of quality employees. Division sets unreasonable goals which impact end of year bonus (not in a good way). Don't expect opportunity for growth within structured finance as it is very top heavy, if management is content, then very little thought is given to analyst level employees. The culture in the Chicago location has been toxic for the last 2 years but is slowly starting to change, Only transferable skills gained are technical, all other aspects of structered finance are niche and do not carry over to broader financial industry.

AND benefits are terrible - health insurance is awful, very expensive premiums to employees, plus $3,500 deductible mean you basically only have catastrophic coverage.

There is a lack of promotions and growth. They will do whatever they can to not give you an annual raise, or they will give you a 1% raise if you do a great. But they will always find an excuse as to why your annual review was great but yet you only got a 1% annual raise. SELF-FUNDED holiday party and events.

Training courses are blanketed across all employees regardless of relevance to their particular role and must be completed by certain dates even if you are busy meeting deadlines for client deliverables. You can ask for training in specific areas that are key to your ability to do your job, and receive none. Yet, for example, be forced to take online courses that are intended for bank branch tellers when you work in human resources or fund administration. The recruitment process fails to identify resources with the right skill sets for open positions. This results in many hires being abruptly let go, leaving an unmanageable workload on the backs of remaining employees.

They believe that employees are their #1 asset, and stick with them even when times get tough.","They are conservative in what they invest in and how they go about their business.  Don't expect the fanciest offices or the newest equipment, or the highest salary.  But because of that approach they did not layoff thousands when the financial collaspe hit in 2008.

There is a lot of turnover in the mortgage department due to the constant backstabbing and lack of training or development of employees. It's understandable as the managers within the department are more concerned with themselves than developing employees and helping foster their development.

The company really looks out for it's people. The company CEO is very personable and really cares for everyone that works there.","US Bank does not seem to push real hard on making sure supervisors are doing their job properly. The supervisor I had when I was let go did not really know how to be a good, solid supervisor."
6007,,Do not work here,2015-04-06,1.0,,There are no pros for this employer,"Poor Management, inconsistent practices, HR is worthless"
6008,,Great company,2015-04-06,5.0,Bank Teller,they take care of you paid holidays and time off and sick days full benefits and match your 401k by 4% very postive vibes.,room for growth but at a very slow pace
6009,,It's been average at best.,2015-04-05,3.0,Small Business Manager,Decent work life balance overall.,There are lots of things this company does not do well.
6010,,Company is very customer service focus and puts clients needs first. I have had a pleasant experience working so far,2015-04-05,4.0,Universal Banker,"Employees don't have to meet unrealistic retail sales goals like similar banks
You are compensated very well for selling credit products
They focus on quality rather than quantity of new business","Systems are older compared to other similar banks
Less contact with higher management"
6011,,Poor management,2015-04-03,1.0,Universal Banker II,Great loan and account products for the customers.  Large effort towards customer retention.  Good benefits and 401k.  Vacation and sick time consistent with other banks.,"Management was passive and not supportive of operations.  I did not trust the branch manager.  Too focused on sales to pay attention to staff support and training.   Universal Banker position is unrealistic.  Difficult to please both the sales and teller roles and responsibilities.  Tense atmosphere and many employees felt they had to ""watch their backs."""
6012,,Cash for sale,2015-04-03,1.0,Personal Banker,"You learn about banking, such as mortgages, car loans, unsecured loans, and lines of credit.","You eventually learn that banking is merely selling cash for a percentage more than the money received. That's sometimes needed for houses, cars, and some credit. The problem is pushing credit cards and lines of credit on people who have no need for it at the time. You try to tell them that it's a good deal by explaining that there are points, cash back, or no interest for a year. Then you explain to them that as long as they pay their entire balance by their next due date, they won't have to pay any interest. You also tell them it helps your credit. Underneath it all, however, the bank wants you to sell these intangible ""products"" so that the person falls behind in paying his balance and pays the bank for the money he bought. A customer cannot pay off his car loan in a certain amount of months per the contract because if he did the bank would get no money. That way US Bank gets money for selling money. As they gather money from interest, credit fees, and banking fees, US Bank barely pays its bankers. They give you a low salary and do not allow you to make money until your 90 days of training are over. From that point forward you'll have to build your points for commission, but it takes a while to get them consistently coming through month after month where you don't have to start over each time. However, if your manager doesn't like you and gives you an evaluation that scores as ""needs improvement"" then they will withhold all the commission you made for three months and will never give it to you. The evaluation is very subjective. My supervisor and I had a major personality conflict. She was in her mid 20s and the only way she knew how to manage people was to yell at and patronize them. I was in my mid thirties, and I was at fault because I could not stand having a girl tell me what to do. So I was frank with her and I told her what I thought about her. Thus the bad review that took away my commission. But in the end, I'm glad I'm out. I'm not reaching for people's pockets anymore so that US Bank and I can have that money in ours. I'm not selling intangible ""products"". I'm providing a real service to the clients I work for in my current job."
6013,,Great company to work for,2015-04-02,4.0,,Advancement opportunity is great within the company. There is tons of room to move up which is always great.,"Not alot of leadership training provided, most supervisors and up have no solid training on how to function as a leader"

Leadership is something the bank values and we all work together to help one another to grow and become successful.  There are some benefits that are great like time and pay allotment for maternity leave and reimbursement for education goals.  Love the flexibility from my boss - This is a plus for me :),"It can be challenging at times to receive recognition for the work you do.  Raises are given upon the performance of the bank.  Bonuses are good but could be better.  There is not much opportunity for advancement due to the competition, for example, some departments already have an idea of who they may want to hire so you are competing to top the person they are considering."
6017,,My experience with U.S. Bank has been extremely rewarding both personally and professionally.,2015-03-31,5.0,Recruiter,"Personal and professional growth, career advancement, great work life balance, great benefits, competitive salary, managers care to see employees succeed and develop, and ethical company",Vacation does not begin to accrue until after 90 days but benefits kick in quickly.

6021,,Wasn't the right fit for me,2015-03-29,2.0,,Customers were the focus of the company. It was more about the duration of the relationship with the customer less about how much the customer has in their account.,The branch I was in was very emotionally driven. The management was too involved in employee personal lives and looked at everything as a social thing rather than a business environment.

High pressure sales job.,2015-03-26,3.0,Personal Banker,The corporation as a whole takes the time to train you in sales techniques and how to grow your customer base. They provide decent tools at your disposal for you to learn the ropes.,"In my personal experience and opinion, you are at a huge disadvantage if you work at a branch located in a low income area when you're sales are compared to branches in higher income areas. The branch managers do provide some leeway as they are aware of the neighborhood but higher level managers do not seem to care. This makes it difficult to move up if your sales are not up to par with those higher income areas where it is much easier for one to sell credit products."

Wonderful senior management at district and regional levels who keep close contact with branches to ensure a minimal disconnect. 
Wonderful branch management teams who assist employees in reaching their goals and receive promotions.","As with all banking, I do wish that tellers could have chairs or at least a stool to use during downtime.  In this day and age, it seems fairly ridiculous that we are made to stand 8 hours a day.  As young people, it is not so bad but for other branches that may employ older employees or people in poorer health, it is a big issue."

They place significant importance on home and work life balance, encouraging healthy habits and being a part of the community around you. I have always been encouraged to volunteer in the community, we constantly have fundraisers for different charitable organizations and it is an overall positive environment. Salary is competitive and there are so many opportunities for advancement in the path you are on or exploring new advancement opportunities in other areas of the company.","Any kind of customer service work can be difficult at times, however that is not necessarily the company that is at fault. As a teller overtime was discouraged so it could be stressful at times to make sure you stay at exactly 40 hours for the week. In other positions though overtime is encouraged as a normal part of the job. Learning is essential to the company which is a positive thing, every year you are required to take refresher courses in your areas of expertise, however there were never really set times to do this work so you would have to find a way to fit it in with all of your other responsibilities but still manage to get all your work done and meet the deadline.

- Severely understaffed.
- Profoundly Corporate.
- Don't feel like you can take required breaks because you'll either be letting your fellow tellers down by forcing them to work harder than they should (especially for the pay). 
- Management isn't especially helpful, expect you to know more than you're trained.
- Don't even start accruing benefits until 6 months worked.

That's great got strengthening the company but very unfair to employees who have bills and budgets of our own.

Upper management doesn't have one set of ways of doing things, everyone tells you something different and upper management acts like they OWN you.  
They're too cheap to property staff the branches, on my birthday I had to work the entire teller line by myself for most of the day (and I wasn't even a teller, I was a supervisor).  I work well under pressure but they took advantage of my kindness and I was left with anxiety and started losing my hair.   The happiest day of my life was when I stopped working there.

The bank will match your 401K contribution up to 3% and they also provide a pension, and medical/dental benefits. Employee perks also include discounts on everything from Costco memberships to 20% discounts on your monthly cell phone and cable bills. Tuition reimbursement. Very friendly work environment. Room for advancement if you're a go-getter and want more responsibility.","This is a very conservative bank! Everything from the ATM machines the customers use, to the computer and applications you use at work is going to be outdated. In 2014 we finally updated from Microsoft Office 2003.

Expect for the new comers who come in off the street to get paid a lot more than the ones who had worked there for years. Pretty sad when a new teller comes in off the street and they are getting paid the same amount as being a Supervisor or Assistant Manager.  They say their for the customers and employees. LIERS!!!!

11 weeks of ""training""... You're basically useless for the first 11 weeks when you are inside of the store branch because you're on a computer all day long. You don't get a cashbox for at least three weeks and customers will wonder why the new person can't help.

Received incentives every year. But each time I applied to supervisory or management jobs, I get looked over by recruiting and management because the manager already has a favorite picked out to put in the position. I got tired of butting my head against a brick wall so I left the company. 

The new manager over the division I worked in was an arrogant power-crazed individual and no one has anything nice to say about him. It is always about numbers for these people. They do not care about employees or their goals and plans. The HR department is laughable. They just want to know who you are so they can have management fire you if you buck the system too much and speak up for yourself. 

More than likely, there will be that concerned response at the end of this review asking me to contact HR to discuss my concerns. Save your breath. You didn't care when I worked there so what makes you think I would believe you care now? Pathetic!"

If your branch manager doesn't like you, your progression is haulted. The branch manager decides if you can transfer to another location or not. This company is hung up on phrases like ""Welcome to U.S. Bank."" I think a positive attitude speaks louder.

I worked part time and wanted to go full time. There were plenty of teller positions open, so I asked if I could help out at another branch and I was told that I couldn't because I was doing what was required. I was not exceeding my referral requirement. 

My teller coordinator's drawer did not balance, so our branch manager said we better remember something-as in a transaction we forgot to enter. She insinuated that we come up with a solution. We did, based on her advice. Then we were both written up for force balancing because the error was found later. The branch manager had the nerve to tell me she saved us from being fired. She should have just followed procedure. Yes, this would have required closing the branch and counting all the funds, but it would have been the right thing to do. 

Two of my fellow tellers worked evening hours because they attended school during the day. I worked until 1 p.m. When my branch manager wanted everyone present for a meeting, she expected me to drive back for a 6 p.m. meeting. This was a 45 minute drive for me. This made me hesitant to discuss any faction of my personal life because I though it would b used against me."

There are a LOT of incompetent terrible managers there and nothing is done about them. Managers in my department bullied employees constantly. Their favoritism to a couple of select employees was so blatant it would have been funny if it wasn't at the expense of other employees. Managers actually said inappropriate or offensive things about race and gender directly to employees. Most of my department complained to HR and the ethics line multiple times. Nothing changed. Exempt employees forced to work consecutive weekends but then docked a day's pay a few weeks later if they were sick for one day and had no sick days left. Or you'd be forced to use vacation time if you were a couple hours of late into the office due to a family emergency. This despite the fact that you've worked the previous several weekends. Hourly employees being a couple minutes late made to come in on the weekend and work a full hour to make the time up. They weren't allowed to come early or stay late. Being told you can't attend a continuing education event even if you're on the board of the professional organization that is sponsoring it unless you use a vacation day.

I know that no department is perfect but this was excessive. I wouldn't have believed that the things I saw and experienced actually happen in a reputable company until they actually happened right in front of me.

The employee surveys were awful so the bank suspended them to have a year focused on strengthening management. We saw no change. On the most recent all-employee survey the managers in my department again got abysmally low ratings.

If you are interviewing here, ask detailed questions about department turnover. Ask if they do all-employee surveys and how the employees have rated the managers and the department. Find former employees of the department you're interviewing for on linked in and see if you can ask them questions - the worst that will happen is they'll say no. In my career I've worked for other banks as big as or bigger than US Bank and my department in US Bank by far had the worst environment and culture. Which is a shame because i think the CEO means well, but such bad managers being allowed to be so abusive that they ruin whole departments is a big spot on the reputation of the company."

The work/life balance is also TERRIBLE.

6196,,Bad InStore Work environment,2014-12-15,2.0,,Good to get your foot in the door with banking.  This is a good environment if your in Senior management or if you're single with no kids.,"The growth opportunities are minimal to non existant if you're looking to grow to anything but a branch manager.  Leadership talks a lot about running your position and branch as if it were your own business, but also tell you that it has to be done their way with no exceptions.  Regardless of what you've done for the company in the past, it's always 'what are you doing for me now'  Work/Life balance is preached by senior leadership ALL of the time, HOWEVER, if you're a salaried BM, you are required to work a MINIMUM 50 hours per week.  Your job description says you should spend something like 20% of your time doing teller/banker activities and 80% being a manager, but the staffing model requires you to work more towards 60 hours per week, most of which are doing teller transactions, if you are short even one employee.  The company also says they want to develope you and grow your career, but they don't want you to look at anything outside of the branch.  You're told by direct Sr. management that they're working with the department you want to go to in order to develope a learning/training plan so they can promote within (which is never done for some reason) then you find out over a year later that the proper people were never even reached out to.  The trips are nice if you win, the cash bonus' have gotten worse every year until you work your butt off for a measly $1,000 per quarter (not worth missing time with your family) and despite preaching 'we're changing for our employees' it never, NEVER happens.  All of this is in regards to Sr. Management at a district and region level.  Richard Davis is a great CEO.  Summary: you put years of your career into something that will never pay you back due to the lies and culture you work in."

Customer Service Management acted on their emotions and treated staff poorly with no consequences to their actions. Spoke ill about employees to other employees including myself. Did not stay in compliance of our procedures and attempted to cover up their wrong actions.

6245,,Old bank company trying to play in a bigger pond,2014-11-09,3.0,Teller I,"Most branches close at 1pm on Saturday and are closed on Sunday unless you work at a grocery store branch, lame...and don't!  
Pay is OK and potential for credit card sales referral bonuses are nice if you branch has traffic and customers with decent credit to get approved.  Otherwise, most will get declined and won't want to do Secured CC.
My branch manager was really cool.  Let us work and do our thing without ever interjecting unless necessary.
Value volunteering and get paid for it too!","US Bank talks about growth but it isn't really available because of favoritism and lack of opportunities.  Due to the size of the bank and how US Bank grows which is to acquire other banks then change them into US Bank branches, you don't get new positions opening until someone is fired, quits or is promoted (which doesn't happen often).  When a spot opens, the upper management usually already have their pick for the job.  

When I was a teller with a BA and certificate in Business/Accounting, they made a big stink about a TC (Teller Manager) opening and that I had to interview several times for a job I was already doing for several months because our TC was promoted so there wasn't anyone doing her job except ME!  On top of doing her job, I was the sole vault (primary and backup) plus I was the ATM custodian while training new Tellers.

To make matters worse, they were paying the new Tellers what I was getting paid even though I got a ""raise"" and had all this responsibility.

Also, they take their surveys too seriously.  They want 5 out of 5 stars but I would get a 4 out of 5 on the hardest category which was a subjective category named something like ""was I made to feel special"".  If you got a 4, then the whole survey was a fail.  I used to have 100 percent on all other categories and was told that my special score was ""low"" because I was too efficient.  What?  Yup, I was told my management to slow down because I was too good at processing transactions and need to talk and joke with customers more.

The Bankers work WAYYYY too hard because each branch only has one or two of them so they are always busy with their business so when you refer a potential customer to them, the customer has to wait sometimes up to 30 minutes.  Who wants to wait 30 minutes to open an account?  

Plus US Bank technology is OLD.  Their ATMs were recently upgraded to accept checks, their teller windows don't have card readers to open customer profiles...we have to manually type in their information to search for it.  

Also, branches are OLD OLD OLD.  Go into any branch and they suck.  US Bank has NO unifying identity like Chase does.  Go into a newer Chase branch and they all look nice, high tech and professional.

Seriously, work for Chase, Wells or BofA if you want to make money by working hard."

Culture is wonderful and easy going. Layoffs are rare, if at all.","Leadership is decent, but the conservative nature of your business strategy and pay compensation does not allow for top employees to be promoted at the rate or amount they are worth. Real life example, I was offered for a promotion that was 2 pay grades in jump and HR made it a huge deal that the increase in pay exceeded (barely) by 10%. Ultimately turned it down as the extra commute and cost factors did not warrant the pay increase. In addition, waiting to add enough ""years"" to ones belt regardless of other compensating factors (ie high performance level, above and beyond work ethic, high education, etc) is not a vital long term strategy for internal promotions. In addition, pay increase are merely ""cost or living"" adjustments and are considered mirages in monetary growth."

That was the one and only enjoyable aspect of my position.,"EVERYTHING ELSE! I know that in every branch, you will find different leadership types and some awesome/not-so-awesome managers. Well, I was really cheated, I think.

When I began, it was like I had the red carpet rolled out. I walked into my branch and had big gift bags on my desk, notes all over, a big welcome poster over my computer screen. Sadly, this warm welcome faded fast. The first issue, and I know others who have been a banker or a manager will agree, is that the new training program they rolled out is awful. You no longer go to a designated location for a set period of time (1-3 months, or whatever). I was in the first group to experience the new process where you are fully in your branch for training, which is all self-guided except for weekly call-ins with you class. Basically this means that I was sitting at my regular desk, on my computer, looking like I'm doing nothing. When you're coming to a branch that's already short staffed, it's awkward and hard on everyone for you to be just sitting there unable to help out. 

The other big issue that eventually caused total chaos in my branch and resentment from all my coworkers was the fact that I have the ability to run a cash drawer, too, when times get really busy. Because I had come from being a teller with Wells Fargo, I was expected to jump in from the beginning and get in cash even if I was in training courses. It became such a big problem for me to get through my training because I was constantly being yelled at (literally, tellers and manager/CSM, would yell at me across the branch to hurry up and end my training to get in cash... embarrassing). 

I had done so well in every aspect of my job. My customer service was great, I had a huge loan pipeline, etc. When my 90 day review rolled around, it was about 5 seconds of how well I had done, and 30 minutes of how much of a burden I am to the branch because of my training and that I need to skip the training because backup teller duties come first. My trainer had to call my manager several times because I vented to her all the time about why I was so far behind in my work. 

Finally, one Friday my district manager came into our branch. Of course everyone was on edge and being extra cautious to make sure we did everything perfectly during her visit. I was shocked when she and my manager called me into the conference room. 

When I walked in, they threw confetti on me to congratulate me for a huge customer service goal I had achieved. As soon as the confetti hit the floor, they said ""Ok, now let's get down to business."" They then spent over an hour going back and forth about the same BS I had heard in so many other ""meetings"" with the manager about how my training has been a burden on everyone, how my CSM was mad when she forced me to take a live training conference call up on the teller line in front of customers because we were short staffed and I turned up the call volume to be able to hear questions my instructor was asking me, and that other employees felt I was an unproductive team member. UM, LOOK AT YOUR BRANCH NUMBERS!! Oh, and because I told my CSM that I didn't know businesses received customer service calls, that apparently meant to them I was justifying why it was ok to give business bad service?!?! What the heck. At that point, I was like you've got to be kidding me. They passed me a formal warning over the table with these ""incidents"" and hadn't even asked me before to clarify or defend myself. 

My children also had severe illnesses that caused frequent seizures. Coworkers would tell me I was just faking their sicknesses to get time off, and management didn't care. I was really hurt by that.

Needless to say, I had a lot to think about over that weekend. I came back and gave my notice on Monday. 

I can honestly say that I have NEVER looked back. I had an awful, deceptive branch manager who'd be nice to your face and write you up for rumors behind your back. We got a new district manager who played the same game. 

Pretty sad, US Bank lost a great employee over two awful managers and a horrible training program. After 3 months of hearing what a burden I was, I was so burnt out. I knew I'd be able to find a better, less nit picky employer who would actually treat employees fairly."

No communication between senior management and line people. Employees are expected to be seen and not heard. Opinions and different points of view are not sought out or appreciated.

no hope of a full-time position as a teller (they are basically making it impossible for this to be your career anymore - it's full time enough to get you benefits and to take up all your time so you can't really work a second job without wearing yourself out, but not full time enough to really support you)

as always in pretty much any big company, not a lot of perspective from the highest high-ups about what is really best for the little guys down the line"
6311,,"Very Stable, Good Midwestern Culture",2014-10-06,4.0,Product Analyst,Work/Life balance is good. You never have to worry about the future of the company or the risk of losing your job. People are for the most part friendly and easy to work with - it's not cut throat. There are opportunities to move around to different groups if you're proactive in looking for them.,Many people have worked at the company for lots of years and sometimes aren't open to new ways of doing things. The conservative nature of the budget makes it hard to get new projects going even if they'd make the company better off in the long run. Bureaucracy can make things take forever!

There is no set policies throughout the company. Everything is left up to 'branch manager discretion.' This meant a new manager could come in (high management turnover) and change a veteran employees set schedule. They could also change vacation time practices and policies, sometimes doing so halfway through the year. It was very difficult for anyone with another job, school, a family, or just a life outside of work.  Some locations required availability of 7am-6:15pm M-F and every Saturday morning while only scheduling employees 15-40 hrs/wk. If you questioned management or we're not able to comply with schedule changes, you set yourself up for retaliation in the form of even more last minute schedule changes, not approving vacation requests and even employee reprimands-which were all considered ""OK"" because it is the manager's discretion. There is no set hiring wage for positions and raises are few and far between. Often employees didn't know why they were or were not getting a raise."

Depending on which department you work, I believe U.S. Bank gives a fair shot at maintaining a healthy work-life balance.","Compensation is lower than other banks (annual raises average about 1% - seriously), and the ""benefits"" are a joke. Seriously, if you can get a job at Citi Bank or Wells Fargo - do it. 

God forbid I have to ever get an x-ray or something, because I'd go bankrupt. My own manager told me his medical bills are already $7K in - and it's only September. Another supervisor had to go to the E.R. one day  where they did a MRI - she came back with a $3K medical bill. 

I chose the best health insurance policy they offered and I'm literally paying $300 per month in premiums, yetI can't even go to the doctor for a routine wellness check and blood test without getting billed for $80 (they only covered cholesterol and blood sugar testing; who cares about early detection?). I'm literally scared. The co-payment just to get inside the E.R. to see a doctor is $150 - isn't that the same as if you don't have health insurance? I never had a co-payment higher than $50 for the E.R. I've never had to pay a dollar more than $20 for any of my doctor's visits - regardless of the type. 

Every time I go to the doctor, I'm advised of all the things that are NOT covered by my health insurance. Did I mention this was the best plan they offered? I live in fear that me or my family will get sick or injured, because I'll have to file bankruptcy. Considering how little they pay me, the least U.S. Bank could do is offer a decent health insurance plan."

I developed scripts which automated varying processes of the loan servicing department. There were about 400 people who worked in my building and If I had the time and effort I could have automated almost all aspects of their jobs. Honestly, it is shocking that management doesn't realize how many jobs can be replaced. If they put more resources in technology they could literally automate the entire loan servicing program and the only jobs needed would be data entry.

I wouldnt recommend to ANYONE to apply at my branch until that demon woman is fired.,"Pay raises are NOT likely. Health insurance truly SUCKS. Assistant managers can really ruin an entire branch. They are very nasty about being over on your weekly time. I wasnt even being paid overtime because I was 35 hours a week, but I would get yelled at for being over by an hour in a week and would have to take an extra long lunch the next week to make up for it; so they wouldnt have to pay me a PENNY more than they had to. I was even scheduled at much less than 35 hours one week just because the assistant manager felt like punishing me! Call nights, where you have to stay an hour or more after work to make proactive sales calls, are guaranteed if you dont make your sales expectations every week... Total BS.. Not all branches are like that though thank goodness.. Gallup is pretty stupid. I used to do the monthly reports for my branch and one single grade below perfect can stop you from getting a bonus.

This is my only positive comment.,"The bank has a ""throw 'em to the wolves,"" ""let 'em learn as they go"" mentality towards training. Which makes no sense for a bank that is supposed to protect their customers' money. The fact that you're struggling to understand all of the different computer functions is your problem, not their responsibility to make sure that you understand your job inside-and-out before they put you on the teller line. God forbid you make a mistake on the computers, because the higher ups certainly won't see that mistake as a reflection of their poor training practices.

The job focus is entirely on sales. I'm not complaining that banks need to sell products to make money, but you'd think that the bank might bother to make sure their people know the banks' products well enough that the poor guy standing in line at the Walmart branch for who hours on a Friday can get an intelligent answer by the time he gets up to the window--one that doesn't involve scrutinizing the Baroque hell of the Who to Call list to figure out which three departments one is likely to be transferred to before the answer can be found."

San Diego is still kind of a new market for the company so if you are lucky you can end up with the right district manager actually grow quickly.","Because San Diego is a new market you are not valued the way you should with the company, San Diego is one of the most expensive places to live and they under pay hourly telling you that you can make it up in commission, but the commission structure is like a slap in the face and goes by a point system vs product sold. Also you may be one of the unlucky ones to end up in southern San Diego district where the distric manager really does not know what she is doing and does not value you as a person, she also likes to take credit for any success you do have, for the past two years I have  tried to get a promotion and have not had success, I always exceed my goals, i participate and volunteer in district trainings, conversations and have even lead many of them. instead I have seen managers be demoted to bankers (yes, this is real), people that I trained have got positions I have worked hard for (and the district manager's reson is because they stand out more, and no her perfomance is not better than mine, we are always among the top bankers), over all the company is good but the people the bank hires as your leaders makes a difference in your future, this distric manager in particular is already retired from union bank, she is now working again and dont think she will be here long, she cares only about numbers even if its not entirely ethical, I imagine this is because she wants a fat bonus and re-retire with a great pay, every one else ( like me ) doesnt matter to her."

Taking calls with no breathing room in between, not even a second to take a sip of water.  Every second you were not on a call went against you and God forbid you needed to use the bathroom.

It needs to be clear. Constant berating for not selling products to customers that do not need or want them in public forums continues to be humiliating for those trying to be responsible lenders. Come up with incentive plans that reward retail employees for doing the right things for the right reasons for the right customers. Reward them for service that does not always include a sale. Stop demoralizing us by telling our assistant managers that if their they don't see their BM's working at least 60 hours a week, we are not dedicated.

Although I realize this is a bank, many professional divisions are Monday-Friday day shift only which for me does not allow for an optimal work-life balance.

In the technology area, management recently instituted 5% pay cuts across the board because they were ""not meeting revenue goals""; which, in my mind, is a poor excuse to cut pay.

They only  point out the ""areas of opportunity"" that you need to improve on.",They always get rid of the hardworking employees that exceed their goals because they do not want to pay their incentives.

Job security if you can handle it,"This company will suck the life out of you! They expect you to act like a physician always on call, not matter what. However, the compensation in no way warrants the demands. You are never, ever, going to be able to deliver enough for this company. If you do well, they simply short staff your branch and expect more. They talk a good game about career development, work life balance, etc. Do not be fooled this is the WalMart of banks.  High stress sells environment. Product selling masked behind ""Needs Assessments"". Senior Management is not involved enough in internal promotion opportunity allowing many under qualified individuals to be advance based on personal relationships rather than achievement and skill. Realize you can't push a product to the same customer that comes in every week. Find other reasons to value your employees! Micro managing people only brings down moral and is not motivating your employees! Realize that people have family's and a life outside if the bank!! Stop expecting the bank to be the employees first priority over their own family! Management is very disrespectful to employees, making them stay late if they didn't hit sales numbers. Talk down to managers and employees. Pressure for sales has employees opening other accounts for themselves or multiple accounts for one client, therefore they aren't growing the business at all. Goals are unrealistic, I've been in this business a long time and have never seen anything like it. Leaving company. So many employees are unhappy and stressed out. They were once a great company but have become pushy sales all the time. Unrealistic goals. Heavy micromanagement. Up to 4 conference calls a day. Employees who cheat the system to make goals are rewarded, while honest employees are managed out. It's not even a secret. Management doesn't care about you. You're just a number to them. The pay isn't competitive. Unbelievable rate of turnover. All the good managers quit because they realize, it will never change. Customers can open accounts, credit cards and take out loans online now, most of the customers walking in the branch need maintenance, help with fraud, difficult situations debt with and assistance with problems. There is not as much time for all the proactive calling and selling and balancing it all as senior leaders think.

-Easier to ""get in the door"" of banking than most other banks from my experience
-The company does like to acknowledge its employees (but not contractors), and the company usually tries to do a better job at this than its actual members of upper management","-Senior management is so disconnected from the realities of daily work it is unreal
-Numbers, numbers, numbers. Company is obsessed with meeting numbers rather than accuracy in workloads (and this is scary, especially in a bankruptcy department)
-Horrible training and confusion on the job. Between an entire department, most problems were due to bad training, multiple opinions on the same issue (that should be cut and dry), miscommunications, etc.
-Contractors made up over 30% of the workforce in the department I worked in (bankruptcy). These contract employees are treated like lower class citizens and any full-time employees who stick up for them and/or try to change the department to address this are criticized. (I tried to create a contractor appreciation program among other things.) In the majority of cases these contractors work for the company, full-time and with their own assigned reports and duties, for years without the benefit of FT employment (I knew a contractor who was there for 6 years that I supervised, applied multiple times for a FT position, did superior work, and was passed over for a contractor who had arrived within the year who often relied on others for guidance in daily work and whose numbers were a fraction of the other). 
-Higher management (department manager and on up) are disconnected, unskilled in the jobs of the department, and at times, downright corrupt. I had a department manager make fun of contractors in a management meeting with myself present, and his successor went on to intimidate the management team not to speak negatively about any department flaws or decisions, even if an employee came to them in confidence to vent. Thankfully, there are better positions of similar types at better companies, as was proved when about eight people in total left in a short time period (two months) after this successor began to make these rules and changes."

Very little tolerance for any mistakes"

6549,,OK company,2014-05-08,4.0,24 Hour Call Center Personal Banker With Selling,excellent pay and if you have good sales skills then you have the potential to make really good money. The benefits are really great and start after 30 days of employment.,If you dont sale really well then you may be out of a job .  They offer a lot of mid day shift only and if you dont have a vehicle then this wouldnt work for you because the  job is not on the busline.

It does not matter if you make a branch profitable in less time than the projected day, that you represent the bank in non profit  companies events. They don't trust their employees"

6552,,It is a great company to work for if you are not a Minority.,2014-05-05,3.0,Asset Manager,I worked at the US Bancorp CDC.  They throw lots of money at their employees.  We have yearly lavish outings on a yearly basis.  They even had all employees spend a few days at the Trump Hotel in Chicago in suites.  The benefits are ok.  The headquarters is in Downtown Saint Louis in an area that is booming.,"Not a minority friendly environment.  I anticipate a huge lawsuit happening in the future.  Minorities are the last to get promoted and the first to be fired.  They move minorities in places after the fact to try and avoid lawsuits. I am not a minority, but I am afraid to speak up."

Open most holidays, and hours suck if you have a family at home.  Open Sat and Sun, so expect to work weekends.

6554,,All about Selling,2014-05-05,2.0,Teller,I enjoyed working with the people who came into the bank. A large bank has as lot of benefits that can be offered to customers.,All about sales. Management is more concerned with meeting sales goals then providing customer service. You are asked to work hard to meet sales goals but the only people that really benefit are the managers and upper management. My manager got bonuses and accolades but nothing was given to the tellers and bankers who get him there.

There are also plenty of different departments within US Bancorp if you do not want to stay confined to branch banking.","Hourly compensation is too low considering level of education acquired to work there. When getting into management, calling in sick or not coming in is not really an option. For standard tellers, it's okay to call in sick, but for those getting into management, it's looked down upon."

6579,,Proud to say I work at US Bank.,2014-04-18,4.0,Anonymous Employee,Richard Davis is an excellent leader.  US Bank remains true to serving their customers and supporting their communities.  Good solid company to work for.  401k matching contribution is a nice perk.,Would like to see more promoting from within the business lines rather than bringing in outside business line employees or outside of US Bank for leadership roles.  Employees who have been here for many years are often overlooked for promotions.
6580,,Poor Management,2014-04-18,3.0,,The compensation is great and when they are not short staffed they really work with a student's schedule.,Managers are made managers before they are ready to lead and we are constantly short staffed.

They also let you purchase an extra week as well. I have a total of 4 weeks/year.","In my district, they are somewhat hypocritical. They refuse to advance you into management, even if you have superior leadership and motivational skills, unless you are a top-tier sales person. Each sales person that met the requirements thus far has failed as a manger, letting their responsibilities go and letting the branch and employees fall a part. Whereas a banker who shows excellent skill at conducting management responsibilities and duties is basically spit on because they havent yet become an ""assisant banker"" but has been employed with the company for several years and meets or exceeds expectations. 
In addition to this, outsiders have been hired for management positions with no prior banking experience. So instead of getting support and help, subordinates are training managers on rules/regs etc and are not getting assitance with their needs. 
Also, pay is not that great. My base pay is $24k a year and my bonuses only gave me an extra $3k. Im considered a top banker in my district and my annual performance raise was only .43 cents."
6584,,Greedy management,2014-04-16,2.0,Anonymous Employee,"Work life balance is pretty good, most people friendly (not true in upper management)","During the economic crisis the president asked everyone to take a 5% cut in pay for six months so the bank could make it through the crisis, even though the banks were all being bailed out by the government. Then when the crisis was over he never made up the lost pay but gave himself a $10 million pay raise from $4 million to $14 million. They don't care about working people. They think you should be grateful for your underpaid job."
6585,,US Bank is a bank,2014-04-16,3.0,,"Working for US Bank is good because there are usually bright, energetic, young people working with you as well. Benefits are good.","The overall company makes changes in policy that clearly only take into consideration the traditional branches. In-store branches suffer from the stigma of not being a ""real bank"" customers routinely under-estimate the employed bankers' abilities and competency. Advancement is unlikely for most. This position requires standing all day.  There is constant turnover and branches are chronically understaffed."

The work environment is conducive to open communication and does not feel micro-managed. Management is accommodating to your schedule if you have other life goals or schooling. There is constant recognition and really nice incentives if you do well with sales. Customers seem to be our number one focus as we strive to treat them as guests.,"Pay and benefits could improve. Along with the challenging fast-paced work flow, sales and servicing the customers in a timely manner can be difficult as well. Perfect service scores can sometimes get ridiculous or unreasonable and affect everyone's incentives."

They are very understanding if you have something that you need to take care of. The managers sit down with you every few months to make sure things are going ok,"You have to use sick days for doctor appointments and you only get 6 to begin with. There are a lot of pointless meetings that are required that take large portions of your day. 
There is a generally feeling that a lot of the stuff you do is to protect yourself in case someone comes to blame you for a mistake. Instead of figuring out a solution and preventing it from happening the next time, it is like everyone wants to point a finger."
6598,,Large corporation with a lot of possibilities but cruel policies against its own employees,2014-04-05,2.0,Teller II,LDP is one of the best programs in the banking industry that can advance you to a position of your choice. Do not miss out on this program opportunity.,Be careful of what you are preforming and what you doing. Everything you do is monitored and solely depends on what outside auditors says.

Schedule not flexible"
6633,,10 years at the bank and still enjoying my job,2014-03-16,5.0,,"I think most of the upper management is very approachable - at least in the Payments division. Being a salaried employee, I have the flexibility in my schedule that hourly workers may not have.",Management sometimes withholds information trying to spare employees the reality of negative news.
6634,,they make lots of promises that are not kept like room for advancement or salary increases that never come.,2014-03-14,3.0,Personal Banker II,ok if you like working with customers and a team environment.,"too much work and very little pay  sad to say some employees never see a raise in years and when they do the compensation is a slap in the face, usually less than a dollar. Very few decide to stay, many employees leave within months to find better opportunities."
6635,,Mortgage,2014-03-13,2.0,Anonymous Employee,Pay was decent...coworkers decent. Nice office in a great location.,There was nothing really awesome about the place just a regional bank with a lot of drama. Everyone wanted to move up and it was highly competitive in that aspect which caused way too much turmoil on a daily. Pretty sure the manager in the dept created all the drama. Glad I'm not there any longer was starting to get gray hairs prematurely. Oh yes the medical coverage is atrocious.
6636,,Stay away,2014-03-13,2.0,Senior Banker,"- Pay is very competitive for the industry.  
- Company for the most part has a laid back atmosphere.  
- Sales goals are reasonable for the most part.","- Be ready to always be selling and being aggressive with people making teller transactions that are usually in a rush or have somewhere else to be.
- In my position, I was in an in-store branch, so I had to do everything.  Run the teller line 90% of the time, open new accounts, answer questions and answer the ever ringing telephone usually with just one other person there cause these in-store branches, especially in my district are always short staffed.  
- Due to the low ratio to work load in the in-store branches, usually there is an average of 4-6 employees. My branch had 5 and was the 6th busiest in the district out of about 16 branches.  Be prepared to usually work one shorter shift, and at least three long open to close shifts with only one person there.
- In states where breaks aren't enforced (Such as Ohio) any break you take less than 30 minutes you are paid for.  If you take a 25 minute lunch you're paid for, so this is a PRO.  However, don't ever expect to be able to sit long enough to eat because there isn't enough staff for the customer lines and workload and you cannot leave the branch other than to go out into the host store to grab a bite to eat if you are lucky enough to eat it.  Usually by the time you get back there are 5-10 people in line and the bank requires you to assist the customers because they come first. 
- When there is only one person there and they are working with an issue or opening accounts (which happens more than 60% of the time) you cannot take a bathroom break in the in-store because it requires to leave the branch and go to the host store's bathroom.  You cannot leave the front line unattended.  There were numerous occasions where there was opening of accounts or issues that lasted for hours and back to back issues and customer lines and wasn't able to go to the bathroom for 2-5 hours, sometimes until the end of the shift.  
- Technology is pretty outdated.  This company needs a fresh approach. 
- Benefits with US Bank were HORRIBLE.  I was shocked to say the least from such a large company.  The only option for deductibles is $1,500 or $3,000 and there is quite a bit of money you have to pay out of pocket for medical and prescription co-pays.  I was single on my health plan for medical, dental, eye, and prescription with the low premium/high deductible of $3,000 and I still had to pay almost $40 per bi-weekly paycheck, or about $80-90 a month.  If you get the lower deductible, you pay about $130-200 per month.  If you have a family forget it, with the $1,500 deductible for a spouse and child you're looking at several hundred dollars a month.  Upwards of $300 or more.  Plus, the benefits aren't that great compared to other companies I have worked for that charged less and covered more with lot less out of pocket expense.  
- They will hardly ever reimburse you for travel expenses to off-site training, and if they do expect it to be at least 2 months after you submit your reimbursements as they only approve so many usually only once per month, and it has to go through 2 levels of approval.  I left before I received over $200 they owed me for travel expenses and I have contacted them 3 times since and finally they agreed to pay me.  It's been 3 months now and I still have not received payment or a call back after another attempt to reach them about reimbursement payment.  
- Not as ethical as you would think being a bank that is heavily regulated by the government.
- They will also micromanage you and listen to everything you do.  The operations team that comes to your branch frequently will watch you like a hawk for you to make a mistake so they can tell you what you did wrong (like facing the money the wrong way or counting the money back to someone wrong) those are just the simple things.  The management will micromanage you in selling ways.  Be prepared to use the customers' name very frequently and you always must offer at least 1-2 products per transaction, per customer.  If you don't you will be under the feet of management and looked down upon.  
- Compensation plan for ""incentive"" could be better.  They don't call it commission because you're less likely to get paid out, and if you do you must hit several other tiers at 100% before you receive full payment.  If you don't, it's very minimal payout.  Usually less than $200, so make sure if you accept employment that you receive a higher hourly wage like I did."

Fully vested in 3 years. Decent vacation time. Managers do listen and it is a very racially diverse company with many opportunities for minorities and women.","Departments can't seem to cooperate or get along with each other. It is a big company and ofter hard to get the things you need to get your work done. For example I was moved into the testing department and it is nearly impossible to get the documents you needed to actually do the testing. I worked long hours and weekends because other departments couldn't deliver their content on time and then refused to extend the testing time.

Bait and switch jobs! Hired me as a web marketing person, then moved me into software testing, which I wasn't remotely interested in. Promised me training for the job and never delivered. A Friend of mine was hired for public relations writer and they tried to make him be a graphic designer even though he had no design experience. It takes a long time to get someone hired there, so when managers have an important spot to fill they just move over the last guy hired to fill it and hope they can learn it.  I quite out of frustration, without even having another job to go to. 

I worked it in the Internet and Mobile Channel Group, other departments aren't this messed up. I would also stay away from there IT department (they call it TOS), unless you are ready to work a lot of late nights and weekends."

- Flexible schedule
- Great work/life balance
- I love my co-workers","- Compensation is well below market average
- HUGE and often ridiculous emphasis on KDS scores
- Incentive payout
- My branch failed an audit 

I honestly don't working here is worth it. I made more money selling shaving products at the mall and I'm a licensed Banker. I hate having to wait for deferred points to kick in in order to receive a payout WHICH you don't get at the end of the month.

-Your responsibilities may be simple but you will be tasked with many objectives that your held accountable for.

For example, you will be responsible for; aggressive sales goals, ""perfect"" satisfaction scores, cash handling, banking transactions, customer interactions, loss prevention, cleaning/appearance of the branch, opening/closing,etc 

- Your pay will be noticeably lower than your counterparts at a traditional brick & mortar branch (but your sales goals will be less as well)

-Physical Setting; you'll be standing for almost the entire day in close quarters to your co-workers & branch manager and/or assistant manager.  And there is a reason why the branch is located inside a grocery store i.e. you will be asked to do ""aisle marketing""."

Employees get 2 free days to spend volunteering, which is heavily promoted. Some managers are great.","Different areas of the bank do not communicate with each other like they are in different 'worlds', resulting in problems. Managers often refuse to purchase tools that will make people's job easier, even something as basic as a $5 dollar wrist pad. Nobody ever gets a 1 (best) rating in their performance review, even if they worked your butt off doing two people's jobs. Jobs are so specialized that if one person is out, there is double work for someone else. People begin to feel overworked over time, until 'management' finally realizes there is a need for another employee. Management hypocritically has their staff attend classes on How to lead a team, but don't go themselves when they are the ones that need it. Sometimes an employee will want to attend a development seminar (in house), but management won't allow it unless they use vacation time. Sometimes an order will come from upper management that lower management knows is a poor decision, but are forced to carry it out even if they don't agree. Constant pressure to increase workload volume and cut staff. Salaried people often have to work 11 hr days. Typical yearly raises are often twelve cents an hour for certain departments, even for good performance, due to 'budget'. Most workers are only there for a paycheck and have no interest in bettering themselves, even though many personal growth opportunities exist. Tons of bureaucracy due to 'compliance' and not being able to break 'procedure' EVER, even when it doesn't make sense.  Lots of 'blanket' fixes and unnecessary training, instead of addressing just the parts that need it. To change the procedure, it takes a month and has to be approved by 6 different people. And favoritism to the ideas of people who are the loudest but not the most right. Managers may put a negative comment that needs improvement on your review even though it was never mentioned earlier in the year."
6675,,Good company,2014-02-25,4.0,Project Manager,"Great work life balance-the ""use it or lose it"" vacay policy allows you to actually use your vacation without feeling guilty. The downside is many folks wait until December to use it so the bank pretty much shuts down the last week of the year.

Oftentimes, you're left with a feeling of holding the bag on some things because others don't do their job.

6826,,Boring US Bank,2013-11-06,1.0,Internal Manager,If you are into fiance and using archaic computer systems its a great place to work.  They are careful with their money and would be a good investment with little risk because they are not going to get caught in a mortgage crisis.  They undermarket so they have to give you a better deal on most of their products because they are losing business to their larger competitors.,Low pay.  Headhunters call all the time because they know that they can hire you away with a pay increase.  They are bankers first and they dont know much about the functional areas.  For exaple the bankers know banking but they dont know marketing or sales or operations.  So you get the bankers take on sales and marketing which is fairly 1980s. Little upward mobility.  No resevour of knowledge.  If you are looking for a first time job it might be ok but if you are over 30 probably can get a better job somewhere else.

Most HR representatives ""pass the buck"" or delaying making decisions, instead of providing assistance.  Compensation lags current market. Merit bonuses have been under market against competitors for over 6 years. Bonus program for lower levels is fixed so managers can allocate more money to their favorite employees even when all in team have met goals. Mid level managers lack appropriate performance management training."

There are lots of opportunities for advancement and lateral career changes.  Hours are very good and there is good opportunity for incentive pay.,"It is a Big Bank.  So, it's also a big corporation.  That means there is very little opportunity for you to do things outside the box.  Also, depending on the business line, there can be quite a bit of politics. compensation is generally lower than local or regional banks, but that's true of most big national banks."

Overtime.

Friendly if slightly catty co-workers.

Well paid work for what it is.

Free parking.","Dull. Too quiet. People have too much time on their hands so office is a bit catty. 

Management can often be pretty petty. In fairness though this could have been because everyone was new, including themselves, and they were finding their feet as managers and getting confident in their new found authority. But the pettiness was annoying. Blowing things out of proportion was elevated to an art-form.

Relations between middle office in London and back office in Dublin were poor.

The business was not growing. No new clients. Senior management didn't seem to have any ideas on how to grow this client base in a competitive market.

The location is literally in a ghost industrial estate. It feels depressing to be so far away from any amenities."

Us Bank offers a lot of career-learning resources for employees to build management skills. They are willing to teach you if you don't know the business.,Management can be blind to your current work load. There are also communication issues between management.

The insurance wasn't too great but it did cover dental and vision as well.,"Some departments were not welled managed and nobody ever did anything about it no matter how many people complained to HR. The raises were very small, it was only raises once a year and it was just to barely match inflation."
6859,,Distinctive Leadership that Values the Employee & Business,2013-10-04,5.0,Technology Architect,"If you are looking for a company that promotes career growth and advancement opportunities, look no further.

You can move up to a variety of different positions and the company is open to let you advance.",Working at a bank in general is not exactly a stimulating experience.

There are a lot of campaigns that offer the opportunity to make more money and the benefits are pretty good,There is no real training.  You are just thrown in and forced to sink or swim.  There is no support from the DM and she has no idea about how to manage.  She is clueless when it comes to HR issues.
6875,,"No talent needed, no excitement offered",2013-09-16,3.0,Teller I,"US Bank is a pretty decent company to work for, though I didn’t particularly enjoy the job I had in the company. The company does seem to take a more cautious approach to business decisions, and there is a big emphasis on ethics. I did see the bankers in my branch consistently making good ethical decisions and explaining their reasoning behind those decisions to everyone involved. The bank offers a pretty wide variety of benefits (I’m not just talking about health insurance) that I do not see offered to entry level jobs in other industries.","This was definitely not a work environment that rewarded or even welcomed intellectual ability or creative thinking. The only qualities that were really important were: a) having a pulse, b) not stealing, and c) having no moral opposition to convincing strangers that they need more debt.  Any questioning the status quo was very much not okay. When I asked questions like “Why can’t we try doing it this way?” the answers were typically, “Things have just never been done that way.” 

The bank provides vacation time to tellers, which is nice, except the manager that I had denied two vacation requests for every one that she approved. Each request and denial came with a lengthy guilt-trip laden explanation. Requests for time for routine medical appointments were included in this circus. What if someone calls in sick while I’m having my teeth cleaned? Are we really so short staffed that I can’t be missed for an hour? And why is this my problem? If we don’t have enough people, hire more. 

I took an exit survey before I left. There was an opened-ended question about how my manager could improve. The textbox was limited to a tweet’s length. The feedback is clearly very valuable.

And also, SO MANY of the customers smelled awful."

Horrible work environment, managers would encourage employees to send credit cards to customers who did not request them. When customers would come into the branch to ask why they received a credit card, one particular branch manager would say that they came with every account and they only were reported to your credit if you activated it. Management would send brand new employees to local stores and malls and have them find people to fill out credit card and bank account applications (usually lying to them about a special $100 bonus that didnt exist). There was no room for advancement. I applied for one particular position on 3 seperate occasions, but never received one interview. All three times it was filled by an outside candidate. Four months after I quit, I had a recruiter call me asking if I was interested in interviewing for the same position."

They provide great opportunities to make a big bonus. It is a growing company and I won't mind working at a different branch.,"In my personal experience, it was just management. Micromanagement was detrimental to this specific branch. That is why there is such a huge turnover for employees here and why area managers are always investigating here. In my time here, a little over a year, I saw 5 people start and stop. This is a branch that only has 6 - 8 employees at a time so that number is significant."

No unpaid time off allowed if needed, two weeks paid vacation only. Frequently being yelled at and/or harassed by customers, usually for policies/procedures that lower-level employees obviously have no control of, such as recent account changes that push out and discourage lower income clientele.

When I had a question, they told me to refer to the book even though I repeatedly told them it was easier for me to see someone hands-on AND even asked to send me to a more busier branch temporarily so I can pick it up quicker. Branch managers compared me to a new employee they recently hired.. which was not even new, she came from ANOTHER U.S. BANK.. while I had NO background experience with banking.

My coworkers and management are some of the laziest human beings I've ever had the pleasure of knowing. An Instore banker is a glorified teller...my managers feel too good to help people or new employees. They are constantly sick and leaving the branch early in the afternoon but getting paid 40 hour salary. Turnover in my branch has been high and now I know why. Along with my managers refusing to get on the ""teller line"" even when the lines get 10 people deep. There is a lot of gossip and belittling. Our branch always makes our goals, often wins campaigns, yet it is never good enough. I've seen my coworker lie on credit applications and apply people for things without their permission, and management ignored my voice of concern even though its extremely unethical. Another coworker called ethics because of the managers always being gone and disappearing, and we all got cornered as they cried and demanded to know who called. If Richard Davis walked in this branch and saw how they were operating it would probably be shut down or they would be termed on the spot. I also know the company believes in a work life balance, which I never get to see because I work 10 hour days, weekends, and overtime almost every week even though I'm a 35 hour employee and we are fully staffed. Heaven forbid if i take a day off. District management has ignored all concerns because of our great sales numbers...the stress of the hours and duties of this job will fry your brain. You must make sales calls, aisle market, help the line, get a sale someway somehow among being a personal maid and slave...new Instore bankers give everyone else a reason to be lazy and help less than they already do. If you become overwhelmed no one cares, prepare to be yelled at or given an attitude."

If you come to work do you job correctly and keep to yourself there is no way you will advance in this company.

There is absolutely no accountability for management.  Anytime they want to change something (to benefit themselves) they do it without regard for employees. I detest Usbank and would never recommend them to anyone."

7091,,What a joke!,2013-01-03,2.0,Teller I,The only thing positive about my experience here was their employee benefits. I was able to feel what a career type job was compared to retail sales.,"I worked retail for four and a half years and became the Assistant Manager at a local retail store. As soon as I heard I got the job at US Bank, you wouldn't believe how much it was an honor to be apart of the family Sadly, the branch I worked for played me wrong. I can understand training an employee, but they wouldn't even bother.  I would ask for help and they would briefly tell me what to do and they would finish the transaction themselves. Within a week in, they sent me on the sales floor and expected me to learn everything I've read. I was never told that I was a slow learner, but for a person with no banking experience, you can at least help them when they have a question. They even compared me to a person when they already had banking experience, not to mention a person who worked for US Bank that transferred branches. It didn't help that they were hinting me that I should look for another job when the one month hit either. I later found out that there were two ladies leaving for maternity leave the same time and they needed me to learn everything by that time. About 60 days in,  they terminated me. Why? Cause she claimed I didn't hit her expectations and even said that ""if you had the time, you'd be a great banker"". I never failed at a job and I never will. I picked myself up from that experience because I doubted myself. But I got my previous job back the next day from a manager who also said that ""I deserved better"".

7093,,Deliver at all costs,2013-01-02,2.0,Co-Manager,"The pros vary upon what it is that you seek from an employer. If you like someone else giving you objectives and rewarding you for reaching them, this employer (just like many other corporate structures) offers an environment for such. This could be considered an ideal corporate banking position if you really are looking for ""stability"" as far as corporate banks are concerned.","Just like many corporate or publicly traded companies, the structure is highly geared toward quarterly performance. Therefore, you are obligated to make an effort to reach your objectives. Unfortunately, the bar will be raised each year or quarter along with any incentive plans meaning you could potentially face a crossroad where the interest of the customer could be squandered because of the pressure to meet your quarterly thresholds."

About 2 months ago I got promoted to banker two and they raised my pay to 14.25 (from 12.60), I then found out that Banker  1’s who just got hired and weren’t even making their goals were getting paid more than me. I worked my but off for this company and they pay me and others like crap. They over work us, a lot of the time we work 9.5 hours with NO LUNCHES! They want us to go above and beyond with our goals but the pay isn’t worth it and everyone in the in store division agrees with this.

As time progressed the ""rough patch"" my office was going through with turnover seemed to be more of a consistent battle across the whole district and not just one office. You will work like crazy and they expect you as a manager on salary to pick up all the slack no matter how short you are. They are a 100% number driven company with little concern for the people behind the numbers. The bonus opportunity is quite limited and you must meet criteria in many categories before earning bonus.

lack of training, there are atleast three branches in the district that are managerless and no one is training to fix that. The training for new bankers is to sit infront of a computer for hours then be thrown on the line and hopefully you will get it.

They are always trying to improve and be better. The customers are wonderful, and it can be a fun job with fun campaigns. The district management and ops specialists are also very pleasant and helpful and believe strongly in teamwork. Its a fun job with lots of opportunities to be promoted, etc,.","In my particular branch, the nicest way to put it is my managers are tyrants. Before I started they had a very high turnover and lost over 4 employees in 6 months. Im new to banking, and my manager is very unhelpful. She personally belittles employees, huffs and puffs when you need an approval or assistance, she tries to pry into our personal business, and she gets overly upset when sales goals arent met and throws around the fact we take her bonuses away. The bank can be very busy in the in-store enviornment. It becomes overwhelming doing teller transactions, offering products and doing the loans. It is the ultimate multi-tasking job, and its particularly harder for me because the management sits at their desk all day and doesnt want to help you or the customers. From what i've heard in other instore branches, the management style is similar and you are expected to sell sell sell and be nothing short of a slave. I also feel operations are constantly changing and it feels hard to keep up with, since the smallest of mistakes can get you fired. Its also a bank open 7 days a week and open til 7 PM during the week."

7142,,Not moving in the right direction,2012-10-12,3.0,Personal Banker,"Good product offerings, competitive rates, very profitable","Antequated incentive program, does not take into account competitive advantages/disadvantages of your locations. For example, I was judged right along side someone who worked at a branch with 4-5x the traffic and loan balances as my small branch. Did not compare as production per opportunity, only gross production. So when that person has 4-5x the opportunities, they have 4-5x the production and, in mgmt eyes, they were a better employee"

Our department recently went through some changes and no one was let go, or moved to another branch/division.  Good Benefits/401k, HSA, Life Insurance, etc.  There's also an employee perks website with discounts on shopping and entertainment.  There isn't another large bank in the United States with a better government rating or reputation.","Management seems to be more concerned about the profits of shareholders than the advancement of employees pay/bonuses.  Management is probably overpaid compared to the salaries of other employees, but most large corporations have that problem.  People have issues with customer service, overdraft charges, etc., but that comes with all banks.  (See the USB Facebook page.)  My advice to them would be to not get an overdraft, and try to do banking online, or during non-rush hour times."

7153,,My perspective,2012-09-20,4.0,Anonymous Employee,A company that has tremendous integrity!,One district manager can allow an employee of 14 years to be terminated without a personal conversation! Sad.

Nothing exotic (a.k.a risky).,"Top-Down. Compensation tends to be conservative (Though Bonuses are good because of strong bank performance, base pay can be improved comparing to competitors)."

I was able to negotiate raises and was rewarded for my performance.  Direction from management was clear and the focus/overall communication from the top down seemed very good.","Turnover, turnover, turnover.  In my short tenure at a branch, I eventually became the most senior employee in the course of a year.  This is the nature of the beast, as the pay is low and it's easier to replace you than you care to admit.  Make yourself stand out and there are opportunities to move up."

There's plenty of room for career growth if you like the work, and working in a banking environment allows for a better understanding of personal finance.","It's a sales job through and through.  Customer assistance is expected and required (as it should be), but the most ""successful"" tellers are the ones who convince the most customers to get loans by talking to a banker.  There's nothing wrong with this--banks have to make money, but retail banks located in less-frugal areas are at a significant advantage, as US Bank is very picky as to who they loan money to.  Standing in a teller window for an entire workday can get extremely boring.  Customers who don't know how to handle their own money can get very angry, sometimes even borderline violent.  Robberies are more frequent than one would expect, and can be pretty scary."

Good leadership from CEO.","Salaries are much lower than other companies  No good programs that offer room for advancement of your career.  Tuition reimbursement offered, but minimal.

7174,,"High expectation, low training",2012-08-21,2.0,Customer Service Representative,"Good pay. I started out 10.10 an hour. If you work the last shift, you get a 10% increase making it 11.11 an hour. 
Great coworkers. I seriously worked with amazing people. 
Most Fridays they cook lunch and you just pay a couple of dollars for a plate of food and a drink. 
The assistant managers were awesome to talk to.","Answering terrible customer's phone calls about their mortgage. I had an elderly woman scream obscenities at me because I had to put her on hold in order to call another department about her inquiry. 
People think they can say anything to you over the phone. Anything. 
I had very little training for all the things you need to know about in order to do your job. If you had trouble with a call, you could call the assist queue which consists of other senior reps that answer your questions. Most of them are nice but some make you feel like an idiot for asking a question. The entire month I was on the phone by myself, I had to call the assist queue with every call. Every.single.call. Angry customers do NOT want to be put on hold like that. Especially when they have several questions and it had to keep happening. 
Management aren't happy being there anymore than the reps are. They are kind of oblivious too."
7175,,USBank,2012-08-20,4.0,Applications Manager,Good place to work.  Great job security.,Inevitable bureaucracy of a large corporation in some areas.  Good job security means they sometimes retain people that aren't the right people for the job.

I was proud to work for this company and would do it again.  Richard Davis is an outstanding CEO.  I had the opportunity to meet him and what a pleasure it was to do so!

There are always positions opening up and they love to hire from with in. If you do well with sales, you will pretty much be able to go where ever you want in the company.","Working in a branch can be stressful due to the need to be selling all the time. If you are not the top sales person, they don't even want to acknowledge you. They act like customer service and loyalty is the most important thing to them right now, but all they care about is money and hardly paying anything to the people who are the face of their company. If you want to make money in the company, you basically have to be a vulture."

Great/amazing credit cards, as long as you pay them off quickly.  Not kind for excusing fees, higher managers very stingy when clients really might need a break.","Benefits are a jip.  I worked at a previous bank and an employee would earn vacation time way quicker and more fairly.  You show up, you earn vacation.  The ""buy up"" for an extra week of vacation is a jip.  They need a much better system.  And as a newer employee, you are shown you have a certain amount of hours to take for vacation.  I had to move with my s/o back to where we moved from and was told I wouldn't be able to take a vacation day before moving away because ""you haven't earned it.""  I wasn't sick once in my 4 months and on time!  I earned one day!  Come on!  I took the day for a dental appointment.  JIP and very unfair.

The pay is competitive, the incentives are good, there's a high level of camaderie, management is approachable, and, as there's no face to face customer contact, jeans are acceptable. U.S. Bank's community involvement is commendable, too.","Chances are good you're going to start on the phones.

Opportunities for growth, vertically or laterally, seem limitless with such a large company, and the customer service area does pretty well with hiring from withing, rather than externally.","Health benefits aren't great, and don't seem to be getting better (though I feel that is probably the case nation-wide).

7215,,Good Options if you stick around,2012-06-21,4.0,Personal Banker,"As with many retail banks, there is high turnover, so it does not take much loyalty to be recognized. After two years with the company, I have moved to top of my district in sales, without much more work than when I started, and job promotions seem within reach. Part of that is just getting better at the job, makes improved sales seem easy because of improved skills.","Still hate calling. USBank seems to have more outbound sales calling than many banks, but less than some like Wells Fargo. The job is not autonomous, but the better your numbers the less oversight you will see from managers. However, slumps in sales see quick action taken by managers."

One being that the pay was too low for what they were asking of me. Getting paid in the low 40's (this is considered on the higher end of what managers get paid) as a manager to work 55+ hours and work 6 days a week is very unfair and is one of the reasons why there is so much turnover. I also was unhappy with district leadership, there was blatant favoritism and mistreatment to those who are not favored.  There is no work life balance, and the district management actually laughs about people being upset about not having a work life balance. You need to sacrifice more than it is worth to do everything that is expected, and in the end it's not worth it for the paycheck. They emphasize leadership and how important it is for good leadership, but they basically crap on their ""leaders"" and micromanage them to death. The weather in Seattle is depressing enough why be in a job that's even more depressing?"

The company places a great deal of emphasis on employees maintaining a work/life balance.  Company offers a career for everyone, whether they wish to stay in the same position, or look for promotional opportunities.  It's all up to the employees to make promotions happen.","Promotional opportunities are naturally limited outside of the bank's main retail footprint.  Base salary is middle of the road, or slightly below, but the company offers incentive (variable) compensation plans that try to make up the difference.  However, these incentive plans are either tied to company, line of business or portfolio success.  Depending on the plan, and outside factors, it may be hard to realize 100% of the incentive payout."

In my personal opinion, my knowledge and insight of the banking industry is different, compared to my first work day. If you are content with selling financial products to customers, then you'll be ok within the banking industry. If you are a recent graduate, like myself, who had envisioned working with the community to change the face and reputation of the financial industry, or found out that the regulations and practices for the industry are not as effective in a customer's daily transactions, then this industry won't be for you (matter of fact, this is a position where you will work hard and you may not get all of the recognition that you deserve, from both management and customers). There will be no advancement or support to get any of the financial licenses (at least, not for a long while, unless you're prepared to work to the bone for more than a year and wait to become nominated by your district manager)."

Never received over a 2% raise.  Usually was either 1% or 1.5%, even in booming years.  Company standard is a 2% raise.  Bonuses are ok, but overall they don't keep up with cost of living adjustments at all.
Unless you are at the HQ location, there is no opportunity for advancement.

Benefits are by far the best I've seen from the few companies I've worked for.  Paid vacation, paid sick days, matching 401k option after a year, health, dental, vision, life...simply the full works.  Advancement within the company is very possible.  Within a couple of months some opportunities presented themselves to me and many people in management position explained their way up the ladder.  And there are cash incentives for booking credit cards, meeting referral goals, and high KVS ratings (customer service).  Also provided good training where you never feel alone or the feeling you can't receive help.","Very repetitive.  Can't stress how redundant it gets to stand in one spot all day making deposits, withdraws and payments.  In addition to that, especially in my branch, a vast majority of customers come up unprepared meaning you need to find their account numbers, fill out their slips, etc. which becomes very annoying really quickly.  There is also massive pressure to sell, sell, sell.  Even though we rather not give people products that'll benefit them (a good thing for the customer), we are still expected to meet certain numbers.  And in some branches, we only so many customers that come through, so the number of people we could try to sell to are limited.  We often get negative feedback about how we're always trying to sell them something.  Then we we do perform at a high level, our goals are increased for the next period making it even that much more difficult.  Recently there is a big push for customer service where a ton of time and effort is being used.  If we dont get a perfect score on a survey call, its a complete failure and dont receive any points.  In addition, many of our cash incentives are based on our customer service ratings."

Their focus tends to get caught in the small things (employee gossip) that tend to get blown up because management is so focused on them.  They also tend to have managers in different parts of the country than their employees - not an ideal work enviornment.  There's a lot of non-verbal communication that is lost because of this.

Granted you get to go into work later, 10 AM, but you do not leave until 7 PM. The weekend shifts are also long or awkwardly placed in the day, Saturday shifts are equivalent to a normal weekday shift at other businesses (9-5) and Sunday shift cuts the day in half (12-4).

Very ethical leadership and honest genuine respect and concern for customers, and fellow staff members.","Depending on the district, upward movement can be tricky, as there are two different sides to the set up. There are Community branches/districts, and there are Metro branches /districts. The community Districts tend to to be filled up with very long term employees, not looking fro advancement, so movement is very slow. The Metro districts are much more fluid, and have more opportunities available."

Policies and procedures are well thought out and clearly written. Operationally sound.",Like being micromanaged? How about promotions and recogntion not to those qualified but rather to whomever has the best suck-up ability? Have ethics and believe in doing something right rather than just to get approal from the analysts? Then US Bank might indeed be a good place for you to work. The pervasiveness of such behavior starts at least at the top of retail banking within the Cincinnati market
7302,,It was OK,2012-01-25,3.0,,"Some great colleagues--some very knowledgable people who have worked at the bank for years
Some of the work was interesting.
Location 
Certain departments were very well run","Very limited opportunities for personal and professional growth
Teams were often too large (80 people on a conference call does not an efficient team make) and meetings would go on for 2-3 hours or longer.

Some good managers, but too many inept ones"

Management does not care when you have FMLA absences.
Bad pay in comparison to other companies, and very poor raises given annually."

Occasional work from home is not company wide policy it is completely at the mercy of supervisor.

Benefits are below standard.
Senior leadership is delusional and naive and tried to impose his own antiquated personal (including religious) and professional beliefs on employees.
