226,,Mehhhh,2020-10-05,2.0,Anonymous Former Employee,Decent starting salary if you have some experience.  Variable comp plan that is attainable once you have lending authority.,There is no strategy in the buildup of new employees.  The “formalized” training is being built as they train you.  Expansion within the department grew faster than what they could handle and the employee experience suffered.  They want to act like a big bank but they are relatively small and lack the means/leadership based on growth rate of the business.

There is absolutely no work-life balance at all.
The bank uses Waterfall for SDLC, yet the business is constantly adding new requirements anyway. Despite this, the project managers keep the same project timelines, which forces the projects to be very condensed and stressful. (We currently have SIT/UAT going on AT THE SAME TIME. INCREDIBLE). 
I consistently work 12 hour days all the time, and have to work on the weekends sometimes too.
The work environment is pretty toxic. I am in meetings all day even though I have development work to do, yet I'm always asked why work is not being done.
Co-workers are okay, but everyone only cares for themselves. There is no accountability anywhere, across any of the apps.

Senior management plays favorites and surround themselves with yes sir/man employees creating a toxic culture.

* The 'promote from within' philosophy is just a way for them to keep salaries low. I was promoted to a new position at a time when many people were hired into our group. They all received a VP title and much higher salaries, even though I was training them and handling more work than they were. Management said there are actual caps on how much of a raise an employee get.

318,,Incompetency And Lack of Accountability Across The Organization,2019-07-09,1.0,Vice President Finance,"-The only thing good about UB is the relax environment, which could be a major con too.  If you want to move up in the organization or get things completed in a reasonable amount of time, it's not going to happened at UB.
-If you have no ambition or want a job where you clock in and do the bare minimum, UB is the place.
-UB is trying to implement an Agile culture and they hired consultants to help with the implementation.  But they don't listen to the consultants and tell the consultants ""we're doing it our way"" ; thus, wasting millions of dollars.  This is the prime example of UB's great ability to waste large amounts of money.
-UB's new Agile culture is going to blow up in their face because they don't even know how to implement it or know what they're doing.  Plus, their culture isn't made more a proactive environment as UB resembles a government agency.  Agile requires accountability and competency, which are two things UB doesn't possess.
-Filled with Project Managers, Accounting/Finance employees, Directors, and Developers with inflated job titles who are nothing more than paper pushers that can't even fill out the paperwork or explain their own reports. 
-Developers are a joke here.  Code gets pushed out that doesn't meet the project requirements nor do they test the code to see if it works.","-Raises are a joke.  There are better paying jobs at their competitors and smaller banks.
-401(k) employee match  is 4%, which is the minimum safe harbor match and below national average of 4.7% per Fidelity.
-They're planning to cut $100M of expenses in the next 5 years, so massive layoffs are coming.
-Consistent reorganizations and ""lighthouse"" layoffs practically every year.  In other words, they're always laying off people due to cost issues.  However, management never looks at the departments that are causing the inefficiency and where the costs are consistently being added.  Their response is to promote the people who are the cause of the inefficiency.
-The average UB employee tenure is 10-15 years who are receiving a cost heavy pension plans.  These employees lack competency, vision, accountability, and initiative as they do the bare minimum and wait out their pension payouts.  
-Narrow minded employees who don't see the bigger picture and only focus on their little area.  They push back when recommendations are suggested.
-Incompetency and lack of accountability at all levels of the organizations.  There are Managing Directors who will not put anything in email especially when it comes to their projects being written off.
-UB is a process heavy organization where they think adding an additional process onto an already inefficient process is always the solution instead of evaluating the current process.
-Projects take anywhere from 3-5 years to finish.  Once finish, the technology is obsolete and they have to write it off and then they decide to go with an outside vendor."

I've seen way too many good people go because of this. Good for senior level employees just trying to slide into retirement. Questionable fraternization between managing director and junior/intern level employees. Questionable immigration practices/manipulation of immigration law.

332,,Looking for gender discrimination? Come here!!,2019-04-12,2.0,Anonymous Employee,"The CEO has a great vision and is a very transparent leader. The problem is that his ideas and vision do not cascade down to the actual managers/leaders across the organization who touch employees on a more regular basis. They even mock some of his statements challenging the status quo and are committed to the fact that ""it will always be this way, so deal with it.""  

Being a Japanese bank the culture is very conservative which can be a good thing when so many other banks out there are engaging in risky behavior. Job security is good for the most part, and if you are let go the packages are generous.","As a male who is committed to gender equality, I have noticed that men are treated significantly different than women. We are treated with more respect, make more money, are given priority office space, are allowed more flexibility in terms of work locations and schedule. Overall, if you are a man and work at the bank you have it pretty good. This is pretty ironic given the fact that the bank continues to make strong claims that they're ""committed to women"" (both internally and externally). If you are going to make that claim, and want to ""be known for it,"" you should probably walk the walk so you can back it up. Actions speak louder than words. 

Additionally, there is very, very little opportunity for growth.  The organization is very flat and operates quite lean. Meaning there are few human resources to get things done. Frequently managers stay in their positions and do not get promoted and do not leave which means there is no opportunity to move up. Another impact of operating very lean is that there are EXTREMELY limited budgets for professional development and growth opportunities. Aside from the ""internal learning opportunities"" (which are pretty pathetic) good luck trying to get approval to attend any outside/industry conferences or events to help you better yourself, or god forbid bring leanings back to your position to drive ROI for the bank!!

Finally, technology. There isn't enough room or time to describe just how terrible it is. Imagine the way banks operated in the 1980's (in terms of systems and technology resources) and that is what the bank is currently working with."

Through my 18 years, even with several organizational changes and moving reporting lines, they paid a good salary, allowed me to take good care of my employees and I left with a very fair package.  They are a true bank, and I keep all of accounts there.  The 4 not 5 rating is because I don’t know now what it’s like to work there, and as fair as they were at the end for me, up until the last three years I sometimes had to press quite hard to get the salary bumps and employee support","Again, quite a number of years ago, but up until my last three years or so the bank was much less generous with salary bumps, though they always were good on enhancing employee skill sets at their expense. At the time, and understanding the bank was beginning their move to a much bigger bank, there was not always clarity in what employees were being told by management and management sometimes seemed to have different interpretations of what they were told to say."

-High turnover because of poor management and legacy systems.
-Management shows up late all the time and leaves early, but complains when you arrive 1 min late.
-Goals are complicated because you have to literally go out to get business. Traffic is not high enough in volume, so you are cold calling everyday.
-lots of partners so it can get confusing with products and services the branch offers vs partners (not all partners are reliable).
-the systems branch uses is outdated compared to their partners and commercial banking.
-you literally have to call operations for everything, which means more time wasted.
-you need approvals and access for everything, which takes forever.
-IT takes forever to reach and computers are down frequently.

Union Bank management is dominated by former Countrywide executives who are completely clueless about what to do and the results speak for themselves.

407,,Stay away,2018-09-20,1.0,Banker,Maybe you will have some nice coworkers,"This bank is uncompetitive with any competition. They seem to think we are still in the mid 90’s since much of their software and processes remain antiquated and out of date. Constantly changing policies and creation of extra fire ringed hoops for employees to jump through just to service a customer. They blame it on regulators, but this is not the case as other banks do not have these same issues. Compensation plan for bankers is terrible and they just announced it is getting worse. Now they won’t compensate you except semi-annually which is completely out of sync with other banks. The idiot on the call stated “it’s an industry trend”. That’s total BS. The performance periods have been extended industry wide but most banks will pay on deals quarterly and several banks monthly. Find one of these companies to work for if you don’t want to wait until May of next year to be paid for something you did in September. 

Underwriting guidelines are subpar and a HELOC takes 60-70 days to close. By that time customers just ask to cancel the process because they can get it done in 15-20 days elsewhere. Even employees don’t use us for lending needs since anyone can find a more competitive bank that has the ambition to get it done quickly within a mile radius of the branch.

Sales goals are terrible and focus on metrics that are not possible to meet given low branch traffic (credit cards) and subpar HELOC products. Deposits pay nothing except for a $400 incentive semi-annually if the branch goal is met. 

Lastly they attempted to do remodels beginning in 2017 but this is failing miserably. Some branches have received a remodel but it is always done on the cheap. Essentially they are making themselves into a crappier version of chase. Other branches are void of a remodel and they ran out of money so these remodels have to be delayed. If you work in one of these then you will be embarrassed to go to work each day as the branches look old and run down."

Doesn't matter if you have done senior level work for years, even new employees barely worked with company for one year get's promoted doing same level of work or less. With new CISO in place, newly implemented rule is you have to work at level of position you want to promote to first before you are considered for the promotion. Anything you did in the past that have proven you were more than qualified doesn't count going forward. if you are in the in-crowd, such as going on annual trips to Vegas as a group etc you will get promoted.

Great for entry level positions within the branches and other areas.,"It's extremely difficult to advance in the company, it's all about who you know and even then it's difficult. 
They do not provide their employees the right tools to do their jobs.
There is no structured training for most areas, you're basically thrown in and learn as you go (this excludes branch positions, the branches have very good training programs for all positions)
They are about 10-15 years behind on technology compared to other banks.
Almost all upper management are former Wells Fargo execs that expect a smaller bank to run like one of the larger banks with zero tools to do so.
Most staff members are doing the job of 2 or 3 people.

The pay was very poor for an entry level position and the first thing I was asked when I was called by a recruiter was if the below the teens/hour rate was acceptable. They are owned by a foreign holding company and try to operate very cheap in terms of wages outside of California. They work you non stop, ie. more than two person workloads and there's no appreciation at all, it simply isn't worth what they pay.  They will say you will get a bonus, but you won't. They play favorites and only handed out bonuses to 2 people on the team, one of whom was on a leave and then quit. All the good people started leaving and have all left by now. They started massive layoff's which aren't reported in the news. Pink slips are handed out every 6 months to a year to California workers, They cut many positions within the branches and operations side. Many were fearful they would get laid off so they quit their branch positions. Everyone is just treated like a cost, despite them making/holding billions of dollars each year. They are profitable the past several years yet still lay off people. They don't care, the longer you have been there the easier you will lose your job. There are better companies to work for. The low approval ratings and low recommendation % is for good reason. Keep away."

But now I don't even think those are worth it.,"There has long been a group of senior executives that used to work together at Countrywide, and over the last five years they have slowly taken over virtually all departments at the senior- and mid-levels. As a result, there is rampant cronyism and nepotism. Mediocre or incompetent ex-CW executives are shuffled from one role to another, rather than just let go. 

They've created a culture of fear and incivility, where everyone is afraid to lose their jobs or cross the wrong executive and decisions are made based on certain executives personal preferences, rather than what's strategically sound. 

It's not all just ex-CW of course; it's also employees who are willing to be sycophants to the ex-CW crew. Decisions are made based on personal vendettas and alliances, and strategy changes often without any coherent explanation. Relatives of executives with no related experience are hired. People who are inexperienced--but solid sycophants--are promoted. 

Cost-cutting initiatives--which were once part of improving the balance sheet in order to acquire other banks--no longer make sense. Previous decisions to reduce costs--which have been quantified and successful--have been reversed without a logical explanation. Layoffs continue in the name of streamlining, but the people left are working longer hours without an increase in pay. Employees are being squeezed. 

The ex-CW crew has brought along their culture and are often unwilling or unable to listen to other people's ideas. They believe that if something worked at CW, it should work here too. Sadly they seem to have forgotten that CW failed."

Benefits are being slashed in ridiculous ways, embedded subject matter experts are being pushed out creating increased risks and demands on those who remain, and compensation perks are being eliminated.  

Middle and Senior Management ranks have exploded in size over the past four years as new senior managers and executives hire friends while forcing the lower-level management and staff to be reduced through attrition.

Most don't understand the real business problems nor have managerial skills. And when they do understand, the solution is not there, mostly buying time by implementing ineffectual delaying tactics or endless meetings with committees.

There are some interesting initiatives, like trying to shut down old dilapidated branches and replacing with robots or apps, but this maybe too little or too late at this point, given the severe competition and headwinds.","The place is very weak. No strategy, just reacting to events or situation, and doing that poorly. Brand recognition is low. Technology is non-existent, somehow they think throwing bodies and consultants at problems is the best way (it is if you are minimizing costs and number of employees for the eventual sale of the bank).

My peers are suspecting that at the current pace parts or all of the company maybe up for sale because simply hard to achieve any semblance of reasonable returns for the investors' money. Cost control is not effective, cutting costs resulted in comparably reduced revenue, negating any positive impact of such cost containment.

Did I say adverse selection of employees? After years of attrition, the ones who are still there in the management ranks are those who can't find a job elsewhere. It's no secret people are waiting for their packages once the hammer falls. Yes, some good ones, but that's like a few among dozens in a typical department."

Layoffs continue to occur and those who remain feel like they could be next because there is no gratitude for the extra work we continue to take on. The benefits keep getting worse - took away the pension last year, changed insurance companies and increased the prices, switched so that 401k matches are only done at year end so if you leave mid year you get no match (nice for the bank to earn more interest for itself), no more vacation buy options so if you're in your first 5 years at non-offiver level you get 2 weeks and nothing more (don't be a parent because you'll never see your kids), sick days used to be 12/year with rollover up to 400 hours and now you get 7/year and if you don't use them you lose them (definite increase in sick days used was seen this past year). It's difficult to move up in the company and they are so cheap - even with tons of layoffs in the past two years the bonuses are less and less and the salaries remain below market. Management is incompetent and inclined to hire from outside or make easier, illogical promotions. They want to emulate the big banks so badly that they keep hiring from Wells and other competitors to ""get an edge"" and then wonder why their long time employees jump ship. Oh and force ranking your employees based on a bell curve and hurting their chances for promotions and bonus incentives is a great way to boost morale - and you wonder why the employee satisfaction survey keeps getting worse every year.

Good luck on getting anything done - everyone passes the buck, candor is hugely lacking, you will die waiting to have a useful 1:1 with management.  I wonder what they are afraid of?  In many respects - technology, culture, sensitivity to a diverse society - they are a throw-back to the dark ages.

816,,Going downhill,2015-10-21,2.0,Anonymous Employee,"Generally good people working for the company.  Overall you will find hardworking and honest people at Union Bank.  Some room for career advancement if you have the right people rooting for you.  Some real gems in the long time older employees.  
Other pros are steadily disappearing.

Work life balance is generally good, there is strong pressure to perform at times but typically nothing backbreaking and nobody has died of overwork and stress that I know of.  Benefits were pretty good before but are steadily being cut down, see below.","This bank used to have a pension.  It's now gone.  This bank used to have a better health care plan. That is now also gone.  This bank used to have long tenured staff and people who knew their communities.  Gone.  This bank used to have a 401k match.  It is also gone replaced by an annual match that you don't get unless you are working for the company on the last calendar day of the year.  AOL tried this a while ago and had to withdraw due to public backlash.  IBM does this but offers a higher employer match and access to an advisor.

Benefits are steadily being cut, commission is half of what it used to be.  This bank was known for paying higher base salary and lower commissions, so it would even out with other competitors.  Now the commissions are lower, benefits are lower and staff is being aggressively cut to deal with the fact that branch banking does not have the foot traffic it once did.  

They say they are looking to be a top ten bank over and over again but have shown little progress in anything besides cutting costs.  Investment in technology is not there and systems are very antiquated.  Not sure when the top ten part begins but it hasn't started yet.  It seems like it would be hard to attract top tier talent for a top ten financial institution with sub par technology, staff and benefits, but maybe there are more changes in the works."

The starting pay is between 50k-55k based on experience and market, so its good compared to other banks.","The worst thing is the archaic systems they use to equip bankers and staff.  Along with the typical office politics, this is also a business 2 business job, so ignore this bank because their branches are dead.

Pay is better than industry's average.  Good benefit packages.   Relax schedule.  If you don't want to move up and are looking for a wor-Kation, this is the place.","Product:  Very backward.

Credit policy is set based on mortgage guidelines.  Lack of creativity, when there are excellent clients that do not fit all 5 boxes, the credit team will have auto declines, which makes absolutely no sense.  Pricing is not competitive.  So when there is a prime deal, Wells Fargo, Chase et al will gobble up the deal.  The underwriting teams used to do personal / retail mortgage and have absolutely no idea of basic accounting and C&I underwriting guidelines.  Perhaps they should freshen up on basic accounting / credit courses.  

Cash management:  Still using technology from last decade.  No one knows what they do except for reorganizing their teams on a continuous basis and pretending to be busy.  

Communication:  Unclear / Confusing

People need to be ""friends"" with certain groups to find out whats going on with various groups/partners.  

Culture:  Passive Aggressive.  Often times my group becomes the scapegoats of other groups failures.  They won't tell you why but they stab you in the back with smiles.

Goals: Unrealistic 

Upper management wants to be top 10 bank in the U.S.  So, they will set unrealistic goals and trickle down to worker bees.  In turn, many people leave because it is unrealistic and the vicious cycle continues.  Therefore, the bank has slowly becomes the laughing stock of the industry.  

Technology:  Prehistoric

DOS base software (I don't even know what DOS is).  Which means no transparency, that causes duplicated efforts and internal territorial fighting.

Operations:  Less than sub-par

When there are deadlines, and the ops quote you 5 days of SLAs, the turn around time is NEVER 5 days."

This bank has many good products which makes them easy to sell. If you want to move up, and they see potential in you, they will help quite a bit. Good pay compared to other banks. Although the bank is small, it seems it has a lot of potential to become nationwide, meaning it's a good company to grow with.","Although it's easy to move up, it takes a WHILE. All tellers start at 20 hours, and more hours are somewhat difficult to pick up. After a year of being a teller, one may move to another position after training. Training is lacking, for the most part you are thrown directly into action as opposed to extensive training, which probably isn't the best when you deal with others' money. It's a small bank, only located in three states, so many customers are returning clients, making it slightly difficult for referring."

If you want a 9-5 job until retirement (or the bank ceasing to exist) with good benefits look no further. Most ""old timers"" have been here 20+ years. There are even employees here who've been around for 40 years. Some don't even know how to use Excel.  The bank spends millions on contractors and consultants.","See the ""Pros"" section. If all you have is old timers who have little incentive to change how things are done, then you have one or two options - wait for them to leave (which they won't given the ridiculously generous pensions) or you leave. It takes an IT ""field"" technician 4 days to come to your desk to fix a problem with the browser. 

If you have no ambitions, don't want to learn anything and bide your time, come here! In a few years you'll be unemployable elsewhere. You too can become one of the old timers. If you do want to make a lot of money, come in as a contractor"

Nice base salary, giving is huge in the company and so is community service.  Health insurance for the employee start from day 1 and are paid by the company 100%, the family is added after 30 days I believe, and they pay for life insurance to match your salary at no cost to the employee.  Executive management is consistently asking for feedback from the teams.","Very few cons, this is a nice company to work for.  The majority of the marketing is done for California and if you work in the PNW it is almost like an after thought.

952,,Growing Pains,2014-11-19,3.0,Anonymous Employee,"Union Bank is a wholly owned subsidiary of Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (Tokyo).   As such, it's in a perpetual state of growth and transition.   Advancement opportunities are greatest for those in corporate or leadership roles, but all employees have unparalleled access to career development and certification programs.   Corporate culture is tied to performance-based recognition events throughout the year and community involvement.    Union Bank has an active Foundation and excellent reputation within the community.","Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group consolidated its North and South American interests into MUFG Union Bank (NY).   Communication is a huge area of opportunity and direction is often unclear as the company expands beyond its historically regional presence.  Employees are continually expected to do more with less and this has a substantial impact on work/life balance.   It's not uncommon to work through evenings, weekends, and even scheduled vacations.   The benefits offering is also sub-par due to recent changes."

Competitiveness within the marketplace -  Union is able to price their products to be competitive as well as conservative to attract the best customers","Like many large organizations, Union Bank is highly structured. Decisions are hard to come by some of the time. It would be more efficient to delegate more authority to line units. 

While the ownership is substantial it sometimes feels disconnected. I have worked for another foreign owned institution and noticed the same element."
955,,Great company,2014-10-16,4.0,Teller,Management was nice and when you put in time you get to set your own schedule. Picked up shifts from other people.,Sometimes they asked too much of us. Can only do so much in 4 hours.

Products are very customer driven and the team prides itself on making recommendations based on the clients best interest first.,Came to UB because of a promise of advancement and found that they were all lies. Benefits are horrible. Tell you what you want to hear with no follow through. Becoming a good old boys club. If you are not in the club you get no love.  Horrible home loan process.

A lot of upside as they seek to grow and expand across the country
IT was great: I don't know if I was just lucky to not face a lot of IT issues, but the few I had were resolved quickly and efficiently.","The expansion seems like it is moving along a little slowly.

966,,"Zero leadership, DIY approach to everything, committed to mediocrity",2014-09-21,3.0,Director,I work with tremendously nice people and have found it to be common thread throughout the bank. Compensation is decent.  Training is so-so but it is encouraged wherever you can get it.,"Nothing works like it should in this organization.  Just getting small tasks done -- such as ordering supplies or a computer or whatever -- is a royal pain because of the 1990's platforms and applications in place.  Corporate Directory isn't even correct, so you can't find people when you need help.  Japanese culture rotates CEO every three years or so and as a result, the CEO's emphasis is on making Tokyo happy rather than building a great culture, listening to employees, or truly improving the organization beyond making it more profitable.  The Retail arm is run by a bunch of monkeys with more ego than intelligence, so it's little wonder the retail biz is floundering.  Every department is its own silo because leadership at the highest levels doesn't know how to look at the big picture.  It's a joke to think that this bank will ever be in the Top Ten (which is its aspiration).  It can't get out of its own way.  It does an employee survey every year but hides the majority of the results from the employees because employees always lambaste management -- and then the bank states the same goals every year in ""response"" to the survey results.  In other words, it pretends to care what employees are saying but in fact, it does not care at all.  Actually, it doesn't know how to change."
967,,Tons of change - good and bad,2014-09-13,3.0,Anonymous Employee,"For the past 4 or so years, UB has been going through tons of change with the goal to grow to a top 10 US bank
- Updating outdated policies and instilling aggressive revenue/growth goals
- Lots of new blood challenging status quo
- Good opportunity to grow quickly if you position yourself in a good spot
- Bank is financially secure with tons of hiring and capital injection from Japan","Still a long way to go
- technology is decades behind
- business processes and basic business management is lacking, especially in Commercial Bank
- with growth comes significantly greater influence from Japanese parents, losing autonomy"

Had a nice benefit package with 401k, medical, dental, vision and some employees have opportunity for pension benefits depending on date of hire.",Archaic systems that make providing best in class service a real challenge. Tenured employees who are resistant to change slow down actual growth and create an environment where rewards are determined by politics instead of performance and merits.
969,,gender discrimination,2014-09-07,1.0,Senior Vice President,The only good thing about this bank is the location. It is in the financial district and close to public transportation. However the office decor is quite dated and old.,Gender discrimination and salary gaps between women and men are atrocious!

There is a good internal career site that is updated frequently and a published list of bankwide guidelines that help create a common basis for performance reviews.","Although there is currently many career growth opportunities within the company, company policy limits how much your salary can increase per pay grade preventing internal candidates to fully realize the market rates for their skill sets.  This creates frictional unemployment and causes an outflow of talented people.  Also, 401(k) matching could greater to be on par with other financial institutions."

There is no work/life balance whatsoever. Senior management does not care about retaining employees (and has publicly voiced this). Employees are regarded as ""labor"" and worked to the bone until they eventually resign. This plays into senior management's favor as their idea of saving money is through attrition. Managers are shown no respect by senior management as their micro-management style by-passes them completely."

Unlike other top retail banks, Union Bank gives opportunities to their own qualified employee's first before anyone else. Things like community involvement, philanthropy, and volunteering is required for every employee who works of the bank. In addition, the networking atmosphere and the company's intranet is what differentiates this bank amongst the other competitors.","One drawback about Union Bank is that it doesn't formally train their employee's for any sort of certifications. Six Sigma, Financial series, and NMLS certified are the only licenses/certifications I can think that the bank offers/reimburses. Things like getting you Project Management License, technical computer licenses, or any formal training is not offered off the top of my head."

987,,SRB,2014-07-16,1.0,SRB,10 minutes to get to work,"This bank is a complete joke. The business model is based on cold-calling/canvassing hoping for a miracle that someone will actually do  business with us. Ironically even if we win their business and they apply for a loan, there is a  great chance it will be declined for the most stupid reasons:  credit report shows late payment on a gas card 3 years ago OR not having enough income (even tho they have $500k deposit and the loan is only $200k), Incidently, declined borrowers have no problem getting loans elsewhere with better rates/fees. Even employees get their loans from other banks because they get better deal. 

There seems to be an endless amount of new forms to complete for tracking sales.  Not to mention endless conference calls to discuss sales and best practices where the SRBs just bs everything. I worked for other banks and i don't recall one conference call.  When someone makes a credit card sale, it's celebrated and emailed to all the bankers. Ironically, for a bank that's been around for 150 years, it doesn't have it's own credit card department. 

The products are inferior to other banks' products.  The company is delusional about the bank being the best.  Why would someone open a checking account with union bank with same fees/requirements like Wells/chase/BofA when our locations are very limited, almost non-existent compared to the real banks?  Nobody cares about the stupid slogan, ""doing right, it's just good business"" . 

The technology is inferior and non-intuitive.  It seems like the company grabbed a bunch of high school students to develop it with no insight of how banking works. When WAMU left the banking world, union bank should've bought their technology. The turnover for SRBS is very high but they don't care.  We're all expendable. 

Marketing team. What marketing team??? Where are the tv commercials so people will recognize us?? We have radio ads that are ineffective.  The marketing team are branch employees going around businesses like Jehovah's Witnesses. And like Jehovah's Witnesses,  we are annoying. 

Upper management will use their level to intimidate (by using mind games) the folks below them.  Someday this pretend bank will be out of business."

Another major drawback of the group is a lack of accountability and clear responsibilities among senior and junior employees. Senior employees regularly throw junior employees under the bus. Senior employees also expect to take credit for junior employees projects. From what I found whatever a ranking Senior said goes, so if they do not like you, you will be gone.

Top management and Federal regulators tried to convince employees that this was a perfect match when nothing could have been further from the truth.

Management implied that they were going to take care of the employees and look at all the systems to see which were better.  Their systems were surprisingly out dated, slow and cumbersome and yet the ""better"" systems were shut down and a majority of the employees lost their jobs or left.

As a former employee of the ""acquired"" bank, I've never felt so disrespected or shown such a lack of trust by an employer, even after the finger printing and extensive background checks.  The processes and procedures put in place reinforced their lack of trust and made it difficult to service the customers.  Customers were practically running out the door when ""service"" started meaning getting products shoved down their throats whether they needed it or not.

The arrogance and condescension shown by the ""new"" management was appalling.  It's no wonder that you can drive by any branch and see empty lobbies."
