0,,Great Job,2022-04-14,5.0,Business Analyst,"Culture, benefits, work-life balance and plenty of opportunity to grow.","Pay could be more, but you won’t get better training anywhere else."
1,,Mortgage Underwriter,2022-04-13,3.0,Mortgage Underwriter,Helped me understand the mortgage world.,Fast growing company doesnt slow down.
2,,A job here would be the biggest mistake in your career,2022-04-13,1.0,Mortgage Underwriter,The people you meet can be great.,"Even as I post this, I know in time there will be some phony response from UWM saying “it’s not their culture” or “I hope you found a better fit.” Seriously, look at the other reviews and how many times they’ve said that. It’s a generic, robotic, kool aid drinking answer trying to make all these unhappy current or former employees seem like we’re off our rockers for saying this place is a cult. I have never in my life worked at a place where the culture was as toxic and degrading as it is here. There are so many negatives to working here that I won’t list but you can go on any one of the thousands of reviews that will tell you all the horrible things that happen here. I don’t believe it was always like this. I think once upon a time, this was an amazing company. But they got greedy and turned into a corporate succubus. Leadership have no idea how to be leaders and worse, they don’t care. If you need to work here to get a foot in the mortgage industry, please remember you don’t have to stay here forever. Get the experience and get out. There are places that will take you. I promise you no matter what response is given to this review, it will be complete and utter bull. I PROMISE you."
3,,Great for College Students,2022-04-13,3.0,Instructional Designer II,Lots of opportunities to learn and upskill,low pay for my role
4,,"Ok, if you need the Money and you are skilled",2022-04-13,2.0,Senior Underwriter,"financial gain, growth, constant training",does not care about employees personally.
5,,Low Pay/Micromanage/Favoritism,2022-04-13,1.0,Instructional Technologist,-Initial Mortgage Training was valuable,"- Constant micromanagement 
- Cannot retain employees 
- Below market salary 
- Advertise “family” environment - employees
 treated poorly/team leads have favorites 
- Cult like atmosphere"
6,,Horrible place to work despite their propaganda,2022-04-12,1.0,Senior Underwriter,"Pretty much nothing besides the fact that they will train you to underwrite with no background in finance.
Work anywhere else but here. It is horrible.","Everything.
In training they made you drink the juice / they even said “don’t read glass door reviews as they’re not an actual reflection of our company” …..the reviews on this website are far more authentic and accurate than anyone in upper level management at UWM will ever be. Everything you read is very very true.
Work life balance is terrible - they false advertise “flexible hours”, completely untrue - if you clock out one minute too early, you will be on a report.
Leadership never recognizes hard work, they only micromanage and take every opportunity to berate you under the guise of “continuous improvement” 
There is absolutely no work life balance as they refuse to offer the option for people to work from home under any circumstance.
People are not their greatest asset, I have been harassed sexually and verbally by brokers on the phone just to be told by management that these are “just stories and they have no proof of clients being nasty towards employees” - even though they listen to every single phone call placed. They turn a blind eye in order to continue to exploit their employees and take advantage of their production.
They treat women as less than 
They advertise no dress code, there is a strict dress code however it changes based on who your leader is making it very confusing and hard to conform to 
No empathy or compassion for team members
Publicly save face by saying “we don’t lay Off employees” yet they exercise their free will and have fired over 1,000 people - chalking it up to natural attrition…right."
7,,Great Company,2022-04-12,3.0,Account Representative,"Great Culture, nice building, good food, nice people, great opportunity, great training","Very long days, working after hours"
8,,It’s a Job,2022-04-12,3.0,Appraisal Support Specialist,The people here are incredible and your direct management is some of the best I’ve ever worked with. They really care about you and your success.,"The company over all does not care about you. They’ll tell you we’re a family, but then lowball and take advantage of your ambition. I had received a raise in a position and as soon as I transferred out for a special position they took that away and paid me less than I was making before for a higher level, higher stress, and higher responsibility position. If you are applying here be prepared to negotiate for a higher pay because they will offer you as little as possible."
9,,Absolute Trash,2022-04-11,1.0,Underwriter,A lot of people work there,"Management
Treating employees like children
Micro-Micro management
Recruiters over selling"
10,,Not for everyone,2022-04-11,2.0,Underwriter,Meeting plenty of people and making connections.,"Heavy workload, little work life balance, salary pales in comparison to other underwriting positions"
11,,Dont believe the hype,2022-04-11,2.0,Mortgage Underwriter,good work environment to be at,"too many to list, the pay is so far below industry average its almost laughable. you cannot speak up abouy anything you dislike without being ostracized. UWM likes to make it seem like its all sunshine and rainbows but in reality it essentially a cult run by idiots. they shoot the messenger without listening to the message"
12,,Underwriter for loans,2022-04-11,2.0,Underwriter,Good group I worked with,Poor leadership on multiple levels
13,,Great if you missed highschool,2022-04-10,2.0,Post Closing Specialist,"The only good thing about this place is the benefits (insurance, 401k,etc)and that you can work a Monday-Friday 9-6pm shift.","You are constantly micromanaged and treated like a child. They do whatever they can to be degrading, they “score” your phone calls and talk to you like you are a child incapable of having a simple conversation continuously if you mess up their script on even 1 out of 10-20 calls. (Literally you get graded like 80%-100%) they send you “Lq’s” which are your errors and you lose your bonus if you get them( they find the smallest stupidest things to error you on so you lose your bonus..) the team leads are people who have NEVER been managers or leaders and they act like they are so much better than you. The trainers act like they are highschool teachers and literally purposely try to call out and embarrass people during “class”. The only way you will move up to a lead position or out of operations is if you suck up and make as many friends as you can cause they don’t care about your production… just who you know and how well you can fake it. You will be reminded DAILY about how easy it would be for them to fire you and you will witness multiple people get fired for ridiculous reasons (aka having an opinion). They say firm 40 hours but back when we were busy we had mandatory overtime.. and you technically have to be there 9 hours a day because you HAVE to take an hour lunch but can’t wiggle your schedule around AT ALL. And don’t even think about going outside to get fresh air even for a quick 5-10 minutes while clocked in (even though there are no windows and your sitting inside a giant box all day) because the VP will “personally walk you out” if you are caught outside. Don’t think about getting sick or getting Covid cause you will be FORCED to use all your PTO while sick and then if you have any “unexcused unpaid time” you will get fired…. UWM can be summed up as one thing… highschool on steroids. Be surprised if you make it past a year."
14,,Not all it's cracked up to be,2022-04-09,2.0,Underwriter II,"I don't have many pros, the benefits were alright.","No work life balance, no support system, high expectations, high stress."
15,,Terrible company,2022-04-09,1.0,Underwriter,Some of my co-workers were really cool and helpful.,"Just about everything. HEAVILY micromanaged, quotas were unrealistic, training didn’t prepare you for the floor, pay was ridiculously low for the amount of work to be done, brokers treat you like their personal slave, a put up and shut up mentality.. the list goes on. They say that their “people” are their greatest asset, but this couldn’t be further from the truth. Only thing this company cares about is how many files can be done, at whatever the expense that is to their workers. They don’t care about you."
16,,Good,2022-04-08,4.0,Mortgage Underwriter,People and that’s about it,"Culture, hours and other things"
17,,Don't do it,2022-04-08,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"Paycheck is timely, that's it","They try to pull you in with the idea of the company being fun and laid back but the reality is much different. You will not have time to make use of most of their perks because you'll be busy suffering verbal abuse at the hands of clients and they provide no support to you when this occurs. The focus is one a lie of ""elite client service"" The benefits aren't that good and if you ask you will never receive a legitimate answer for why work from home isn't allowed. Really they're embarrassed they bought multiple buildings that they would not have use for"
18,,Low pay,2022-04-07,1.0,Mortgage Underwriter,Nice environment everyone was nice,"Pay was just bad, not enough to provide for my family"
19,,A Good Intro into the Corporate Work Horse,2022-04-07,3.0,Post Closing,"Hired little/no experience, training was comprehensive and extensive, medical benefits were great","Long days, very low pay, ""we are family"" mentality that feels manipulative."

24,,If you value your mental and physical health APPLY SOMEWHERE ELSE,2022-04-05,2.0,Operations Specialist II,"During my time at UWM, I had the opportunity to meet some fantastic people, but that is about it in terms of the benefits of working there.","Between the cult-like attitude that every team member must possess in order to thrive and the absence of work-life balance, I've never worked in a more toxic environment. Day in and day out, I witnessed how my coworkers felt compelled to abuse drugs, alcohol, and other substances in order to get through the long days. Please reconsider submitting your application if you are not a cisgender white male. Sure, the corporation promotes a ""family"" atmosphere, but if you don't quickly fall into line you'll be forced to quit due to burnout or be fired. At the time of writing, there is still no covid policy in place, so team members must either use up all of their PTO or report to the open office sick."
25,,UWM offers everything but trust,2022-04-05,1.0,Senior Software Engineer,"Great campus, amazing people and free pop.  Unlimited potential that is all lost because of the cons.","No trust.  Rules for everything.  You punch a timeclock in IT and have to be in the office every single day even if it's a blizzard and you could get everything done at home just fine.

Very little gets done because of all the rules and managers, tech debt just lingers and about the only way to get fired is to not have 40+hours punched on your timecard."
26,,Review,2022-04-04,3.0,Senior Underwriting Team Lead,"Great learning experience
They are willing to poor a lot of development resources into leaders",I was easily working 90 hour weeks as a salaried employee making below average pay.
27,,"Very stressful and competitive, with very bad micromanaging and grade-school atmosphere",2022-04-03,2.0,Operations Specialist II,"On-site amenities and benefits are cool, but ultimately unnecessary. The PTO is great but you are lectured for using it.","Management and team leads are extremely disorganized and disconnected. The expectations are unrealistic and they set you up for failure, almost in effort to create perpetual turnover so nobody catches onto their tactics. This place is VERY Kool-Aid feeding. The environment is very strict and uptight, and you will be let go for any negativity including just saying you are having a bad day. The pay for entry level was increased to $15/hr but the higher tiers were not increased to match that, so you wont get a pay raise taking a promotion and entering at a higher position leaves you making the same as people below you."
28,,you'll get experience,2022-04-01,1.0,Identity Access Management,you get experience you may not have had a chnace to get at another company because they really will just hire almost anyone,you're not paid fairly and that sucks
29,,Work,2022-03-31,3.0,Underwriter,The hours are good for work life balance,The amount of work needed to be able to make a decent bonus is not worth it

33,,It is Amazing!,2022-03-30,5.0,Sales Executive,"With all the ups and downs with economy, UWM has continued to do great. We received a 10% raise last year for everyone and this year was good too.","Work flexibility was an issue, but they did great things recently to help with that."
34,,Everything it used to be - it is no longer,2022-03-30,1.0,Mortgage Underwriter,In the past the underwriting training was top notch. When it was super busy the pay was way over the top to be working for 90+ hours a week. Those that put in the work got paid a lot of money.,"If you read nothing else in this post - know this. They will follow up on their non compete agreements, if you work there for a few months, hate it and decide to leave, UWM will send you a cease and desist if you work anywhere else in Metro Detroit. 

After 2019 the leadership shifts created a nameless employee is just a number environment. The culture was dead and the pay lessened, the best talent both in Ops and in leadership started to leave and the people left (outside a few cases) were undertrained and overworked.
As a senior underwriter you will work unpaid hours, you will have earned bonus taken away, and you will be in a toxic relationship with all the brokers.
The company is client first - which is a great way to run a business for a short while, but at some point will bring it to it's knees since the employees/team members are bound to either snap or find better and frankly better paying, work. 

The company has received countless investigations from Oakland Counties Health Department for Covid-19 related violations. During the pandemic, leaderships (Ishbia) desire to have people in office made the company a super spreader complex and this was downplayed and lied about by leadership.
Not only was there no tracking or clarity in place for when someone on a team got covid - when it was found out, the immediate team leads were being directed not to tell anyone as to not cause a panic. 

From an ethical and from a work life balance standpoint. There's much better jobs out there. If given the option between leaving the mortgage industry after 8 years and starting fresh in another, or going back to Shore, I'd choose a new industry. 

If you're reading this - apply to a different company."
35,,Great for some not for all,2022-03-30,3.0,Account Executive,Comradery. Some of the top management are phenomenal people. Learned a lot but 1/2 is UWM specific. Great place to work if you didn't go to college or don't have other prospects.,"Management uses psychological warfare to feed on the weak and build the strong / the people they want on their team.
You are constantly subjected to possibly being called on for a live objection test in front 1000 people. Some people love this, most do not.
Way way way too many distractions, none of which is about supporting the customer. Filled with amateurs that are in control of your schedule and todo lists. You have all these people who've never worked in a corporate setting and don't know how to properly schedule meetings in control of your day. A lot of people are told to hang up on a customer so they can call into an unscheduled meeting or activity. Mandated to spam each other to add excitement to the team. You have to post to LinkedIn, but the only people liking the posts are UWM employees. Everyone is constantly sending mass emails internally. It's a giant waste of time and not about serving the customer.
They talk about work life balance but it is not really there. We were encouraged to come in 2 hours early, stay late and work on weekends."

48,,Undewriter,2022-03-21,5.0,Underwriter,"It is a grind do not get this confused for an easy job but a lot of the people that work there are super nice and some of the most helpful people in the world, you also make a genuine bond with your POD and the people around you. UWM does a good job at listening to its people but its also does require hard work and persistence.",Being able to work remotely would be nice for the people that have a long drive but they are now adding time incentive bonuses for long time workers so if you've been there for a 6 months and above and you have been doing good you get the possibility to choose a shift.

I was the most senior person on my team with one year experience 
Direction changed weekly. In my time there I don’t think I ever actually finished anything. I would halfway through something and then the direction would shift and I would start something new.

From what I could tell in my very short time there, everyone with experience and knowledge was jumping ship and most teams were filled with entry level employees with little to no experience.

The company is a joke. The pay  is very low,   with extreme micromanaging and unrealistic commitments. They have created teams  to listen and watch your every move. There is no open door policy.  If you have issues in your daily work life, dont bother to bring to management. They will use everything  and anything you say against you. Especially, if it's against their proceedures and lame policies.  They hire college graduates with no  work experience to sell their illusion too. Anyone with any work experience, catch on quickly to the lies and horrible ethics and leave the company. They promote from within, to keep from paying  decent wages for experienced management. This way they can also continue  spreading  their cult like agenda. Anyone that is experienced in the mortgage industry,  have left this company.  They are constantly hiring because  there is constant turn over. Dont give up your current  job for this company. You will regret it everyday.  Mat Ishbia  is always stating we are family.  I would divorce  my family,   if I was treated the way UWM treats its so called family.  Dont believe  the firm 40. Noone works a firm 40. It's an out and out lie. Nepotism and favoritism is no joke here. You better hope your one of  the chosen people. UWM's  covid practices  were a huge joke. They  only enforced  practices,  once Oakland County stepped in and  fined them from all the complaints  received by employees. Anyone who spoke up  apposing their practices,  were let go for one reason or another.   I bought into Mat Ishbia  being a great guy, until he revealed  his true  self.

- The building is gross people constantly get sick there.
- They don't care about you, they are all for PR

I started working at UWM in 2016 when it was fairly a great company but then once they relocated to Pontiac it all went down hill. I left last year for a company that paid me $10 more an hour than UWM was paying me. I was a leader at UWM for a while and it was not worth it. The promotion I got was barely a raise in pay and when I went to the SVP of ops (at the time) about the pay she told me ""It's not about the money"" it was easy for her to say because her husband is the CEO/President of a Mortgage brokerage so she is well taken care of."
113,,Decent place to get into mortgage industry,2022-02-15,2.0,Underwriter,Trains you to get a better job somewhere else. 40 hour weeks. 4 day work weeks after 18 months,Micro managing & corporate propaganda in your face all day. No work from home.
114,,Outlook has changed.,2022-02-15,1.0,Senior Underwriter,"-UWM will train you where other companies will not. The experience is valuable
-You can work your way up, or laterally move.
-Flex 30
-Merit pay increase opportunities
-Relatively stable employment (like you won't be let go due to economic downturns)
-Medical Insurance","-Transferring to another team/department can be difficult. Errors from months ago or high use of PTO will hinder career path.
-Low pay. Minimum wage in UWM is $15/hour, but this cannot support a family. This pay is also not worth the high production. When I talked to a Splitting Team Member last year, they were paid $11-12/hour and had to do 60+ loans per day. VVOE had do 27+loans per day (last year). I'm sure production requirement has increased since then.
-There is a disconnect between what the company thinks we can do versus reality. Underwriting team specifically, the old production structure was minimum 5 underwrites per day (Senior), or 11 conditions per day (UWII), but now production is based on tenure. I think this does not encourage people to stay long term. The higher production requirement does not increase pay. The minimum is 6 underwrites per day (Senior), or 14 conditions (UWII). This number increases the longer you're in the position. The average files are bigger and more complex compared to 2 years ago. UWM encourages faster turn times for less touches (larger uploads). This is fine, but the production never went down to compensate for larger loans. Underwrites can take 1-2 hours to complete. Conditions usually take an hour to complete. Higher Underwrites also mean more Senior queues. They can take 5 min to 1 hour and do not contribute to production points. This is also on top of Client services. This is a big source of stress for me.
-There is a lot client service to do, and they interrupt production. We must send 2 video emails per day. We must answer all calls, or if away from the desk, the phone must be forwarded. We have client requests. UWII's must check on Closing underwriting requests which have 15 min turn times."

- Full benefits. Lots of choices/options.

- The company culture tries to foster a positive environment.

- The campus has a lot of amenities.

- Paid training.

- Flexible with your home life and when it may clash with work (or at least in my case)

- Security. As of now the CEO advised he will not lay people off and upheld that throughout COVID as well. Even hired people during that time.

UWM really is a great place to work. Like ANY job there will be issues or grumbles or complaints. I'll go over some of those in the cons. However, I do feel that a majority of the company is great. You are not stuck in the position you hired into, it's rather easy to promote and grow if you work hard. It's the #1 wholesale lender, which comes with it's perks too. It has a very tight knit culture and wonderful people to work with. The CEO Mat Ish is a personable guy, and I have met him in person a couple times, as he walks around checking shaking people's hands and asking how they're doing.","- Pay is lower than competitors.

- Currently no plans to work from home or do a hybrid style.

- No paid time off when you get COVID. Or a separate sick time bank. Everything is taken from your paid time off.

- No union. You are an at will employee and you can (many do) get fired for miniscule things.

Now for the cons. As I said before, every company has negative aspects to it. There will be times when employees are let go or fired and are very bitter about it. Sometimes it's justified. The slight downside to UWM is while they foster positivity they've also let people go for being negative or voicing their opinion that may be against the company. If they find out you're leaving, they will 'let you go' before you can use the rest of your PTO. This causes employees to wait till the last minute and give little to no notice when quitting. As also stated above, the pay is decent but compared to what others get in the industry it's below standard. The CEO justifies it since he will not lay anyone off and there is so many amenities on campus. Now I've never worked from home and I'm only used to working at a buildings, but the CEO stated he doesn't plan on working from home or creating a hybrid schedule. This makes A LOT of people upset because EVERYTHING can be done from home easily. During winter season it's difficult for those during bad weather with kids or when pandemics occur."

That said, a lot went into my decision to leave the company, but I'll focus on the lack of COVID responsibility and losing work from home flexibility. 

One of the larger reasons being the return to work, despite sporadic spikes in COVID cases since returning to the office in mid-July. This showed a significant lack of compassion/caring about our Team Members despite many catching it from being in the office due to the lack of efforts by the company to make this a safe environment (i.e. keeping the plastic barriers, keeping meeting rooms closed, requiring masks, removing work from home opportunities flexibility, etc). This seemed very nearsighted and a disregard to Pillar 1. I felt my mental health taking a hit, constantly being stressed and anxious about being in the office potentially leading to getting COVID and limiting my ability to take part in the things outside of work with friends and family that may not handle it as well as I could if I were to spread it (in my mind, a disregard to ""We have work-life balance""). 

The loss of work from flexibility was a big hit as well. Within the IT realm, working remotely has been a huge opportunity and almost a standard for companies across the board. For UWM to allow that flexibility during the times only when they were mandated to do so made it feel like a very disingenuous gesture. When it was removed entirely (during business hours), it caused an increase in great people leaving due to changes in their personal lives that required more flexibility that UWM didn't want to offer. This makes me nervous for the future of the IT team and the company as a whole. This is a severe lack of foresight and adjusting to the changing landscape of the world becoming increasingly smaller. UWM is limiting its available talent pool and bleeding really, really good talent for seemingly petty reasons. 

Those are certainly the main reasons I started looking for new opportunities, but even as of recent I learned of things that leadership has done dealing with Team Members that are either looking or leaving. Letting people go just for looking for a new opportunity has potential impact on their financial well-being and shows a lack of appreciation for the effort those Team Members showed while working here no matter their reason for looking. On top of that, refuting planned PTO after a Team Member puts in their two weeks is a quick way to turn a happy employee that was approached with an incredible opportunity to a disgruntled employee. 

All in all, may sound harsh, but my faith in the company truly being family-oriented and employee-centered has quickly faded over the last 6+ months and quickly became something I no longer wanted be a part of."

 - Expected to answer the phone anytime it rings. We would also have to make sure we hit all of the customer service points (for example, asking the broker if there is anything else we can do for them and asking about their day). If we don’t say any of this, we will be marked down on our call score. This gives me major call center vibes. I was an underwriter…not a customer service rep. Oh and don’t ever miss a phone call or you will be yelled at if you do. I literally couldn’t use the bathroom without having to forward my phone to someone. 

 - We we’re scored on EVERYTHING!! Call scores, client satisfaction with client requests, Loan quality, etc…

 - Had to respond to client requests in a given time frame. These requests are timed and they just add to my anxiety. We were expected to drop everything (even if you are working in a file) and respond to these requests. This lead me to get errors while underwriting some files.

Raises are once a year based on performance only. Nothing based on tenure. As well as extremely secretive and inconsistent. Outside hires will make more than internals. As a lead your ability to make money is dependent on if you can sell the company well enough to those under you. Survey results if someone was not happy with the company would negatively reflect on you personally which would impact bonus and “scoring”. The company did not listen to ideas or concerns despite telling everyone to “challenge the why”. Cheating to hit commitment (and therefore bonus) was rampant and not disciplined. If you spoke up about cheating you would be forced out by harassment and retaliation. Claims to have zero tolerance policy on harassment but then also stated that the culture is to give everyone a chance. Senior leadership is completely tone deaf and constantly pushes that we must be grateful for every tiny thing we are provided. Most of the “perks” listed can not be used by those in production roles. Preaches a work / life balance but sells shirts that say “never relax”. Instructed by the ceo to fire anyone that could be perceived as negative because retention rates only calculate those that quit (not fired). No work from home because we’re “better together” yet 2020 was a hugely successful year when people were working from home. Official COVID precautions are that it’s up to each person individually and will not put anything more than the bare minimum in place to protect employees. If you have to be off work for COVID they will use all pto. Once you’re out of pto you can’t take any days off (for any reason that won’t require a doctors note) and will then harm ability to apply to any other position per instruction to not suggest anyone with 0 pto. Opportunities for advancement are few and far between.

They want you to drink the koolaid and if you question anything, then you are not apart of their “family” and you will be ostracized or even fired. It is very much cult like. Whatever you do, make UWM be your last choice when finding a new job. Or if you are like me where I just needed a job until I found a better one, play your part and try to make money until you find something better.

Pretty solid training to take anywhere else.","Literally run, this place does not care about their employees. 

Paid lowest in the industry.

Commitment based, and if you don't hit commitment just do yourself the favor and quit. Literally spent WEEEKS about telling everyone about some great news we will love. All they did was INCREASE an already difficult commitment and made it harder to bonus for most departments. 

Two buildings didn't have running water for a day. Did not send anyone home and expected them to travel to another building all day to go to the bathroom. They only gave us 20 minutes which was not enough time for the travel involved. If you took too long they clocked you out. Next day they had ""running"" water, but for 3 days that wasn't SAFE TO DRINK. They provided a laughable amount of water bottles for the staff. Not enough for 4 teams of people let alone a whole building that staffs hundreds of employees.

No work from home options, literally are told to go to another company if you want to work from home. 

After the holidays when everyone was back from work, whole teams (10-15 ppl) were completely out of the office with covid, and every day more and more people went home b/c they got covid from the people around them. Nothing was done to care for the employees for safety- just expected to not take breaks and to skip lunches because we are so short staffed calls are coming in a minute apart. 

 Company expects you to use YOUR PERSONAL PTO days if you are sick with coivd. If you are out of PTO days, you don't get paid while you are out sick and no work from home option.

I could go on, but I don't have enough time in the day to explain how poorly they treat their staff. But if I have anything to finish off with its: 

NEVER EVER take a drink or leave one unsupervised from/around an AE or a higher up for your own safety."

- Brokers can be rude and disrespectful to you but you must kiss their hinds. And nothing is done about how poorly employees are treated by broker as long as the brokers are making UWM money. UWM is NOT a family, its a SWEATSHOP for loans.

- Ever since the company went public, everything has gone downhill for employees... oh and the stocks are in the trash.

- Promotions are nice when they happen but lately many people have not been promoted due to the over hiring of this position and other positions due to UWM always trying to compete with Quicken loans. 

-We were notified that in order to bonus from now on that we have to do more work for less pay. And not even 48 hours later the CEO Mat decided to pay every MSU male basketball and football player.... EVEN THOUGH THE FOOTBALL TEAM IS SPONSORED BY Quicken Loans. (yet we're a family at UWM)

-If you get COVID, they do not give you COVID PTO anymore and they stopped ALL COVID safety procedures... we can also no longer work at home due to COVID.

They constantly hunt people for punching in and there is zero flexibility in the schedule. PTO is very poor; limited holidays available. You'll even work major holidays. Everything that you read about how horrifying they were and are with COVID is TRUE! They have never cared. People were getting sick with COVID and they would not disclose who/what/when or anything. There was zero contact tracing. All the information and cases were hidden and they were more concerned of having people back in the office. Many people got very sick at UWM, MANY... For a very long time they were not even taking temperatures at all and they would allow people to come back without a doctor's note. After direct exposure KNOWN by everyone they still let everyone that was exposed come to work. This place is very dangerous to the physical and mental health in many ways.

- Heavily underpaid for the industry ($19-$20/hr for an UWII)
- Lack of bonus potential following changes in the bonus structure presented as “exciting news”
- Constant distractions and pointless meetings to limit production
- Have I said micromanaging yet? IT has access to Microsoft Teams and your phone calls are being listened to and “scored.”

197,,"Great Spot to Learn the Job, TERRIBLE COVID Response",2021-12-24,3.0,Senior Underwriter,"Great training, provides an opportunity to learn the job without experience - which is rare for a lot of companies. Lots of room for growth.

The culture is very modern and there are a lot of perks (including flex 30 and 4 day work weeks after 18 months).","Multiple team members have died from COVID and the company has no regard for COVID response unless it's government regulated. While many of us are more than capable of working from home without any decrease in productivity, we are forced to come into the office because our CEO ""doesn't like us working remotely."" I have had multiple instances where I have been exposed to COVID-positive team members and have never been informed by the company - only by the people who contracted COVID. People are coming into work COVID-positive because they have run out of PTO and they cannot afford to not work for two weeks. 

Which brings me to my next point - low pay and high expectations. Underwriters are paid well below the industry standard, and the position has turned into more of a customer service role than a compliance role. The low base rate was acceptable at a point when the bonus structure was attainable, but they decided to restructure it to the point where the best, most seasoned underwriters were losing tens of thousands of dollars per year - all while the CEO was working out a deal to pay for the stipends for MSU athletes and bragging how this year was the ""best year in company history."" It was a complete slap in the face. 

Our job is overly analyzed to the point where we are getting emails from our leaders if our number of outbound calls does not match our production numbers or if we ever miss a phone call. While leadership is very adamant on handling situations where brokers are disrespectful, it shouldn't be a problem we should deal with to begin with."

The training is not the best but not the worst, you have a basic idea of what to do but when you hit the floor it will take you another 3 months or so to actually be good at the job.

It’s a steady job with decent benefits. If you’re coming from something like fast food or landscaping, UWM is an ideal stepping stone to something better.","Focusing on only the parts I feel most qualified to address:

1. I have significant depression and anxiety issues. If you have mental health issues, I’d strongly encourage you to seek employment elsewhere. Furthermore, if you’re in introvert, you might consider UWM to be an absolute nightmare.

2.  UWM does not allow work from home. They hide behind this comically out of touch “we’re better together” policy. Amongst the employees, even the ones that love it there, everyone assumes the real reason they don’t allow work from home is that they are dumping all this money into a sprawling complex and they want to feel like they are getting their money’s worth.

3. UWM is really big on discussing work/life balance. It’s critical to understand that this does not apply to the IT department - at least not in the Enterprise Technology department. Long hours, nights, and weekend work are all expected of you, despite management constantly telling you it’s not. I lost count of the amount of people who were expected to work while they were sick with Covid. Oh yeah I guess I was wrong. They will let you work from home, but only if you have Covid. 

4. When I first started, numerous people gave me the heads up that someone in my management chain was highly prone to knee jerk reactions and unprofessional behavior when stressed which is frequently. What struck me was, the people telling me this were not all on my team. The individual in question has so cemented their reputation for unprofessionalism, that even people who don’t work for them knew about it and felt compelled to warn me. 

5. At the end of 2020, on an all IT meeting, a VERY high level person in the IT management structure gleefully admitted that they are aware that “we move recklessly fast.” Does that really sound like the kind of organization you want to work for?

6. This is true of any organization but is particularly salient with UWM. I urge you to remember that HR is not there for your benefit or protection. They are there to protect the company.  

There’s more too. Please be sure to do your research before taking a job there. As I said, you could do far worse than UWM. But it’s absolutely a “to good to be true” situation unless you have a very “Type-A” and “Yes men” personality. 

I’ll end with this. I had such a bad experience there that I’m choosing to pursue a new discipline in IT. After 10 years of doing what I do, UWM has tainted it beyond repair."

240,,Maybe - If you need a foot in the door for the industry,2021-11-22,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"get knowledge easily as they first few months as an underwriter are just training (though a lot of the training was done quite poorly, had incorrect information, or couldn't back/thoroughly explain information when questioned)","Training really isn't good...you tout #1 training team, but reading what the award is for tells a different story (it's for most amount of time set aside for training, which makes sense when they hire thousands to train for 2-3 months). The actual trainers and produced information was awful - had to help teach people around me many things (even though this was all new to me too).

they tell you only underwriting positions are open and take away the original options you apply for to force you down that road after telling you it is easy to transfer after a couple months. That was a bold face lie on both accounts, the positions remained open (and still are) and the minimum time for transfers are 6-9 months (with 6 months of no errors at all...which is not very realistic).

Some teams get to enjoy/experience the ""culture"", others wonder what it really is besides just being in a cult. Mixed messages from upper management and Mat all the time. Changes to commitment and bonuses. Covert things meant to make tenured people pulling in a lot of money leave because this company cares more about money (aka Mat cares more about money) than anything else.

Again with culture...it is used to obfuscate the fact that every role in the company is underpaid in the industry/role by a ton. Brokers are mostly jerks (can't use ""bad language"" here) because most are narcissistic, better than thou, types because ""I pull in big bucks"". Most tend to try to illegally skate people through approvals by hiding information (think 2009 housing crash, these types were the reasons). Management and top level people all make you feel like a POS if you don't just sit there and take it but does nothing to the broker/broker shop harassing people. Had to watch several coworkers sit there and cry because of brokers...and management tell them to buck up and move on, ""it's just words"" (that constantly happen).

Forced increases to commitments put into place late this year. Already super difficult to hit normal commitments when there are never enough loans (sorry, 90% of the time there are not enough) to even remotely come close to the old requirements. Told firm 40 over and over, but then berated right after about having to stay and hit commitment, and if you don't hit you get written up. Forced overtime, without pay for a lot of people, that counts against you because your commitment increases because you are there for longer (no joke).

Required to have UNDER 4% error margin (human error alone is 10% or something isn't it...?) or your whole bonus is forfeit and you are always automatically put on a PIP. THey have many other ways to keep you from getting paid the money you earned, but they are more worried about you pushing out loans and forcing speed over quality anyways that the use these tactics to force you to stay at low earnings.

thousands of people have left this company this years and last. They even over hired by thousands, causing issues for everyone, and wouldn't ever address it."

- Campus is cool and has free pop
- People there are really cool
- Casual dress code
- Doctor's office on-site for when their negligence eventually gives you COVID","They say we're family, but if an actual parent treated us like UWM does, child services would be called immediately. Some departments are treated better than others, but in terms of industry standard, everyone is treated like crap.

Let's start with the COVID policy, or lack thereof. Yes, there's hand sanitizer around and I hear there are masks at certain places, but that's where the precautions end. No one is required to wear a mask, no temperatures are taken when someone walks in, and it seems like HR (or TMS, whatever) does absolutely nothing when someone tests positive. One of my friends told me that their leader mysteriously stopped coming in to work, then they saw facilities sanitizing that leader's desk, and that's the only way they knew. they had COVID. I also got a COVID scare in my first couple of weeks there and was given literally no direction by anyone on what to do. Now that cases are going up, they're still doing nothing, but multiple people have gotten and spread COVID in office. No, management didn't tell us that, I heard it all through that sweet, sweet grapevine.

In addition to the lack of safety measures, they're also not giving anyone time off related to COVID. No, people have to exhaust all of their PTO and then take unpaid time off if they need more, I guess? This review would be more clear on the details if there was an actual policy. Oh, and about that unpaid PTO, they've recently decided to crack down on it and let fewer people take it. So now they're actively encouraging people to come into the office even if they may be sick, which could very well spread COVID even more.

""But can't people work from home to avoid spreading the virus?"" you ask. Yes. They could. People worked from home perfectly fine at the beginning of the pandemic, but they will not let many departments work from home now even if they are sick. Why? Because of this asinine belief that we're ""better together"". The only thing we're better at together, Matty-Mat, is talking crap about how you run this god-forsaken place.

I will never be done ranting about this place's terrible mismanagement of the whole pandemic, but you get the idea, so let's move on.

Let's talk about pay. It sucks. I get paid far less than I should and I know other people do, too. They do this fun thing where they'll promote someone from a relatively low-paying role to a team lead or an AVP. Why would they promote someone a couple levels above their pay grade? So they can get that labor for cheap. UWM only allows a certain percentage of a raise per promotion, so there are a ton of team leads and AVPs who are DISGUSTINGLY underpaid. If this is currently happening to you, my advice is to apply elsewhere to get the same title and a HUGE pay bump. Don't give this place any more of your time or energy.

The 401k match sucks. It's half of what you contribute up to 3%, so 1.5%. That's all I need to say.

There are only 6 company holidays. Yes. 6. For everyone in the company. Your PTO to start is 10 days plus 2 floating holidays, but that's pretty despicable when you consider how other companies give more holidays and sometimes even more PTO (or unlimited PTO) to start.

Another thing that really sucks is that EVERYONE has to clock in and out. Yes, even salaried employees. They claim it's to make sure you're sticking to a ""firm 40"", but considering they make departments do mandatory 10 hour days, I think it's just to keep track of us. Oh, but SVPs and up don't have to clock in and out.

They also LOVE to give the illusion that they listen to their employees. A survey was sent out earlier this year asking people how the company could improve. Now to be fair, I didn't see the results of the survey, but everyone I talked to put work from home on their first survey. When the second survey was sent out, a survey they claim contained the ""top answers"", work from home was nowhere to be found. Bonus advice to management: it's not taking your employee's (sorry, ""team member's"") opinions into account if you purposely (allegedly, I'm not trying to get sued here) manipulate the survey data. In fact, I heard they had a meeting on how to stop people from asking about wfh. But hey, at least 2-ply toilet paper made it to the second survey!

Daily commitments and bonusing is wild. You are given a daily commitment, but if you do more than your commitment, then the number you hit is your new commitment. There have also been changes to bonusing that have caused some people to essentially get HUGE pay cuts. I don't know why UWM thinks it's a good idea to implement policies to actively discourage people to do their best, but I guess that's. why I don't make the big bucks.

There's a million other stupid little things that make this an awful place to work, but you get the idea by now and I have COVID (yes, I did get it at UWM), so I'm just going to wrap this up. In short, Mat Ishbia runs this company like he played basketball; barely acceptable and worse than most."

257,,Great learning experience. You will not be paid for your work.,2021-11-14,1.0,Account Executive,the People there and the knowledge you will gain.,"Having said that I will just share my genuine experience. I started in October 2020, before they went public. The first 6 months are exciting because you are being paid $36,000 salary, so for a single guy it was livable. Then on month 7 you drop down to $24,000 a year (not even $11.50 an hour) and get paid on loans once you fill up these “buckets” (of course recruiting doesn’t tell you about). You have to fill up 5 loans per bucket before you get paid on subsequent loans. If you do the math closing 15 loans is something you have to work up to your first couple months - and you will could be paid on it. I closed more loans I didn’t get paid on than the ones I did. I stuck around for a year before basically giving up for the first time in my life because I was using my credit card to be there, going into about $800 worth of debt every month I was there, taking home about $1300 after taxes. I had to take days off to door dash so I could make rent. If you google it UWM is being sued for not paying out on OT. I wore the suit, took the calls at 11pm, went to some of the “dominate at eights” before I realized how much of a pep really it just is (firm 40, right?). Overall in 12 months I made $25,000 if this review gives anyone an idea. Only take the job if you’re living with family or don’t have bills and want to gain experience."

- my coworkers were intelligent and motivated
- management in my department was pretty good","- first and foremost, the Covid policies here are non existent.  There was a small workforce in the office prior to the summer, but the CEO made a decision to force all workers back into the office. This would not have been a huge issue for me, but I was hoping there would be some type of documentation on how UWM was going to keep us safe in the office. Mask usage is essentially non existent, outbreaks are common, and you are forced to use your PTO if you get sick. Considering most of the company only has 10 days, you will lose your entire bank if you get Covid. If you get sick after losing all of your PTO days, you will need to “borrow” from next years PTO bank. 
- There is no type of work from home plan and no ability to scale out in the event that people need to work from home. You can’t pretend to be a tech company when most of your employees have to use shared computers and you don’t have a working VDI instance for your employees. 
- Tech people might make a decent wage, but other parts of the company are drastically underpaid. You could literally make more at a fast food company
- Attempts to modernize infrastructure are hampered by a mentality of doing things the way we have always done them. If you try to update or move the company forward, you will not get support. 
- The company is losing so many people every week that almost every team is understaffed. This is definitely compounded by the lack of WFH as most technical people can find a job that is more flexible."

- Closing is one of the positions you can stay with the Firm 40 pretty regularly.

The company started off pretty solid and had a promising/exciting vibe to keep grinding & you will move up in no time. The overall morale was pretty bearable UNTIL we went public; that’s the moment I can pinpoint when everything went downhill fast.","- PTO (Company had no Covid plans for people that were forced to work from the office, so if they were exposed/positive they had to deplete all of their PTO first to quarantine and did not have option to take it unpaid.)
- If you start in a Tier III role there is not too many options for promotion/pay raise down the line. 
- The Micromanagement of it all - you are watched constantly regardless of the role. There are entire job roles devoted to auditing your files and phone calls so you are constantly being reviewed and graded. The Auditing is fine for quality purposes BUT, as of the last couple months, everyone has noticed the CI Team giving out errors right and left for things that are either false or seemingly new rules out of nowhere. All of this brings me to my next point:
- Companies inability to be a “thumb pointer” and acknowledge their hiring faults. UWM took on too many people in anticipation for more business, and we of course are slowing down, and thus there’s not enough work to go around. So instead of the humane response of properly “laying off” or “furloughing” their “family” (so they can definitely qualify for unemployment) since this will look bad image wise, they raised everyone’s commitments/metrics to be unattainable and began building up insignificant errors on employees reports so that they either scare employees into finding something else, or they have the ammo to eventually fire you without room to retaliate. 
- Mat’s tone deaf decisions; the “exciting news” that basically cut everyone’s pay, and then a few days later donating 32 Million to MSU men’s sports? …what? 
- Rate of Pay: UWM pays their employees SIGNIFICANTLY less then their competitors, and the employees pump out huge volume/produce lots of revenue. Nobody at UWM should be making less than $15/hr - no one. 
- Brokers/Title Agents - honestly you will deal with some horribly awful ugly clients while working here. You will get screamed at by people who, usually, don’t even understand the basics of TRID or what’s compliant, and coach them through basically how to complete their file so they can go on to make a $7,000 commission/compensation on one loan while you’re unable to afford to take a day off.

Also, the health/dental benefits are good.","UWM pays less than what is standard for the mortgage industry. Workers do not get to chose their own shift time. And as of Summer 2021 UWM does not allow workers the flexibility of working from home. On top of that, UWM sometimes requires overtime (it calls this “rise and grind” wherein we are forced to work for 10 hours instead of 8 in a day). And there are no part-time positions at UWM.

UWM enforces non-compete clauses. It has sued workers who left to seek better opportunities.

During the pandemic it became clear that UWM values convenience more than it cares about the health of employees and their families. From June of 2020 and onward UWM required a significant portion of the employees to work in person. The company will not take measures to protect employee health/safety unless the government requires them to do so. In the fall of 2020 the number of COVID cases in the office each week grew from ten cases one week, to fifteen the next, to twenty five after that, and finally there were 50 COVID cases in one week, among just those people working in the office."
293,,STAY AWAY,2021-10-24,1.0,Senior Underwriter,my pod-mates were amazing people! Thats literally the only positive.,"There are so many cons to this soul sucking company ill try to get to the biggest ones. The firm 40 is a JOKE. I dont know a single underwriter who only works 40 hours. Most come in early, skip lunch, then stay after to hit commitment. I was putting in 10 hour days and being told it wasnt enough by my team lead. Brokers can and will say anything they want to you. A pod-mate got called a racial slur, it was reported to the AE and guess what? this broker is still allowed to do business with UWM. I have not gone a single day without seeing an underwriter crying at their desk by how horrible brokers are to them. You can report the call or email but i promise you nothing will be done. I even got called a moron by an AE. Not only do they not care about your mental health they dont care about your physical health either. Their response to covid has been a joke. At one time they had temperature scanners and dividers between desks and a mask requirement. Then when everyone came back to the office they got rid of all of that. The person who sat next to me actually got covid. I got a call from the HR department to let me know they had tested positive. They DID NOT require me to get a test or make sure it was negative before coming back to work. I did the responsible thing and took a day off, got tested before coming back into work but how many dont? The micromanaging is insane. Every month the pod is ranked and scored and compared to all the other pods in the company. You individually are ALSO ranked and compared to every single underwriter in the company. if a person or a pod is ranked low you get in trouble and in a lot of cases they just fire the lowest 1% of underwriters. So no pressure. How are you judged or ranked? A few ways: 

No call left behind: you MUST answer every single phone call no matter what 

Commitment: If you miss commitment it counts against yourself and your pod 

call scoring: They listen to a majority of your calls and if you dont stick to the script provided you will score low. I scored low on a call because i was literally crying on the other end of the broker screaming at me. I had to go to call coaching where i was forced to listen to the full 15 min phone call while the call coach laughed at me. 

Client requests (CRs): This is a special type of email that is timed. You have two hours to respond but its frowned upon if you dont answer it in 20 mins. The thing about CRs is this is also a way for an issue to escalate to your TL. Brokers are told to say they dont like the underwriter’s response to speak to a TL. So this is basically their opinion of you. 

Senior queues: if you get promoted to senior you get senior queues and they must be out of the queue within 4 hours. If a senior queue is not taken out of the queue in 4 hours it counts against you. 

Basically then monitor everything you do and will constantly tell you you are not good enough. My mental health took a complete nosedive while working there. Save yourself the stress and look elsewhere for a job."

The new bonus structure is nearly unobtainable. They punish the veterans who are loyal to them by making them work more for less money. I can guarantee you have never worked at a place that micromanages you the way UWM does. The amount of people I know that have quit without a back up plan because their mental health couldn't take it anymore is outrageous.

- the training just doesn't prepare you for this. in fact, the training is pretty much irrelevant once you hit the floor. it's a different world on the floor, where it's all stress, endless zoom meetings that last about 40 minutes, endless academy and task stuff that you have to complete at a required time. and then once that's done distracting you, you then have to panic and try to reach their commitment. and they wonder why some loan quality is bad. 
- they tell you loan quality should be main priority, but then keep hounding and scolding you about reaching commitment. 
- the inconsistencies between what is right and what isn't when reviewing a file. i have asked a few people on their view on how something should be entered and they all gave me different answers. if that isn't concerning, then i don't know what. true, there are job aids to help but sometimes it feels like i'm decoding them because i just don't understand them sometimes. maybe they aren't in more layman's term for me to understand it, but i did come into this with zero mortgage experience. anyway, you think people would be on the same page about guidelines or reviewing files. 
- zero communication skills. 
- it really is we're all smiling on the outside but really, screaming on the inside. 
- this place is great for the first few months, going through the training and then starting off on the floor. but that all comes crashing and burning down on you when reality hits.

337,,Don't let their ads fool you...definitely not like it used to be,2021-10-02,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"- Great people work here and really liked my co-workers

- Cool building/amenities (but you won't have much time to use them)

- Nice perks like event tickets, the fair and trick or treating - but as the company grew, these events became extremely overcrowded and downright annoying to attend.

- They hire just about anyone and give an opportunity to those without experience. It’s great for people coming from another industry (hiring people with prior retail or food service experience is their favorite) since it’s a more consistent schedule/income and offers benefits. However, the pay is abysmally low for the industry, the 401K match is subpar and any professional with a few years’ experience in the mortgage world will quickly become annoyed by the lack of knowledge and professionalism that abounds within the company. Not to mention the constant turnover and mass hiring sprees are exhausting!","When I joined the company years ago, it truly was a great place to work. The company was small, they lived up to their “pillars” and you weren’t treated as just another number or cog in the machine. You actually felt as though their whole “we are family” mantra rang true and you were really valued as an employee.

Today, the company is a shell of its former self and most of the good parts are gone. The change really started to happen once they moved to Pontiac – senior management became greedy and constantly obsessed with beating/bad mouthing the biggest competitor down the road in Detroit. Now, it’s constant gaslighting about how great UWM is, how important employees are, etc. but the company’s actions send a completely different message. Toxic positivity is the best way to describe the work environment. As many other reviews have mentioned, this place has all the classic hallmark traits of a cult, including learning ""UWM speak"" (words like “employee”, “boss” or “manager” are effectively banned from communication because management claims they have a negative connotation. You must use words like “Team member” and “Leader” since they're more aspirational and uplifting.) So for those contemplating a career at UWM, here’s a few insights into how they really live up to some of the pillars they constantly preach so you know exactly what you’re stepping into. 

People are our greatest asset? Sure but they don't really care about your health and safety. Managers and anyone not hitting commitment (even when there’s a lack of loans to work) had to physically be in the office everyday since May 2020 while COVID ran rampant because the CEO thinks the company is only best when collaborating in person. All employees were back in office full time since July 2021, crammed into open-air buildings 5’ or less from their closest co-worker. Oh and masks are pretty much nonexistent in the office. If you work better at home because it’s actually quiet and you can focus? Sorry, you need to come back “home” to UWM where it’s loud with constant interruptions (the office environment is an introvert’s worst nightmare). They actually had signs all around the building and messages on the phones saying “Welcome Home” when employees had to start returning to the office in June. If you ever consider a workplace as your “home”, please seriously reevaluate what’s going on in life – no job is worth it! So much for the work-life balance and “firm 40” they talk about but don’t adhere to.

Thumb pointers not finger pointers? Yeah that only applies to employees. Managers will constantly micromanage and belittle people over the stupidest things but managers/executives can do no wrong. Make a mistake? Get called out, sometimes even in front of the whole team. The number of contests they ran based on who had perfect time card punches without any lates is worse than elementary school! If you’re a minute late from your scheduled start time, it’s noted and tracked. Too many ""lates"" and you get to have a conversation with your “leader” about why you’re late or even get let go. The quality of your work always seems secondary to the accuracy of your time card! Oh and if there's snow forecast – the CEO would have all the managers remind people to leave for work early so we punch in on time. UWM even advertised a ""discounted"" rate at a nearby hotel (paid at our expense, which for a number of employees would probably cost more than a day’s pay) to stay close to the office so you're not late. Even though people have proven they can successfully work from home and not risk their lives in a pandemic or driving to an office during bad weather, WFH is no longer allowed under any circumstances.

Continuous improvement is essential for long term success? That apparently doesn’t apply to their technology though because it’s always breaking, crashing or causing costly issues. The IT team keeps losing the good, knowledgable people (understandably so) and the builds are so rushed and convoluted, that systems are bound to blow up. You'd think they'd learn that going fast leads to mistakes and system problems, but they keep pushing things through anyway because the CEO believes speed always wins. Quantity reins supreme over quality at UWM.

Fun and friendship? Sure, good in theory but all those “fun” activities they offer during the work day are not accounted for in quotas and commitment numbers. You’re expected to attend these things but commitment stays the same – even though you had to spend 30-60 minutes at the event so you’re seen as a “team player”. 

If you are caring for elderly loved ones and/or young children and don’t have a spouse/significant other at home to provide the bulk of the caregiving, this is a terrible place to work. There is no flexibility in schedule, work location or sick days offered to help you juggle those additional personal commitments whatsoever. I really did enjoy working for UWM at one point – it’s the longest I’ve stayed at a company in my career - but it’s no longer the same company I used to enjoy being part of. The greed, misogyny and utter lack of concern for others from senior management became too much to bear. My mental health is so much better now that I’ve left this toxic environment."
338,,"Do your research, believe the reviews.",2021-10-01,1.0,Operations Specialist,"Bonding with your team, and realizing you all actually dislike it but need the money.","First off the lure you in with this ""family"" motto, that alone should be a red flag, most places that preach that do not follow it and in fact use it as a tactic to take advantage of you. Which they in fact do.. You'll be promised things in your interview that will not hold up to be true (ie. Permanent work from home positions, easy raises, easy way to work up the ladder, firm 40 hr weeks). The orientation will come and you'll be hit with a wave of full force frat boy masculine energy. Hopefully you'll be lucky and you'll be with ""equals"" instead of positions above yours, because if you are they will make it very apparent that they're better than you. 
 If you make it past all that, then congrats you are now an easily disposable worker! Forget the firm 40 hr weeks, you're working mandatory OT without OT pay during the busy season and a ""strongly encouraged"" 15 minute unpaid lunch 1x day instead of the legal 30 mins, or normal 1 hour. If thats not enough, your commitment just got raised because ""we wanted to make it more fair for everyone,"" even if you were barely hitting baseline before. Sometimes you'll be lucky and they'll give you time to ramp up to that new commitment, but other times if you're not hitting that you'll get put on a PIP which is like a warning. Don't even think you'll be hitting bonus tier unless you don't care about your free time, or your hand/wrist. So much button clicking, now you need to spend 1/4 your weekly pay on a new computer mouse so you'll be in less pain.

-In 2019 the starting pay rate was higher than it is now, even though the company is growing.
-The sports complex is not built to benefit the city of Pontiac's children, it is used to grow the ""culture"" and is an over grown office building for training. 
-Matt Ishiba notoriously only donates to MSU male athletes, not the females. 
-AE's are often told to take less bathroom breaks, thus leading to people deficating on the sales floor. This actually happens multiple times a month..
-The programs they use to run their company cannot withstand the amount of people operating on it, thus frequently crashing 2x or more a day.
-Underwriters consistently get pay cuts when their workloads get increased, resulting in lower quality which makes others workloads worse.
-They make it very difficult to get promotions

350,,Cult Like,2021-09-28,1.0,Underwriter II,"Nice Facilities,
In-House dining options,
Paid ""Training"" for your position.","UWM is set up and managed like a cult.
Many reviews on here have called out that in order to be happy or successful at the company you must drink the kool-aid. This is not a coincidence as the company relies on herd mentality and deception to brainwash the employees and convincing them they are happy and fulfilled with their jobs.
After accepting an offer at UWM and before even beginning working at UWM you will get an email from the company describing to you how you can make money from UWM even before you work there. They have a referral system where you can earn $2400 per person ($40/Month) that you refer to work at UWM. Additionally, it is set up like a pyramid scheme where you can earn extra cash for each person your referral refers to work at UWM. If you ever talk to someone at UWM about working there or getting a job there, chances are they will tell you how great and amazing it is, that the job changed their life, and also that they can refer you. The company lives on turnover and is able to largely support it with their predatory referral system set up the way it is.
During your first week at UWM, they will go over the company's 6 Pillars and they will begin to introduce you to what some of their cult-like mentality is. 
One of the Pillars ""Thumb Pointers"" is basically set up for you always to take the blame for any issue but to reward you and make you feel good about yourself whenever you do it. The company is not worried about getting to the root cause of problems or even looking to solve these problems as long as they have people stepping up to be thumb pointers they have someone to blame.
The other pillar that they will push on you during your first week is ""All In"" or as you will hear Mat Ishbia or Former Controversial NBA Pro Mateen Cleaves say, ""Burn the Boats."" In short, what they are telling you is that you need to be %110 committed to UWM right then and there and if you aren't already during your first week, they don't want you there. They want UWM to be your only way of going forward. While they spin these pillars to seem positive and charismatic they are simply manipulative platforms to alter your opinion of the company. 
There were no real issues with the training that was received. They push you through training for a new position in a short amount of time and it is relatively impossible to cover everything.
The problem is that when new underwriters hit the floor, 95% of them are completely unprepared for the job fresh out of training. There is no training on the overall function of the company and how your job fits into the larger loan processes so you are left wondering what other departments do and generally are unable to help clients with issues or questions or even get them to the right person if their question does not directly correlate to something you were taught in training. 
Once you have made it through the welcome week and your training class and your development stage you officially hit the floor with a commitment to hit and everything goes out the window as far as what the company promised you.
The company says they work a firm 40 which is a lie. You are required to take an hour lunch so you at minimum are there for 45 hours a week. But they don't care how much you work as long as you hit commitment. Their biggest concern is you hitting your commitment before leaving every day.
The company will talk about the 3 legged stool that the company sits on of production, quality, and customer service. While this is referenced the company makes it clear that production always comes first. 
If you fail to meet your production, management expects an explanation on why you didn't hit your commitment.
The company currently has an across the board commitment of 14 loans worked per day as an underwriter.
If you only work the firm 40 hours that they promise you, that leaves you roughly 35 minutes per loan to get your work done. 
Mind you the company creates incentives for brokers to have as few touches as possible on their loans meaning they will generally have the majority of documents uploaded for each loan each time you touch.
Not to mention you also do not get credit for each time you touch a loan. You can spend 30 minutes working a loan but if there we no conditions cleared you will get no credit.
On top of all of the production you are expected to complete you have other things taking your time, Daily trainings, meetings and shift huddles, phone calls from brokers, emails from brokers among other issues you must address.
While it is possible to excel in the position and exceed your commitment a large amount to get a decent bonus, it is an unrealistic number based on the practices you are required to take as far as your work flow. The majority of people who bonus and exceed commitment are able to do so by abusing the system in their favor and taking loans from other underwriters.
The job itself is fine as far as working at a company where you examine loan documents. The majority of brokers are a pleasure to work with as long as you know what you are doing and are able to do your job correctly. But remember you will not be fully prepared for the job coming out of training.
The company promises opportunity to make good money and that is still there if you are willing to cut corners, and work extreme hours.
Ultimitly if you have no other choice and are willing to take this job to get experience over a year to get yourself a better job than you have opportunity at UWM, but you will have to sacrifice decent work hours, sanity, and dignity."
351,,Apply Elsewhere,2021-09-28,1.0,Instructional Designer,"None – UWM epitomizes the worst excesses of top down hierarchical leadership and resource centralization, leading to a culture of treating team members as disposable and of placing short-term gain over both sustainability and long-term enterprise durability.","In no particular order:

- Routine micromanagement from team leaders with little to no familiarity with the roles performed by their direct reports, leading to exhaustion and burnout of team members
- Discriminatory behavior perpetrated by management and condoned by senior HR team members
- Sexual harassment and predatory behavior by management at every level treated as an open secret; HR either unwilling or unable to impact
- Invasive behavior by management portrayed as being part of ‘family culture’
- Pay often below market standard (10-15k), regardless of prior experience or seniority
- Witnessed at least one instance of VP-level leaders boasting about breaking labor laws, laughed off by AVP and leaders when reported
- Discussion of pay not just discouraged, but expressly forbidden by team leads
- Abrupt change in position expectations, often widely deviating not only from hired-in position but from standard definition of roles, owing to managerial ignorance over the roles they are set to lead
- Due to a regular lack of quarterly planning and mismatched prioritization between different levels of leadership, unpaid overtime consistently expected
- Clocking in/out to the minute required for all positions, including full-time; unpaid, clocked out lunch hour required for all positions. Shorter lunches, while permitted, did not impact length of time team members expected to be on-site (min 9 hours)
- Covid-19 Pandemic treated cavalierly, resulting in adverse impact to team member health, ranging from on-site contraction of virus to mental well-being during unprecedented global crisis to termination of team members in good standing over said team members providing feedback over company’s inadequate safety measures
- Lack of technological literacy among C-Suite officers is setting up the company for immense issues in the not-too-distant future
- Overhyped training programs not adequately staffed behind the scenes, leading to training team burnout and consequently, subpar team member development"

Generous PTO, lots of great things to do on your lunch break, Mat and his team have done a good job. Seeing the sales meetings every week, I know Mat has very good intentions and drive and it's extremely inspiring to be a part of that. On top of that, If you end up on a good team with people you work well with, it will be great. Some of the best people I've ever worked with were on my team.

If you are able to stick this out for a few years, you can make some serious money.","The truth is, the only people who talk about a firm 40 are Mat and the people who train you at the beginning. They mention it when you are new, but you stop hearing about it as soon as you hit the floor. As an AE, you aren't forced into working over time, but the higher level leadership expects a lot. You are constantly getting pulled in several directions, trying to juggle multiple tasks at once and always falling short on something. Down the road once you are a little more tenured, all of these things will effect your scorecard which effects your comission.

There's a lot of pressure to answer calls at home (forwarding your desk phone to your cell phone) on the weekends and evenings. It's not absolutely required but it is heavily encouraged. It's also heavily expected that you get there early every day. I'm early all the time and I was one of the last ones at my desk every day..

The pay is also quite low as an entry level AE and it can take a while to grow your business into something fruitful."

They'll think nothing of packing all 1300 IT people elbow-to-elbow or in an arena to satisfy the owner's ego.

They bill themselves as a ""tech company"" -- they're not. They are 100% sales driven. Anything sales wants, they get. You won't build good systems here, you'll build whatever sales wants quickly, or be fired.

Professionally, it's a terrible company. Most teams have trainees and new developers outnumbering professionals 7 or 8 to 1. Very few people know what's actually going on -- don't expect to learn anything here from your peers. You won't learn anything to help you pass a tech interview at another company, so it's hard to leave.

Promotions are hard to get once you get past the lower levels, often people are turned down for arbitrary reasons. If you aren't part of the ""in crowd"" -- the bicycle club, the drinking crowd -- don't expect to get a promotion. There are a couple of 'brown' people that have gotten promotions, but they're just tokens and show up over and over again in their promo videos and pictures. However, in the lowers, the Dev I's and II's can't code their way out of a paper bag and are promoted to keep them from going elsewhere.

The environment is out of the 1990's. No CI/CD at all. Monoliths everywhere. Poorly trained QA. Almost no automation. Terrible coding practices because the new Devs throw so much bad code at systems, it's horrible. No local environments, no working Shared Dev or QA environments. Push your stuff to Staging and hope for the best. If you mess it up, expect to spend a lot of time being yelled at.

Large multi-month projects show up with built-in deadlines and poor requirements. Management decides that it needs to be done by a date, and it will be. Teams are pressured to work nights and weekends to finish. Features are never dropped. The CEO is never told no. Sales trumps everything including safety, stability.

The ""Firm 40"" that UWM used to have got dropped this year. It's now ""work life balance"". See what they did there? Working 70+ hours a week, you still have a life, right?"

359,,Can't Hire Anyone,2021-09-23,1.0,Software Developer II,"- The people to my immediate left and right
- Training for new developers
- PTO is decently competitive 
- Cheap swag
- People bring in food all the time","- Pay is very substandard compared to other developer positions although the company will brag about having a 'crap ton' of money

- Absolutely no COVID precautions

- People working in the office while diagnosed with COVID

- When someone senior (SVP) was diagnosed with COVID, there were many many many senior leaders without masks that were locked in a small office with them. Instead of telling anyone and having those in close contact with them quarantine, the business decided to not tell anyone and let those that were in close contact run around the company without wearing masks

- Building is freezing, but we were told that we cannot use blankets in the office because it gives off a bad look to the brokers

- Lack of communication and transparency on large projects

- Extreme lack of experienced developers. Most developers that work at UWM are from the Dev X program and many cannot critically think or develop well for a long time

- Continuous improvement classes are the same classes over and over, barely scratch the surface of the topic they're touching on, and fill up almost immediately

- Misunderstanding cross functionality. The company wants developers to QA things, write user stories, and run scrum rituals. They also want BAs to develop, QA things, and run scrum rituals. This is not cross functionality

- Very loud and hard to focus

- Horrible work/life balance. For every AIME initiative (annual), there will be crunch time where every developer will be working weekends, holidays, and until midnight or later during the weekdays. One of the current projects has been having every developer and QA work almost every weekend and holiday for at least the last 4 months

- Deadline driven projects without requirements. There are oftentimes large projects that need to be completed, but don't get talked about with the developers and QAs until the last moment. This leads to weekend and after hours work frequently

- Tons of lip service. Leaders will tell you that deadline driven projects are going to stop or that they will put their foot down every single week for years

- Too many meetings. 40%+ of your day will be spent in meetings sent sporadically throughout your day so it's hard to maintain focus on projects

- A lot of software developers, QAs, and BAs are leaving but we cannot hire any new ones to replace them because of the salary expectations, non-WFH policy, and lack of COVID restrictions

- Convenience store is nice, but very expensive
- The entire company practices waterfall but will claim to be an agile shop

- Most developers, since they don't have external practical experience, will boilerplate code without understanding what they are doing or how to make things better

- Promotions are highly political and aren't based on merit or ability but rather 'time in seat'

- A lot of promotions aren't really promotions. Any move to any different position whether it is lateral, a demotion from team lead to QA, or a change in title is considered a promotion

- There are a lot of quick internal promotions which might sound like a good thing, but are usually because many people with experience leave. This means that many of those that are promoted internally have just been 'in the seat' longer than others

- Can't use different chairs unless you have a doctor's note and the chairs are usually broken and don't have headrests

- The paper towel dispensers are almost always broken in the bathrooms

- You have to clock in and out of work 4 times a day, regardless if you are salaried or not. The business will say it's to ensure a good work/life balance, but if you're working weekends and holidays without any additional compensation or flexibility in your schedule or punches, then it's not about a good work/life balance

- You can work 60 hours one week, then work 38 the next week, but still get a 'talking to' about how you're not putting in enough hours/leaving early on the 38 hour week

- The more competent people get picked for every project which leads to quick burnout and settling for mediocrity with the rest of the floor
- Those that do get hired and stay are either only entry-level or are unemployed and are applying everywhere

- Code base for main solutions are massive and not built to scale

- Scaling applications is never prioritized so the massive solutions continue to grow into even larger messes

- Most Scrum Masters don't do things for most teams

- New products aren't maintained and client reception, client feedback, and client usage aren't metrics that are measured so we never improve on any new product after releasing it

- The Destiny application is appalling and slows everything down. UWM has 250+ developers but can't seem to build a system that isn't dependent on an engine built in the 1990's

- Feedback falls into the abyss

- 'No meeting Thursday' has mandatory meetings all day

- All IT Meetings are held in the Sports Complex, non-remotely, and it takes about 30 minutes to walk to it (one way) when we have an auditorium with nearly the same capabilities in the same building that IT already sits in

- If you catch COVID at work, you're required to take your own PTO for as long as you can until you recover. If you run out of PTO, you're forced to take unpaid leave until you recover or come back into the office with COVID. New hires only get 10 days of PTO and it's required that you quarantine for 14 days if you catch COVID or have been exposed to it

- Dance parties are loud and shake your desk, making it hard to get work done"

I just don't believe he understands how to scale his success correctly with keeping a good company culture. Putting soda machines and video games in the company doesn't make it a good place to work. Matt is a great person he will say hi to everyone and stop by to talk to you. Don't be surprisde if he randomly sits next to you and ask to eat his lunch with you. He does care about his company and his employees, but I don't believe his intenions are correctly being trickled down management.

* Good amount of good co-workers

* Gym

* Club activities (Video games, arcades, board games, etc)

* Power Cart ( cart full of goodies these are free, but only if your team meets a quota). Lot of teams know this is not easy to obtain so they share with other fellow teams.

* For the Team Leads (Managers) they are for the most part good people who I have met.

* You have the ability to shadow another role to see if that's what you want to become. You even have the ability to change roles (the even offer some training of that role).

* For a person fresh out of college this is a good start (for a limited time only see my cons below as to why)

* Morning stand-ups may have you do a chant. Some teams will say famous movie phrase while others may include a war speech (not kidding about the last one.) So if you're into that kinda thing that's this kind of place.","*No sick days (You have to use all your vacation days if you're sick. That's why many people who are sick come to work and get others sick. That's how I got sick. :( 

*Employee rentention rate is extremely low for IT (I cannot speak for other departments). You will see people quit very often and very frequently. This is why they are desparate to have IT workers. They will hire anyone at this point because people quit so often.

*No work/life balance: There are times when you will be asked (highly encouraged) to work overtime with no compensation other than a free lunch, a shoutout, or a pat on the back (no monetary compensation at all nor extra time off).

* One quick story about the above. A fellow co-worker confided in me that because her car broke down she asked if there was any way to work from home as she didn't have a way to get to work. She was denied. She asked can I take a vacation day to get the car fixed. She was again denied because the project needed to be in a better spot! I was floored when I heard this. How do you do this!?!?!?!

*Toxic work culture: There is a sense of getting this ""done"" at the extent of hurting others and I have seen this with my own eyes. Couldn't believe this. You will have co-workers verbally abuse contractors in order for them to seem smarter to upper management! The even sadder part of this is that Upper Management is ok with this as they encourage this behavior by either turning a blind eye or involving this behavior themselves.

* Had one contractor confide in me that he couldn't wait to be done with the project because of all the verbal abuse. I felt so bad that there is little that I can do unless I want to get fired. 

*If you have a family or plan on starting a family this may not be the best place for you because of the aboved mentioned. This place doesn't encourage working from home even if you have to go to a dentist appointment. So if your son/daughter gets sick you will have to burn through your vacation days or if the project demands it find a sitter and made to come to work. The bottom line is that upper management meeting their goals trumps your family or your needs.

*Upper-Management are disconnected to what goes on to get things ""done"". They turn a blind eye to HOW it gets done in order for them to show their leaders that they met their goals."

They build a massive complex in Pontiac, including the largest land-bridge in the state to connect their enormous buildings. And they wildly overestimated how many underwriters they would need. 

Because they spent so much money on their facility, they felt it necessary to bring ALL employees back into the office, regardless of circumstance. Not only as a way of justifying that expense, but also because this position is not competitive across the industry. Their facilities are pushed as a huge benefit to working for the company, so if employees are working remotely, they will eventually realize they can make more elsewhere. 

Personally, I hit all of my commitments (usually exceeded them) and was promoted quickly while working remotely. I also had family circumstances that made it impossible to come back into the office. I was forced to quit when the ultimatum was set for returning to the office. It took me less than a month to find a permanent remote position that pays 30% more with a competitor. 

Ironically, the company loves to tout that its employees are extremely valuable, and that we're all a giant family. But it does nothing to protect them (COVID is basically a dirty word. Minimal precautions taken. I knew several people who were forced to come into the office WHILE THEY HAD COVID.) And retention is not a goal of the company at all. 

This position was heavily production driven, and by the time I left, there was simply not enough to go around. It was mathematically impossible for everyone to hit their production goals, yet management continuously stressed the important of production, and reprimanded employees who did not hit them. I was fortunate to never be impacted by this, but I know a lot of people who were. 

Even when there was enough work to go around, this job never felt stable. I had 7 managers (team leads) in as many months, at one point. Some of them quit, some stepped down, some were 'politely asked' to step down. My rotating cast of coworkers was impossible to keep up with. I will say most of my managers were pleasant to work with, and generally knowledgeable.

Hours were 10-7, not very good, and downright awful if you had a commute. Mandatory lunch made it worse. There's not enough time to really go anywhere or do anything, you just sit in the office for an hour. Most people work. 

Overtime is 'not mandatory' according to every manager, however every other Tuesday it is literally mandatory to work for 12 hours. And most employees are forced to work overtime to hit commitment in normal weeks since the workflow is in such a bad spot. The kicker? Senior underwriters are fully salaried. No additional pay for OT. Bonus program was peeled back so heavily that bonus pay is now pennies. High producers and employees who know what they're doing have no incentive to stay with the company once they've put in some time as a senior underwriter. And team leads have it even worse. They work a ton of OT, are not paid well, are not treated well by their managers or their clients, and have almost no upward mobility from there. Just trapped in a position that demands every ounce of your soul and rewards you with the pay that starting underwriters make at competitors."

They make you do some unnecessary not even related ""Group Building Activities"" and I know what you might be thinking that I may not be a social person-No in fact I love collaborating with coworkers and being involved with team work however the problem here at UWM was that if you are doing better than others there and you just started working and mind you the others have been working for 2 or more years you get hated on and the supervisors or group leads whatever they call them show a lot of favoritism towards specific employees not racially but more along the lines of if you didn't have anything in common or something small in common with them they don't want anything to do with you and they team leads take advantage of you as well as the CEO from the company promised himself only 40 hours total for work however that wasn't the case I was told to come in early and my shift started originally at 11am-8pm however I was told to come in at 9am-8pm not given an extra break time not even allowed to leave a little earlier since calls would slow down around 6pm. I personally hate drama and if there's drama in the workplace I stay away and when it comes to the point where it becomes out of hand normally I would go to a supervisor or in this case a team lead however they were involved in the drama as well I didn't mind going the the mandatory meetings because they were informal with changes and procedures however this group bonding which was like 3-4 times everyday was unnecessary the reason why was bc UWM would get 10,000 - 20,000 calls a day with 30 staff members in the department during that time and every time the queue went past 30 seconds (which is how long the customer would wait for someone to answer the phone) the team leads would start yelling and that's why I was so bothered by the ""team bonding' activities because that's when the queue would normally go up and I got so mad to the point I confronted the one from the two of the team leads about it stating ""Is this going to help me better understand the criteria of work while helping the customer?"" As soon as she said no its just team bonding I said no disrespect but I rather do my job she didn't know what to say bc she knew I was right I wasn't there to make friends I was there to get paid to work no matter what you do before applying just know they will do anything and everything to get involved with your personal life there's being genuine with your coworkers and being friendly but then there's UWM where they are too invasive into your privacy to the point that even if your just having an off day but still doing your job as you should they will pull you off to the side wanting to know ""what's wrong"" just so they can have gossip to spread around and lastly if you think your gonna advance here and they provide opportunities well sorry to break it to you but its false advertisement I signed up for classes they offered to become better in mortgage knowledge however it needed to be approved by the assigned team leader when I notified her that I signed up for the class as required she said she would look at it and approve it then 4 days go by she said she hasn't gotten to it yet then 3 weeks later she says she won't approve of it its not worth working here they mission quote is ""be you here"" but while working there they didn't accept who I was and was forcing me to be someone I am not."

Sooo apparently that’s where our bonuses and salaries are going. Because it’s your biggest year, best month but screw they employees right???

We are already underpaid for the industry and then they greatly reduce what work we get credit for (production), cut salaries across the board…. And then greatly reduce bonuses. They also increased daily production requirement after they took away what qualifies as work. It’s so laughable.

In addition the that, over the last few months they have added more and more to UW plates but give less and less. 

A Team lead used to make over $100k, now it’s around $75k

Sr Uw used to make a salary around 70k, now they only pay them $52k

408,,Please don’t work here,2021-09-02,1.0,Senior Underwriter,Made some friendships that will last a lifetime,"I was employed at UWM for 6+ years. Everything went downhill when the company moved from Troy to Pontiac. They only care about numbers. They promote people to hit a quota, not because those people are qualified to get promoted. They hire 500 people every two weeks to hit a quota. Not because those people are qualified. Your salary is 40k below industry average, AND you’re doing WAY more work compared to underwriters at other companies. You will notice whenever they try to sell you the company so you can apply, 90% of the things they will mention are the amenities. The gym, cafe, store, etc. They can’t talk about the work environment because everyone there is unhappy. They don’t talk about their system because it crashes every. single. day. They don’t talk about how if the system does crash, you are still required to hit commitment. They don’t talk about mandatory UNPAID overtime. (Don’t worry they will pay you with pizza or pasta it’s okay). This place went down hill so fast. They wanted to grow so fast in an unhealthy way. They throw around “we are #1” in everyone’s face not realizing that this statement has nothing to do with them as as an employer. It has to do with production with brokers. You might be number 1 to brokers because of how much you take off their plate and put it on your employees and that results in more business of course. But to your employees you are far….FAR from being number 1. They send out surveys for feedback on being employed at the company and only share the results if they’re good LOL. Response to COVID? Might as well tell your employees I really don’t give a crap about your health you need to come in and work in this factory even if you are sick. They’re idea of following CDC guidelines is placing plastic shields between computer monitors. They literally separate the computer monitors, not the people sitting at their desks. How is that protecting your employees? Not to mention that everyone else at other companies are still working from home because this job is 100% doable from home. But UWM only makes 99.99% of the company come in to the office sitting next to each other all day. What’s the other 0.01% you ask? It’s the one government employee that’s the highest producer that was the only one allowed to stay working from home even though they required all other employees to come back into the office or they’ll be fired. Even if they are sick with doctor’s recommendations to stay at home. So yeah, stay away."

A lot of drawbacks to count for this one but a main one is this:

After their most successful quarter of business in company history they drastically slashed the bonus structure for Underwriters. It's a pretty troubling trend that after going public the first idea for pleasing shareholders is to gut the amount of money your employees are getting. It's a bad environment to be in... over the course of your career management will introduce more responsibilities for you to take on, causing increased stress, making it much more difficult to make commitment. Underwriters at UWM get paid significantly less than pretty much any other institution, that's in addition to weird requirements like needing to be ""in office"" (which is absolutely wild in the COVID world). The only solace that I've found in the job is that the bonus pay was handsome. It's transactional and makes sense: you produce more, you get paid more. This last week management made an ""exciting announcement"" that they claimed was a result of ""taking employee feedback to heart."" That announcement ended up being a gutting of the bonus structure that, when implemented causes many employees such as myself to lose about $500 in income a week. A WEEK! And they pretended that it was what we asked for! It's baffling seeing the company tout its best quarter in company history while behind the scenes the management is obsessing over the possibility that it's low level workers are being paid too much.

They've created a development machine where they don't value their employees, because they can just hire cheaper, more subservient employees to fill their seats. Look elsewhere. Honestly Quicken would be a step up from this place. At least you can work from home and get out at a decent hour."
413,,"its a long one, feel free to scroll on by cause it reads like a diary entry",2021-09-01,1.0,Underwriter II,The training program is comprehensive,"The turn over is so insanely high for underwriters that by the time i left i was one of the most senior team members on my POD... I had been working the floor for about 4 months. YOU ARE DISPOSABLE and they make sure know that by having a 500 people class ready to replace you the minute you dont buy into their ""CULTure""
When you are in training they will address these very glassdoor and Linkedin reviews; they will dissmiss them and say that it trully makes them sad to see these comments because theure simply not true. They will tell you that your Team Lead is there to helop you with every question, ""THEY DONT EVE DO THEIR OWN LOANS, BECAUSE THEY ARE THERE TO HELP YOU"" they will say. 
Its all a lie, the minute you are out of mentoring and are doing loans on your own, you ARE on your own. 
Everyone is struggling to hit their commitment, they don't have time to help you understand concepts, your team lead will be so busy trying to please their higher ups that they will not be at their desks most of the day. 
I repeat you are on your own, sure you have PDF resources that you can reference but this is real life, real people and real transactions; every situation that you come across will not be on paper. 
You will feel overwhelmed.
some many times did i go into a restroom only to hear someone cry over how much stress and pressure they were under. only to go back out there and out on a brave face because ""you dont want to be the negative person on your POD that brings everyone down""
On top of your high daily commitment you are tasked with communicating with the client that you have made decitions 3 DIFFERENT WAYS everytime you touch that file. Phone call, emaill, and Usnap. 
what is Usnap you ask? a video of you saying what you just did. yes, call to say what you just did. an email to say what you just did, and a video to sat what you just did.... Remember to do this on every loan everyday! or you will get talked to , you will get put on a performance plan, you will be reminded that this is a crucial part of your job. 
Did you miss a phone call only to immediately call right back, and made sure the client was taken care of? THATS A BIG NO NO! at UWM you CANNOT miss one phone call, you will have to have a conversation with your TL explaining what was so important that you dared to miss a phone call.
While you were on that phone call, did you remember to hit ALL your points? Have a print out ready to make sure you do because if you dare to forget to ask how the weather is in California (where its always sunny) YOU WILL GET TALKED TO. 
There is a whole team dedicated to listen to your phone calls, and point out all the wrong things you did. they call this coaching... no girl its just nit picking. 
you can have a fantastic call but if you forgot to ask how the weather was then you are wrong and you will get ""coached""
lets go back to commitment, say there are 500 people working and for the day there are 500 loans, each person will get 1 loan right?! WRONG you are still expected to hit your daily 11 loans a day commitment.... oh but they're not monsters if that is the case they will adjust commitment and will be understanding; but they're not going to let you know till 6 pm so you've just spent your whole day freaking out because you're not going to hit. 
Recap: don't do it, the success stories that you will hear are just that, stories. UWM has become a turnover monster that is bigger than you. the machine will continue to run with or with out you ; the only thing you can help is wheatear you almost loose your mind before you realize i by simply going elsewhere."

421,,Used to be enjoyable and reasonable,2021-08-30,1.0,Senior Underwriter,People are generally nice here. Very fortunate to have a team lead who is understanding and knowledgeable.,"Underwriters' commitments were supposed to be a measurement of loans they can underwrite in 8 hours on average and was assessed month to month. But that monthly commitment was based on your ""best week"" of the month prior, which totally defeats the purpose of an average. Using one week as a measurement of what someone can do in an 8 hour day on average made no sense. New ""exciting"" changes were made to the commitment structure (and bonus too, don't plan on earning bonus money unless you don't mind working 24/7) to change commitment based on tenure, forcing you into a commitment you may not be able to handle without sacrificing loan quality and client service (also additional metrics to be met for LQ/client service). This new structure is based heavily on underwriting basic conventional files while other products can be incredibly more intensive than conventional (jumbo/FHA which you get slightly more credit for but not nearly enough). Half the day is spent on items which no credit is earned while also expected to underwrite large loans that on a good day, with no interruption might take an hour. Conventional loans tend to be much simpler and easier to review and maybe 20-30 minutes to underwrite. I'm not sure how files with 60 pages to review can be worth the same as files with 500/600 pages. I've had to tackle files with 1000-2000 page uploads but that's worth the same as that small, 20/30 minute file? Every day is constant stress and is affecting life outside work.

For as much work as underwriters do, the compensation is lacking."

I live out of state, so moving to Pontiac to start this job was a process I began immediately after accepting the offer. I had stopped the interview process with all companies that I was interviewing with almost 3 months ago now and have to begin the process all over again.. I am at a loss for words as I was excited to begin my career post college. Further, they offered me the option for a job in operations, specifically receiving packages, where the pay is nowhere near comparable. I'm at a loss for words."

- The janitorial and food staff in the Sports Complex are friendly. 
- You learn about a lot of things involved in the mortgage industry. Knowledge is unmatched.
- Free Coke drinks and good food.","- Underwriters and processor assistants are paid very little compared to the competition.
- If you don't have a more corporate role (auditor, account executive, IT, etc.), you can forget about having a work-life balance. 10-7 and 11-8 shifts are ridiculous.
- This company pushes the idea of a Firm 40 but you have mandatory Rise and Grind days. I think it's backward.
- If you live an hour away and you have a 9-6 shift, it's really a 7-7 because of traffic. 
- No Work from Home. The CEO said he's not for it at all and that's UNREASONABLE. Wouldn't expect him to understand since he's a billionaire and his spouse is at home.
- COVID gets treated like a joke
- Always talking bad about the other mortgage company ""45 min away on Woodward"" but they have a better work-life balance.
- The many benefits and perks are just thrown at you to keep you from having a life and from complaining about your pay.

I have felt very happy with my role at this company until they yet again took a good thing and ruined it, probably the only thing that makes it worthwhile to stay. Throughout my tenure with this company a majority of the talent has left. Although we are mortgage underwriters we truly are a call center. Here you will spend your days trying to underwrite while constantly being blown up by brokers asking the dumbest questions. None of them know what google is or that Fannie and Freddie guidelines are available online for them to review prior to harassing us or even submitting bad loans. 90% of the time they are argumentative and rude while you are following a script for your calls.(Which are recorded and scored)UWM has client request they may submit which is another communication where just like your calls you are required to drop whatever you are doing and race against a timer to answer their questions. Unfortunately these interruptions leave room for errors which results in your income being taken away. (I fully respect penalizing those who cannot underwrite cleanly but why make so many distractions that make it so easy to make errors)-if you work there and read this I received my LQ bonus so no, I am not bitter, just aware.- They have officially lost their minds today by “hearing our feedback” about not being able to hit their commitments. So naturally what have they decided to do? Raise the commitments and lower the bonuses. Those that are new to the company are not going to make it. Those of us who work hard all day exceeding our commitments are now being compensated less(about 30k/yr for myself). Is this their way of forcing out new people, or those that are not high producers as well as those that are high producers? I for one did not ask you to over hire. 
The only thing that has kept so many of us here is the bonuses we receive as our salaries are significantly low for industry standard. These bonuses we work very hard for. Now we are told to work even more for less? Hats off to these folks for crushing the dreams of those hoping to buy their own home or pay off student loans. This is NOT a family as they try to sell, this is disgusting and not acceptable. I believe many of us expect our income to increase annually, here it decreases. Your employees have bills. The changes taking over the company are offensive to those of us that work hard."

As a 2 year SRUW, they did not treat me as an equal or with respect. Call scores, Usnaps, no call left behind - all just micromanaging policies to keep you distracted from doing your job.

Bad work conditions.

Overall, very shady business. Hence all the lawsuits. I worked there for 5 years. 1 year in a starter role, 4 years in Underwriting. So I’ve seen the change in UWM from a smaller company to the monstrosity it is now. 

I used to love coming to work in the early days. Was a company I did genuinely feel what they preach, “family”. More the business grew, the more greedy it became, and the more the focus was on numbers and production. Very “beat all other lenders” mentality. Overall quite unhealthy. 

I’ve worked 80 hour weeks, have been reprimanded for not hitting numbers when there’s physically not enough loans for everyone to hit, ever changing expectations, just a mess. Cheating people out of money is common as well. 

Don’t even get me started with the COVID-19 response. Forced people to come into the office during the pandemic. And I’m talking the EARLY days, some people were even in office during the Michigan Shut Down. All behind the guise “This building is the safest place you can be”. Meanwhile was rated one of the highest COVID rate companies to work for in Michigan. Also made efforts to hide it. Leaders were specifically told NOT to tell how many people had gotten COVID a day. Which always were higher and higher numbers. Disgusting.

Lending support. Closing. Post Closing. Quality control. Training. 

They promote people with little to no experience leading people. Vet your leaders better - most people leave a manager not the company. They generally promote people with no backbone, so they can push their agenda on them with no pushback. If you have a backbone and your own opinion, prepare for serious backlash. 

Very underpaid compared to similar jobs. The “promotions” as mentioned before go to favorites. Don’t ever apply for leadership unless you want all your freedom taken away, that’s no time at home and you aren’t allowed to have your own thoughts. 

If you have a large bonus, they will create a new error, just to take your bonus away. 
Example: review loan, 1 week later new “error” put into place. Now all of a sudden that loan from a week prior is an error. Even though it wasn’t a rule at the time of review. They will do whatever they can to take your money away and make bonuses as hard to get as possible. 
Now you can “fight” an error, but the qc team has changed so much now they will get an error if they assign you an error in mistake. Due to this - they don’t overturn errors anymore even if it was their mistake so that they don’t get into trouble. Management sticks by them even with proof that the error isn’t true. 

Most leadership quits or steps down because they are forced to punish employees for something that isn’t their fault. 

Your commitment will continuously go up despite having no work and blue days. If you can’t hit your commitment because there’s no work you will be punished."
456,,Started out a dream then became a nightmare.,2021-08-16,2.0,Resolution Specialist,The people are the best part. Amenities are nice and the restaurant options are frequent.,Once they went public the culture changed. Commitment is a requirement for the job but it went from obtainable to impossible with every month having more points that you can claim being taken away. 80 % of the department is on a personal improvement plan which should show the higher ups that the team members aren't the problem.
457,,Great Work Culture,2021-08-15,5.0,Mortgage Loan Closer,"everyone is really nice, great benefits, transparency, and communication between leadership and team members.

I’ve met some of the best people inside of UWM,"Seriously Underpaid, packed on more work from another department with not a single cent more. This company fits the needs of someone who just needs to get a foot In the door. You can move on to a great paying company from the experience from this one."
460,,4 years with UWM,2021-08-13,3.0,"Team Leader, Underwriting",There are many pros about UWM; lots of learning and great training to get into this underwriting field,"The intense amount of works and client service is top of everything , sometimes management take the unreasonable clients over employees."
461,,Mortgages - Hunger Games Edition,2021-08-12,1.0,Senior Underwriter,"Good health insurance, awesome amenities that you’ll never have time to use, opportunities for growth without skills, training w/ no experience, great friendships forged under mutual suffering","Was with this company for 3 years and there’s a lot to unpack. If you are fresh out of college w/ no experience (like I was) this could be a good place to cut your teeth. They’ll train you from the bottom up in the mortgage industry and underwriting. That being said you better be willing to give your blood, sweat, tears, & 1st born child to them.

Your training after initial underwriting excellence class is subpar. You will be thrown into the deep end and you better hope the people around you are willing to help you. They will probably all resent you because they themselves are drowning and can barely hit their own numbers. Nobody has been trained well at the company for years so even if they wanted to help you, a ton of people have no idea what they’re doing. Most of our clients are also similarly clueless as to UW requirements and will fight you tooth and nail on things that should be a no brainer. I’ve seen co-workers be reduced to tears on the phone from how cruel some of these clients are.
Anyways, once you get up to speed, you will have no work life balance. Firm 40 hrs/week is just one of the flavors of Kool-Aid they’ll try to funnel down your throat. You will come in early/stay late even when there aren’t enough loans to go around. Because of course they still expect you to hit your numbers when there’s no work available. In addition to this you better make sure you answer EVERY single phone call that comes through and follow the script perfectly. The script turns everyone into a robot and even our clients hate it. However, it does seem that they love that they can verbally abuse the UWs without you being allowed to even so much as defend yourself - don’t forget, you’re always being recorded.

They also have CR’s (client requests) which are singlehandedly the most demoralizing initiative imaginable. These requests come through relentlessly at all hours of the day. You are timed on answering them so you must stop everything you’re doing to respond to stupid questions for the brokers that they could have done a 10 sec google search to find. Did I mention if they don’t like your answer (which is 75% of the time) they will respond negatively to them and they’ll be sent to your team lead? These are unlimited so you can get 5+ at a time from the same client. We also have USnaps which are videos we have to send of ourselves to the clients everyday when we work on one of their files. You don’t have a choice to send them or not. Fun fact is that you can see how many times these videos get viewed by the individual you send them to. I actually stopped sending these to male clients because certain ones would creepily watch them over and over again upwards of 20 times. But god forbid I complain as upper management is a void that views you as a negative person if you so much as dare to complain about anything. They are extremely out of touch and would much prefer you just be a yes man.

So overall in what is supposed to be an 8hr day I was expected to do 9 initial underwrites all of which I would have to both email/call out on, complete whatever files came back to me for income & occupancy conditions (Sr. Queues) which could be upwards of 10+ a day within no more than 4 hours from time received, send 2-5 videos, answer every single call all day which was around from 5-15 calls of varying lengths, complete all CR’s immediately of which I could receive up to 20 in a day, respond to all emails within 3 hours, complete all training assignments the day they were assigned most times as management would threaten to fire you if any of your assignments weren’t completed by the time they randomly dictated, and attend all meetings of which we had one every single day, an hour long training meeting every Wed and another hour long company meeting every month. (How’s that for a run-on sentence?!) Couple this w/ the lack of flexibility to work from home even when our jobs can be effectively done remotely and you’ve got a recipe for mass employee PTSD and burnout.

But don’t worry, you can work all that stress out at the on-site gym. Or perhaps keep yourself going w/ some free pop and get your game on in the arcade. Oh whoops, sorry I forgot - if you’re lucky you’ll only have time to use the restroom so forget about utilizing all those amenities/perks. They’ll kind of just pleasantly taunt you in the background. And that forced unpaid lunch that is supposed to promote “balance”? Yeah, you likely won’t be able to take that either and will work through it just so you don’t have to stay in office until 9pm. But hey, at least it kept me skinny. Best part is if you’re salaried as a Sr. UW there’s no overtime pay so you’re not getting compensated for any of your extra work. Speaking of not getting compensated, you better make sure you keep that loan quality up or they’ll snatch away your bonus in a heartbeat.

To sum it up, if you’re extremely desperate and don’t know your own worth, be my guest. May the odds be ever in your favor."

Also company is super young and I’m 26 but the managers are as young as 23 and they are unprofessional with language. Lots of loud cursing and joking and you can hear it on the phone."

""Firm 40"" means mandatory overtime because it's cheaper to pay OT than bonuses. Lied endlessly over safety procedures during 2020 Covid. Higher-ups play favorites which means Team Leads who can pep you up to overwork, but can't actually give you answers or actively sabotage others who try to work hard. They will find months-old errors to justify not paying out a bonus. They pay people more to hire in at a higher position than those who are promoted up. Mat Ishbia was happy to have more ""inventory"" on the market because people were being foreclosed on due to the pandemic. You will have random new processes thrown at you because their practices let errors slip by constantly, and then they won't pay you for it.

The former head of IT training was a mean guy. One of his subsequent replacements got fired for what was rumored to be inappropriate relationships with his trainees.
The pay bumps were meager. They used to have bonuses in application development but they were cancelled w/out explanation.
There is career development like I mentioned in the pros section, but it took over a year for them to make it.
Team Leads were forced to come into the office at the height of Covid-19 and we were told this was so investors could see people working. 
All IT came back to the office in July of this year. There is no more work-from-home, even if you're sick. A lot of employees start with12 days of PTO.
Lastly, there's a bit of a skills gap and consistent production issues."

-Wanted us to hit our commitment everyday even when we had no loans in the queue to work. 
-Promotion was based on favoritism more than actual performance. 
-I think the worse thing was I put in my two weeks and then found out a few days later that it was my last day because “not enough loans” for everyone.

They cram you in to the smallest space possible on a wide open floor so that all eyes and cameras are always on you. Everything is about production. To survive you must produce. If you don't make your quota they will force you to work overtime and you will be publicly listed and called out at meetings. If you do make your quota then they will continue to raise your quota even higher, literally every month. You have no say whether or not your quota goes up. Every aspect of the job is public. Your entire team will know your quota and whether or not you hit it. The managers roam the isles periodically throughout the day to ensure compliance. They will ask you out loud how far you are on your quota and then publicly shame or praise you to serve as an example for the team. Once the pandemic happened in 2020 they were forced to send many of the staff to work off site. This gave them even more leverage. They threatened to send, ""under-producers"", back to the office in the middle of the pandemic. This was in spite of the fact that there were multiple positive COVID cases at the office. This was also at the height of the virus, before the vaccine. They used it as leverage. They threatened to send staff back to work in the building if quotas weren't met.

They understand they have a company culture problem but instead of fixing it, they put lipstick on a pig by giving us free candy bars and having a gym on campus that most people never have time to use. They also pay under industry standards even though they are currently making more money than ever before. I felt because I had no personal life I was always working early, late, and on weekends.

Literal fighting, people cheat and steal loans just to hit an unreasonable commitment. I could write a million things, but UWM pays someone to negate these negative reviews saying 'only the people let go write negative reviews' so that should really tell you something.

549,,"Manipulative, innefficient, micromanaging leadership style.  Doublespeak and Big Brother style monitoring abounds",2021-06-18,1.0,Underwriter II,"Many excellent coworkers and Team Leads (UWM doesn’t deserve 90% of people they employ.), some in-office perks for the few with the time and energy to enjoy them, low-level living wage early into underwriting track for those that need an immediate income","If you like to work in peace, pass on this job. 
Not only does UWM like to monitor and score everything— files worked, calls, meeting attendance, etc. 

You will be interrupted all the time by both brokers who are allowed to call, email, AND use timed internal messages called Client Requests, as well as by management who like to undermine the underwriters work by insisting on many unnecessary meetings, as well as “academy” items that include videos, quizzes, etc. that have due dates. 

The best part of the interruptions is that your production quota is never lowered. Recently, the entire in-office staff had to sit in the hot sun for an hour or hour-plus “rally.” Production numbers were not reduced at all for this company mandated event.

Seeing as how everyone has a “commitment” (aka quota) one might think that people are assessed individually, which they are, but the system is setup so that your team and team lead can suffer if you had a bad day or tough files. There is a commitment that they expect the group you’re in to hit as well. So, others are supposed to make up for a lacking team member.

By the way, your commitment is arbitrarily set by the company when raised from the initial commitment of eleven; it’s not based on math, but by whatever the company decides. When I really pressed for clarification as to how it was figured after they raised mine by 8 files a week, I was answered with silence. 

Also, commitment is reached by earning “points,” but an easy file is weighed the same as a difficult file. Because of this, the closer one follows the rules the worse of a time they will have, as some people cherry-pick easy files.

If you like autonomy or being treated with respect as a trusted adult employee, stay away. The job, especially when you start, is unnecessarily stressful, and the company is too self-congratulatory to amend any of its ways. 

Also, most employees work 10-7 or later, which is terrible in it’s own right, but the “firm 40” is a pure lie on top of it. So, if you want energy or time for life outside of work forget about it. 

The company in many ways seems to be a reflection of its CEO. While I do not feel he is intentionally malicious to his employees, I do think he may have workaholic tendencies which are being reflected in his company’s operations. And his emphasis on in-person work conflicts with the desires of many of his employees. He projects his personal desire for everyone to return to the office openly in speeches and interviews where his sweeping generalizations state that the majority of employees want to be back. I know several of my coworkers and myself preferred working at home. And I envision a near future where many people leave the company for remote opportunities.

Overall, not a great place to work. Too many nonsensical and sometimes childish time-wasters on top of the constant interruptions. Unfortunately, there are many young workers that do not know that they have other options and that not all companies treat you with the level of implicit and explicit disrespect found at UWM."

560,,Schrodinger's Feedback (Long Entry - Grab popcorn),2021-06-10,2.0,Software Developer,"The people - my god, the people! The friendships gained by working here are beyond what could have ever been asked for. Like any other business, there are sour apples, but beyond that, most of the people that can be met ""on the floor"" are some of the most genuine and kind-hearted individuals. Build your network and generate as much loyalty as you possibly can. It will be your rock if you decide to work here.

It is likely you will start at UWM in an entry level position. If there's one thing to praise UWM for, it is their desire to train and give almost anyone a chance at a career they only dreamt of.

Depending on the individual(s) you are speaking to, feedback can go a long way, and the change you're looking for can be immediate. Further detail on the flipside of this in Cons.

This place will teach a great many wonderful lessons that you will carry with you for the rest of your career. While the Cons section will certainly be longer than the Pros section, please understand that you will walk away from this company fulfilled and happy with what you accomplished here.

In conclusion, there are good things at UWM. Skills, genuine friendships, and social intelligence to be gained in abundance. In many cases, there are glass ceilings. You will be limited in ways that seem nonsensical, and, believe me, they are. However, if you stay focused, you will benefit greatly from working here. Don't let the rest of it distract you.","This is attempt number four to get this section through. If you see it, that's our counter!

As indicated by several (dozen) other reviews, Underwriting is a mess. The recent 500+ person classes are an indication, in my eyes, that they are looking to somehow retain above a certain metric of individuals (""bodies""), fully expecting a good majority to ""not make it""/leave before 6 months have passed. This belies a leadership organization that has found the crux of a zero-sum game, choosing instead to gun the throttle despite the eventual potential of the engine (their talent pool) flagging and breaking down. It is believed to be inadvisable to have your most crucial operational structure at risk of snapping at every opportunity to meet ""expectations"" - a word that may be inaccurate, in this sense, perhaps ""demands"" is better.

Then there's IT. Organizationally speaking, it mirrors a similar structure to Operations. Meaning, skill and knowledge are sidelined in lieu of getting more people up and running to address as much as possible. In a skilled trade, like anything in IT, your knowledge is your sword and shield. Your usefulness is directly measured by your critical thinking skills. What can be assured is that very few individuals are brought into the fold - fresh as babes - with any of these aforementioned skills. Pair that with a massive legacy system and no stable means of properly explaining it in a concise manner, and you've got yourself a volatile situation - a Jenga tower waiting to be toppled.

As far as leadership, it is painful to say that there are those present that don't meet the criteria of being a successful or, even, thoughtful leader.

Think of your basic, run-of-the-mill middle manager. They're the most numerous in any business, have less power than their subordinates, and some even resent their direct reports for it. They are ""P6"" without actually being ""P6"". Language is strictly policed, to the point where, in many cases, if an individuals has no way of following their training in terms of communication, they will either shut down and not say anything at all, or belittle/condescend to the person they're speaking. To this end, feedback tends to stop at this level if they feel the feedback is a lost cause, or ""beyond their control"". The most disappointing part about this is the self-defeating nature of that mentality. It makes employees feel worthless because they're not positive idea factories. Not every idea will be positive.

Couple this with the ""romance"" mentality some may still carry for the company. Experiences being varied and different as a rule, the mentality isn't strictly at fault, though it can be said that the application of this mentality is certainly a problem. As drinking the kool-aid goes, the pitcher has been tipped all the way back (without spilling), drinking greedily. While not relegated to one type, the ""romance"" mentality tends to gravitate more strongly around referred hires, though it claims everyone in the beginning. This clouds judgment, and removes holistic thinking around a big-picture perspective of the company and its operation. Were this just localized, this wouldn't be a problem, however, it exists throughout the company. Like the previous paragraph, not everything is going to be positive. ""Perseverance"" is a word everyone should become well acquainted with, as well as ""Adversity"".

Then comes a liberal application of the Peter Principle. Again, not a unique item for a company with over 9,000 employees, however, it is worth at least a brief mention. Being promoted to inevitable incompetence is a bottleneck waiting to happen. Preferential treatment is one of the many ways these promotions occur. High producers are not always going to be great leaders. An apt socialite isn't always going to have the communication or organizational skills necessary to be effective. While one of the pillars says, ""Continuous Improvement"", there should be a limit to how much time is afforded to an individual on their performance and efficacy. Sometimes, ""a little improvement"" just isn't good enough. That's okay, too.

Worst yet are the processes that exist solely to be ignored. It is entirely possible for someone in IT to go an entire day - sometimes even weeks - without doing anything, and it isn't noticed. Leaders must delegate and facilitate their teams. They are not there to avalanche themselves with work and ignore their subordinates. Knowledge is not something to be horded. It should be obvious and frowned upon for this to exist. A project can have degrees of importance - that is how they are prioritized - however, in a department that is at its largest size since its inception at UWM, no one team should be sidelined in favor of another.

Bias abounds in UWM, without check or balance. This bias causes these above situations. It brings the unqualified - maybe even undeserving - into positions of power to spread that aforementioned bias further. There is chaos and carnage caused by its existence. There may eventually be a point where this bias ekes its way into UWM's most crucial infrastructure. At that point, its removal would risk collapse, a concept that becomes more real as time marches on. There are those present at UWM that showcase this issue endemic to the entirety of the company's culture. As the quote, ""It's not what you know, it's who you know,"" goes. Simply put, there are people employed there that shouldn't be. Everyone has their rights, and it's a sensible belief that people deserve a chance at redemption and rehabilitation. However, that being said, what has been witnessed and seen time and again at UWM from the people referenced tell me that they haven't learned anything, and have been given more than enough chances.

In all of this, there was a very good period that was cherished, then the curve of the horizon can be seen. Plainly, its likely the treatment of its employees won't get any better. The beginning of 2020 pulled back the curtain just enough for those that witnessed it to see the uncaring and out of touch nature of those behind it. Those married to the company. Those seemingly taught never to accept defeat and push for a win, no matter the cost. People whose vision is so narrow, so fixated on that victory, that it may come back to bite them in the end. The beginning of 2020 wasn't the first ultimatum, the Fairway/Quicken contract certainly wasn't the second. Underwriting and Closing knows better than anyone how many obscured and ""unspoken"" (see the other reviews) ultimatums delivered behind closed doors. Those demands can get worse and more frequent. It's a shame that these things aren't being showcased as poor practice, but then again, these are the same people that may have made (spoken vaguely on purpose) comments about introverts and their personalities. The same people we watched silently lose their minds over a team huddling for the morning without their Team Leads, spending an extra minute or so in blissful relief at not having to answer the phones for a bit longer.

While there certainly were positives, the negatives quickly overtook them. The channels that exist to provide feedback and attempt to facilitate change are regularly ignored in lieu of preferred language, instead of opening a dialogue. It is unfortunate, and something that needs to change. Maybe, one day, someone with the ability to make that difference will see this review, and act accordingly."

Be ready to work hard and have fun doing it.","Specific to IT professionals: there is no work from home policy, salaries can be on the low end of the competitive spectrum and everyone must clock in and out. These are probably three of the biggest complaints I hear around the IT floor at UWM.

571,,For a first job ok,2021-06-05,5.0,Underwriter,Salary is good and benefits are too,Hours and clients can treat you poorly
572,,Don’t do it,2021-06-04,1.0,Underwriter II,"Paid Holidays, generous PTO in first year, free coffee, soft drinks and tea","I will start off by saying that this job was not for me. I was thankful to be given the opportunity to work here as COVID hit and have job security. I just truly feel that all the wonderful things preached are not practiced after a year and a half of working there. New hire groups upwards of 300-500 often, the company is growing quickly, but many are leaving. 

The PTO time is great, I never had any issues taking time off but, use it sparingly because when it is gone, it is gone. There are special circumstances where unpaid time can be taken, but is very frowned upon. You get a generous 10 days in your first year.

I was promoted to Underwriting within a year of working on the Closing Team. Closing was not a fun time, it is a call center. You are required to be logged into the phones for your full 8 hour shift and may take upwards of 20-30 calls a day which count towards your commitment. The brokers and title agents could be VERY unpleasant to deal with. The portal the clients use is 90% self serve, but they will not take advantage of it primarily because they do not know how to use it and the Account Executives would not take the time to walk them through it, rather just tell them to call closing assist, they’ll do it. I found more often than not I was fighting for work to do daily, outside of calls and if you did not hit your commitment or if you were not within the floor average, you have to give a detailed explanation as to why. You can’t use the excuse that there wasn’t adequate work to complete, or your calls might have been long, you had to point out your own flaws and what you could do better. Mandatory late night shift once a month where you are required to work 2 hours extra.

Anyways, Underwriting. 10am-7pm shift time, no other choice unless you are within the top 10% of underwriters you may have the opportunity to change your shift time depending on availability. This is evaluated every 6 months.

The firm 40 preached is non-existent more often than not if you want to reach your daily commitment goals. Mandatory 2 hours of overtime every other week, but they will provide free pizza in office on those overtime days. The bonus structure is nice, but at what cost. 

The internal auditing team seems to work against other internal teams in giving errors. It is nice to have your work reviewed and be advised if you did something incorrectly, in the long run can ultimately save the company money but there are times when the “error” you receive is not an error at all. You have the option to fight it if approved by your Team Lead. Rather than having the error removed, they will reduce the level of error.. these will affect your bonus. There are strict processes you must follow when entering data and if it is not in the internal job aids, you are wrong. Mind you, the job aids don’t always supply all of the information you need, or may not be updated.

The brokers have a client request tool they usually just use to skip turn time, they may re-escalate the request an unlimited amount of times if they do not like to response they receive. These request do not count towards your commitment and ultimately slow you down and may hold you back from reaching your daily goals. Newly required you must send a minimum of 2 “usnap” videos to brokers when you work on their files. So not only are you required to email out and call the client (based on their preference) you have to also send a 30 second video of yourself advising of the file you worked. If someone on your team does not hit commitment, the rest of the team is expected to pick up the slack. 

The jobs are demanding, stressful, and underpaid compared to industry standards. They will train you, and pay you for the training but once you hit the floor it’s like you never went through training at all. The perks and benefits are great but you won’t have time to use them. Food selection for lunch is out of this world and there is even a little convenience store in the building with anything you could ever need. Starbucks on site. Free soda, tea and coffee. 

Majority of people working there are great people and you will undoubtedly make new friends. Personally did not have any issues with management. 

UWM is doing remarkable things for the broker channel and the industry as a whole, but you start to feel like the brokers are more important than the people in the building. I would have liked to see more realistic expectations for staff and better pay for the work being done. Made the decision to part ways after a year and a half. The job was not for me, but may be a good fit for you."

574,,Great Company with the Best People!,2021-06-03,5.0,Talent Team Member,"I have worked for many companies in my past which included retail, hospitality, mortgages and advertising. Some of those were good and some were not as good which made me appreciate being a team member at UWM. Knowing what's out there made me value my time at UWM immensely and I never took that for granted. It's a culture that is built on caring for it's team members and you can feel that the moment you walk in the door. UWM was always my home away from home with an amazing work family that I loved to be part of. 

I think it's easy to look at imperfections when you are looking for them and the reality is no company is perfect but when you find a company that truly puts it people first you need to remember how rare that is and UWM takes pride in doing whatever it can to allow each team member the opportunity to learn, grow and be successful in whatever they want to do. Anything you want you do achieve you can, you just need to work hard and be positive. That is a the recipe for success and if you ask me, it's doesn't get much better than UWM! 

I am grateful for my almost 3 years and hope to return to UWM one day. Please trust me when you read this, if you are looking for a place to be able to accomplish things you never dreamed of, this is the place for you. You will get incredible training to set you up for success which starts on the FIRST WEEK. I can't think of any other place that takes that much time and care to build a strong foundation right from the beginning. You will work hard and there will be tough days, but your team and leader will be there every step of the way with you and you will get to be part of something that is bigger than yourself. Your role no matter what team is essential to the success of the company and in mortgages you can truly change lives which is what having a career is all about.

588,,"Nice healthcare, UWM does not care about employees",2021-05-25,1.0,Post Closing Specialist,Great employer subsidized healthcare. Couldn't ask for better. A couple of nice coworkers,"The CEO Mat Ishbia states he's open to any suggestions to better the company, but anyone who would prefer to work from home was suggested to quit. Seems like Mat Ishbia doesn't actually want to hear from his employees, and keep his company as outdated and out of touch. Mat made the decision for every employee that we would all be happier in office. I don't think he should be allowed to make sweeping generalizations like that. Many of us would prefer to save on gas, and not sacrifice precious hours to driving back and forth from the office. The hours are already long with a mandatory one hour lunch. At home it's a 40 hour week, but in office it easily turns to 50, when you add the commute and hour lunch. 

I think if he wants us to come back to office, he should cut our hours down or give us all a raise. Not to mention the pollution from having 8000 employees driving everyday, the plastic factories that are the cafeterias, (UWM has recycling, but 80% of plastic ends up in the dump no matter what).
 
UWM claims to have work/life balance, but 50 hour weeks in office leaves very little mental energy let alone time in the day to do anything. 
Mat needs to let people work from home permanently. He isn't counting his privilege of being able to afford childcare so he can live at work. 

They handled covid horribly. My training class was a couple of weeks long, mandatory in person, and it all could've been done remotely. They didn't require masks while in the building, and did not disclose when someone in our group got covid. So people would just disappear and no one warned us.

- The Be You culture, the on-site amenities, and some of the perks","- The work/life balance is non-existent. In training, we were told we would be working a ""Firm 40"" (besides the mandatory extra hours every other Tuesday). But, in order to hit commitment for the day, especially when first starting out, it's rare to be able to leave on time. A lot of people have to stay extra hours every night and even then don't always hit the commitment goals.
- The way commitment works: you get the same amount of points for an easy file compared to a difficult file so most people predatorily pick and choose their files to work for the day. If you get stuck with a difficult file, it can be impossible to hit your production for the day. No extra points for the extra work.
- When starting out on the floor after training, it can be hard to find help. Despite the weeks of training, there is still so much that they did not prepare you for and you're pretty much expected to figure it out yourself (some leaders are more helpful than others)
- I see multiple breakdowns every week from the stress everyone is under. Not just from the difficult production commitments, but from getting yelled at by brokers.

So compensation. Mat really likes pointing out how his leadership style is similar to what he learned from his player/coach days for the MSU Spartans (now) Presented by Rocket Mortgage. You know what else the NCAA model is known for? Abusing it's star athletes and not properly allowing for compensation despite what they bring in. You get an education, we make billions. Seems on point Mat.

Firm 40? Those Rise and Grinds and ""Late Night's"" that supposedly aren't mandatory but you ""have"" to ""make up if you miss"" contradicts this.

We're family here! Yeah you know how some families are verbally abusive, cult like with psychological conditioning, and how the cute popular one seems to get away with everything while the straight A student gets the whip for an A-? You now understand why there are so many curiously under-experienced people in VP/AVP roles.

""People are Our Greatest Asset"" you hear this a lot, so here's some free advice. When you refer to people as anything other than people....you probably aren't treating them like people. See... assets are a commodity and that makes sense. You can leverage, discard, threaten, abuse, undervalue, overutilize, manipulate, and a whole slew of other things to assets and no one bats an eye. Doing those same things to people well....that's bad for your image.

"" We are Thumb Pointers Not Finger Pointers""  except when the company that is #1 in technology has their whole system crash (regularly) and you can't admit it to clients. Bonus points, if it's down for 4 hours you still have to hit your 8 hour production....by staying past your firm 40!
 
There was a big announcement at the start of the pandemic about how there would be no lay-offs which was quickly followed by a daily video you had to watch that day or it would be considered ""a resignation"". Neat way of avoiding the word ""fire"" or ""lay off"". Plus there were daily reminders that we could be let go (which is odd since MI is a right to work state where this is a thing anyways) Not sure why instilling such fear was the go-to move when there was already enough fear and uncertainty with Covid starting.

Underwriting is a mess, all the real talent left during the beginning of the pandemic. For every good leader you have there are 5 that are in it for their bonuses and will make you do things such as cancel a closing because the CLUW is about to breach SLA when a phone call would fix it....because the SLA is there for the client right? the client comes first right? No wonder there hasn't been any stop to all the cherry picking. You get your numbers and I get mine so keep it moving!

Operations is hit or miss but the signs were showing that it was no longer following its own ""How We Do It's"" before the company even moved to Pontiac, but I still see some good ones in Lending Support.

Post Closing is run by the cliché equivalent of a middle school yearbook committee possessed by the characters from ""Mean Girls"".

Closing has some good people there too but honestly between the growth and mass exodus of talent it's all a mess. IT has the historical issues you will typically find in that realm plus the added bonus of not really working for a real IT company with IT company like hours since we are effectively a M-F 9-7 customer service call center .

Training in general is a bona-fide course in data entry to their systems and heavy propaganda on the culture that this company has been completely failing to live up to since it moved to Pontiac. Your ability to learn roles/guidelines is purely reliant on your ability to disseminate information and your own personal competencies since getting help is unreliable at best when everyone has their own unrealistic production numbers to hit.

And Covid , this place is not safe nor do they respect how dangerous this is. People were already getting sick (some even mysteriously) more frequently upon the move to the way more open(which only exacerbates the whole issue with an airborne virus.) Pontiac HQ well before the pandemic. Expressing concerns led to terminations.

All in all that's a lot of cons, so make sure you read the other reviews and look for patterns. I'll give UWM credit that they are more willing than most to train people with zero experience, and if you are coming from really bad industries like retail/hospitality this may be a step up. Just know there are a handful of other companies who do mortgages in this area that have better benefits, culture, covid precautions (work from home, and more serious protocols in office), and most importantly compensation. Just know that these places may be harder to get into since they are efficient and don't address workload by throwing a mass of untrained people at it.

And if you do come on board, don't trust anyone that has been here for more than 3 years, we're all snakes that sacrificed our integrity long ago for bonuses."

Nice Starbucks on site, cafeteria food was good.","The Underwriter training was stressful and pointless. We had quizzes everyday and if you didn’t pass you had to retake the quiz the next day. The training was on a point scale so if you didn’t have the select amount of points at the end of training they would move you to a job within UWM with lower pay and not a job that you originally applied for. Their were 500 people in my underwriter orientation training. At the end of training around 400 were left. People quit left and right because of how mentally draining the training was. UWM is famous for their micromanaging. You would be yelled at if you had your phone out or if you were talking to your neighbor and if you didn’t clock in exactly at 9am you would be scolded for it. You couldn’t clock in a few min early. Early on, I was very excited to start my career at UWM until I eventually saw how 2 faced management was and how easy UWM hires people. They hire anybody which is why their orientations are 300+ people every 2 weeks. If I were you I would not dare work for UWM. On social media and TV they make it look like a dream company to work for, but until you experience it yourself, you’ll realize that it’s just a farm."

635,,Run. Don’t waste your time.,2021-05-03,1.0,Team Leader,The friendships I have made and continue to have from my time here.,"As a former employee let me give you a fare warning and say that working at UWM is not worth the toll it takes on your mental health and stress. Take all the negative reviews seriously and don’t fall for the 5 star fluff that UWM “encourages” employees to write to overshadow the truth. 

Within the last year UWM has probably lost 100 of their best underwriters. Many people have left and found a company to work for that not only values them but doesn’t give unrealistic expectations. Let me break out these expectations so you get a true understanding. Whether you are an underwriter 2 or a senior underwriter you have a commitment. The commitment portion of the job is not what’s hard. It’s everything in between that gets in the way of underwriting itself. Client service is important to UWM, which is understandable, but UWM takes it to a level that quite frankly is disgustingly excessive. For one they have a process in place called ‘no call left behind’ which means whenever you are at your desk and a client calls you must pick up that phone. Whenever you get up to use the bathroom, go on lunch, or simply take a short break you must forward your call to your phone buddy. Not only is that not fair to you but in turn you are already overwhelming somebody else who is already stressed. The second is commitment. No day is every the same. Some days you may have a great day while others may come with more calls, more difficult files etc. There is not much wiggle room there. If you’re having a bad day be prepared to stay as long as it takes to hit your commitment so you don’t feel the guilt or get the disappointment talk the next day. My next point comes in to the fact that brokers can talk to and do absolutely whatever they want to get their way. Underwriters get calls scored each month which much effort is put into call coaching for underwriters and all the tips in the book to brown nose brokers but as soon as a broker gets angry or doesn’t get there way look out. By no means is every client this way but there are more negative conversations that happen from brokers that the company lets slide by because obviously business is more important. 

Being somewhere for over 4 years and seeing such a drastic change from my time first with the company to the end is quite sad. I left QL for the better alternative and as much as Mat has tried to be different, UWM, is just another sweat shop like QL with high turn over rates due to everything mentioned above. UWM likes to prey on new graduates or individuals with no experience with these catchy “best place” to work mottos but in the end they are just going to over work you. Being once one of those graduates and keep looking because you deserve better. Finding a place that values you and where You don’t need to constantly be micro managed is possible. Once you’re in, UWM, makes you feel stuck and always hides behind their non compete clauses. Fare warning that if you do decide to work here look deep at the new hire paper work. You could be signing something without knowing. They don’t make it obvious that you are signing a non compete clause. Just like their failure with having brokers sign their contract to not work with QL and Fairway their non compete is just the same. Ignore the noise and truly think about what you want and what is your why and drive. If it’s stress and anxiety this may be the place for you. 

Before any of you VPs respond with your negative comments or hypocrisy of “sorry you weren’t a good fit for UWM” I would like to say I am sorry that myself and the many many other truly experienced underwriters that have left we’re not a good fit for you. Good luck with the constant mass hiring sprees and the high turn over with inexperienced workers because you lost some of your most valuable employees."

I would not recommend for employment or as a consumer being involved with UWM. A perfect example of the bait and switch. What you see is not what you get.

642,,Not as it seems,2021-04-27,1.0,Underwriter,Nothing comes to mind at all.,"-Need to quit lying about firm 40 Underwriting literally has built in forced overtime called “Rise and Grind”

-They talk about all these perks on site which would be really cool if we weren’t chained to our desk by our phones (unacceptable to miss a call) and Client Requests.

-Speaking of Client Requests these are basically a special form of email the brokers can use to torture you with and it is unacceptable to let one go for too long without a response or to get a negative response from the client.

-Team Leads are not leading anything. They are not available to you and only respond through emails.

-Nothing negative can be expressed at all for fear of being labeled a “bad culture fit” 

-Team members are FAR from the most important thing to UWM, production is king and you cannot miss your production “commitment”

- “Commitment” is raised with no basis or math to support even tho they claim it’s based on your “best week” it will raise no matter what.....only way it doesn’t is if they performance review you out of your position or the company.

-I haven’t taken a full lunch in I couldn’t even tell you how long and this commonplace amongst the underwriting floor (but you had better have your four punches on your time card because ya know “work life balance” and “firm 40”)

-Leadership as a whole is immature, this is especially true for direct leadership, or “team leads” (in quotations because again they lead no one and nothing) as the vast majority of them got their role through popularity and have no idea what their doing. 

-It has been stated here several times in UWM’s responses that we are “over staffed by design” to “ensure no one will ever have to work more than 40 hours” okay great, than why do our individual performance goals keep going up? The same goals that force us to stay late to achieve them. 

-We are forced to prop up our “industry leading technology” it’s garbage. IT is over worked and lacks experience as a whole. We must lie to our clients because if we state on the phone we’re experiencing  “tech issues” or “slowness” which happens often we will be penalized in our call scores.

I could go on, but in conclusion if you think the cons section of this review vastly outweighs the pros.....well that sorta says it all doesn’t it?"

Unlike a lot places I've worked, even if you don't know how to play the game, there is still a lot of room for advancement. 

Like other places I've worked, they say ""we're a family"" all the time. Unlike other places I've worked, we really are, almost even more so during COVID. 

There are a lot of really terrific people here. It's easy sometimes to look around a meeting or room and realize that so much of what gets accomplished here is due to good people who care about what they do. It's also easy to realize that it's because we spend so much time cultivating the environment (at least in IT) for good people to become great. 

We have a pretty good senior leadership team. The CTO cares a lot about doing right by IT and the people in it. He demands a lot of us as other leaders to be a ""people leader with a technology background"" and focusing on coaching and mentoring cross functional teams across all of IT. 

There is a lot of transparency from most of senior leadership so all IT team members know what is happening with other teams in IT and communication and collaboration is touted and highly encouraged. 

In IT, we don't work off of a budget. It we need to introduce any new tooling and it makes sense to try it out or purchase outright, we get it. All new ideas are vetted quickly and typically moved on if it makes sense.","Just like any company, there are for sure some issues that are difficult to work through. 

We are asked to move too fast for the amount of work that we have to do, which causes problems for everyone in trying to keep up with both quality and speed.

For good portions of my time here (and still now) IT is treated like an other production unit at any part of the company. Our resources are always pulled to go after any problem, at any time, to chase requests. A lot of this seems to come from the fact that IT rolls up through Operations, and even though the Chief Operating Officer is great, she doesn't understand IT and asks for it to be treated like all of her other production teams. While this is incredibly frustrating for all of us, the CTO and the COO do work well together to try to make this better, but so much more needs to be done to allow the IT team to be run as an IT organization.

Other senior leaders need more alignment with the overall IT vision. It's one thing to hear it, it's another to see it in action all the time. We have some amazing senior leaders and others that need to get into alignment with everyone."

Juicy, high school drama every day","Mat Ishbia, eccentric billionaire that made his money exploiting the pandemic and hiring desperate people with his propaganda machine. You’re not late! You’re tardy. You’re not at work! You’re at a campus. Look at the monitors all over the south building, how many employees do you think noticed in the background the words “work hard” on a lot of their apps. Sure, you’re glancing at the monitors a hundred times a day, eventually it’ll settle into your subconscious.

Leadership. Male leaders can’t wait to sexually harass all the new Female hires. They are afraid to speak out because there’s such a toxic “clique” culture just like high school. They preach “inclusivity” but employees will laugh at any ethnic name that comes up on their loans and share it internally for a giggle.


Toxic Positivity is rampant. Nothing gets addressed because they don’t wanna hurt IT’s feelings because IT has a lot of internally hired people with zero IT experience. Most of them don’t know how to code or know any programming language. 

You are a number to them and if you don’t produce for them and make Ishbia richer, you are trash. If you make a mistake and it hurts your leader’s metrics, you are trash. Here’s your coaching opportunity, by the way, if we fire you, sign this non-compete clause so we can sue your 22 year old self if you try to apply elsewhere.

Account Executives are on that white powder most of the time which is why UWM is now considering putting in a drug policy. Poor Underwriters can’t stop bouncing their legs because of all the adderall they take to function in that place. Both buildings look like a sad sweatshop with people’s sad little desk decorations to at least give them some hope in that depressing place.

You are there 9 hours a day and at least one or two hours is taken up with mindless huddles talking nothing but metrics. You will be assigned tasks, academies, stupid videos with Ishbia flailing his arms around because the man cannot stand still. The man is a neurotic liar living in an alternate reality.

They took advantage of the pandemic to hire desperate people who got laid off only to make them feel like they’re nothing without UWM. The infrastructure wasn’t there to support 8,000 employees. Sales force crashes if you stare at it. Destiny blows. All poorly coded software that is constantly crashing. Do you think your commitment is adjusted for when that happens? Heck no! Just keep CRUSHING it.

I sincerely worry about people’s private information being out there with these work from home employees. You think as a Borrower giving complete access to all the documents in the loan process to a kid in his 20s? Your information is constantly shared internally to make fun of your name, your employment, even the dream house you worked so hard towards. Guarantee there’s a more than enough UWM employees just cackling away at your private room information through Microsoft Teams.

Overall, bad experience. Would not recommend to anyone unless you’re willing to swallow anything that makes you an individual and sacrifice yourself for the cult like mentality of the people who stick around and drink the Kool-Aid.

I didn’t write this review because I was a bad employee which what UWM states all these poor reviews are written by. They literally say that to a training class of hundreds of new employees every week."

As the company grew from several years ago the mindset changed, things were family oriented and became numbers oriented. The pillars used to be real, they're now so hollow they could never stand in reality. The micromanagement is out of control, which is mind boggling because upper middle management are paid so little that I cannot pinpoint what motivates such behavior. I had to threaten the employment of team members during a pandemic because of production issues...you know, when this started and all loans stopped flowing. I had to be a cog in the wheel of that disgusting machine that makes people fear being unemployed, people who were adults and older than myself in some cases, making 16 an hour. The CEO said, for literally years, ""We are a family company! We are never going public!""  which is hilarious when you see how it played out:

My new hires were told that the CEO does not enjoy being home with family but rather would prefer to be at the office...Which is likely due to the activities he participated in immediately preceeding the ending of his marriage... but wait, such a high profile man who owns a private company getting divorced would cost untold-""WE ARE GOING PUBLIC!"" Ah, there's the rub. He cares about his money, being ""number 1"" which must feel really good from the mountain of people on whose back you stand. It's a sweatshop of threats and low wages. 

At least Quicken is up front about the atmosphere. This place has the gall to lie to you about that and pay you in soda and coffees."

I wish I would have started sooner.,No cons that I can see so far!
705,,"Great, if You Loved High School!",2021-03-01,2.0,Account Executive,- The people you are going to work with are awesome.,"I took this as my first job out of college. I have a Business Degree from Eli Broad - Michigan State University. I feel that UWM was not completely honest with me when interviewing for this position. Some of the main things I did not like about the position are below:
- Very similar to a locker room culture - Not Professional Workplace
- First of all to better understand the job you are going to be convincing mortgage brokers that it is worth thousands of dollars of their customers money to make the job easier for them, the mortgage broker, at the cost of their customer. Essentially anyone that cared about getting their customer a good deal would laugh you off the phone regardless of what tactic management wants you to use that week (Fast Pass at Disney World). Bottom line it is not worth closing a week or 2 early if the loan is going to cost thousands of dollars more.
- Expect your normal day to be run like a varsity sports practice from high school. ""No wasted motion"" means when you are at work you are working. If you are looking for any type of freedom this job isnt for you. You will be FINED $500 for having your PHONE OUT at your desk. 
- Power Blocks - You will be treated like a 9 year old and have a few times a day that you are not allowed to leave your desk (No not even to go to the bathroom) these 30 minute blocks you will be smiling and dialing while your division leader walks around behind you yelling and instructing you to have one of your computer monitors off, the one that isn't Salesforce so you have no distractions. (This unfortunately is not a joke) 
- You will be micro-managed down to 15 minute time intervals, not exaggerating my Division Leader would send out an ""AE Schedule"" we were to follow with time scheduled in 15 minute increments. 
- The accounts they ""give to you"" will mostly be people that have retired or have been burned by UWM in the past. I understand this is part of the job but I don't feel the ""ramp up"" period was accurately portrayed to me in interview. 
- If you do not get enough production from your accounts they will be moved, for example I had a top producing account moved less than one month after ""earning"" it because they needed it for a ""new team"" 
- You will be measured several times a day, you are responsible for getting a ""perfect day"" which is essentially you working for salesforce to show that you are badgering your 17 contacts enough. Some of the metrics you will be measured on will not be in your control (# of 2 minute calls, # of Dials, # of Zoom Meetings with Clients, # of USNAPS) 
-""Run the Play"" management will call a ""play"" when everyone is to be pushing an incentive or program, on these days you will be responsible for calling all of your contacts that day, along with sending an email and a custom video. This leaves you with having to call people multiple times a week asking them for loans. 
- Be prepared to ""Play the game"" to succeed
- In my case my Division Leader had the tactic of intimidating people to try to get more out of them. Unfortunately for him he didn't realize your sales people have to be confident to be successful, that support should come from the top down. My division Prestige performed very poorly compared to the rest of the company and also had a lot of turnover."

707,,So many fake 5* reviews,2021-02-27,1.0,Account Executive,"The people, so many great people you will meet here","It's so funny how many fake 5 star reviews UWM has. It's so clear that the leadership is asked to get on here and review. 95% of them don't even put more than 5 seconds into their 5* amazinggg review. Nothing like stroking your own ego, Linkden posts, facebook posts, all your minions running around posting about the All mighty UWM... Give me a break. This company is terrible, once they became public they sold out.

The bad reviews you read are true, if you read it and don't believe it yet look again in 6 months and tell me your view didn't change. 

This company is lead by fear, I joined this company due to the fact i was tired of working all day everyday and was content to make a modest amount in exchange for a modest pay.

I was told that this is one of the values this company was founded on. In a few short years that was thrown out the window.

Handling of COVID was pathetic and thinking you're bigger than everyone and going to be the first to bring everything back to ""normal"".. Please, you're a mortgage company stay in your lane."

On the outside they seem like such a great company to work for but once you get there you see it’s all lies this pandemic has really showed how much they don’t care about the employees they were forcing people to come back to work rather they felt comfortable or not if their production wasn’t good. Even though there were cases of COVID in the facility. UWM will never be QL!"
719,,A documentary on this place would be a HIT,2021-02-22,1.0,Underwriter II,"This place will take about anyone and give them a job. If you’ve fallen on hard times and this is your only option, go for it.","UWM perplexes me. I have worked here for over a year and have no clue how this place functions. It is so terribly mismanaged. Everything from parking and seating to loan management and leadership is an utter ruin. 

Let’s start with the simple. The company has nearly doubled to 8,000 employees in my roughly year of employment. I don’t have a guess, but I’d say maybe 40% of employees are working from home. If you’re a new or prospective employee, I promise that you will never work from home. Only employees with certain seniority or the ability to hit numbers that come with seniority are able to work from home, and it’s the desire of the CEO to bring everyone back on campus after the pandemic is over. This place is literally bursting at the seams. There is nowhere to park and the campus is running out of desk space, leaving employees to wonder where everyone will sit at the current pace of hiring and when everyone returns to the office. 

UWM is a glorified loan sweatshop with the ambition of becoming the top lender in the United States. The only way that they’ll do this is through pure manpower, which means that leadership is stuffing 400+ person classes onto campus to give them a Zoom training that has somehow won best training program in the world. Yes, you will be expected to attend your Zoom trainings in the office. Sick? Important family event? Too bad, any use of your PTO is frowned upon here but especially while in training. 

After training, you’ll be on the underwriting floor with otherwise great team members who are very much obviously weighed down by the stress that comes with the company’s disregard to human factors and is more concerned with the number of loans you work on a given day. It’s like a looney bin here. There have been so many things that have made me uncomfortable at this place. You will see Team Leads in their twenties (an age group I belong to as well) berate and embarrass older underwriters who are new to the role but have been in the mortgage industry for years. You’ll watch as you slowly start putting off important areas in your life - sleep, your relationship, social life, a balanced diet - in order to meet commitment. People around you will notice and inquire about your health, but it feels rationalized because *all* of your coworkers are experiencing the same type of mental and physical stress that this job brings. 

There aren’t enough loans for us to work since they’ve hired so many new underwriters, so it’s very commonplace to steal coworkers’ files or clock-out to stay later in order to meet your commitment (the number THEY set for you) for the day. This place calls itself a ‘family’ and oh my god it’s so cringe. There is nothing to be considered family in a type of workplace like this."

722,,"Deceitful, Demoralizing, Just Don’t",2021-02-19,1.0,Underwriter,Free pop? Unless there’s a pandemic,"Full disclosure—I worked at UWM for over 2 years. The company has flip-flopped between helping its employees and sabotaging them, particularly its underwriters. For UWM all underwriters are expendable and replaceable. You will need to go through UWX, their underwriting training class, in order to potentially end up as an underwriter. What they don’t tell you when they offer you the job is that you may not actually end up being an underwriter or being paid what was initially offered. 

UWX acts as a filter to suss out those they believe will be qualified for underwriting based on standardized testing methods (which have been proven to inhibit critical thinking, something that is essential in underwriting). Unless you pass the final exam, you and the other flunkees will be dispersed into various lower-paying departments within the company. Some of these positions pay less than entry-level positions in the fast food industry. 

For those that do make it to underwriting, they offer incentives to get you to work harder, put in more hours, and churn out more loans in pursuit of more money. Then they turn around and raise your daily production number based on the numbers you achieved chasing the incentive. You thought you were safe because you hit those numbers on the weekend? Be prepared to hit those weekend numbers during the week now when you have endless phone calls, client requests, webinars, quizzes, team members with questions, etc. Instead of rewarding its top underwriting talent, UWM instead punishes those who excel and drives them away. 

Leadership has only recently started trying to be more flexible by acknowledging the absolute stress and anxiety that is being experienced by those with the highest commitments on a daily basis. Previously if you spoke up because you were having a tough time hitting your numbers most leaders would label you as negative and make it somehow seem like it was your fault despite the company being at fault for implementing such a flawed system. Toward the end of 2019 it was the worst as they pushed incentives hard and turned around and raised the overall commitments of those that participated without disclosing that they planned on doing so. It was shady, underhanded, and pretty much what you come to expect out of this company once the newness has worn off.

We’ve had bonuses promised and then taken away. They could afford to offer remote training during a global pandemic but chose to herd new employees into the building like farm animals so they could micromanage them better. Even internal team members wanting to change positions within the company are forced into the building. Meanwhile other lenders are hiring for 100% remote positions with 100% remote training. 

2 years with UWM...I’ve realized that in 2 years of hoping this company would improve, that somehow if I stuck it out things would get better, I was just fooling myself. Working at UWM felt like being in an abusive relationship that I had been conditioned to feel terrified of ending. UWM brainwashed me and made me feel small, unintelligent, devoid of value, and reduced me to nothing more than a tool to achieve it own ends. I never want anyone to feel that way. If you value yourself and want to rise to your potential, don’t sell yourself short by working as a corporate lackey. For those of you still suffering through it: know your worth and don’t let this company kill your spirit."

• At the same time, if someone brings up a shallow or false accusation, people come to their ""rescue"" and the accused person is reprimanded (especially if the accused person is a minority)
• People make up stories about others often, just to get them in trouble (yet another happening reminiscent of grade school) and without documentation, they'd get away with it
• Leadership does ABSOLUTELY NOTHING to discourage childish behavior (just keep telling everyone how great they are)"

740,,Be YOU at UWM,2021-02-07,5.0,Post Closing Specialist,The best teams are at UW! You will feel like you are part of a family!,There aren't really any cons I can say about UWM. It's a great company to work at overall.
741,,Soviet Centrally Planned Economy in Pontiac MI,2021-02-06,1.0,Underwriter,Good training. Nice facilities. Not in a high traffic location.,"They have production quotas just like the Soviet Union. Whenever you come up short your coworkers get all in your business as if they're red guards storming your home to see if you're hoarding grain. You are always encouraged to overcommit yourself to higher quotas. They have ""incentives"" that they run every 6 months or so which is just a euphemism for a socialist emulation campaign where they expect all their employees to overwork themselves and sacrifice themselves for the sake of helping the company.
Führer worship is outwardly encouraged. Mat Ishbia is seen like the red sun in our mortgage sky. Similar to Mao Zedong, we are encouraged to think that Ishbia is our true grandfather and that he cares more about us than our real families. 
This dystopian work culture pits employees against each other. When employees quit, the remaining employees react as if the Socialist Union of UWM is bleeding out. The prospect of quitting is met with the same antipathy as East Germans had for their compatriots that fled to West Germany. They brainwash you into thinking that you would be nothing without your benevolent employer and Führer, and that leaving is the ultimate betrayal. However, the work culture they foment cannot blind us to the fact that people living beyond the wall, i.e. not working for UWM, are living much more prosperous lives with much better pay and hours. 
When you do leave UWM, you must be as clandestine as an East German crossing to West Berlin. If you mention as much as interviewing at other places, you will be fired on the spot. If you use your uwm email address to apply for other job, you will be fired on the spot. Additionally, if you put in 2 weeks notice they will fire you immediately and will not pay you whatever PTO and commission money you have accrued. 
Overall working for UWM is something I would wish on no one."
742,,Avoid at all cost!,2021-02-05,1.0,Account Executive,No pros besides decent healthcare,"This has to be by far the worst job I've ever had. It didn't take too long to see the companies true colors. Everything they try and brainwash you with, turns out to be a blatant lie. They cherish the ""Firm 40"" which is a complete lie. You are responsible at the bare minimum 11 hours of timed client request responses. Also they want you to take calls any time of day, and on the weekends. My team lead called me on a Sunday while I was out of town to check my level of ""availability."" It exponentially got worse each week. I quit for a culmination of different reasons. But when I was expected to work an extra 2 hours a day, everyday, for 3 months without being paid for it. That was the last straw for me. They use humiliation techniques where they randomly call on you in front of 800 other Account Executives to see if you did their recommended daily play. If not, you are on camera in front of everyone to be humiliated. Also every Friday they do an objection battle training that is also in front of all 800 Account Executives. The first humiliation technique that they implemented. Expect to get paid 80$ a day plus a skewed tier of commissions. You have to be a brain dead corporate slave to play their game, and brown nose yourself to a very miserable top. Even the people that have been there awhile and do make good money, are so miserable. Avoid at all costs!"

The company hired a diversity and inclusion coach, but I'm not sure if it will do any good within IT. Walking within IT, you hear some wild racist things, but everyone acts like they don't listen to them or laugh it off. There is no room for growth for any POC within IT. There is one AVP that's a POC, but that was just a formality. Someone wrote a horrible review on Glassdoor, and what do you know? The person that shuck and jive and allows people to say weird racist things to him is promoted to AVP. That's one person on the ""App Dev"" side. There is no one on the ET side.
A lady over there has been team lead since before I started, and she has two leaders that report to her. I asked her recently why she wasn't AVP yet, and she said, ""it isn't my time yet"". I went back to my desk and looked a few things up, and I noticed no POC above AVP. UWM calls itself a diverse company, but from what I see, they are filling their quota. There is one POC AVP in sales, NO VPS. There is one POC AVP in operations, no VPS. One POC AVP in underwriting, no VPS. TMS has none, finance/accounting has none. How do we send out a BLM post on social media, but does BL matter? They are good enough to work in the company and get all the grunt work done, but they aren't good enough for Senior leadership. How do you think this looks from the outside? If the rebuttal is no one is ready, what does that say about the company's coaching skills?"

Some good things are:

Cool work environment
Liked working with co-workers
Flexible with time off/leave early request
Able to shadow and transfer to a different team","Even though, it's a decent company. They are sticklers about ""Culture"" and will use it as a reason to either keep you or not. They are heavy on you saying yes to anything even if you have concerns about what's being asked. If you do say no to what's being asked, they will instantly take it as you not being a culture fit and let you go! I worked on a team that would overlook and down play my skills until I spoke up and informed them. The team I worked for has one of the worst reps in the IT department for keeping POC and women on their team and everyone in leadership/IT knows it. 

Some other cons are:

-Lack of diversity in upper management (AVPs and up)
-Will pile projects on you and then rush you to complete the task
-Communication issues
-Will overlook your ideas until someone else mentions it

Everything, absolutely everything will be on the brokers time. I understand the importance of hard work and liked the job in itself, but I wish I was told about the longer hours.

You are expected to hit a daily commitment despite these CONSTANT interruptions from these oftentimes rude, angry brokers who expect you to treat their file as if it is the only file you have to work on. So you can spend literal HOURS answering calls, responding to CR's (Client Requests), with little to nothing to show for it on the production report, and you will be harassed for not meeting your minimum daily commitment. And with all of the stress that you have to endure, the micromanaging, the pressure to hit commitment, the harassment from the brokers, you would think that at least the saving grace is that you will be fairly compensated for all of it, right? WRONG...that is the WORST part of the job. UWM employees across the board are paid FAR below the industry standard, which is an absolute shame for a company that constantly boasts about their record quarters, number 1 wholesale lender rank, number 2 overall lender rank, etc. You may be overworked at Quicken Loans, but at least your paycheck will reflect it.

Don’t believe the company responses here. They claim that “people are their greatest asset” but will fire you if you dare question the why to having to come in during a pandemic. Yes, I’ve seen it happen. I myself had my job threatened when I brought up my own concerns about covid. They tell you to question the why, but it’s a trick to get you to expose yourself so they can cut their losses. 

They promise a firm 40 but will definitely force you to work overtime. Upper management is emotionally manipulative by forcing positivity despite insisting we all treat our clients with empathy. Well, where’s the empathy for us? People in the office are still testing positive for covid, aren’t you supposed to care since you claim we’re all family?

For the amount of stress this job puts on me and the amount of training that was required, I should at least be able to afford a 1 bedroom apartment. But that's not happening- I spent the summe living out of my car while working this job due to how low wages are compared with local cost of living.

Stop with the excessive micromanaging. I've lost count of how many ""check in"" emails I have to send to my boss about every possible thing that can be measured, how many things I'm being scored on, etc. It takes up a lot of my time, and considering I have a high commitment to beat or else wind up on a PIP, I don't appreciate that."

818,,A Little Concerning....,2020-11-21,3.0,Underwriter II,"Currently in training for UWII - just finished training with a class of 400, yes, 400. Training is very detailed, lots of information, help with referencing job aids. Trainers and class helpers are very knowledgably, willing to help you. It's been amazing experience. Campus is huge and decorated very professionally. Everyone seems very nice. Lots of signs around about wearing masks in common, hand sanitizer stations around the office. Temp checks when you enter lobby (but if you are asymptomatic, you won't have a temperature)","Class of 400 during a pandemic. It really felt like we were in a cattle herd, just bodies to ramp up the numbers. Pre the Governor's recent mandate, people were told to wear their masks while in common areas however people could still use the cafe to sit and eat their lunch, masks off, while maintaining social distancing. How scary was it to walk into a cafeteria seeing people sitting around without their masks on, talking, spraying in the air. After mandate, Cafe seating area was closed, now you have to eat at your desk. Desks are in an open floor plan and they are really close to each other. You can literally sit at your desk, stretch out your arm and touch the person next to you. A thin sheet of plexiglass is on each desk. You don't have to wear masks at your desk. I have to admit, even though we were 400 people on one floor for training, sitting on top of each other, I thought it was pretty cool. I was really excited about learning and being part of a company where people appear to be happy. Until we received a talking down from HR where the person literally screeched at us for being concerned that we were still 400 people deep after Governor mandate. The person really told us that the negativity was overwhelming and that this group was the most negative group she's ever experienced. That dress down cooled me on the company tremendously, especially considering in the beginning of the conversation she says she felt the morale of the group being brought down then she launches into a screeching tirade that ends with us being the most negative group in the history of groups. Way to motivate us. This tirade stung a little more when the next day she comes back on-line to give us a rah-rah speech about it being last day of training. After the final, people who didn't passed the final were asked to walk to a conference room where I assume you were let go. Imagine, you are in a room of 400 people and you walk towards the direction of the conference room - people know you didn't make it and now are being let go. How embarrassing. I thought about those poor people all evening."

822,,Warning from a former employee,2020-11-19,1.0,Senior Underwriter,"I worked at UWM for over 4 years before I finally summoned the courage to do what I should’ve done years ago.

When I see this category titled “Pros”, I instantly laugh. I thought about lying and putting a couple things in this category to make it seem like a more fair review...but why? That’s dishonest. 

The only reason I’m even typing this is to help any poor soul who is even considering taking a job here. To you people, read the section below very carefully.","I am not saying that it’s impossible to work here as an underwriter, enjoy your job, and be genuinely happy....what I will tell you is that it is EXTREMELY rare.

Almost everyone from my original training class had already quit before I left. I only know a few people that I started with that have stuck it out. And those people literally hate their lives....

UWM, objectively, has become a more stressful and less accommodating place to work in my time at the company. (Despite what I’m sure the HR puppet will say in her cult-like response to this review) — also, little fun fact: most of the 5 star reviews you read on here is from UWM leaders...upper management makes them fill them out to help balance the negative reviews...and this place STILL has an awful rating.

They have continually demanded more and more from underwriters without increasing pay. They give you ridiculous daily goals that are difficult to hit with zero leniency.

I have literally nothing to gain from filling this thing out. I am only doing it to help someone prevent making the biggest mistake of their adult lives.

Trust me, do not work here. You will regret it."

-Gym (when COVID wasn't an issue)","I enjoyed my time at UWM for the most part until COVID. Leadership was not transparent with COVID in the office: we had to find out through the Free Press. They only put a real effort forth after being fined by OHSA. Those that spoke out against COVID were fired. Leads have to be in the office, no excuse. Those who are having trouble hitting numbers have to be in the office even if they're high risk. Leadership is focused on profit and money over safety. 
Lots of growing pains, IT is growing too fast and reorganizing constantly. Training is a joke since a lot of trainers have no IT background. 
Firm 40 doesn't apply to IT, people are forced to work nights and weekends to make unreasonable deadlines. 
Pay is subpar. We spend tons of parties and other things that no one really cares about. At the end of the day we're here for a paycheck not a party. I think 99% of the team would prefer higher pay opposed to parties.
This is a good place if you're starting out in your career to get a few years of experience, but after that you're better off going to a more mature company for career growth. There are too many inexperienced team members for mentorship and career progression."

I am continually impressed by the resources and teaching the Training Team is capable of every single day to make sure everyone is learning efficiently. 

The pay rate is relatively low, but increases substantially for each promotion. There is also a ton of money to be made in bonusing. The income is really what you make of it--as long as loan quality stays solid.","Micromanagement is unreal. Leadership is able to pull reports on everything and anything under the sun, just trying to find people who are slipping up on any number of expectations thrown at the underwriters. 

Work-life balance is not what it used to be in the company. It is not uncommon for people to work 50 hour weeks or more, even for brand new underwriters. Leadership can push 60 hours pretty easily in peak periods. Senior leadership will just say to improve on time management skills, but that is much easier said than done. Especially for newer underwriters, it can be incredibly difficult to juggle the numerous client service related expectations alone before considering the actual production requirement. It's way too many things at once, which makes the position incredibly intimidating. The company tried to make underwriting an entry level position when it comes to the guidelines, but managed to make it substantially harder by increasing both expectations and responsibilities. It is can't imagine it will be easy to sustain in the long term unless a lot of underwriters are hired, and commitments are reduced."

Most of the time they will ask you for more which will require you to give them more free time, micromanagement is big there and even team leaders are not on board with things they deliver to team members but they have to follow the rules as they get yelled at from management, so many seasoned leaders and team members have left the company!!! They brag about the extra amenities they have but as an underwriter you will not have time to use them. I moved to work with a different lenders and UWM sent me a letter asking me to leave my new employer or they will sue me and their CEO Matt Ishbia would go in front of the underwriting team and be like I’m going after those people who left us as we invested in them and we’re gonna sue them! Like he owns people DICTATOR. Every time they roll out a new product or a goal all they do is focus on how this will make the company rich and Matt Ishbia even richer, people their are under paid and loan quality can easily hit you with an error to take out your hard work!!

It’s got to the point where you don’t even underwrite anymore you take calls and CRs for the clients who are absolute morons and have no idea what they are doing. Your direct leader is barked orders at by their leaders and the VPs and essentially the structure is an absolute cluster. Since your actual shift is taking calls and CRs you underwrite after hours which is especially stressful as you do not get paid OT. The firm 40 is basically a 40 hour minimum. You best believe KG, MS; and JF leave on time. They keep pushing integrity and threaten you with not cutting corners but have conversations with those individuals and maybe acknowledge our hardwork. Also they keep stressing the “suggestion box” lol what a joke.  Why do you leaders not comprehend that with the ever growing list of people leaving the company you are paid enough to figure out how to make this work; if not go underwrite yourself as you are essentially getting paid to walk around and respond to glass door reviews. We got raises a few months ago but still about $40k less than industry standard. The bonus structure is also bs because you have to maintain a high commitment to get decent pay but the auditing team is essentially skewing files and changing doc dates which in turn you get a level 2 and your bonus is gone.

During covid where people are literally getting sick and dying, you are threatened with coming to work in the office if your numbers aren't 100% . They really don't care about people getting infected and bringing it to the building as long as you hit your numbers. Wouldn't dare consider this a career type role. People are leaving left and right. They don't tell you that you have to work mandatory overtime every month until you're almost done with training. Some people have family situations where they cant do that.. The training is set up for you to fail. You get out of training and on the floor and have no idea of what you're doing.

The company has stealthily managed to quiet or terminate any employees who were vocal about COVID (especially after only finding out about positive cases in the building through the media).

Mat Ishbia and team stated employees who had been WFH since the start of the pandemic would be able to continue so until January 1st, though that was a lie. All team leads were forced into the office to preserve the culture, even those with at risk families who provided doctors notes, voiced concerns, etc. Leaders were told to promote ""facts over fear"", while the sales floor was seen coughing on each other and on those who wore masks before the mandate. I personally spoke with new employees who were made fun of in front of new training classes BY THE TRAINERS for wearing masks and face shields. United Shore's response to this? They pulled their offer from the new employee. A young woman was outed in her department for reporting sexual harassment, HR's response was to ask her to let it go.

 The company is known for their notorious HR bullying tactics, refusal to put anything in writing, gaslighting their own team members over the phone, implying they're not grateful enough for their jobs whenever concerns are voiced. The company has bled leaders and other team members due to their awful response to COVID. It's disappointing, since I was incredibly excited to be part of the team as well as a company who I THOUGHT would uphold values that I respected.

You'll likely see a reply here, indicating that ""most of the positive cases were already working from home!"" and how ""they've gone above and beyond what was necessary"". If you were to bring up the massive fine they were slammed with, they'll respond how it has since been taken back, which happens to any company that fixes the giant glaring error they're being shown by MIOSHA. I can't imagine the kind of conscience it must take to just lie like that, since so many already know the truth, and it can be seen throughout many of these reviews. 

The company is notorious for demanding unreachable deadlines when it comes to IT. Projects that should take 2 years are done in 1 and barely even acknowledged. Firm forty means you clock out at 40 and end up working up to 60, since you have to be ""committed to the grind!"" for your ""family"". Any voiced concerns to your leader are generally circled around with little to no solution, and HR will wait in the wings to label you as negative. 

Do yourself a favor, if you really need a job, put in a year and get out. Go somewhere you'll be treated like a person and won't fear for your life or the life of your family."

Underwriter II work is fairly easy.","Summed up: Constant tracking and micromanaging, new innovative upper management decisions that pile on the workload for underwriters, harsh loan quality scoring and monetary penalties, a fake kool-aid culture that veils a more money-hungry corporate nature.

One example of the most absurd things is the tracking / micromanaging that goes on. For instance, the numerous webinars and trainings equates to an hour of a trainer talking at you and lecturing you on changes or practices and also add a lot of unneeded fluff. It is fair if we did not have to hit the same quotas for those days, yet we still do; indiscriminately expecting the same out of your while disrespecting your time is absurd. If the company is going to be so production focused, it would really be wise to cut out some of the fluff and things such as tracking your clicks or activity when viewing these virtual seminars. You are tracked on literally everything else such as production, call/CR quality, time punches, company social media posts, training hours, client video greetings sent.

Your calls and client reqests are both tracked and scored. You must follow a script for each conversation and say very specific words in order to ultimately get a passing 100% score and that plus the client requests represents your client service metric. This results in no real room to have organic conversation with clients, and no matter how frustrated or how much the broker dictates the agenda you are expected to sound uniform and as a robot. Ultimately if you don't hit your average points you end up in remedial training and you are hounded to say all the ""correct"" words and you must attend more unnecessary training. 

As far as client requests go - these are essentially permission from clients to instantly demand things from you and your responses and response times are tracked. Imagine trying to underwrite; and there are pauses and interruptions in your day that can stop you in your tracks and force you to respond. I have not experienced a better platform for customers to express their entitlement than this one. If heaven forbid you made one mistake or attempt to preserve the integrity of a loan and add any conditions too late, you must pay and answer to that entitlement and demand for instant gratification and answers. If your answer is too delayed, you get harped on; if you get too much negative feedback and it gets escalated, you also get harped on.

Ultimately, everything is on a timer in this company which is too stressful for people who are just being human. Recently the company introduced a system which put a tremendous amount of strain on both Underwriter II's and Senior Underwriters - the loan touch system. Basically, a review constitutes as a touch which incentivizes processors / loan officers to upload the majority of their documents at once, in bulk. This compounded with a degree of turnover causes a high degree of strain on underwriters as you will spend a lot of your time combating brokers over touches when there is disagreements over items being reviewed and cleared. Really, it is a perfect storm of ingenuity to pay your underwriters less, cause more frustration on the job. The policy incentivizes vile behavior and is a very constraining way of approaching increasing turn times during a busy season. It makes me believe the company will do everything it can to undercut their employees in favor of bending over backwards to the clientele. While they are not in the wrong to serve their clientele, it is a very poor way to promote employee retention and satisfaction when the company squeezes every drop of effort out of their employees without justly compensating them. This especially goes for Seniors who are under salary compensation. It is no secret the work day during busy seasons is not a 40 hour work week, yet Senior Underwriters are paid salary as if 40 hours is worked. You could go well into 50 to 70 hours to hit your goals and not get paid the difference. Unless one optimizes and masters the role it is hardly a promotion for most. No surprise many potential future talent has left the company.

Loan quality is rudimentary assessed. You get a couple (4) audits to possibly a dozen into the teens audits per month. Most of these errors are assessed on a pre-funding basis so when caught are remedied and cause the company no loss other than remediation effort. The weighing is so basic that a few moderate but non defecting errors can snatch your bonuses away in mere moments with a highly degree penalty of 75%. This causes a great degree of paranoia and stress among underwriters which really lends to over-conditioning and self-preserving behavior which goes against the brokers' interests. There is no intent to reconsider how this method of scoring can brutalize employees' mental well-being or sense of security in their roles.

Pretty much every day you are met with propaganda on how great the company is and really fake cheeriness, and really feeble attempts at reviving a dying culture that one had some shape to it. Not to mention really silly contests that mean nothing to most and are passed off as fun or motivation - which really hardly does much to motivate in a busy era. The company attempts to throw more money at underwriters yet contradict rewarding harder work by making work more difficult and also sneakily removing/restructuring bonuses. It is really easy to see past that facade. Really it has become a churn and burn esque work culture and you don't really matter that much. From what I can tell and experienced the company has also handled the work from home directive during COVID-19 really poorly and even more so in other teams, such that there is a genuine conflict of safety in midst of a global pandemic. It affects some employees deeply, and a lot do not have the luxury to go to the office, yet feel tremendous pressure on the basis of production metrics. It is worse in support departments.

I will not delve into this, but there is also a fear of leaving to similar occupation fields due to legal action being threatened that have been mentioned repeatedly here.

In face of all this, there is growth opportunity here for those with grit and can temporarily overlook these aspects plus more, but as of recent times the bias has been towards unsavory aspects. It is not a bad employer to get some training out of it, but be prepared to be worked and subordinate like a dog. Ultimately it is what you make it."

However, the auditing system is completely flawed and no amount of “upoints” can make up for it. Everyone is “supposed” to get 4 audits a month. For a let’s say “average” UW doing bare minimum 25 loans/week (100 month) that’s 4% of loans being audited. But for a person doing 60+ loans a week 4 audits is a little more than 1%. How is that fair? Let’s say both of those people get 2 level 2s and 4 audits. They have the same LQ percentage but the person doing 245+ loans a month is doing significantly more work. If it were proportionate to commitment the person with 60 commitment would get 10 (9.8 audits round up). How can you compare those two UWs when one failed 50% of their audits and the other person failed 20% in this example of proportionate audits? Instead they look equally incompetent and the UW who busted their a** for the company gets their hard earned money taken away. This is incredibly discouraging and makes anyone producing more than the required 5/day feel unbelievably unappreciated. Oftentimes it feels like the auditors know this and intentionally audit the minimum or refuse to overturn errors out of spite."

Health care is ok.","Cons? Basically everything. I feel like I left right when the “great fall of UWM” was just starting. When I started the company wasn’t really small about 1000 people. Team lead’s and VP’s (even Mat himself) were super hands on and helpful. All of the teams had such great flow and balance. Team members helped each other, it was so good. The 6 pillars this company swear is law actually meant something and you could see it. Then queue the first mass hiring. And the second... and third.. 

I’ll admit the company got a lot of business very fast but in the beginning it wasn’t bad. Management actually had a plan and we were getting rightfully earned bonuses. 

The fact of matter and the reason UWM is starting to crumble is because they are corrupt. They brainwash (drinking some extremely strong koolaide) and if you don’t drink or at least pretend to drink? Byebye. They’ll find a bs excuse to kick you out of the door asap. They’re racist, (don’t drink the koolaide and stand up for yourself? Don’t come to uwm poc). I watched so many poc get fired for “being too outspoken”. Team leads have no clue what they’re doing and they’re stressed out, they get fed some bs and then spread it to team members. But don’t ask more than one team lead! Or you’ll get more than one answer for the same question. Over worked, underpaid, under appreciated. By time I left the company, commitments were rising and bonuses and incentives were either hard to hit or impossible. Buttttt they’ll give you pizza sometimes. That firm 40? Is a joke. Work life balance???? If you work 11-8?? Good luck. Question the why but don’t question too much. That hour for lunch they “encourage” yeah you’ll need all of that in hopes of hitting commitment. They love saying “We promote from the inside” lol, seriously that’s a joke. The promote those who kiss butt and very rarely those who work hard. And the way their handling covid??? I may not work there anymore but I made many friends and I kept up to date. Even just reading recent reviews. Especially with the idea of returning. All this to say - the reason I left was because I made it out and where I made it to, I would have been one in position to lie to new people and people in the company in general.

906,,Here are UWM’s pillars and how they don’t stand by them:,2020-08-21,1.0,Senior Underwriter,I made some pretty great friends there.,"1.	Our people are our greatest asset: This is probably one of their biggest lies next to Firm 40. You will work 50-60 hours a week just to hit commitment. Underwriters have a horrendous amount of responsibilities including responding and solving CRs within 20 minutes, emails, answering every phone call and possibly your “phone buddy’s” calls too, Senior Queues have to be completed within 3 hours, and all these need to be completed before you actually grab an initial underwrite. Commitment is the daily production number you have to hit, which is “based” off an 8-hour day, but don’t worry, per upper management, it should be easy to hit, since they just ASSUME that all your other tasks for the day don’t take long. They expect too much out of their employees and pay at such a ridiculously low rate. 

Also, they say that they’re a family-oriented company, but they don’t care about their employees with families. Underwriters are stuck with a 10AM – 7PM shift, and if you have kids, you better find someone to go pick them up from daycare or school because it’s nearly impossible to get an earlier shift. They will praise all their young employees who can work an endless amount of hours, but if you have kids of your own or responsibilities outside of UWM, you’re frowned upon for not being a team player for staying late or working weekends.  

Oh, and let’s not forget COVID-19. The CEO promised no layoffs, but shortly after that All Company Meeting, decided to find other reasons to fire people, like not watching the “Mandatory P5 training videos.” Or the moment the queues started to pick up, he started telling team leads to threaten team members that if you miss commitment 1 day, you’ll be forced back in office the next day because it’s viewed as, you’re not capable of doing your job at home. I don’t know Mat…. maybe sometimes we have bad days, and commitment is just too high? 

2.	Service is everyone’s responsibility: They will hound on you if you miss 1 call, even if you might be on the line with another client. They grade every call and you’re frowned upon if you don’t say “Thank you FOR something.” Even if you say “Thank you” 5 times in your call, that doesn’t matter to them. They have the time to critique someone for their call scores, but not worry about the quality of the work the team members are doing. They speed through training, so no one is really an “expert” at their job.  

3.	We are relationship driven, not transaction driven: LIE. All they care about is the numbers. They’ll raise commitments to an unattainable amount, expect everyone to work overtime to hit, and then make mandatory “rise and grind” or “late nights,” which require everyone to work a 10-hour shift and hit 125% of their daily commitment. If 1 person on your POD doesn’t hit commitment, well…. looks like someone has to stay after to make it up for them. They stopped caring about quality and just throw out a bunch of incentives to get employees to work more.  Then 2 months later, they will get hit with an error that can potentially take away their bonus.

4.	We are thumb pointers, not finger pointers: It is SO rare to find a person that actually cares about their files.  The company has set expectations so high, that employees literally have to go in the file and work it as quick as possible and are bound to make mistakes. And no one likes to take responsibility of their mistakes, always pushing it onto someone else. 

5.	Continuous Improvement is essential for long-term success: Training is a joke. Through the last couple years, you can clearly tell they keep cutting corners and keep trying to speed training up so team members can get into production quicker. No one really even has an idea of what they’re doing until they go in mentoring.  You’re lucky if you even get trained in lending support, they just make you shadow and then expect you to work 100 loans in production within days of learning the function. They will only provide “Continuous Improvement” training classes when it’s slow, and throw out Quality or Continuous Improvement anything when it’s busy. Because all they care about is the amount of loans they push through each day.

6.	Our path is paved with fun and friendship: I remember the days when we were encouraged to take a walk and a little break to play ping pong or stop by the bake sale, but now you’re lucky if you can even walk away for a lunch or take a bathroom break. You’ll be so overloaded with work, and so micromanaged that you’ll be asked how you’re doing on commitment every other hour. It’s all for show whenever brokers come in office, or to show any visitors that it’s a fun place to work, but none of the amenities can ever really be used because you’re stuck at your desk for the entire day.

The work environment is so toxic, just go somewhere else where you can get paid a wage that your time is worth."

United Shore prides itself on its 6 pillars to foster an excellent company culture. After working there for over a year, this could not be farther from the truth. You will be overworked and grossly 
underpaid compared to industry standards. I was a high-producing II during my time there, but the company will cut every corner to not rightfully pay you.  You will be micromanaged like crazy (regardless if you are hitting numbers in production, quality and service) AND for things completely unrelated to the job (e.g. I was yelled at for not submitting my RSVP to their holiday party when I had at least a week to do so). They set unrealistic expectations in terms of production, quality and service on its underwriters and expect us to take everything in stride. They value quantity over quality at the end of the day (and was told this directly by my leaders). How can you provide elite service and maintain quality if your underwriters are cutting any and all corners to hit their daily and weekly production numbers? There certainly seems to be no integrity in the work they are doing. They preach a 'one team, one dream' mentality but pit pods and teams against one another within their monthly rankings. If you fall short of their unrealistic expectations, you will be scolded for it. They also preach an open-door policy for upper leadership, but you will be frowned upon or considered 'not a team player' if you provide any constructive criticism to make work on the floor better. The company is growing too fast and cannot keep up, resulting in promoting team members to leadership positions with little to no leadership experience whatsoever. And the cherry on top? Their response to the pandemic has been horrific. They sent us home way too late (late March/early April) and forced some back into the office in the early summer. They continually threaten underwriters that they will need to return to the office if you are not hitting daily numbers. 80+ positive cases tied to the office (whether team members were working in the office or from home is irrelevant) and we have to hear about it from a news article? Come on now. Stop jeopardizing the health and safety of your employees for the sake of business."
909,,"If you value yourself, STAY AWAY",2020-08-20,1.0,Operations,"Very few. Free drinks, amenities when you get any time to use them (which is never), health care is decent.","When I first joined years ago, this was easily one of the best companies to work for. Within a matter of just under 4 years, it all faded away.

First, let us discuss how COVID has been handled. To call this a freak show is legitimately offensive to those who call themselves freaks. The company has routinely lied to employees about what has gone on. They have covered up cases and outbreaks since day 1 they FORCED employees back to work. UWM claims it isn't true, but most people were told to come back for some reason and that once they were back, they couldnt leave. And when people came back, nobody enforced any safety measures. Guys, asking me at the door if I am sick is not a health screening. The media has now exposed the company and UWM has had this dismissed as a Quicken conspiracy. It is so funny how in denial they are because of the PR hit (which is happening anyways). Mat is delusional in saying how safe it is there. Then again, his wife posts about how BS she thinks masks are, so is it that shocking?

COVID aside, they have turned vicious against their employees. The CEO threatens lawsuits against any employee who leaves for a competitor within 100 miles. That's cute considering they brag about how they poach Quicken people constantly. These very threatening sentiments have been echoed by VPs, DLs, and other leads. The emails are so unprofessional that it is sickening. HUNDREDS, if not, thousands of employees have left over the past few months for the abuse. 

Additonally, everyone is overworked and underpaid. Forget even hitting any bonuses to make up for your poor pay; they routinely alter them to where hitting them is a joke. They can afford the worlds largest skywalk, but cant pay a half way decent wage? Please.

UWM runs like a high school with all the popular kids running everything. Join and drink the kool aid or get canned.

913,,Good start to your mortgage career and that's it,2020-08-19,1.0,Condition Splitting Specialist,It's a great company to get yourself into the mortgage industry if you have zero experience. The free training is huge and a great perk.,"There are A LOT and it would probably take me forever to think of them all and type them all out, but here is what comes to mind first.

To start off, the pay is well below industry standards. They used to make it where you could bonus decent and that made up for it, but they do this thing now where every 6 months the analytics team ""re-evaluate"" every teams bonus structure and commitments and figure out a way to make you work harder for less of a bonus. With the way things have been going, in another 6-12 months you won't be able to bonus unless you're working 60 hours a week. But don't worry, sometimes you'll get a power cart and a pizza party to make up for the lack of money you're
making, because, ya know... that pays the bills. Also, they have also made baseline commitments nearly impossible for new people to hit, yet upper management expects them to hit it every day, while making zero errors. They're set up to fail from the beginning and I feel very bad for these people.

Secondly, the culture is terrible. It has such a cliquey high school feel to it and the employees are talked to and treated like children. There is rampant favoritism across the whole company and people are being promoted, not because they deserve it, but because they are well liked by upper management.

Thirdly, you guys preach firm 40, which is one of the biggest lies ever. There are literally mandatory late nights every week and if you don't participate, you have to have a ""valid reason"". If you aren't putting in a bunch of OT every week, you're judged by team leads and looked at as ""not a team player"".

Lastly... I used to really respect Mat, but I feel like the bigger the company gets, the less he cares about his employees. At the beginning of Covid he said nobody was getting fired, which was a lie. He said that he wanted to keep his employees safe... yet, another lie. The third floor has everyone packed in there like sardines and so many people are getting Covid... AND NOBODY IS BEING TOLD ABOUT IT. Word gets around, people find out things and shame on you guys for not giving team members a heads up to get tested. And now Mat is threatening to sue Underwriters that want to get out of the toxic work environment that is UWM and get a better job? What a joke. Keep underpaying all your employees, except your MSU buddies.

I'm sure I'm missing a lot of things, but that will give people an idea of the work environment at UWM."

They have multiple rate sheets for different clients, they will take producing accounts from good AE's and give them to their favorites. They kept changing the comp plan and lying to us about the reason why"
915,,DON'T WORK HERE,2020-08-18,1.0,Underwriter,"It's a paycheck, if you're absolutely desperate","Too many to list, but I'll try. First off, the culture they CONSTANTLY brag about feels more like a cult. They micromanage every move you make. Everything you do there is scored and every employee is ranked based on metrics that are often ridiculous and unattainable if you care about the quality of the work you do. You have to say the same things in every call like a robot or your call score goes down and you have to go for call-coaching. They want robots not people. They care much more about quantity rather than quality. They give shout-outs and rewards to underwriters for going above their commitment on loans, but don't give rewards for no errors or actually taking the time to help the client because that cuts into quantity of loans worked on. They hire as many young people right out of college or in their 20s as possible because they don't have as much work experience as other people so they don't realize how ridiculous the place is. They show off all the amazing amenities and make it seem like employees are playing basketball and getting massages during the workday. The amenities are there to draw people in, but you have to use them on your own time, before work, after or during lunch, which many people don't have time for. And now that many people are working from home and the gym and other things there are shut down because of COVID-19, employees can't use most of those amenities anyway. The company is growing so fast that they keep putting people into team lead and upper management positions who aren't the least bit qualified. There are cliques everywhere, including in management and it feels like high school. If a team lead or upper management doesn't like someone, they will treat them badly, make up lies about them, and write them up based on those lies. Their Human Resource dept. is called Team Member Services and you learn quickly you can't go to anyone on that team to talk about any issues you're having. It will immediately go back to management and you WILL face backlash. But that is always their go-to answer on these honest reviews that they reply to -- Speak to Team Member Services. They try not to outright fire people, unless they're breaking a rule of the company, so that they don't have to pay unemployment benefits. Instead they lie and bully people and make their lives miserable until they either quit or they offer them a position in another dept, making much less money. Unless someone lives with their parents and is paying most of their bills, most people can't afford to work in another dept because they don't pay a livable wage unless you're in underwriting or sales. You can't trust anyone in the company. If you have an issue with anything there, do not talk about it at work or discuss it with your team lead. Either live with it or find a better job, which is what I did. The company has one goal, and that is to be the #1 mortgage lender in the country. They constantly talk about that and how they want to beat the actual #1 mortgage lender, a large company based in Detroit. Because of that, they forget their employees are actual human beings, with thoughts and feelings and different personalities, not robots. I cannot stress enough, RUN from this company unless all of the things above sound like a company you'd like to work for."

Also, some of your fellow team members become some of your best friends. IE; Those who suffer together bond.","Demands of a cult environment. This includes daily chants, forced memorization of multiple philosophies that you must recite in groups, and if you have anything but bad things to say about any other lender you are publicly shamed.   

  

I've had to wait to post this review out of concerns of their retaliation against me for leaving and that of some friends who are unfortunately still there.  

  

Daily my leader and colleagues that met with him (all males) would rate woman out loud on their sex appeal by using the Underwriting Levels. Example; A full set of docs = a very sexy woman. 

  

When I was in training my leader would cry and yell at me almost monthly. He would then come in the next day with candy or red bulls as an apology. Talk about a mental abuse situation. When I attempted to go to his leader who is ex-military, he shamed me for it. This senior leader talked over me and accused me of not being able to handle the job. They had us on a low salary income but I was forced to work 60+ hours a week. Eventually they did switch us to hourly but only have long months of draining hours and low wages. 

  

When I was moved to a Product Owner, I was paid 20K-35K less than my male counterpart who had less experience, and a much smaller team. My leader required a written email of all the work I had done that day and took credit it for it in all the senior leaderships. This is the same leader who at the time was married and I would walk up to his desk to find him sitting with a young Closer female and he would have his hand on her thigh.  

  

When he was promoted up and had his last Your Time with me, he said now that he was in a senior VP role, he needed to be more concerned about ""white people crime"".  

  

He would constantly check out the females that walked by and made comments to me about not dressing more in outfits like woman who wore skirts and heels. 

  

They say they promote within in, but those promotions are only for lower level movements. Anything with real career growth is hired from outside the company. And these promotions rarely include a salary increase. You are told to look at the opportunity as growth not for pay increase.  

  

When I finally left to an employer who doubled my salary, many of my friends there were told they were not allowed to be friends with me as I am a traitor and should not post anything with me on their social media pages.  

  

Being a Trainer and a Product Owner provided no training or role expectations. Any flimsy expectation list that would pop up would be rigorously enforced for a few weeks and then forgotten until they made up another a few months later.  

  

When I left the company, they even had the audacity to expect me to write up what my role is so they could fill it. They had NO idea how I did my job or all the extra work I did outside their request. They threw EVERY random question my way or Team Member made error my way to research and explain why the system I was overseeing allowed this.  So, here's the long story: 

  

I was a closer, and then the concierge closer dealing with angry clients. I was promoted to a trainer for closing. During this time, they decided to upgrade the system used internally and externally. Anyone that knows anything about building a system or program can understand the complexity and time it takes. Throw in that it is also a mortgage used system that interacts with other internal and external systems, and you have serious work cut out for you. Rather than allowing the professionals of this to identify how long it would take, Mat Ishibia throws out a date HE wants so he can look cool at the big Broker conference. I'd like to say ""so long"" to their FIRM 40 mantra, but that's always been a facade. I worked closely with them as I needed to understand it as to train their Closer’s on the floor. They were working seven days a week from being the first at the building well past even when the cleaning crew had left. When it was time to roll out it was the same concept. I was working not stop building, preparing, and training. No direction from leadership, no tools, no plan, no nothing. I literally did it all and my leader gave no one to help me. (fun fact: he would later get an award for this. He didn’t even know what the system was called... Recognition is only given to leadership.) 

  

There is no physical way the amount of work that was needed for this system could be made in the time frame Mat Ishbia was demanding. Corners had to be cut. And there was A LOT of cutting. All along the way the team was not choosing what to or not to cut, no ... all this was cleared with the Operations leadership. THEY KNEW!  

  

So, towards the end when the current PO had simply had enough of the abuse and moved to a new position, I was popped into it due to my close relation with the team and work. I was beyond excited but had no idea what I had gotten myself into! 

  

I thought I was getting away from a mentally abusive leader but found myself with a narcissistic closet tyrant who dresses in that 'cool guy next door' way. So now I have a system still being completed and a leader who has no idea how things are built. He decides he wants it completely different so has new demands and changes that are almost impossible. He won't listen to how things work or need to be made. He wants it how he wants it and he want it NOW. I found myself daily trying to talk my developers off the ledge. Don't worry though, all their hard work, the rest of the team and the POs did not get any recognition. Rather this senior VP who did nothing got a fancy award and announcement and the holiday party. Of which he toted around that night while following closely behind to one of his 23-year-old Closers while his wife was at home with their child. #AbuseOfPower 

  

The favorite past time of senior leadership is to go on witch hunts. If ANY error is made, they will spend days, weeks, and sometimes even months looking for the ""most"" at fault  

  

Don't walk, RUN away! Wal-Mart pays better and cares better.  

  

When the pandemic started my friends still worked there and though I want to share the nightmares they are facing,  they are not stories that belong to me to share. I'm sure you can imagine. 

 

They tolerate racism, sexism, and anti-LGBTQ+ statements and actions. To fit it all here would take too much time. I feel confident in the other reviews of how much this has been covered for everyone to get the jest here.  

 

There are some good people there, even a few good people in senior leadership. To them I exclude from these statements and they know who they are. Again... emphasis on the word FEW."

927,,JUST SAY NO,2020-08-07,1.0,Anonymous Employee,The only thing I like is the on site doctors office,"So first of all, leadership blatantly lies all of the time. This is a straight up cult, and the more you praise the company and Mat Ishbia, the better you will do. United Shore pays 60% what their competitors pay, and rely heavily on bonuses. However, they change the bonus structure all the time screwing you out of hundreds of dollars a month. So now you have to do double the work for the same pay. And this is a regular occurence. And on top of that they gaslight you when you express your disappointment and make you feel crazy for not feelinh grateful to work for such a ""wonderful"" company. 

Leadership is only made up of people who praise the company, without any concern about managerial skills. Team leads have no real power, they are just the go between. There are so many levels of management that it's hard to get your voice heard. They say they want your opinions and want you to 'challenge the why' but when you do you are written off or reprimanded. 

During the pandemic they sent pretty much everyone home but then started using the office as a threat. If you aren't hitting your daily 'commitment' (production goal) even if just for a day or two you are told you have to come into the office. New hires, people in any type of training, and all team leads are required to work in office. Yet, the company insists that everyone is there voluntarily. Their safety measures are a joke. And they straight up lied to employees about cases in office, until the press busted them. But the company and the CEO is so focused on beating Quicken and micromanaging that they don't care who gets sick as long as it furthers their agenda.

You are also made to do more and more work without getting any type of a pay raise, excepting a small 'merit' raise every february that's really equivalent to a cost of living raise, no matter what they say. 

All in all this company is extremely untrustworthy. 0/10 do not recommend. Worst place I've ever worked."

The cafe has pretty good food.","Yowza, where do I start.

United Shore's COVID policy was a disaster. The CEO is obsessed with everyone being in the office, and they implemented measures to force employees in, who were working remote. There is not enough work for employees to hit their commitment (thats what they call a quota), so they started a policy that if you didn't hit at least 80% of your commitment, you were forced into the office. Of course you cannot hit commitment, there isn't enough work. Boom.....come in or your fired. Yes, I have the emails from the VP stating this. If you had ANY reason that you had to come into the office, you were NEVER allowed to work from home again. No masks were required until July 13th, and no symptom checks. Just stroll in and infect everyone. No one was informed that the company had over 50 cases of COVID, until a news article published it. Nice.......
 
The company chants 'firm 40' as a mantra, yet it's a complete and total lie. You will NOT work 40 hours, as the company implemented late nights years ago. All employees are required to do 10 hours on Tuesdays and Thursdays. If you say no, you can kiss any promotion goodbye. 

No one knows who is in charge around here. There are hundreds of 'leaders', who simply regurgitate information that was passed on to them, from some man in the sky. It's frustrating.

Something's fishy with Hall Financial and UWM. I'm not completely sure what it is, but I have a good idea. That's a topic for another time, and different audience.

The pay is atrocious. I cannot stress that enough. It.is.atrocious. If your smart, you will come to United Shore, get trained, and then work fully remote for another Mortgage Lender. Yes, United Shore will try and sue you, if you work anywhere within 100 miles. What they don't realize, is that there are tons of employers in other states that are hiring remote workers, for double UWM's salary. Get in, get trained, get out. 

There is no honesty at this company, instead you see a look of fear on peoples faces, if you try and get them to be honest. No one talks bad, instead they all sound like soulless robots, repeating some crazy programming loop.

The CEO blah blah's one thing, and then does something completely different. He has this 'we're family' mentality when he is in the public eye, and then screams and yells in private, while huffing and puffing about how people are replaceable as heck. Mhmmmm. Look bro, your not fooling anyone; we all nod and smile, while you tout your nonsense, but not one of us actually believes your word vomit. We work there, duh.

So, fellow job seekers; think twice before you come to United Shore. It's a weird place, full of corporate nonsense, and double speak. A place where they talk about how much they care, while stabbing you in the back with their nonsense policies and production commitments. A place where you will make the equivalent of a Wal-Mart salary, while being told to be grateful that you contracted COVID from the facility, because you could have been (gasp) laid off instead. A place where your leader has the IQ of a potato; who blindly relays messages to the underpaid workers, while shrugging and telling you the 'the man in the sky' told him to tell you these things. When you ask who the man in the sky is, he will respond 'our lord and savior Mat' lol."
930,,United Shore's Experiment in Human Sacrifice,2020-08-06,1.0,Senior Underwriter,"Despite the virus spreading like wildfire within United Shore, with over 50 cases confirmed (and likely hundreds more), employees are pushed back into the office if they are not at 100% capacity working from home.  It's fine - the only thing that matters at this company is appeasing the brokers, your health is a secondary consideration (at best).","Flagrantly violating executive orders by our governor - this was reported both locally and nationally  - simply to churn out more loans is really telling.  Great company. Whatever, we will hear that they're looking out for us, and that we need to talk directly management to address any concerns. It will not be mentioned that doing so would equal termination. Priority number one at any business should be to keep your people safe, yet at United Shore there is a reckless disregard for human life all in service of slimy mortgage brokers."
931,,Time for Change,2020-08-03,2.0,Senior Team Lead,"United Shore is by far the largest wholesale mortgage lender in the country, largely due to it's lightning-fast underwriting turn times and client service standards. Brokers can contact underwriters directly via phone (unique in the industry) with a guaranteed answer, through email, and through digital requests that have reliable, super efficient response times. Income documentation, once uploaded, will be guaranteed to be reviewed in 3 hours. All of this combined with industry-record underwriting turn times, UWM is an undeniable go-to for large and small broker shops country-wide. All requests are timed and guaranteed to get resolved within a very strict time-frame. The only problem with all of this is that all of it- and I mean all of it- falls on the shoulders of the underwriting staff at UWM.","Due to this unique client service focus, underwriters are finding themselves stuck between 2 ever-increasing pressures: production expectations, and client service expectations. Daily commitments are calculated based on a monthly average- and if you happen to produce more one month, you are then expected to hit those higher numbers consistently thereafter, regardless of changing circumstances (COVID *cough*).

Now with higher production, comes more phone calls, CRS (digital requests), emails, and senior queues. This up-take in client service tasks pulls underwriters away from doing what they were actually hired to do: underwrite. I liken this situation to being trapped in underwriting quick sand, where you find yourself busy for hours on end, however getting nowhere in terms of meeting the ever-increasing production expectations. Time continues to tick, you continue to work, but you have nothing to show ""on paper"" for production. 

More and more time is being spent on resolving the client-service requests (either by phone or digitally) and senior queues, increasing stress and the feeling of ""being behind"", thus creating a hasty, nerve-racking underwriting experience where you anxiously anticipate the inevitable interruption in the not so distant future. 

Underwriters also receive financial punishment for making ""errors""- both pre-funding and post-funding. The real thorn in the side is the prefunding errors, as these are errors that ""would have"" caused an expensive buy-back from the company, however don't in actuality because it was caught and corrected. 

Counter-intuitively, these errors cost underwriters the most money, depending on an oversimplified calculation of errors to audits ratio (that could be as little as 4 loans audited for the month, so one or two small mistakes can wipe away an entire month of hard earned commission). I've seen people lose upwards of $10,000 by making 2 mistakes which were almost instantly resolved by the company. This compensation structure keeps underwriters on edge and even more anxious the entire month, as one small mistake could waste away countless hours of stressful labor.

Training is largely conducted on slide-shows and multiple choice exams and workbooks. Underwriters are then thwarted from the classrooms and into a 2 week mentoring process which gives them about enough time to maybe learn the basics of the system, let alone learn how to underwrite thoroughly. They are then expected to meet their commitments and make little to no errors. If errors are made, underwriters are placed on probationary terms and all of their work is expected to be reviewed and scrutinized by their leader (me). 

Team leads are literally bombarded with the oversight of all of these responsibilities, metrics, questions, client service issues, etc, paid a fixed salary, and without choice have to put in extra hours to meet all deadlines and time frames with no extra compensation. We of course have the option to produce ourselves, however doing so will only make us less available to deal with the constant needs of our ""pod"" (usually around 12 underwriters needing help with income questions, client service issues, system questions, the list goes on)."

UWM has become a joke in the industry by other companies who are grabbing up their employees left and right. Didn’t chose any of those who joked about another company. I did my homework and found a great company paying 10% above industry to secure top talent. Oh and I tell you my level of peace has returned.

UWM is the largest wholesale mortgage company in the nation but pays the least with huge responsibilities outside of the underwriter role, so your employees are not your greatest asset. I am an underwriter and now I can proudly say that’s all I do is UNDERWRITE. I love my new job. No stress and no extra requirements. You are bleeding at the hip losing top talent due to under paid overworked and lack of transparency with COVID cases. I entered the building a few weeks ago and all I was asked upon entering is any symptoms me, no, guard....ok. No temps no mask requirement just 2 words and I was on my way. This is not a one off this is the norm. 6800 people and rising.  There is not enough free coffee juice/pop and snacks worth my life."
935,,Great Company -  COVID Concerns,2020-07-30,3.0,Underwriter,"I believe this would be a great company if we weren't living in COVID times. I'm sure I speak for most when I say, I appreciate Mat promising not to lay off any employees.","United shores really harps on their pillars, one of them especially - “our workers are out greatest asset” and often remind their employees how important they are to the company. Their actions of late, however, feel contradictory. With the recent uptick in COVID-19 cases United Shore has failed to address this recent news and/or provide an alternative. This is especially the case for the recently hired employees. Sitting in a class room with 70+ trainees and in the same building with over 1,000 other team members just doesn’t feel good and it does not feel safe. It feels a little irresponsible and feels like there is a lack of care for their employees. Fortunately I live alone, but I am still in my upper 30s and have underlying health problems that put me at higher risk. My first week was last week and the aurora was peaceful and positive, but this week it feels different. I’ve been taking the proper precautions to stay safe during this pandemic - this has been my first time being in such large spaces with so many people and its just scary honestly. The trainers have mentioned that during the first stay at home order all trainings were on line, I guess I don’t think that it “being a hassle” is a good enough excuse to not take the proper precautions to virtually train employees if it means saving lives. 

I’ve heard that some of the new hires are starting to feel like nothing more than a number and that the company is only concerned with keeping up with production goals, instead of the safety of the employees. Especially when many of their competitors are conducting training and work virtually, safely."
936,,FINGERS CROSSED YOU DONT GET SICK!,2020-07-30,1.0,Anonymous Employee,They will hire just about anyone.,"How can it be legal to force people to work during this pandemic?? Now you tell us that we can’t work from home unless we are meeting our production numbers??? Production numbers that you set as an average of everyone.... guess what, your “high producers” are cutting every corner in the book!!! Now we are stuck in the office, not allowed to say anything, and barely any safety measures taken to keep us safe!!! 

Oh, and the CEO? Yeah, saw him walking out of the office before everyone else gets there. Why are you not staying with your family if you believe the measures you have taken are enough????"
937,,They do not care,2020-07-30,1.0,Team Leader,The only pro to this company is that it'll take you years to figure out how much they truly don't value you.,"You are a number. Your health and well being are nothing compared to the greed this company has. This company would rather have you work in the office during a pandemic that is killing people rather than send you home. If you are allowed to work from home, the second you don't hit your numbers you're forced to come back into the office and if you refuse, you will lose your job. I've had to let go of great team members because of this. Of course we have to spin it off like that's not the only reason they were let go. The words "" there are thousands of people who can take their place"" came right from the CEOs mouth. Ive been here for many years and never thought I'd see a day where I plan on leaving because of the greed that is being shown by senior leadership. Its truly heartbreaking to watch a company that was so humble, turn into such a wolf. Don't be fooled by this company. Go to quicken, at least they're honest about how many hours you'll work. Do not believe the firm 40 lie they tell you. You'll make more at quicken too. 18 dollars an hour to do the same work that uwm would pay 12 dollars an hour for."
938,,"If you work here, it is illegal to work anywhere else",2020-07-29,1.0,Senior Underwriter,The flashy stuff they advertise during the interview (it gets boring overtime though),"The very first sign of issues is you will see this get buried under a bunch of ""Positive"" reviews. They tell their leaders to go make accounts and post good things. Look through these reviews and stop paying attention to the things that sounds too good to be true. I mean, could it possibly be a good company if the OWNER threatens EVERY underwriter with a lawsuit if they leave the company (and yes, this has been done). 

There are so many problems with this company including their inability to listen to their people. They promote that they listen to their people but only when they ask for it. If you have a great idea or feel like something could be changed to improve your life, no one will listen to you. In fact, they tend to do the opposite, such as committing someone to an amount of loans being done EVERY day based on a average of their best month. This killed me for months...and no one would listen when I asked for this to be adjusted. 

The money that you are paid is so minimal...it is unbelievable that they have any retention. Probably because they'd much rather pay million's in entertainment. Whenever you hear them talk about all of the amazing artists they have at their holiday parties, just remember that is not coming out of their pockets, it comes out of yours. They'd rather pay fair workers, top of the line venues and insanely rich artist over you. On top of that, the place is unbelievably unethical. Just take a moment to look up Mat's support of Anthony Casa (a chairman of AIME) who sent a profoundly disturbing video to other mortgage company leaders. It is pure sickening. 

Consider this a warning to anyone looking into this company. I understand if you are using this as a stepping stone to get into the mortgage industry but let it be ONLY that. There are sooooo many great mortgage companies out here that value you as a person based on what they do rather than the words they say."
939,,RUN !!,2020-07-29,1.0,Underwriter,Training is somewhat decent here.,RUN TF AWAY!!! What CEO sues their employees because you want to escape being constantly taken advantage of. The CEO DOES NOT CARE ABOUT THEIR PEOPLE. It’s a damn CULT! Please think twice before working here.
940,,Hard Works Means Nothing to this Company,2020-07-28,1.0,Senior Underwriter,Free Snacks and Nice Facility,Its all about politics and butt kissing. Underpaid and Overworked.
941,,Not for long term employment,2020-07-28,2.0,Training,"This place is great if you use it for the training they provide and then moving onto another company. Think of it as a college that will pay you! 

Some of the people are the best people I have met in my life. The recruiters really have it down, because they bring in some of the best people! Granted there are a few bad eggs that slip in and with hiring booms a lot more seem to slip in than normal. But overall, the people are just fantastic.

The benefits are pretty good!

The career opportunities are a mixed bag. While you do have a *chance* to move up/around within the company there is a lot of favoritism and labeling that goes on before the move. You almost have to be fake to move up.

All in all, I still recommend people to work here, however, I give them a clear understanding that this is temporary and should be used as a stepping stone to other things.","This place is like high school all over again, clicks, drama, etc. 

They do not train the leaders. I know below there is a lot of bashing on the leadership. However, you have to realize that they are not training the leaders on how to be good leaders. They give them a crash course in leadership types and send them on their way. The leaders are under extraordinary stress to try and meet quota and help/manage their team - while getting paid next to nothing.

The pay is ridiculous, United Shore needs to do some market analysis to realize they are well below market standards. 

You have to ""play the game"". To get anywhere in the company you have to work the system in your favor. 

The culture is slipping, company culture is such a fickle thing. You'll notice depending on what team you go onto that the culture will be different for each one. 

Remember to always get you ""four punches a day"" and get there on time, if you don't they will use this to let you go.

All they care about is the bottom line and how much you can produce. They will overlook cutting corners if you can get the job done quicker.

I'm disappointed in the way that United Shore has handled themselves with Covid19. They were late to the party by sending their employees to work from home, then forced them back at the beginning of July. It doesn't surprise me to hear that there are confirmed cases of Covid19 within the company. If ""being family"" is built into the culture, why are you forcing people to work in the office that could expose them to Covid19? And don't just say that they have an option of working from home because there is a fear instilled within the company that if you rock the boat- you're pushed out."
942,,Career vs a Job,2020-07-25,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"The company is constantly growing and most negative reviews on here are team members that don’t strive to better themselves.  Team Members that are constantly looking for the next best thing to come along instead of creating their own opportunities within United Shore.   So if you are a self starter, go getter, have a positive attitude and a strong work ethic United Shore is the place for you.  

Everyday you get to challenge yourself to be better to make a difference and that’s the difference between having a job and a career. 

Let’s truly look at what’s going on here with positive and negative reviews.  Negative reviews don’t mention the Zero layoffs during Covid 19, even while the company purposely slowed down production and money wasn’t coming in no one was laid off, benefits didn’t get cut (you still had your insurance and still received your paycheck) and the company took the time to help us better ourselves.  

I know so many people, friends and family members that are still struggling to find work and have no benefits.  So instead of listening to the noise from our competitors and claiming they will take care of you look yourself in the mirror because the grass isn’t greener on the other side.  They just need you because they know our training is the best in the industry and that our culture is far superior than theirs and they want you to help them create what we already have.  But it’s doesn’t work that way.  It’s all smoke and mirrors and what they promise you is for the short term not the long term.  Here it’s a career there it’s a job. 

If you read a lot of reviews most of them are driven by our competitors egging on the weak to try to tear down what we have because they don’t have it.   

If you are looking for a career and looking for something long term and not short term United Shore is the place to be.  Family owned, Family run.  As for the review that said something about an IPO during the massive layoffs throughout the curing back in March, April and May layoffs would have been unavoidable at United Shore because IPO’s and non family owned businesses only care about the bottom line.  They don’t care about you.",Nothing! You control your work ethic and attitude.

944,,This Place is Different,2020-07-24,5.0,Team Lead,"Being in tech and mostly working agency jobs before this, there was some culture shock I wasn't ready for. Everyone was extremely friendly and there was a lot of music playing throughout the building. I was worried I'd joined a cult instead of secured a job. Once I started learning about the pillars and how they were trying to approach culture differently I gained some understanding.
Then about a week in I was sitting in the lunch room and watching a security guard happily let people into a broken door that was in the process of being fixed. Every other place I'd worked would have a sign that said ""Broken Door"" and just waited for someone to fix it. At United Shore people take pride in doing things the right way in every role, and a broken door that inconveniences everyone who came across it was unacceptable. They do things differently here.","Their agile is highly advanced and working remotely is not possible. Being in the office is an important part of the every day work flow and culture. 
Punching in and out takes some getting used to but eventually you realize it has more to do with transparency than micromanagement."

Worst place you could possibly work.,2020-07-09,2.0,Anonymous,A Lying CEO who only cares about his pockets NOT that of his hardworking employees,"Read below. Anything I could say is already been said a 1000s times before. Fake promises of bonuses, hours etc. In 2016 the CEO stated he would give us all a bonus of $10,000 if we got $50 Billion in production. If you think you're getting that bonus I can promise you that you aren't. This company treats brokers like gold and employees like garbage. This is a churn n burn employer. I'd guess 70-80% of their employees receive some type of government assistance. It's sad to say, but it's just a matter of time until they get shutdown due to their ridiculous, unethical business practices. They are now trying to sue employees that leave because they were tired of being taken advantage of paid poorly and wanted better for themselves or their families. IF YOU TOOK CARE OF PEOPLE THEY WOULDNT LEAVE. NOVEL CONCEPT, I KNOW. You could also end up with a moron for a boss like I have that expects you to complete 60 hours of work in 40 hours because they work 7 days a week. I'm not paid to sit at home and get additional work done on a weekend so to hold people to a standard that doesn't fit their pay is moronic. ""We're family"" Yea ok as far as work goes maybe, but certainly not pay. Money is saved for Mat's illiterate Michigan State buddies who can have their bareA all over local news, but be a ""Leader"" here. Place is such a joke.  Look elsewhere."

961,,Watching this place crumble before my eyes,2020-06-19,1.0,Senior Underwriter,It’s great when you can actually do your job and hit your bonus. Unfortunately these times are few and far between.,"Leadership as a whole. They are more concerned with cramming everyone back into the building during a global pandemic than the happiness and safety of employees. It’s sadly all about the bottom line here. Changing the commitment of underwriters to go up with their best week of the month and not taking an average. They offer “incentives” which are a mere fraction of what they used to be. When you do try to go for an incentive they will audit your files to try to find any error they can stick you with in hopes to take away that incentive bonus. I understand we are supposed to be flexible, but when leadership is running around like chickens with their heads cut off it only leads to frustrated employees. It’s been incredibly disheartening to hear about upset employees leaving to find a better experience at another company only to be threatened by leadership with a lawsuit for signing a non-compete (which was not disclosed to employees when it was signed). Instead of thinking of ways to keep their employees in a positive way, they have moved to the scare tactics in order to make employees feel trapped. Employees are leaving in drones and management just seems to want to work what employees are left to the bone. Client service is important but when you have clients who are clueless, sales teams who are poorly coaching them, and continually raising the expectations of underwriters to unrealistic levels it creates the perfect storm of a terrible experience for all parties involved."

Just beware of the stress that comes along with the promotion.,"This place loves sports analogies. They run all of them into the ground. They love to give lip service and talk about how much we are family. If my family treated me this way, I would cut all ties with them. They lie and say you can be open and honest with us. We would love to hear what you have to say. Don't believe it. If you tell the truth you are punished for it. If you tell them something you do not like, you are labeled as ""negative"" and you will never live that label down. You are not encouraged to go and speak with ANY of the VP's. You have to follow the chain of command to death or until they get rid of you. This place is a mean girls club. If you are not popular, your opinion means less than nothing. They send out a survey twice a year and tell you it is anonymous; however by some act of got your next meeting with your leader will include their leader and they will want to talk about if you are happy with your job, like you can ever tell the truth about it. They place you in salary positions, pile on the work and insist you do not work overtime. However, everyone always clocks out so they do not have to hear the speech from their manager about ""firm 40"" and then they proceed to work a firm 60 hours. I use to believe the CEO was just oblivious to all of the all of the unhappiness on the floor. However, I have now come to think he just does not care what anyone thinks. And anyone who disagrees gets the chop! You are not allowed to reason with upper management. Be happy and smile until blood runs from your eyes but don't you dare say one negative word.Yes they sent us all home to work for a few months due to COVID, but you best believe we will be packed in there again like sardines as soon as Michigan is given the all clear. It does not matter if it is safe! They do not care at all! I got sick at work once, I went and told the DL who is now a VP, he told me I need you to hit your numbers before you go home. I told him I was scared I would not make it home, he told me I need you to hit your commitment. THIS GUY THEN GOT PROMOTED! Does that sound like family? Lol, an abusive family that only cares for you when you can do something for them. However they never give back in return. Four years ago we were promised 10K in 2020. We will never see that money. However the CEO can buy new buildings and build bridges, and go after Quicken in superbowl commercials. How about helping your family out and spreading the wealth in these tough times. I guess we are not family when it comes to matters of money. YOU WILL NEVER HAVE WORK/LIFE Balance here. Secretly everyone hates it here, they just lie and smile to keep their jobs. People are not their greatest asset, they are expendable. They will fire you and but someone else in your place the next day. You will never have time for fun or friendship. You will never make it to the gym after working a million hours. They will force you to take three thousand training courses and quiz you until you are blue in the face. But don't worry, they will remain the number one wholesale company in the world, and that is all they care about. Nothing more. The bottom line is something is broken in this company, and they do not want to fix it. If they wanted it fix, they would put as much effort into making people really happy, as they do into making people act fake and lie about how they really feel so they can keep their jobs."

There is nothing professional about this place. If you’re desperate and have no choice to work here then go ahead. Get your money and get out. It’s the fakest organization I’ve ever been a part of.

There is no “firm 40”. They want you to work extra hours out of your own time for days called Rise and Grind where you are required to work 8-7, if not even more so you can hit your “commitment”. Best part is you don’t get paid for the additional hours you put in as you are capped when you get “promoted”. They don’t pay you for leadership programs. If you want to participate in it, you have to do it outside of your work hours. You basically go from being hourly to salary. Basically suffering a major pay cut. 
Can’t forget that if you have clear evidence that a Division Lead or Team Lead is insufficient to lead a team or pod and you are uncomfortable working under them (super perverted and super creepy), they won’t give a rat’s butt about it and will tell you that you have a “bad attitude”. 
Don’t forget the time wasted listening to trainers rambling about changes in the industry through webinars and then you are expected to make up for the lost hour of work, even if it means you need to work extra hours without pay.
The company will come after you if you decide to leave even though they claim you’re “family” and they want what’s best for you. Ultimate B.S!
I loved this company. I was so happy there. Then it all turned sour when they forced me to be promoted. When I was forced to start from scratch. When I was forced to work so many hours and wasn’t paid for all the extra hours I put in. And the worst part is when COVID-19 happened and they didn’t know how to handle crap! Kept coming up with overlays (their own requirements for documentation), making us audit files instead of actually producing anything, and suspending our bonus when every other competitor was doing amazing! Worst part is when they started hiring soooo many people and then promoting them within 3 months of starting as underwriter IIs without testing their knowledge and then expecting team leads and the people who have been there longer to help train these people that didn’t know anything. They add so many tasks onto you and expect you to be perfect at everything you do and not be stressed with all the piled up work they throw on you."

It's because you claim ""People are our greatest asset"", yet you do not express it. Certain Underwriters cannot be replaced with some random new hire off the street like Mat Ishbia thinks they can be. You're losing talented Senior Underwriters because you are asking us to do WAY too much, while being the lowest paid Underwriting staff around. The salary is a joke compared to the industry standard, you need to take a look into that immediately. I don't care about your bonus structure, other lenders have that ON TOP of a higher salary than what you are offering. We see you Mat. We see that as revenue goes up, our bonus structures and our salaries stay the exact same. Some of us are not blind. Also, stop with the Usnaps. Stop with no call left behind. Stop with the ridiculously unobtainable turn times, and unobtainable CR and CLUW SLAs. Stop being so afraid of inconveniencing the client for one second and just think about your people. Do you think it's okay to overwork us the way that you do? Really sit down and reflect upon that statement for a moment. Just stop with all of the busy work. We are working, we promise. Just let us do our Underwrites, and let us call a broker back if we are in the middle of doing something. Let us answer that CR right after our current Underwrite. You do realize that the unnecessary constant stop and go nature of our jobs is also leading to our LQ downfall, right? Being expected to drop everything that we are doing to answer a CR, do a CLUW, answer a phone call. Those interruptions have a direct impact on our process, which you guys want us to have so badly. LET US HAVE SOME UNINTERRUPTED TIME THROUGHOUT THE DAY, THE BUSINESS WILL NOT CRASH AND BURN. Also, please take the Team Leads out of production. You guys have good Team Leads stepping down constantly because you are putting too much responsibility into one role, and not very many people can handle it. It's not normal to have to do 3 Underwrites, monitor usnaps, call scores,CR data, CLUWS,completes,escalations,training new Underwriters, meetings, handling tough calls with brokers, etc. I understand client service is important, trust me I do. But, management makes it the top priority at all times. How are we expected to be happy at a company and listen to our CEO when he says that we are ""family"" constantly, but we are the ones always suffering at the feet of the client? Stick to your word. If we are family, listen to our concerns and make changes. You have no idea how many intelligent people you have working at your company, and you're going to keep losing them if you continue to treat them the way that you do. All I've ever truly wanted to do is come in and do all of my work at the highest quality possible, and go home after I've put in my 40 hours. I was in love with my job in 2019. You guys were so much better at managing back then. I felt heard, and I felt valued. Then, I was moved to a team that made me miserable because I happened to get the worst leader in the building. You have done NOTHING with the amount of complaints that you have received about this leader, and its disgusting. It speaks so loudly on our team. We are all suffering under poor management and you do nothing about it. I don't even have to say his name and I guarantee you already know exactly who I am referring to. UWM is a toxic environment that tricks people into coming to work for them. We don't use the basketball court, the ping pong table, the gamer room. We don't work a firm 40. If we do work a firm 40, our leaders make us feel like we are letting our entire team down because we don't want to stay and work extra files and not receive any overtime for it. It's all for show. Maybe instead of all of these ""amenities"" that are just a way to show off to the brokers when they visit, put that into our salaries. Pay seniors the overtime that we deserve. Give more raises to the people who stand out and always exceed expectations, it'll give your employees motivation and something to shoot for. Stop basing commitments off of your ""best week"", that just makes people fear their commitment going up and will never exceed commitment. Honestly, just stop with commitments all together. Make us have a minimum, and anything above the minimum is extra money for those who want to put in the extra work. Yes, you will have some Underwriters who always work the minimum, but so what? Just pay them the normal $52,500, which is still low for industry standard anyway. I guarantee you a lot more people will exceed the minimum number if they don't have to fear their commitments going up. I know for a fact that I would constantly be exceeding that minimum."

You punch in and out so that they can tell if you arrive and leave on time. if you arrive later than your planned/scheduled start time, your boss will come talk to you about being tardy. What is this, hi school? your salary, but you will be treated like an hourly worker at mcdonalds. other reasons to punch in and out include so they can tell who is taking short lunches. turnover is massive because everyone is miserable and ceo refuses to change organization and culture. they force the smiles you see in pics by firing anyone who they think is negative and they call that coaching out. coach up or coach out is there saying and you will be treated like the newest freshman on their hi school basketball team. horrible horrible company do not take job with them unless you have to and make sure you have an exit plan. everyone else does. they illegally make people come to office during pandemic even though state law says only those who cant work from home are allowed to report to office. be you here is there thing and family company is there thing, but their actions say get to work here even if it puts your actual families health at risk."

977,,A complete and total facade...,2020-05-10,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"While this is a very negative review of the company, there are some positives. You do get decent benefits, hour lunch, free coffee/soda/tea constantly, and a lot of on-site amenities. There are also a lot of cool and genuinely good people who work here so making friends/connections is relatively easy. This is coming from someone who has worked across multiple departments at the company. While it might seem like a con, the company does do a good job of allowing you to get exposed to many areas of the mortgage world.","The biggest negative to working here is that the company is constantly deceptive to all who are connected to it. Let me explain...first, let's talk about what employees go through. Employees at all levels of the company are lied to about how bonus structures work. The company already pays poorly from the get go (as several reviews have already pointed out) and tries to tease you with the idea of bonuses. However, with how the company hires, bonuses become difficult, if not, impossible to come by. They are so driven by data (which is constantly kept behind closed doors) that even if you manage to bonus, it will soon just be taken away as they will make it harder/impossible to bonus by adjusting thresholds. The only way to make up for it is for employees to work long hours (with the exception of what happened with COVID-19, as they cut off every single way to make money outside of just your hourly rate. No shift premiums, OT, bonuses, etc). Your only way of making more money is either through a tiny yearly merit or by getting a ""promotion,"" which is really a joke in so many respects. Promotions come with generally a minimal raise and a lot more work on your plate. Mind you, they are now effectively requiring you to take leadership courses in order to become a leader. It's been said by management that you don't need to take these courses to be considered for a lead role, but good luck finding people who get promoted without taking those classes.

In addition to this, employees are expected to join into the cult messages the company promotes. There isn't an opt-out; you're forced into it if you want to get anywhere or get labeled an outsider. They look into how positive you've been on their internal message board and how much you've shown appreciation to other team members. I, along with others, have been looked down upon for not participating and simply doing my job. Oh, and if you want to be in management, prepare to sellout. You can't have your own leadership style and must adhere to the company's mantra. It shows a lack of free will among employees as a whole.

So speaking of that, the employees are constantly at the mercy of horrible brokers who shout and get mad at you for everything, even if it isn't your fault. Brokers can access you in so many ways that employees in a lot of departments that you will get driven nuts. The company's ""No Call Left Behind"" policy is beyond a joke, as you cannot miss calls without fearing backlash and ultimately end up getting canned. So brokers are allowed to contact you in several ways, treat you like dirt, and you have to take it. Does that at all sound like this company respects their own pillar of ""People are our greatest asset?""

The quality of employees is declining. You're also at the mercy of a lazy IT department who constantly ""breaks"" our technology and doesn't care to fix it. Underwriters are so poorly trained that you being a body in a chair matters more than your output as long as you kiss up to the broker. Sales poorly coaches up their brokers, straining all departments in the company to have to deal with ridiculous scenarios and issues that hinder productivity."

The benefits are reasonable and fair.    Working remote and from home is definitely a positive and should be looked at past COVID-19.,"Mortgage industry wise, the pay is not competitive and you can work here, get the experience, and go to another company and make more.    The company should analyze the market and pay based on what other mortgage companies pay, especially in underwriting.  Losing qualified staff due to inadequate pay is the only con I would state."

981,,A Place To Get Better Every Day,2020-04-09,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"I've been at United Shore for almost a year now -- long enough for the new shine to wear away -- but the thing that still strikes me as so different from any other place I've worked are the amount of training and resources available for those who are interested and willing to constantly push for better. You have access to training from the moment you walk in the door -- and it's expected you'll continue training throughout your career. Whether to get better at your existing job or to learn how to do another one (this is one of those rare places where I see as much movement from type of job to type of job as up or down the ladder), there are coaches, classes and online resources for you. 

As someone who gets bored easily and thrives on learning new things, this works for me!

Also, I really have to say, as goofy as it is, I really LIKE coming to a place where people hold the door open for you, say good morning, and are weirdly nice (at least before we all pretty much had to work from home...). It sets my attitude right from the moment I enter the building.","This place can be hard for someone who likes to fade in the background and just do their thing. You are required to not just do your job well, but also to connect with others, to share your ideas, and to help others get better too. And some people, frankly, are super uncomfortable with that. That's okay, but if that's you, I'd say think again before taking a job here or you will for sure be unhappy.  

Also, the parking lots are football fields which sucks in winter. And schedules are pretty rigid. But that's small potatoes (at least for me)."

If you ever try to voice your opinion or suggest something new, you are immediately labeled as having a “bad attitude” or “not being a team player”. There are so many things this company could do to improve. They require all employees to work a 10-7 shift but refuse to implement a day care in the buildings to help assist employees who have families; because let’s be realistic, what daycares are open until 7:00 PM? When asking the CEO, why we can’t have a daycare, he states “this isn’t something that everyone can use”. Let me say, as someone who doesn’t have children, I would love for this to be an option for my co-workers who do. This place preaches about having a “work life” balance but there is none. They said you work a “firm 40”, no more than 40 hours a week, but when they are busy and need the help, and you don’t offer to work until 10:00 PM for the exchange of being bought pizza for dinner, you are labeled as a person with a bad attitude and that you aren’t a team player. Not one person in upper management could care about anyone below them. This place is hands down, the worst place I have ever worked for."

989,,This place is crazy,2020-03-04,2.0,Senior Underwriter,There's a Starbucks in the building which is lovely. Casual dress code.,"Ugh. Where do I even start? The hours are impossible for people with kids and they plan flat don't care. I have zero work life balance. The mandatory shift in underwriting (and most other roles) is 10am to 7pm. Daycares close at 6pm. How is anyone supposed to make that work? Their big thing is Firm 40 - as in give us a solid 40 hour work week and then go live your life - but I have never been scheduled fewer than 45 hours a week, sometimes 47, and more is absolutely expected. You get shamed for leaving on time at the end of your work day. Everyone is expected to stay late and come in on the weekend. Those that don't get lectures about not being a team player.
The expectations are unrealistic and often ridiculous. You have a daily quota of files to underwriter, which is not unreasonable, but they constantly add tasks and meetings to your work day reducing the amount of time you have to actually get your work done but the expectation is that if they take an hour out of your day for a meeting that you will stay an hour past the end of your shift to make it up. Unpaid of course, because we're salary. We have to send video emails to our brokers every day about absolutely nothing and it's embarrassing and uncomfortable. Additionally, you are not allowed to miss a phone call. Ever. You have to ask your coworkers to watch your phone so you can use the restroom and sometimes they don't want to. I shouldn't have to ask 4 people if I can go pee please. I work with a girl who is six months pregnant and holding her bladder because she doesn't want to ask. 
Nothing is ever enough in underwriting. You can be there on time, work your scheduled shift, work through lunch, do all the things you're supposed to do, and it's never enough. You didn't stay late? Didn't exceed your quota?! Only 100% on your call scores this month?! Better schedule a meeting to discuss why the score isn't 105%. It's utterly demoralizing."
990,,I Was Fired,2020-03-02,1.0,Underwriter,The benefits. Bonuses - if no major mistakes.,"I was fired without given any direction afterwords. They fired me without hearing my side, or letting me know what I did wrong so it wouldn't happen again. Just flat out fired. The guy that fired me did not care at all. Makes me want to go into HR as a career and ""part ways"" with people in a better manner than I was treated. So thanks for that. I was doing a shadow/drive session with not my assigned shadow/driver, In a nut shell I was doing what I was suppose to be doing just not where I was suppose to be doing it. The next day they call me into a room and fire me. I was in love with that job and was looking forward to the next step. I was actually happy to get up and go to work again. After finally almost getting out of training; they broke my heart. They did not hear me out. Had the termination paper ready and no direction given. Which is why I give this place 1 star. They say even if United Shore is not your fit, they will help guide you to your right career, or place you somewhere else within the company. They let me go without a care in the world. I was escorted out and humiliated. Their people are their #1, that's a fabrication (their clients are their #1). Firm 40 they stress in a positive way. Firm 40 but require overtime and give it a cool name; Rise & Grind Tuesdays.. Everyone there is goody-two-shoes. Watch your mouth or you will get told on. If sitting when they say sit, and you like being treated like a dog or like feeling like a high schooler all over again, then the benefits are definitely worth it. Or if you have a family to provide for, stick it out. Shut up and work mentality. They care about their clients more than you. People typically do like 14 underwrites per day. Overworked, but pay is decent."

You have to provide great client service so you can’t tell them their being ridiculous of course so it can be hard to deal with a toddler like that. Brokers may bring life to the company but they shouldn’t be allowed to verbally abuse anyone. The people around you will boost your mood afterward if your on a good team, but again, just make sure you understand what the position requires from you. The hours aren’t awesome either unless your perhaps single with no kiddos."
995,,An Objective Review,2020-02-11,2.0,Anonymous Employee,"The amenities are nice, as there's a gym, onsite doctor, store, cafeteria (that serves subpar food) and a somewhat new building (albeit in a rather bad area). The company does try and do engaging things with the employees. The yearly holiday party provided is extravagant, and they host a fair in the summer. They also have a 3 o'clock dance party every Thursday but I don't think 90% of the employees care for it.

The company will train literally anyone to do anything, regardless of prior background or knowledge, so it's a good way to develop a new career. There are also some solid individuals here. The company, for the most part, does try to stick to working 40 hours per week.

Management does give time to offer feedback to employees every month, so you are aware of what’s expected from you.","As great as these pros may seem they come with plenty of drawbacks. As stated by many other reviewers United Shore's compensation to employees isn't comparable to other lenders. Production roles have the opportunity to make bonuses but as the company hires in an effort to make sure everything is met within service level agreement and adds the expectation of unrealistic client catering, opportunities to bonus get fewer and fewer. Although the company has made record breaking months most employees haven't received any sort of raise unless they receive a direct promotion, and even then, that might not be promised. 

The technology that United prides itself on often falls apart internally, systems often experience glitches and sometimes stop completely working and are never fixed at all. At times it’s completely abysmal. 

As said before, the company will train anybody to do anything. That means roles are often filled with people who lack experience and desired characteristics of whats needed for that role. I've also witnessed a lot of behavior that's unbecoming of a professional work setting from both senior management and team members (I won't list them to keep anonymity), these behaviors include bullying, gossip, and inappropriate advances. About 57% of the company is made up of millennials, so immature work practices are just wrote off as business as usual.  Team members in production roles are often trying to get as much done as possible, leading to a lot of corner cutting and unfair play. Some of the employees just flat out aren’t team players and don’t really have an incentive to be. 

Work life balance exists better for some teams more than it does for others. If you haven't hit your goal for the day or your team hasn't hit your goal, depending on your department you must stay until it's finished, even if the workload is light. 

The company has odd practices that really cater to the cliental at the cost of the employees. You are expected to answer your phone whenever it rings, and you can never leave it unattended (it must be forwarded to either an OOO team or another team member). The clients can submit requests which take priority over whatever you are doing and must be dealt with immediately. Even emails have a timeframe in which they must be answered.  The above and beyond catering to clients makes even simple tasks hard to complete at times and can really overburden mental health.  Managements answer to this is ""get up and take a break from your desk” but punching out for 15 minutes and sitting somewhere else isn't going to somehow magically put you back to healthy mindset, despite what they say. 

The clientele can get away with a lot if they cause enough of an uproar and will try to do as much as they can to not play by the rules.  A daily argument is expected in a lot of areas that are client facing in the company. A lot of your day can go towards trying to rectify rather silly issues, and although you were working, the reports won’t see it that way, and you can expect that someone’s going to bring up your production at some point."

1008,,Good Training and Experience but not enough pay,2020-01-13,3.0,Community Consultant,"nice community, great perks and services in the building, hours can be flexible. good benefits","flexible hours effect hourly pay. overtime allowed, but not with time and a half. management can be cliquey and power hungry. work load can be very stressful"
1009,,Beehive,2019-12-30,2.0,Client Service Representative,"Free pop, on campus weight room",Pay is low. There are so many layers to this company that “promotions” aren’t real. There’s a small group at the top who make good money. Everyone else here is disposable and basically a body to fill a chair and keep the beehive running for those on top to make money.
1010,,A nightmare ending to a dream job,2019-12-26,1.0,Underwriter,"Had a great trainer, great coworkers, my original supervisor was awesome.  Free coffee and pop.","This company does not practice what it preaches anymore.  Shore was a great place to work for  when I started but the move to Pontiac and obsession with besting Quicken has turned the company rotten.  Two days after Christmas I was pulled aside by my team lead with accusations of stealing from the company.  I had gotten credit for a loan I had never worked or even touched over a month ago .  I was not allowed to plead my case or have an opportunity to look at the file.  This was obviously an IT glitch but it didn't matter. I was terminated on the spot and escorted out of the building like a criminal.  I was not allowed to say goodbye to the coworkers I loved and worked with for so long or even pack up my own things.  My belongings were thrown in garbage bags with no regard to if they were fragile or not.  I wasn't allowed to keep my service excellence coins that I worked so hard to get. They were confiscated on the spot.  Shore would've probably taken my Shinola watch if it wasn't safe at home.  Years of great service gone in an instant due to an IT glitch.  Mat Ishba doesn't care about the people who work for him.  Stay away, work anywhere else if you must have a job in the mortgage industry. You'll be treated much better."
1011,,best place to work,2019-12-10,5.0,Account Executive,"very relaxed, rewarding company to work for",location isnt all that great
1012,,Great place to work,2019-11-26,5.0,Underwriter,Great place to work with lots of perks!,HQ is too far from home
1013,,Don’t waste your time.  Unless you like being paid less than McDonald’s wage,2019-11-22,1.0,,Excellent people. Positive environment. Great cafe and cool perks in the building.,At will company. Pays $12 and hour for underwriting. Account executives get terrible leads. You will only make $500 a week as an AE. If you make it two years and do good. Maybe you can make some cash. But  you will get crap leads for the first year and a half. And they will take away the good leads when you get them. And move them to your team leader or somebody with more seniority. Again about the at Will. I’ve watched people be fired for nothing with no reason. People wanting an explanation will not get one when they are let go. The initial training class is very rushed. So when you hit the floor you still won’t know anything. You’re going to be calling people or brokers I should say that have been contacted 1 million times that hate you. Your job is to make them come to United Shore. Honestly it’s just too much. Especially for the money you’re making. I quit a week ago and I am going to Quicken loans to learn the proper training with better job security. You can be let go for the way your cologne smells. I’ve noticed a lot of favoritism. Usually that comes from the higher ups. But I’ve watched them let people go right now during the holidays which sucks because it’s hard to find another job right now. This place is very cult oriented. They don’t want you talking to your friends who get fired. They tell you to cut off all contacts. I think this job would’ve been good when it wasn’t so corporate. Not trying to bash too hard but don’t quit a good job to come here to make peanuts. The odds of you making it are very slim mama so you have some friends who are in higher up positions. Don’t believe the reviews that are positive. They are submitted by a team of people at the company. The negative reviews are the real ones. I put in my two week notice and got fired right when I did.

1015,,Opportunity of a Lifetime.  Rewarding Work.,2019-11-17,5.0,IT Analyst,"United Shore is all about their people.  They listen and are constantly working to adapt.  The company has grown like crazy, so it hasn't always been perfect, but where is?  At least here they are focused on changing it for good.

The IT culture isn't typical.  There are definitely differences that you give and take.  It's funny though because reading other reviews cite things such as how tough it is to clock in and out or that work from home is limited to those who can be trusted.  These are small problems that are amplified in the absence of greater ones.  United Shore doesn't really have big problems.  It's been great working here.

Work hard, show ownership, be willing to learn and you will thrive here.  My personal growth over the years has been tremendous as the company has allowed me to adapt to my role and move up through the company.","Clocking in and out on salary.  Laughably small problems.

Honestly nothing else really bothers me.  I'm not unreasonable."

1017,,IT Folks: Look the other way!,2019-11-13,1.0,Software Developer,Great coworkers. That’s about it.,"If you’re in IT, look the other way. The culture is absolutely toxic, pay is low, you’re expected to put in hours on weekends with no bonuses or overtime. Forget about working from home - they claim it’s allowed now, but it’s obvious how much management actually looks down on you when choose to work from home. Funny thing is, the CTO himself is only in the office 2-3 days of the week, and works from home the rest of the days since he lives out of state - yet he absolutely is not okay with employees freely working from home. When it comes to promotions, it’s all about who you know. Favoritism at this company is so apparent that it’s actually funny. Also let’s not forget about how the CTO himself has promoted undeserving people simply for the fact that they were a little more than “friends”. This place is an absolute joke, save yourself the stress and find somewhere else to work!"

I feel like I get to make an impact every day, and the people I work with are amazing!",The only downside I have is that I wish I would have found United Shore and started my career here earlier!
1021,,Great Place To Be Since early 2019,2019-11-04,5.0,Underwriter,"This is the ultimate positive environment for a growing company . Mortgages are overall boring so finding a place to work that enjoyable is a big deal. Pay is great for new people to the mortgage industry, and growth is really open right now.",I cant think of any right now. Getting crowded but we just purchased another building next door... So all is well
1022,,run far away,2019-10-29,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"nice new building, holiday party is always well put together.",If you enjoy getting paid in perk or pep talk than this is a perfect place for you. the dream of 6 figures is a pipe dream unless you are a Friend or family member of a VP or played for MSU. The company is littered with unqualified leaders. clean house get rid of the cancer and start fresh.
1023,,Absolutely Incredible!,2019-10-26,5.0,Development Team Lead,"I don’t even know where to begin, this is such an amazing place to work! The opportunities are endless and you really can be who and what you want to be. Come in as an underwriter and want to move to IT? Done. Want to move up into the ranks of leadership? Prove yourself to be a leader in your role and it’s done. Very few places allow for that and it’s really one of Shore’s strengths. The other piece to this is our Pillars. Most company’s have some sort of core philosophy that they tell you about on the first day but you quickly realize that it’s all fake - not here! Everyone here truly embodies each and every pillar and it’s the primary reason this company has come so far. 

The second most important is our technology. Our technology team is unparalleled in what we can produce. The speed at which we move and the agility we have as an IT team overall is mind-blowing. We deliver in a few months what most companies would take years to develop. As a member of the IT team, I really have to say it’s the best team I’ve ever worked with and it’s only getting better. IT is one big family and everyone looks out for each other. The most valuable piece to me, however, is that your voice is heard no matter what your role is. I started off as a developer and later moved into leadership and my thoughts and opinions were heard and, most importantly, valued from the moment I joined. I felt able to effect change no matter what I was doing and a lot of this is owed to the culture our CTO has created for us. Jason Bressler is a world-class leader and has built an incredible team and culture. He invites open and honest feedback by maintaining an open-door policy that applies to team members at all levels which is unheard of.

Oh, and have I mentioned the perks and amenities? We have a beautiful building with an in-house Starbucks and huge cafeteria. There’s a full gym with a full-size basketball court!! We’ve even got an arcade and various other fun-filled activists.","Because we deliver so fast, sometimes there are hiccups or challenges that create bigger problems. This can lead to working overtime occasionally but that isn’t very common. Outside of that, there are some typical growing pains due to our exponential growth but they quickly become minor in the big scheme of things."
1024,,Endless Opportunity,2019-10-25,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"If you show you are committed to the company and work hard, they will return that commitment in full.","Teams change often, so there is not always the best continuity."
1025,,Don’t Work Here,2019-10-24,2.0,Anonymous Employee,Good perks and extras for fun.,Clear cut favoritism shown by leadership. You only succeeded if you kiss up to leadership.  CEO is completely oblivious to how poorly his Account Executives are treated by leadership. They say they are committed to employee happiness and give robotic and rehearsed responses but it’s not true. They’re just saying what they’re told to say. When you speak up you’re deemed a trouble maker and officially committed career suicide.
1026,,Absolutely love it,2019-10-24,5.0,Quality Assurance,Best place to be at where people and culture are valued as #1. Today was an excellent example of Diwali party celebrated with senior leaders support and participation,Fast paced environment but that is to be expected with an aggressive growth. Can’t complain.
1027,,A unique place with a lot to offer.,2019-10-24,5.0,Information Technology,"Of course United Shore comes with a lot of great perks and amenities, but to be honest I don’t even utilize many of them every day. They are amazing perks, but the real magic is in the people I work with each and every day. The organization as a whole is quite impressive. The way leadership values people is unlike any organization I have been. I won’t say it’s all sunshine and rainbows, because that’s honestly not interesting and unrealistic. But the most distinguishing feature about United Shore is they actually want to make it better and they wholeheartedly admit when they dropped the ball or made a mistake. There are opportunities, just like any other company, but it’s about driving change to fill the gaps that real sets United Shore apart in my opinion.","We change quickly, it’s always about getting ahead of the ball before you’re running behind it - which at times can be a matter of hours. For IT specifically, we need more strategy around our actions, and from I can tell that has been recognized and leadership is working hard to correct it."
1028,,There is a reason this company is growing so quickly,2019-10-24,5.0,IT Team Lead,"Where to start? I've honestly never seen a company in my life that is so detail focused. They have literally thought of everything, from training to coaching to peer shadowing, etc. they have literally covered all of the bases.

The vibe of the office is pure positivity, and not in some cheezy, culty, ""Stepford Wives"" vibe, but actual positivity.  And there is a reason.

For one, IT is insanely nimble. For some autos, sprints are literally 6-months. Here, we have 48-hour deploys.

Our data center is World class. You will never see fans duct taped to racks or running some archaic, un-patched software. If IT can business justify it, it gets done.

IT is encouraged to spread their wings, complacency isn't an option. Too often we run into people that interview here that had ""one job"" for 5+ years...not here. Enterprise Technology, for example, encourages moving between teams, having 4-5 SMEs on a certain technology,  and constant employee to employee knowledge transfers. This not only helps the business, but it allows employees to improve their skills and to maintain their relevance.

Change is inevitable. It doesn't matter who you are in the org, you have a voice and you can create change. We consistently say, ""If you thought about it long enough to complain about it, you've had the time to come up with a solution.""

Opportunities for advancement are insane, if you want it, you can make a plan, work for it, and achieve it.  IT is growing so fast, the inevitable cream will rise quickly to the top.","With an insanely fast moving business, IT sometimes struggles to catch up. While I list this as a con, this is a good problem to have.

Cross team communication seems to be lacking at times, with 700 IT employees and 70 leaders, it is sometimes difficult to broadcast messaging. Especially with teams working on the same projects without knowledge of one another.

Lastly, benefits, PTO and salary aren't as competitive as they should be for a company this large. This needs to be looked at as we are losing good talent to other firms."
1029,,I genuinely love it here.,2019-10-23,5.0,Correspondent Specialist,"I genuinely love being a team member here. I feel as though I’m valued and I make a difference. They are constantly providing a positive environment with all the resources to advance and promote continuous improvement. The culture is great, my team is absolutely amazing, and I love everything about my job. I could easily see myself retiring from this company some day.","Shift times, because we are a nation wide company, we accommodate west coast business hours as well, so some folks are required to work later hours, but not everyone has to, and some people prefer it."

They will dazzle you with extra's and niceties, but eventually those things feel normal.","When a place is constantly reminding it's team members of the competition of the workplace, those motivational tactics can eventually burn out certain team members.

1038,,Would give it more stars,2019-10-12,2.0,Underwriter,"Smoke free Environment, benefits are standard, opportunities for promotions are numerous. Team oriented.","The Underwriting training program.  There is a whole week dedicated to just the intro to the company and underwriting. Can be shortened to a couple of days max. And the 4 intensive weeks of class work, which is fine, but they do not give you on hands training into the actual programs you will be running on the floor, which is a big problem for those who learn better by doing, For a computer based company, the class is all book work and you have no frame of reference for where you are inputting all the information. 8 quizzes, 1 midterm and a final. If you don't pass you are relegated to ""study hall"" like a truant teenager. Its embarrassing to say the least, and your fate is up in the air and you feel like a complete failure.
The Senior staff that run the Underwriting program, are underwhelming, i reached out to one of them for an issue, i don't want to name her, but she was rather snotty and i got an snotty email, and the issue is still not resolved after 2 weeks.
The first pillar in this company is People....well the Senior staff really think they are something special and are not helpful at all.
You are given hands on training only if you successfully complete the class work and then you have to remember all the info you were given in a book and now apply that to their program to underwrite loans."

1056,,"Not Perfect, But Pretty Good and Getting Better",2019-07-19,4.0,Software Developer,"Note: if I would have filled this out 6 months ago, I would have given maybe 3 stars. However, there's been a lot of change for the good in the past few months. 

On top of the very large amount of amenities the building itself provides (smallish but nice gym + full size basketball court + fitness classes + sand volleyball court outside, all free), massage parlor (massages given out only as rewards from leadership), hair salon, very good doctor's office with $10 copay, convenience store, cafeteria with good/variety of food, arcade, an actual Starbucks, free fruit and a variety of beverages, etc, etc, etc), the company itself does a lot for its employees. There's a rather large, lavish holiday party (employees only) as well as a company fair (for employees + family) - both free. They also let you volunteer at an organization of your choice (during company time), donate to charity, recycle, and a lot of other things that are too many to list. 

In addition, the culture is very good - I'm not sure where else you'll find a ""firm 40"" in software development (less the exception for a production bug on a Friday, etc). United Shore understands that its employees are people and treat them as such. I've worked at a number of places where I was treated rather poorly and I've never been happier than at this company. Additionally, this is a great place to refine your skills, as additional training is encouraged (5 hours a month required) on almost anything you'd want if it's not completely unreasonable). They even had Uncle Bob (Robert Martin, author of Clean Code) come out and personally give developers a full day workshop. Additionally, Leadership actually takes feedback and tries to improve! 

Another good (and bad) thing about the company is that we're growing so incredibly fast and a lot of our departments are so new that if you think of something you want to do and there's a need for it (which there probably is), you probably could switch career tracks. This can be bad because it means there might not be a subject matter expert for you to talk to about something (for instance, our business intelligence team is rather new and still developing). 

I've heard senior leadership (including the CEO) say multiple times ~""if you're a good culture fit, we'll find you a job."" And being a good culture fit is easy for a lot of people. 

Other things that have been getting better that may no longer apply in older (probably more angry) reviews: work from home is now allowed (at least for IT) when needed (think closer to 1-2x/month) - they just ask you not to abuse it. Well defined career progression for developers is also being created. Some teams were  previously required to work very long hours to pushed rushed projects due to unrealistic deadlines set by the business - this has also been changing. I think most people work closer to the ""firm 40"" unless they volunteer to stay longer.

That being said, the company isn't perfect and has a number of opportunities to work on.","It seems that most initiatives, regardless of their size, are rushed to be implemented without planning. For me, this is one of the most frustrating things. 

Communication is also not great from senior leadership - again, regardless of size. They seem to be trying to improve this, but this could also tie into the lack of planning when releasing initiatives. Perhaps we don't find out until last minute because they don't know until then, either... ? 

The technology can also be difficult to work with. We have a lot of monolithic legacy code in old systems (that we have been trying to get out of for a while) as well as a proprietary system that can be easy for some things, but doesn't provide a lot of flexibility and doesn't scale very well. Our company has grown (and continues to grow) so much that even though the system was designed a few years ago, we already want to move away from it. This won't be easy or quick, though. 

We also don't use a lot of cool, new technologies. Only recently have our teams started using Angular and Python. Otherwise, we're mostly vanilla C#, SQL, JQuery, and Less shop. This also means that if you want to learn new skills that would make you valuable anywhere else, you either have to do it during your 5 hr/month training time or on your own. 

Team compositions are not well balanced. You may have mostly junior/associate team members all on one team with another team all very experienced team members. This isn't specific to developers - this includes BAs, QAs, etc. This has been brought up multiple times. 

If you have an idea or give feedback, be ready to implement it yourself, even if you're not an expert in the field. This has discouraged a number of people from speaking up, because it adds additional work to what they're already trying to accomplish and doesn't automatically provide benefit. Additionally, instead of getting experts on topics and implementing their feedback (example - consultants for Agile or for how to create good metrics for measuring developer performance), they ask the general team members what should be done. I appreciate the empowerment attempt, but what I think on a topic that I haven't spent many years studying probably isn't as helpful as the opinion of someone who's been in the field for a while. I thought this might have been a cost saving initiative, but they're either paying half the floor for a few hours to come up with ideas (which seems rather expensive with a team of over 600 IT members) which may or may not work and then have to ask them to do it all again when it doesn't - or they pay a consultant to come give advice based on their vast experience. 

You may (or may not be) severely underpaid for your skill set. Upon asking how to get a raise, I was told the same thing in two separate instances from two separate senior leaders - ""create an emotional response."" It's not really my job to make my employer feel something to pay me more money. It's my job to show them that I'm of value and then be compensated based on that. Because my spouse and I (together) make a comfortable living, I am able to survive at a lower wage. However, I know developers at a much lower experience level at other companies making much more money than I am. If the pros weren't continuing to get better (or if my spouse didn't make as much as they do), I would have been forced to leave for both mental health (it was pretty stressful before) and compensation.

Something a little smaller - PTO is rather low for the first couple years. You only get 10 days the first one. Even the low-wage, abusive job I had before this gave 16. The PTO does improve over the years, though."

You'll have access to online resources like Pluralsight and team members who are eager to help. If you're interested in building software products that scale, this may be the place to do it. 

Business leadership strives for continuous improvement and is perhaps the most customer and stakeholder-focused you'd experience anywhere in the industry. The environment is vibrant, exciting and a relatively pleasant place to work. The ""open-plan"" concept is taken to the point of over-crowding but that's just growing pains.","Technical debt within software products across engineering teams brings tears to the eyes and some products occasionally bulk under the weight of business demand. Depending on who you are, this is either an opportunity or a less than desirable aspect of working here. 

The ratio of experienced to inexperienced engineers leaves a lot to be desired. Coupled with a low barrier for entry, the lack of a well-designed engineering culture creates a feeling that some are simply winging it. Spoiler alert, most are but aren't we all :)"

1063,,An amazing place to work.,2019-06-13,5.0,Information Technology,"What can I say about United Shore?  I’m 100% in their corner because they are 100% in mine. Shore lives and breathes their Pillars (The company credo). The number one pillar “Our people are our greatest asset” is something they have proven time and time again. Shore has given me every opportunity to better myself and help better those around me. Never has there been a day where this company and their outstanding leadership team hasn’t helped my professional or personal growth.

Our IT teams get to build world class and industry leading applications and infrastructure while using the latest technology and tools available in the market. When I say latest. I mean latest. We are continually building out environments to test different technologies that will take us to the next level. If an idea makes sense, Senior IT Leadership gives us the go ahead. It really is that easy. We are a spoiled bunch.

The care that we display for one another is amazing. We all want what is best for everyone. It really does feel like Family. Family can bicker occasionally, but we stick together to achieve the same goal. Building the best, most robust technology, not only in metro Detroit, but the world.

Beyond my 9 to 5 at United Shore, I find myself bringing the pillars home with me. I often hold companies that I am a customer of to the same standard that Shore holds for itself and its team members. It is no accident that we are the fastest growing company in Metro Detroit. We hold ourselves to a high standard, and we do what it takes to continuously improve and power forward.

I am thankful that I get to work at a place where I feel I can question the why, explore ideas and build cool things.","When driving towards the goal line for project completion there can be a breakdown in communication. This happens every once in a while. Leadership has recognized the issue, and in true United Shore fashion, has committed to making it better."

1065,,Great place for IT Professionals,2019-06-03,5.0,Engineer,"The company is growing and dominating their market.   Every day, we are smashing records.  A company this size, growing at an insane rate creates a lot of unique challenges that are a lot of fun to solve.  There is no shortage of exciting projects to work on.

The new headquarters has a lot to offer employees.  There is a doctor's office, salon, massage therapist, gym (membership included) and a basketball court.  There are a lot of social events going on at any given time.  

The senior leaders are very accessible and friendly.  The CEO is truly interested in making all parts of the business better.  He will randomly sit down with you for an hour or so just to learn the ins and outs of your job.

The IT organization is treated as a vital part of the company's success, not as a cost center.  There is a lot of investment in IT,  both in technology and people.  In many companies I have had to cobble solutions together with freeware and duct tape, but here we get cutting edge hardware and enterprise level solutions.  It's a lot of fun to engineer without financial hand-cuffs.

The work/life balance is one of the best that I've ever seen.  The strong investment in IT leads to very few unplanned issues that wake us up in the middle of the night.  The staff is right-sized, we're not asked to do the jobs of 2-3 people.  This results in an average work week of about 40-45 hours for the engineering team.

The growth of the company creates a lot of career opportunities as new teams and positions are opened up.  The company has a preference to promote from within which creates a pretty fast track to management or senior technical positions for team members.","The preference to promote from within leads to a lot of people in senior technical and leadership positions that are still learning on the job, often without anyone with the time or qualifications to properly mentor them.  As a result, the IT organization is still very immature and lacks the collective wisdom that comes with experience and accomplishments.

Compensation and benefits are not very competitive compared to other large organizations in the area.  This is off-set a bit by the fewer hours worked per week  and the amenities offered by the company.  However, not every team has the same work/life balance and not everyone values the amenities offered by the company."
1066,,Love it here!,2019-05-30,5.0,Systems Engineer,"United Shore is growing so fast that we have the world’s largest sandbox to always play in.  When we moved to Pontiac from Troy, although it almost killed a lot of us, we created an incredibly beautiful Tier 3 datacenter that would make anyone proud.  But in a year, because we’re growing so fast, we now get to build off of that and create hybrid models for infinite scalability.  It’s incredible how fast we get to try out anything.  Literally anything that we think we can move with, we get.","We almost don’t have any time to sit and relax on what we’ve done because we’re always being asked to redesign and rebuild or build on to what we’ve just completed.  But for real techies that doesn’t matter, it’s just a new opportunity to learn new things."
1067,,Developer from Developer X Program,2019-05-29,5.0,Software Developer,"It’s been mentioned here, but it bears repeating, that this is an IT team filled with amazing people and mentors that I can’t imagine working without.  There are so many caring people here and the opportunity to get in at my level without experience elsewhere is amazing.  I don’t know of any companies that do things like this, at the size we are at. 

The amenities in the building are great.  Free gym, basketball court, Starbucks, a huge cafe, massage, hair salon, doctors.  There is even a large convenience store. 

The opportunities afforded here in the development industry are beyond what I have seen or what my friends in the field have found.  I was part of one of the “Developer X” programs.  I went through a boot camp at a company in Detroit and then was hired at United Shore with no work experience.  The pay was twice what I had found available at any other company with no experience.  I was put through a 4 month training program and have been a part of an application development team for almost 9 months now.","Some things here are not industry normal, but because of the opportunity I don’t really mind.  However, I know some people do.  There isn’t a lot PTO (15 days total).  There is not an official work from home policy.  That said, it’s really not a huge issue for me."
1068,,Embrace the growth opportunity!,2019-05-27,5.0,App Dev,"Thinking about my time with United Shore, I've had many leaders within IT and on various business teams care and invest in me professionally and personally. I've been able to learn so much in my time here and also share my knowledge & lead major initiatives for our company.  Everything that I love about the company comes back to two categories; People or Opportunity.

1. People - Everyone cares. Everyone might not have all the answers all the time, but everyone works hard to figure out the best solution. People genuinely care about doing the right thing, however it is sometimes hard for people to see each other's perspectives. At the end of the day, you could walk up to any team member or leader and ask any question or ask for help and they would!

2. Opportunity - With the growth, there is SO much opportunity -- opportunity to pilot a new role, to lead a project, to try out a new technology, to create a community, to learn a new skill... the list goes on and on. If you see an opportunity for something, you will be supported by your leaders and by surrounding team members who are also passionate about the same subject.  

I'm also impressed by how United Shore's culture embraces Agile. I feel lucky to be a part of an organization that values people, team work, strong relationships, ownership, continuous improvement, and fun!  The growth as been challenging, but the culture is very much still alive & I love working with new & existing team members who fully embrace & embody it.","We've definitely had some growing pains from our explosive growth and it is easy to get overwhelmed every once in awhile. Luckily, you are surrounded by great people that can help pick you up!

There seems to be a lot of gossip and drama that isn't necessary, I'd like to see leaders create a culture where this is minimized. 

Recruitment process could use a revamp - ensure we are providing the best material & asking the right questions to get the talent we want."
1069,,Certainly Not the Worst - But Not the Best,2019-05-19,3.0,Anonymous Employee,"This is by no means the worst place to work. I think the people here are fantastic. No one will ever tell you they can't help you, and it's a great place to learn. If you're just out of college or a coding bootcamp, then it's absolutely a great place to get that experience. If you're old-fashioned and don't care about things like having to clock in despite being salaried or not being able to work from home, you'll also probably be fine.

As far as long-term growth, I don't know. I know where I'd like to go within the company, but I'm not sure how, or if, I'll get there. They are very big on training there, which is good in theory, but it also means you have to take a class to get a promotion. Yes, you have to take a class to move from a Developer I to a Developer II, and you have to be nominated for it, and they don't seem to do the classes super often. Other positions have similar class requirements.","The issues I have seem to be the issues that cause many people to leave - low pay, no work from home policy, and no flexibility with working hours. The company has experienced exponential growth within the last few years, but it's clearly still adhering to policies instituted when it was a few hundred people, not a few thousand. 

Here's what I wish someone had told me before I accepted the offer:

- There is no bonus structure for IT.
- There is no work from home policy. Sure, you can take one day if you're having a repairman come out to your house, or if your kid is sick - but it's only for rare occasions like that. We've been told many times that it's a privilege that cannot be abused. In the meeting the CTO had with small groups from IT that's referenced in an earlier review, he told us we will never have regular work from home policy because the business does not do work from home. 
- You must take an hour lunch, which means you must have a nine-hour day. No, you cannot take a half-hour lunch and leave earlier. No, you cannot eat at your desk and leave after eight hours. This is not negotiable. The CTO also mentioned that this is another thing IT does because the business does it. You can see the trend here.
- Even as a salary employee, you must punch in and out because they need to make sure you're taking that full hour lunch and working your full 40. It's frustrating for me. I'd never thought I'd long for the days where I got to choose how long of a lunch to take. For me, clocking in makes me feel like I am a child that must be watched. I've always been of the opinion that if you hire someone for a salary position, you trust they can accomplish the work, and that yes, you should aim for 40 hours, but what's the harm in leaving a little early if you need to? Even ducking out five minutes early is frowned upon. If work is getting done, who cares?
- PTO is also very low. I knew that going in, but man do you feel it in the first year when you have to carefully choose how to spend your 10 days.

The CTO certainly took some flak in the earlier reviews, but I'm not even sure he deserves it. As far as I can tell, he's at the mercy of what the business does and has little to no power to effect change for IT. The business is obviously important; it's how we make money and get paid. But I can't stand being told that we can't have things that are standard at other major companies for IT simply because the business doesn't do it. If we are mortgage innovators, why not offer innovative solutions to the people working there everyday? I think it's very nice in theory to aim to treat the business and IT the same, but it just isn't working. IT people continue to leave after that 1.5-2 year mark, and if nothing changes, I'm sure that trend will continue."
1070,,Trying to be fair,2019-05-17,2.0,Software Developer,"-The onsite amenities are pretty amazing and if you’re paying attention to what goes on in the company social media platform you can get a lot of free stuff like tickets to events, or even using the “classifieds” system trade actual things that you want to get off your hands.  They have a doctor's office on site, a small market in case you need to grab milk on the way home, frequently bring pizza in so you can grab dinner as you leave, and the gym and basketball court are amazing.

-The people are what makes United Shore world class.  I am 100% confident in saying that some of the people I met there are what earned UWM all the “top places to work” awards it’s been getting.

-The training team, as well as the learning opportunities, are also fantastic, as long as you keep your ear to the ground and seek out those opportunities.  I definitely experienced a ton of professional growth while at the company, and I will always be thankful for that.  They also have started making the promotional tracks clearer if not exactly ideal, but many of my complaints that I had about the company regarding my future there would have been silenced while I was still working there if those steps had been put in place sooner.  And from what I’m told this is going to continue to get better.

-The company has been consistently growing in size year after year, allowing them to give careers to more people who need them

-Because of the size of the company, IT has pretty much every form of resource you could ask for.  Your work is reviewed by talented QA’s, your team's lead by experienced devs, projects coordinated by rigorously trained BA’s, and all of what gets written goes through the architecture team which is full of some of the most talented developers I’ve ever met.

-The remote work policy is pretty much “take it up with your leader”.  This has changed since my time when it was “we don’t have a work from home policy.” I still consider this less than ideal considering the fact that you are given a laptop and expected to work from home in emergencies, and the policy will vary leader to leader, but this is still a great move compared to what I experienced.","-United Shore prides itself on several things that it states comprise its company culture.  First of all are its six pillars: People are our greatest asset, we are thumb pointers not finger pointers, service is everyone's responsibility, relationship driven not transaction driven, continuous improvement, and fun and friendship.  Service, CI, and F&F it definitely tackles, I’ll give them that.  The rest, if you truly buy into them, will utterly disappoint you.  I have never heard of a relationship driven company kicking people out the second notice of intent to leave is given and not allowing them to finish their two weeks.  I have never heard of a relationship driven company suing it’s employees who are across the board paid below market wages, for going to a competing company, especially when that relationship driven company actively poaches the competitors employees.  United Shore cares about its relationships with its customers, not with its employees.  The same can be said of people being their greatest asset.  Until very recently, UWM was intentionally vague on how to get promoted within IT across the board.  Promotions were almost always based on personality and who you knew, not an individual's skill set.  Multiple times people who were brand new to the company were promoted into positions that I was told you needed to have at least two years in the chair for, and then shockingly those people under-performed.  The biggest joke of all being we are thumb pointers not finger pointers.  This is meant to imply that people at the company own their mistakes as well as their successes, however anyone I ever saw embodying that mentality was let go or coached out.  One of the current AVP’s within IT is practically famous for his ability to defend his previous team from fallout of their own mistakes, constantly finding other people to blame when code they pushed broke production.

The second big thing UWM prides itself on is the “firm 40” which if you’ve read any of these reviews you know is pretty much a joke.  They claim they don’t want any of their employees working more than 40 hours a week, so they use time cards to track your working hours, but it’s really just a “Firm 40 minimum”.  Someone will comment on this saying they’ve taken on unexpected volume and are working through it, but anyone familiar with the company knows that volume was expected, they claimed to be hiring ahead for it, and frankly that the firm 40 was really NEVER firm.  No one in leadership works a firm 40, and they certainly don’t expect you to.  

-If nothing else, RUMORS of extreme misconduct within leadership are rampant throughout the floor.  Multiple people are supposedly in their positions exclusively because they slept with someone higher on the totem pole than them.  While this may not be true at the end of the day, it certainly doesn’t help that various other people within leadership also report those same rumors as things to consider.

-If you work at United Shore in IT, you know what the Ole boys club is, and you know who is in it.  Essentially there are pockets of individuals in leadership who pick who they enjoy hanging out with, and they do everything in their power to get that person in leadership as well.  This has lead to multiple completely under-qualified or even unwanted promotions, but because they all work as a unit and defend each other, they retain their positions.

-About two years ago United Shore implemented a scorecard system used to evaluate the people within IT based on certain criteria to be used for coaching and promotional opportunities.  On its face this isn’t a bad thing, it is totally understandable that leadership would want actual metrics to back their promotions and to see where people can be encouraged to grow.  However, the system has two major issues, one being that they then give you a score of where you rank on the floor, and two, the system is almost entirely based on rankings given to you by your peers, and as anyone who went to grade school can tell you, this results in a popularity contest.  If the scorecards were to be believed, some people who were in their first year of coding were the best developers on the floor, out ranking architecture, seniors, and even their trainers.  

I do have to point out that I’ve heard that the newer score cards have taken the peer review portion out of the final score, which should help immensely, but the fact that this was implemented for a full year before being fixed, with all of its issues being addressed by the floor upon announcement, speaks to the thought processes of the leaders.

-As any of the other reviews show, the promotional track within United Shore has a long history of being as clear as mud.  Until recently, even what the difference between a developer 1 and developer 2 may have been was kept intentionally vague.  They have however recently introduced a training course that in theory gets you ready for your role as a two, though from what I hear it’s pretty poor training and teaches you very little that you wouldn’t already know at that point.

-One of the most common complaints I’ve heard and have had regards time estimates and the businesses reaction to them.  The business makes a show of being an Agile workplace, but frequently demands hard deadlines, not goals, for projects.  They also make it clear when estimates are given that they do not believe their developers and think they are either intentionally padding numbers to cover themselves or just so they can take it easy.  I’ve seen multiple 6-12 month initiatives get forced into being 3 month projects.  As any good developer knows, there is a delicate balance with software development between quality, time frames, and resources.  United Shore makes a recurring habit of learning that a project should take a year and calling for “all hands on deck” throwing devs of all levels from across the floor at a problem wanting it to get fixed faster.  Unfortunately for everyone involved, more people on a software project usually creates as many problems if not more than it solves, and this results in the projects becoming these ungainly beasts with code reviews intentionally rushed, quality control shirked, and the die hard devs who just want to know they pushed good code working insane hours to meet the deadlines.  This almost always results in buggy poorly written and hardly reviewed code making it into the production environment of a company that is handling hundreds of thousands of dollars with each transaction, meaning each bug is more than just an annoyance, it can impact lives.

-As other reports indicate, if you experience harassment at United Shore (and you will), reporting it to HR has a record of being a total crap shoot.  Maybe it will be resolved quietly, or maybe your harasser will then come back at you having been told by their HR buddy that you went to them complaining and you better watch your back.  People are scared to report harassment at United Shore, top 100 places to work indeed.

-United Shore is not the worst shop you could work at.   And they don’t let you forget it.  Any time you bring up complaints about how a company that presents itself as modern or claims all these great employee first policies breaks those policies or does something showing they clearly don’t value their employees as much as they say they do, someone swoops in with a “well it could be worse.”  Yes it could always be worse, but when one of your tag lines is “Why Not Us,” maybe try and live by that.

-United Shores amenities are world class to compensate for the fact that universally their pay is below market and you can get probably $20k more after a year by going somewhere else.

-United Shore makes a big deal about how it promotes so much from within, and while that is true in IT as it is anywhere else, when I see people getting into leadership roles, it’s never the natural leaders on the floor, it’s the people who buckle under pressure from leadership and promise deadlines the rest of the floor sees as ridiculous.  Promotions are not done based on merit, talent, or tenure, they’re based on if you’ll bend to the whims of the business.

-The company offers 10 days PTO to new hires, 15 after your first year, capping at 20.  This means after years of working at Shore, you get 2 sick weeks and 2 vacation weeks that come out of the same bucket.   Internally this policy is referred to as extremely generous, but if you plan on spending more than 2 weeks having fun with your family in the year, look elsewhere."

I've made plenty of friends, I've learned so much, and I've been able to grow personally and professionally with the help of every person here.  If you ever need assistance at United Shore, everyone here has your back, any struggle that I had, I never once had someone say ""No, I can't help you"", the team works together here.  

Sr. Leadership has been listening to everyone on the team. The CTO has been visiting every team and talking about feedback provided and what actions he, and the Sr. Leadership team are taking on them.  This is great to hear, knowing that my concerns are being addressed, and I'm valued here at United Shore makes me want to come into work everyday with a smile on my face.

From the technology side, United Shore has started to shift, we are looking at more tools and different technologies, I know longer hear ""We are a Microsoft shop"" instead I hear ""We are a solutions shop"". We are building Microservices, and modernizing all of our applications. Our UX/UI team is starting a grassroot initiative which will make all of our lives easier.

There is a free gym, and classes which is nice if you like to work out.

People:

there are some incredibly talented people here who really care, unfortunately they’re leaving in droves. You’ll likely form a fast bond with your peers because people are very friendly here, and we all are in this together.

Experience:

If you come to UWM with no experience, no problem they will train you up to be part of its “well oiled machine” you’ll learn the mortgage industry and make some connections. Understand that this perpetuates the idea you can be easily replaced.","Culture: 

The culture here has changed dramatically over the last year.  People are constantly leaving and most of the people who are still here are looking for work, lots of employees are unhappy. “People are our greatest asset” until you need to step on them to get to the top.  Please stop selling the culture for what it use to be, and understand that’s not what it is today. 


Open floor plan:

The floor plan is a sea of desk with no walls,  people can’t focus. They sell it as a way for people to collaborate but it’s really just a way to fit more desk in a space.  Additionally on collaboration, most of your neighbors will have on headphones trying to get some sort of solitude so they can focus on their work.  Lastly the worst part about the floor plan, is if someone gets sick, everyone gets sick. You have about 8 people sitting within 3 feet of you, you’re working in a germ infested petri dish, there is no escape.


Career progression/ raises: 

confusion, and uncertainty.

If you’re looking for a starter job United Shore
Is your place but don’t get stuck. 

If you’re considering a job at United shore please do your research on industry averages, they pay well below market.

In certain parts of the company there is no structure on how to get promoted, they will tell you they’re working on it, come up with a half-baked solution and then change it.  It feels a bit like dangling a carrot in order to keep peoples hopes up. Unfortunately I don’t think it has anything to do with your direct manager (they don’t even know how much you make). If they submit you for a raise or promotion it has to go through your lead, their lead, his lead, etc until it gets to the top for approval.  Those people don't know you so, why are they going to give you a raise? Additionally all you hear about is how “we’re having our best year ever” “growth like never before” yet you cut peoples commission, and you can’t give all your salaried employees cost of living raises? This a key reason for high turn over.  As an employee you’re constantly being contacted by recruiters or other companies offering you double your salary.


Upper- management:

My direct leaders are fantastic, and I really enjoy working with them. It’s  apparent there is a huge disconnect between mid-level management and the VP’s in IT. There’s a lot of Yes men at the top,  multiple times I would have direction from VP level employees to work on something mid-sprint that wasn’t planned for causing additional work, stress, and inability to meet our previously promised goals. Usually a project that had high visibility to Mat and it seemed like they don’t want to tell him no.  The CTO and Dev leads should not be giving estimates for work without first consulting the team, but it happens all the time.  Because of the high turn over, sooner then later you will be put on a “corporate project” which seems to push people to their breaking point.  You’ll be expected to work long hours to complete a project someone else set the timeline for. If you’re not on a corporate team then likely one, or many of your own teams resources will be taken for a corporate project and you’ll be expected to fill missing team members responsibilities and your own for an indefinite amount of time. This problem is only getting worse with turn over, one of the IT goals this year was better employee retention.  I've asked multiple times to leadership what we were doing differently to improve retention but never received a clear answer.  Please understand your people are burning out faster then your can get them in the door, you need to take a step back as leaders and think about how these big projects are brought on, and involve the project team in deciding those timelines and capacity.


Scorecards:

Simply, you have a report card.

You can’t run IT like sales, metrics are important but how can you use those metrics to measure success or failure when they’re constantly changing.  Please stop stack ranking employees in IT everyone is at a different level, no one is working on the same type of project, nobody has the same stakeholders it’s too subjective. It’s causing a lot of emphasis on the wrong things, and a lot of additional stress on employees not knowing where they stand, wasn’t that the whole point of score cards to begin with- clarity on performance?"
1077,,Control Your Own Success,2019-04-28,5.0,Sales,Great culture. Great leaders. If you are looking for a company where you control your own success this is the place. United Shore has given me the opportunity to grow both professionally and personally. The training is world class and so are the people. I am blessed to work at a place where my effort and attitude is rewarded.,None that I can think of. The hype is real. It is truly a great place to work.

1079,,Awful place to work,2019-04-23,1.0,Senior Underwriter,The train you when you have no experience.,"If you want to be overworked, disrespected, lied to, and treated like a child. this is the place for you! Leaders do not respect their underwriters. When they’re busy they shame you for leaving after your standard work day and make you feel super uncomfortable (we ready stay until 7 as is). If you don’t participate in bonus incentives (which make you work at least 55ish hours to reach those numbers) they just deem you “selfish.” The micromanage you to the core and then make it all seem ok by giving you candy and chips (like you’re a second grader picking from the treasure box for being a good student). This company has gone super downhill."

You will find some good people who you get to know well, mainly, because you are there for so many hours","This whole ""work/life balance"" is a farce.  They preach this balance but then tell you that you MUST work from 10am-7pm or 11am-8pm.  There is no way around it.  Management is a joke, they know guidelines but do not know how to truly lead.  Everyday there is a 30 minute meeting taking you away from the phones, which if a call is missed, it negatively effects your ""ranking"" fall too far and they will send you to another part of the company and cut your pay.  They preach being a family and caring, but my advice is to never tell them too much or they will use it against you!!!  UWM is truly a smaller Quicken Loans and they are run as such... DO YOU JOB OR THEY WILL FIND OTHER WORK FOR YOU.... Production is the highest priority to them and they try to cover it up by stating, ""Quality over quantity"" but if you don't hit your numbers, answer the phone EVERY time it rings AND go above and beyond every day then you are looked at as average.  Benefits are complete garbage and the pay is under the industry average.  They ""over hire by design"" so that you don't get overwhelmed with work.  All that does is make sure that they don't pay over time or bonuses... UWM is a joke of a company and everything you hear is fake and said by people who are brainwashed and afraid to talk bad about the company.

This place is somewhere for young kids, coming out of college, who don't know any better to get mortgage experience.  They will wear you out, and throw you away when you don't hit your numbers any more.  My advice is to stay away, but if you do got there, be careful of everyone as they smile to your face and conspire behind your back!!!!"
1082,,"Great place, lots of opportunity!",2019-04-19,4.0,Software Developer,"Working for a company that is experiencing growth makes for a very exciting environment with opportunity.  The campus is incredible and provides just about anything you might need to work, play, exercise or handle those simple little chores to balance home life.  There is actual belief in their pillar that ‘People Are Our Greatest Asset’, and if you really look around and take advantage of the perks provided, you’ll see it.
 
As a developer I have no shortage of challenging problems to solve.  Appreciation and recognition is received regularly, and you get the sense that leaders do value your effort and production.  I have been fortunate to work on projects of all sizes and contribute to other teams when my expertise is requested.
 
Having been at many other companies, I can honestly say that we lead the way and have more support than I’ve experienced anywhere else.  My Dev Lead is incredibly supportive and I hear from other leaders in the company regularly.  Sure, we have our growing pains but you can see that everyone here cares and is doing what they can to constantly make us better.","Any of the issues I have are clearly due to growing pains.  Agile is a work in progress here, but you can see that folks are working on getting us there.  The rapid growth creates work so it’s hard to focus solely on building that methodology, but I hope that is short-lived.  There are a fair amount of team members new to development and to a professional environment, so we need to grow our senior level staff.  Some of that will happen as others grow in experience, and I trust that leadership is continuing to hire and grow the team right alongside the rest of the company.  Having been other places, trust me, it is pretty flipping awesome here."

The ability to learn from the ground up in IT with no experience and get trained and mentored by some of the smartest people I've ever worked with.  Despite what I think was a very bad year prior in IT, a family atmosphere in IT where there is support from almost everyone.  The ability to work in new technologies - ample training through an onsite IT training team and online courses.","Things haven't been great in IT for a while.  I have been here 2 years, and the first year was great, but the second was very hard.  Long hours, lots of deadlines, team members quitting.  BUT, in a very honest and open meeting with 150 developers (and I heard also done with all Business Analysts and Quality Analysts) the CTO took accountability and talked about the WHY of how we got here over the last year.  He talked about the strategy behind the DevX programs (which made sense to me and everyone I talked to) and the strategy behind how we were going to make things better.  I know a lot of the people that left recently and it was hard, but I do think after hearing this the plan on moving forward that things will be better.  Just actually explaining THE WHY (which we're always supposed to do) was a huge step in the right direction.  The people who have left loved United Shore and it was hard for them to see how tough things were, but for the first time in a long time I feel things are really moving in the right direction."

On-site amenities","This company started off on the right track. It seemed like the perfect place to work. In my head, I could picture myself staying there for years. That all changed once they moved to Pontiac. Once the moved happened, everything turned for the worse... 
 
This company displays favoritism at its finest and it's funny how obvious they make it. The favoritism here trickles down and makes it a nightmare for both mid-level management and team members. 
 
The senior leaders within the company are extremely inexperienced, unprofessional and have a huge lack of respect for their greatest assets … their hard-working team members. 
 
Don't ever expect to get a promotion while you are working there if you aren't in that ""favorite"" pool.  Actually, you can get a promotion, you just won't get a raise. They will convince you that if you take on a new position with more responsibilities that they “promise” you will eventually get a pay increase. Once you accept the offer, don't ever expect that pay increase. All you will get is forced feedback by your leader that has no relevance as to why you won't get that raise just so they can check off a box to make the Senior Leaders happy.
 
There is no REAL appreciation for IT Team Members here. All they do is talk about how important technology is to the company and how it made them so successful. What do the IT Team members get in return? Nothing - just a made up motivational speech once a month by the CTO (who only comes in 3 days a week) saying to work harder and work well past the so-called ""firm-40"" hour commitment that they preach about. Maybe in 5 years, you'll get a dollar raise.
 
There are so many things wrong with the company that a book could be written about it. Read the other recent reviews, there is one common message being said... stay away from this company."
1086,,Best Place to Work Hands-Down!!!,2019-04-14,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"It’s a rare opportunity to work for a company that is growing as fast and is as dominant in its industry as United Shore. The combination of being an independently owned company led by a team of very experienced executives who care deeply about the culture and the people make this company THE best place to work hands-down! Over the life of my long career, I have never seen a company invest so much into the growth of the people across the entire business as I have here at United Shore. From the first day you walk in the door, you have a team of people who care about you as a person and are committed to investing in educating and coaching to bring out the best you can possibly be. 

Our senior leadership truly believes in innovation and not conforming to a standard just because other companies in the industry may do it. They continually evaluate existing manners in which we execute and challenge us to find new and innovative ways to be better and set new highs every day. The amount of passion, energy and empowerment that the CEO, COO and CTO provide to all people across the company creates amazing opportunities for career growth. The expansion of the IT team alone has created an abundance of opportunities for growth for all team members. There is dedicated training to grow your career as an IT leader, empowerment of the development teams to define the agility practices used, investment in technical training internal and external if desired and many more huge advantages to being a part of this amazing team.  

I am very proud to be a part of the awesome growth powered by the creativity and ingenuity of the IT team and led by a very passionate and committed CTO. I encourage anyone who is looking for growth and opportunity to come join us and be a part of something special. In IT, it is always difficult to find that perfect situation where the business is growing quickly and there is a willingness to invest heavily in the continual transformation of the infrastructure, applications and technologies to support the on-going growth. That's exactly what we have at United Shore and it’s truly a recipe for fast career growth, explosive technical growth and amazing success!","While every company will have it's share of challenges, the advantages of being a member of the United Shore and IT team far outweigh any of the growing pains that may exist."
1087,,"Great Culture, Great People, Great Place to Work",2019-04-12,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"The Culture - As soon as you step inside you can feel the energy! Everyone has smiles on their faces and greets you as soon as you walk in. I have never experienced that anywhere else until I worked here. Since I started , there's not a day that's gone by where that positive energy hasn't been prominent. 

Opportunity for Growth - There are so many windows of opportunity here. The encouragement from team members and leadership to continue to develop, learn and grow in the company is awesome. You can tell that you are cared for on a personal level and that they want you to succeed in the company! 

For anyone looking to maximize their potential and work in an environment that encourages growth and opportunity I recommend United Shore ! It is like no other place I have ever worked and once you step foot inside you realize that. Great people, culture, environment, I love it!",At every place there will always be pros and cons. The only thing for me is the move to Pontiac was a little bit of a longer drive than I would have liked.
1088,,Terrible Experience,2019-04-11,1.0,Account Executive,I met some amazing people that I still consider good friends.,"I was there for years and was bought-in to the six figure dream they sell you when you start. It started off ok, but got worse and worse with time. Not only do you realize that most employees aren’t making good money, but then you start to see the favoritism. Friends and family of leaders received most of the good accounts. You can imagine the frustration after grinding for years to become successful and then seeing a good friend or family member of a leader take off right away. They really need to reevaluate leadership, some are beyond unfit for their position and do the opposite of helping their people grow. Some leaders have zero respect and say anything they want with little or no repercussions.  People are catching on to the false promises and that’s probably why I see employment advertising for UWM everywhere: No one wants to work for an unfair company. Stop focusing on being number one and take care of your employees. They don’t care about the cool new building or basketball court, they want to be able to feed their families and keep the lights on at home."

1090,,Poorly Managed and Greedy,2019-04-05,1.0,Underwriter,Started a year ago when business was slower and the underwriting team was actually functional. There are a lot of young people who work here so it's easy to make friends. That's about the only positive thing I can say,"The company is greedy for business and can't keep up with it now. They lowered their hiring standards for underwriting and will pretty much hire a monkey at this point. Instead of raising salaries, they implement crazy bonus incentives so that if/when business slows down they can go back to paying their staff below industry average wages. I terminated my employment because I found a new job and they refuse to pay me my bonus money that I EARNED. The underwriting team is extremely poorly managed. They literally told a co-worker of mine that he is selfish because he isn't working more than 40 hours a week to ""help out his team"" during this busy time. If you are considering joining the underwriting team, do yourself a huge favor and look elsewhere. Don't let them try to seduce you with the Starbucks, gym, basketball court, cafeteria, and other ""perks"". The reason why they have this stuff in-office is because they want you to spend all your time there."
1091,,Company of Opportunities,2019-04-03,5.0,Content Developer,"United Shore offers so many opportunities for all employees. And the training, energy, and culture can't compare to any other mortgage company around.

I had absolutely no mortgage knowledge upon coming into my role as a Closer here, and the training was outstanding. The job itself could be high-paced and stressful, but it's amazing what you can accomplish when you have the whole company working together as a team for a common goal. My job as a Closer was rewarding, and I was able to accept a new role as a Content Developer on our world-famous Training team.

No matter what your background (college degree or not; mortgage experience or not) this company sees the potential in people, and if you're willing to put in the work, you can really go far!","The company is growing at an excelled rate (which is a great problem to have), so many teams have been putting in overtime."

When I started there over 3 years ago this was a place where unique and intelligent people were brought in to be themselves and be taught and nurtured in the business world. There were trainings and classrooms and you could find what you liked and take that path and succeed. However this new UWM is nothing like that anymore. UWM has become your typical corporate cog where the only thing that matters is what you can do for them that day. You are expected to work hard. Long hours with extreme amounts of work. That work will also be graded and categorized by hours you work, errors you make,calls you answered,how well you spoke on the phone, etc. And you will be spending alot of time on the phone as you are not allowed to miss any phone calls. If you do that hurts your score and you will be spoken too. Those calls will also be recorded and played back to you as it is critiqued. You are also expected to do your work while receiving and calling out about 20 to 30 phone calls a day. You will also have to do paperwork in between those phone calls where you are also expected to do a set number of before you can go home. This work and your task can also change on the fly day to day, or sometimes in the middle of the day. You dont know what to expect because sometimes it seems like people dont know what they are doing. Mostly because people are rushed into their jobs because they are falling behind on production. Those scores will than be plugged into a system that ranks you and assigns you a number.That is your ""ranking"" which will determine your team scores and team rankings. All of these numbers determine who gets promotions,who is considered good at their jobs, and who gets the occasional raffle ticket or free snack cart. Honestly the whole process is very belittling. There are even monthly meetings with your direct supervisor where you have to talk about how to improve your ranking! You missed a phone call this month you dropped from number 40 to 180. On one of your phone calls you didn't say thank you. 180 to 200."

Most are inexperienced and received their position by favoritism or by showing they can be easily manipulated."
1095,,Read the  Reviews for IT,2019-03-26,1.0,Web Developer,"Great people and convenient gym, cafeteria, doctor’s office, salon, and convenience store.","Read the  Reviews for IT.  You’ll see the patterns after only a few. 

To add to them, here are my two cents. They don’t know how to handle salaried employees in terms of salaries, policies, or incentives that are common in the rest of the IT industry. A software developer’s work output isn’t  consistent from team to team. Some teams handle massive projects. Some handle one or more smaller projects. It’s not like sales where loan submissions are roughly the same across the board or loans processed for underwriting.

From an organizational standpoint, IT is essentially an internal development agency. They take client requests and churn out projects as a response. Despite having major product applications, there is no roadmap that lays out what’s happening beyond the current projects in-flight. When there is a sense of what’s next, that will often fall through leaving a feast or famine cycle of waiting for new work. There is also no common backlog so that teams in this cycle can jump on known system needs.

 Eventually, you will work on massive projects with hard deadlines that require crazy extra hours. This will be a yearly occurrence with only the slightest improvements for next year. Even when the work earns the CTO an industry award you’ll get, at most, a verbal thank you and a night at the bar.  How is that even remotely acceptable, on multiple levels, when people are their greatest assets?"

This leads to not trusting that you can go to any leader and tell them what you REALLY think. Nobody is ever going to tell you the truth if they don’t trust that you really care about them.  

IT leadership uses a work from home policy that the rest of us weren’t given the ability to use. “But keep working hard guys, the it’s almost over.”  

Pillars are an excuse to get people in the door. Thumb pointer is a nice way to say “you could always do better, so go do better”. People are our greatest asset - and that asset is not allowed to do BooNited with their kids. 

Open floor plans are awful. It’s more about cost than “collaboration” like they said it was.

You can get trained in almost anything you want to do, regardless of education, experience, or initial competence for the job. Just show initiative to the right people and have a positive attitude and you'll succeed. Heads of IT departments here that I worked with actually told me they had no prior IT experience outside this company. 

-Amazing teammates who will weather the storms with you
-Many on site amenities (doctors office, cafeteria, gym)
-Planned activities/holiday parties/etc","I believe the IT department leadership, at the highest level, is motivated by a fear of the business. Couple that with inexperienced middle management and you have a recipe for disaster. If you come here with IT industry experience you will likely find yourself in an endless loop of frustration. The kids on scooters are fun when you tour the building, but not when they end being your pseudo-boss, dictating your project deadlines without any consultation from the project team, understanding of risk, or impact to other project dependencies. ""We move fast around here"" is a bandaid statement for, ""we don't know what the hell we're doing, but we promised Mat that we did."" I assure you it's not fast, it's just unorganized chaos to no end, which feels ""fast"" in the moment. 

Promotions can be had, but the salary increases are rumored to be so low that it's often not worth it. Remember, most of the leadership started in the business, so they are not inclined to transition you into a real IT salary if you're one of those transfers. This is why many people stay 1-2 years, get experience, and leave for a regular wage with their new title. No one wants to be a leader; allegedly leaders often make less than the skilled members of the team. Some of these skilled members end up told that they are next up for leadership, even if they express no interest and/or don't possess leadership skills. You will find quite a few people that used to be leaders and decided to step down on their own to go back into their original role. Where is that normal? To me, this is a red flag, but they will tell you its actually a perk, because ""you can be as ambitious as you want here.""

Overall, I did not feel set up for success, but instead constantly led to failure without a chance to ever remediate mistakes made the second time around. Deadlines are dictated, then missed. I don't believe Mat dictates deadlines, I believe IT leadership overpromises to him. The result is resources being stripped from their projects to go work on whichever one is closest to a deadline without any understanding or formal analysis of the impact. I don't believe costs are tracked for project work because the amount of money being wasted in IT as it chases its tail has to be astronomical. 

They preach a family vibe, but I didn't find it here. It's hard to be supportive of your team when your company gives you nothing to support them with beyond free concert/sports tickets.  These surface level nice gestures get tired quick and didn't really provide me with any long-term value. I saw even the people they love get mistreated and I found it very disheartening to see more than one person with cancer having to show up to work during treatment. Unfortunately, you can't throw Pistons tickets at all life's problems, and ""thanks"" for working nights and weekends without and end in sight doesn't help put food on the table either.

I had a hard time sitting in all IT meetings where a guy (who is in town every other week) comes in (with his top two buttons unbuttoned like he's a night club owner) to justify our long hours and weekends stressing over never ending unrealistic deadlines by stating they resulted in massive gains for the company. His Wolf of Wall Street style ""motivational"" speech usually concluded with a reminder that we need to trust him, we aren't getting raises, need to continue to burn ourselves out, and that's just how it's going to be -- or leave. Every once in a while you had to read between the lines to get that messaging, but usually it was exactly that direct without any sugar coating."

Company got real talent","This used to be a very good company to work at, but from last year it's going downside due to a lot of changes in the management, especially in the quality department. They don't value your hard work and the hours you spent to build this company.  They just value the contacts you know rather than the technical skills. There are severe Indian level politics in the QA department which makes your personal life more stressful. you may even get anxiety issues/ depression to work under such kind of environment.  All the employers work really hard for 9 hr schedule with 1 hr lunch, but still get ready to receive work calls from your team leaders (not all the leaders) on weekends which will mess up your personal and private life.

1105,,"Would the real Quicken Loans, please stand up?",2019-02-08,1.0,Anonymous Employee,The hard working people that aren’t upper management.,"Let’s start at the top - Stop trying to catch Quicken. Your company will never be or surpass them. Accept not being the best player out there and focus internally. The people that work for your company, outside of Sales, are your clients too. That means IT, Ops, Compliance, etc. It’s time you emptied your fat pockets and gave back to the hard working people who make yours and Sales’ jobs easier. Pay them what they deserve in line with industry standards.

This company prides itself on calling the officers of this company “leaders” rather than “managers” yet that’s exactly what they are: Managers. Leaders inspire and motivate, not belittle and delegate. 

Over hearing one manager in particular BRAGGING about how he surpassed his goal to make over 125K by the end of last year on floor is less than motivating, it’s infuriating. Especially when he A. Doesn’t deserve it because he’s a liar and the only thing he knows is how to suck up to the COO who he worked with for years prior to getting the gig (A light bulb should have just turned on). B. It’s exceptionally not motivating when you hear that and yourself make well below the industry standard for my role. 

How’s that escrow tax project he designed with zero business knowledge coming along? Probably have lost just about his salary in production issues by now. 

If you aren’t in the good ‘ol boys club, you won’t get anywhere, unless you’re privy to some knowledge of upper management they wouldn’t dare want as public information.

Mid-level management tries for YEARS to get a team member promoted without any success but one person in particular can get promoted 5 times in that one year?! She must have spent a lot time working after hours (Lightbulb number 2). 

I already covered pay, but incase you missed it: hot garbage. 

Don’t get me wrong, there are some great leaders in this company that actually motivate and inspire. They fight for the little guys/gals to make sure their voices are heard. Those are the leaders you should be looking to for advice."
1106,,You are only valued if you’re a favorite.,2019-02-06,2.0,Quality Control Specialist,"Benefits, firm 40 hours work week","I worked here for almost four years. I loved my coworkers. I worked hard, did overtime, went above and beyond regularly. I supported and encouraged everyone around me. The benefits are great here, the pay is not. But the most important thing here is to understand that they push a false and toxic concept of positivity. They tell you to question things and to #beyouhere, but if you don’t fit into the toxic concept of positivity they try to feed they will punish you no matter how good of a worker you are. They preach team work but than constantly encourage team members to compete with each other and encourage trash talk. Recognition rarely reflects work, work quality, or work ethic and is more often based on favoritism. The company use to be a very great and encouraging place to work but over the last year and a half it has quickly gone down hill. If you have depression or anxiety, do not work here. There will be no sympathy or understanding. There is a firm belief that no matter what you are to blame if you have a bad day or bad moment. And on top of that reality means nothing to them, only the perceptions of others, specifically favorites within the company. So while I greatly love the time I spent there, in the end the environment was far to hostile and toxic for me to encourage anyone to apply here anymore. I recommended several people over the years, I will talk anyone that is even thinking of applying here out of it. There are several good team members and team leads that I have watched be forced to do terrible and unethical things because their jobs were threatened by the toxic positivity of this place. I’ve watched hard workers, good workers be fired because a favorite didn’t like something. I’ve watched terrible employees be prompted because they were a favorite. I will openly admit there is lots of good things the company as a whole does for its employees but the environment and focus on short term profits over genuine longevity and the pressure this puts on people makes those things moot unless you have no issue with a cult mentality. They push a concept of burn the boat, and that is exactly what they are doing burning the boat that is UWM."

When I got to United Shore the culture and atmosphere were very positive and a generally happy environment to work in. But by the time the move to Pontiac happened (June 2018), things had really shifted and it turned into a negative environment where you were constantly told how great everything was and any complaints were not welcome. It isn't the worst place to work but it has definitely fallen off how it once was. If you sort the reviews by date, you'll see a trend that things have really changed.

While there was a lot of work that was put into this building, it's not an efficient work space for the majority of employees. No cubicles, little desk space, and an open office concept is such a recipe for disaster; it's difficult to focus due to all the noise. There are other areas to work, but if you move you lose your additional monitors. It's frustrating that we have amenities like a basketball court but don't have decent work spaces for employees. 
-The company boasts that they promote from within, but that rarely happens at a senior leadership level. Sure, people will be promoted from a level 1 to 2 or even to a team lead, but the majority of employees at the VP level or higher are external. 
While the growth at this company is exciting, it leads to a lot of leadership issues; a lot of employees are promoted to a lead position but have terrible management skills. Although these leads are clearly unfit to run a team, they are very rarely removed from their position causing employees to leave that team or the company altogether.

If you are not the type of person that goes to team outings, bar nights, and dance parties, this is probably not the place for you.  The majority of the employees are very young and most departments are very cliquey. Pay and leadership could be better depending on the department as well. Moving to Pontiac was a terrible decision, and it left a lot of long term employees with no option but to quit.

Decent overall work environment outside of underwriting, lots of perks at the building  (salon, doctor's office, full cafe, Starbucks), very great work/life balance, and a lot of opportunity for advancement.

In terms of underwriting specifically, there are a lot of resources to help you do your job, including pretty decent training.  The initial training has some weaknesses, but you often will get after training on subjects.  There are always promotions being ran in underwriting as well.  You also have a lot of promotion opportunities.","-First, underwriting, despite often being called the backbone of our company, gets dumped on more than any other position.  Any time underwriting has a down month or something goes slightly off path, commence the ridicule.  But is it really a surprise underwriters struggle at times?  If you look at how things are ran, not at all as underwriters are often having to deal with about 20 other things that have absolutely NOTHING to do with underwriting.  

This is a perfect transition into the next point and that is workload.  I am not complaining about the idea of a commitment or anything like that.  The more important issue at hand is all the other little nonsense underwriters are forced to endure.  USnaps (small videos sent to brokers), Make it Rights (Basically an apology for why you screwed something up.  Oh, and you get recommended to fill one out even if you did nothing wrong and the broker is irrationally upset), continuous emailing, phone calls, call coaching, quizzes, academies, etc...you never can just simply sit and get work done.  Is some of that stuff necessary to a degree?  Yes.  But to the depths this company does it?  No way.  You could probably be about 50% more efficient if you didn't have to waste time on other silly things.

Speaking of phone calls, by far the worst initiative launched by this company is ""No Call Left Behind."" Upper management always loves to claim this is a great idea because brokers eat it up (as several reviews on here already point out).  Hahaha, they eat it up while you get eaten alive.  This idea is exactly how it sounds.  You can't miss a call.  Ever.  If you miss one for any reason, you have to then write your leader an explanation as to why.  Everyone freaks out because they are afraid of missing a call.  Is that a joke? Brokers have obviously figured out this is what this company does so they abuse it.  I've been called as many as 9 times in a single day by the same broker.  NINE.  You can't be effective when that's going on.  This isn't including that I watch every day as someone around me is either continuously harassed by a broker to do whatever they please through either several and/or long phone calls.  You can tell morale is relatively low compared to the rest of the company.  Even the fake acting you have to do on the phone calls can't hide the fact that NCLB beats people down.  They also expect you to hit all your call points all the time.  Even having call scores in the low 90 percents is looked down upon.  

I'm going to say this and stand behind it firmly: This is glorified customer service and not truly underwriting.  If you are looking to get a start and get some experience with underwriting, do this job.  But if you are someone that is already familiar with the industry and how underwriting works, stay away...unless you like the idea of wasting time having to argue with brokers who don't know what they're talking about."

They are willing to overspend and don't really focus on efficiency of IT projects - makes it easy to get good tools, never saw anyone laid off
For the most part, you will have a 45 hour week (with a forced 1 hour unpaid lunch) 
Low pressure and expectations
Good place to get some experience","You are not trusted and are treated like a child (fixed schedule, punch clock, internet restrictions, no work from home, no eating lunch at your desk, ..)
It feels more like a factory than an IT organization, and you work on 'the floor' (a term leaders often use to refer to the contributors). There are hundreds of people 'on the floor' with no partitions or walls to separate and limit the distractions and noise.
There is a culture of disruption, which makes it nearly impossible to focus.  The open work enviornment doesn't help.  There are regularly environmental distractions.
Not leveraging cloud for software development - infrastructure and security architects seem to advocate against cloud (yes, in 2018)
The culture isn't for independent thinkers and promotes being an agreeable order taker.  The only people I have seen fired, were fired for disagreeing with their leadership.
They have a hard time attracting good talent and many people aren't qualified for their roles.  Retention goals make team leads afraid to get rid of low performers.  
The struggle to attract talent has led to a variety of ""x"" programs (DevX, QAX, BAX, SQLX), which is like a bootcamp/apprenticeship for people with little to no foundation or background in IT to get into these roles.  This is reasonable, but there are way too many inexperienced people on teams now that need constant hand holding.  The proportion of experienced to inexperienced is now too low.
It feels like nobody wants to take responsibility or own anything.  They want to outsource their thinking and problem solving to others and be given checklists to follow.
Timelines are dictated by the business with fixed scope.
Project planning and execution is often neglected until projects go critical (ie: war room, throw 40 people at it, contributors work extra hours/weekends).  These don't happen too often (2-3x per year), but are unfortunate if you get stuck on one.

1148,,Longtime Account Executive Honest Review,2018-08-12,2.0,Anonymous Employee,"The job itself is rewarding, coworkers are amazing, you build great relationships.","'d like to start off by saying that the majority of the good reviews that you read are actually recruiters being told by management to write them. I've been encouraged to write positive reviews as well. I've been reading the negative reviews here, and I must say, they are pretty darn accurate. I'm just gonna relay the things I feel they've left out: the Account Executive position is more how well you politick rather than how well you perform. People that drink the Kool-Aid and suck up to management are the ones that are most likely to get the better opportunities than the people who actually put in the work. Senior Management is trying to weed out the veteran AEs with mortgage backgrounds by implementing commission deductions that are out of your control. They hire people with absolutely no experience that aren't aware of how to be properly compensated. 10% of your income, if you don't get a certain amount of loan officers to submit (some of these LOs don't even do loans), plus another 20% of your income for hitting a ""perfect day metric"" (by overcalling, which can be damaging to your business), gets taken away from you. The CEO gets so greedy that he forces accounts to be incentivized, which means you no longer get paid on those loans. Upper Management is completely disconnected from their employees and what it takes to be an AE, and are more focused on hitting insignificant metrics. The micromanaging is also out of control. The 40-hour work week is a little misleading. You have to forward your calls to your cell phone when you're at lunch and when you're at home, so you can still take calls from your brokers (you will have accounts on the West Coast that will continue calling until 10PM). If you miss a call or don't take it, you'll be looked at as someone who is not committed to his/her business. United Shore is trying to over-hire as much as possible, so don't believe everything you see. I've worked at all the biggest big box-lenders (Quicken included), and this company has the highest turnover rate of employees I've ever seen."

The culture is more like a high school pep rally.   

They offer PTO but don't offer sick time and you are required to use OR lose all of you PTO each year.  

They require salaried employees to punch a time clock .  

They have ""YourTime"" which is a formal monthly meeting with your leader.  They say it gives you an opportunity to talk about what you want to talk about.  In the end, it is when your manager gives you a monthly performance evaluation.  YOURTIME requires leaders to always find at least one area of improvement - I felt that they never saw the positive and always focused on the negative.   The actual things you are reviewed on have nothing to do with the skills you need to have to actually do the job - they are based on how popular you are and how well you suck up to leadership.

They  addressed formally disclosed disabilities by failing to provide accommodations recommended by  a doctor  AND allowing me to stay in the same job.  They did offer to give me a new position (20% decrease in salary) which provided partial accommodation.  Accommodations that offer a cut in salary are NOT ACCOMMODATIONS.

The language on the floor is filthy and unprofessional.

You get ahead if you some how become part of the popular clique.  

IT managers try to tell experienced and skilled people how to do a job they have never done.  If you don't do it their way AND agree with them, you have a negative attitude even though they don't have a clue about what they are saying.    

EXAMPLE:

Background - I worked there successfully for 4 years and led lots of successful projects to completion.  In these projects I was responsible to create and gain approval for all requirements including detailed user stories and acceptance criteria, high fidelity wire frames, process flows, etc.  I was also actively involved in testing (creating / executing test plans, test scripts, etc.) for many of my projects.  The quality of my work led to successfully completed projects.  

Three months before I was terminated, I was assigned to a new team and my job was split into several pieces.  I quickly got a handle on what needed to be done and created high fidelity wire frames which clearly illustrated what needed to happen from a functional perspective after 7 business days on the team.  When I tried to share these with project stakeholders I was told that it was not my job even though it had been my job for over 4 years.  I was not allowed to share what I had created and it was ignored by everyone.  The person assigned to create this wire frame (the supposed expert) worked on this for the next 3 months with their leader and THEY were not able to get to where I was after 7 days even though they had the whole team working on pieces and parts of it.  BOTTOM LINE - they didn't want competence AND didn't allow me to do my job which resulted in a tremendous waste of company resources."

Some genuinely good people working here so you'll make some real friends,"Gosh, everything.  If you've looked through the past couple of months of reviews then you may have noticed a pattern of 1 star, very negative reviews from underwriting.  That is not a coincidence.  

First things first just to get it out of the way.  The pay is not great here relative to industry standards.  It's at or near the bottom of the scale, which seems odd given how much they like to brag about being #1 and how important underwriting is to getting them there.  They tell underwriting staff in their bi-weekly meetings (which are really more just pep rallies and could be covered in a medium sized email instead) how amazing everyone is, but you're never rewarded for all the success the company is having other than a verbal pat on the back here and there.

This places simply just treats you like a child.  Some of the actual ""rewards"" we were given as a result of helping the company achieve some very lofty goals:  free cake and ice cream for the staff, cookies, a pizza party, you get to wear shorts every friday for a month.  No bonuses, no raises, no extra days off or anything you might actually want.

They hire like crazy with no end in sight.  Most underwriter twos sit around for half the day with nothing to do, and they keep bringing in 30-40 more every couple of months.  They'll say we are ""overstaffed by design"" but apparently their design is to hire a bunch of people to work 40 hours a week and only actually have 20 hours of work to do.

The metrics you are judged on as an underwriter are also a joke.  I hesitate to even say underwriter anymore as the job is really more just customer service rep/secretary at this point.  The heaviest metrics you are judged on are things like ""call score"" and how often you pick up your phone.  You are expected to answer 100% of every phone call that comes in, regardless if you are already on the phone, or if the call isn't even for you.  If a phone rings and that person is not at their desk, you're expected to drop everything you're doing, get up and run over to grab it so it doesn't go to voicemail (because apparently leaving a message with a random stranger is better than leaving a detailed message for the person they called and wanted to speak with).  If you do happen to miss a call, you have to explain what happened to your leader like you're in 4th grade, and an explanation like,  ""sorry I had to go to the bathroom"" is not even close to good enough.  

Bottom line is you are hardly able to do anything anymore at this place without having it show up on a report somewhere.  Everything is micromanaged to a degree where if you have to get up take an emergency phone call from home, you better have permission from your leader and hope your phone buddy can cover you while you go.  Go to the bathroom?  Make sure your phone buddy is around.  Want to add a condition to a file?  Make sure you ask your team lead first to see if its necessary.  Have a borrower who is self employed?  Sure you can approve that but only after it gets underwritten a second time by someone else to make sure you did it right.  

This is an honest review of what its like working here.  Most people are stuck because they don't have the experience necessary to go anywhere else yet.  Join the team at your own risk, the day I left was the best day of my life."

1177,,"Not the worst if it's your last resort, otherwise run far, far away.",2018-03-21,2.0,Underwriter,"I'm going to preface this here as it will probably be the first thing you read: this is an honest, yet lengthy review. I want to be thorough and warn about what you will be getting into. That being said, this is purely from an underwriting standpoint and doesn't speak for the entire company as a whole.

The Pros: 
-Free coffee, relaxed dress code (for anyone but account executives), the firm 40 hours a week is true if you're not a senior underwriter with a high commitment. You learn a lot of valuable knowledge that could help make buying a house easier for you down the line.","What I view to the be most prevalent cons about this company (buckle yourself in): 

-Pay/Benefits: I will just get this one out of the way now. The pay is pretty  low compared to the industry standard (despite being the #1 wholesale lender in the nation as we are reminded of on a daily basis), and the 401k match is honestly a complete joke. 

-Regardless of what management tells you, your opinion and feedback is essentially ignored and not valued whatsoever. Two prime example I personally have of this is:  the year end of 2017 and the eNPS survey sent out to all the employees in each department. Considering the CEO had to come and address feedback to the underwriting staff signals that it must've been overwhelmingly negative feedback. What makes it worse is that he stood in front of the entire underwriting staff, who is constantly referred to as the backbone of the company, and essentially said that if we don't like certain things that we can just leave. The other I have witnessed on countless occasions is management and leadership address any criticism with the following line: ""You work for the #1 wholesale lender."" All this does is deflect issues rather than actually address them  which is a massive slap in the face to people who work tirelessly day in and day out just to make ends meet for themselves and their families. 

-Micromanagement: This is an area where things have significantly gone downhill over the past six months. There are a lot of metrics that you will be measured by. While I have no issue of being held accountable and have my performance measured by some kind of metrics, some of these are honestly viewed as additional stress by most people. A breakdown of these are as follows:
     1. Loan Quality/Production: I have no gripes with these metrics, they're expected, very important and will probably exist in any underwriting position. 
    2. Call Score: This is essentially a client service metric which is heavily weighed in importance. While client service is important, they have gone way overboard on this particular metric to the point that if you don't solve an issue with a client it's okay, all they care about is if you're fake and overly enthusiastic because that's what matters the most. The worst part about this is the calls are scored by people who have more than likely never underwritten a loan in their life, don't understand the intricacies of what could make or break a loan and the seriousness of the conversations required to come to a solution.
   3. Phone Pick Up (No Call Left Behind): Basically exactly as it sounds, you must answer every single phone call, regardless of if you're on the phone at the time or not. You can't go to lunch, grab coffee (one of the few pros if you made it this far and remember), or even go the bathroom if your ""Phone Buddy"" is away. If you miss a call you basically get scolded like a child. Personally, the last time I couldn't go the bathroom without asking for permission was in high school but I digress. 
    4.  USnaps: As you may have seen in other reviews. USnaps are videos that are expected to be sent to clients when they don't answer the phone. What this means is you do the following sequence: Send an email, call the client and leave a voicemail, and then send a video which comes in the form of an email. A bit of an overkill but it's just the way their process is because ""clients eat these up,"" when I can attest that over half the videos I have sent don't even get played. I've also heard numerous complaints from female underwriters of harassment that has resulted from these videos. 

-Favoritism: Self-explanatory and pretty much exists in most aspects of life but is magnified at United Shore. If you're not a ""yes-man"" or related to/dating someone in leadership you're automatically set back."

-fake reviews on Glassdoor that are required to be posted by our Internal Engagement Team (these are tracked to maintain a 4+ tank on this site)
-the CEO is impulsive, lacks respect for his hardworking employees. He was openly disrespectful to his underwriting department during a meeting because the company missed its NPS rating based on employee feedback . The CEO blamed the employees for not wanting to improve and was near hysterics over this and decided to attack and belittle underwriters as not being willing to work more when the reality is that underwriting has worked ceaselessly to implement  senless initiatives which have actually cut underwriting a pay by cutting bonusing ability. 
-Management’s main leading style is bullying, shaming, and denigrating employees. This can be clearly seen in the management dictated and endgame to team produced reviews which claim honest feedback is from employees is coming from “lazy employees” or employees that lack “self respect”. The only thing employees at this company lack is other options. Most are kept here by lack of other opportunity. 
-Expect performance metrics which are inaccurate and stacked against you. One initive called “no call left behind” was launched in a way that ensures employees are gurenteed to fail because they are not allowed to answer the phone during certain windows of time and those windows of time are not removed from the call counting system. 
-favoritism is the ruling metric for promotions here"

1183,,United Shore Leadership Team is Poor...especially in IT,2018-02-14,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"- Free drinks (soda, coffee, etc.)
- Some fun family functions
- Some good people","After the mortgage crisis, the mortgage broker went the way of the dinosaur.  The mortgage broker effectively disappeared.  United Shore is currently riding the wave of the return of the mortgage broker and to a large extent has created it's own market.  The growth is pretty phenomenal, but unfortunately the poor and inexperienced leadership team attributes this to their performance and not to the fact that mortgage brokerages, in general, are booming.  Markets ebb and flow.  United Shore's leadership is ill equipped to deal with recession or another crisis...and god forbid Quicken, Wells Fargo, BofA or any other big bank seriously enters the mortgage broker industry.

Executive leadership across all departments at United Shore is generally inexperienced and poor...but it's by far the worst in IT.  The overall leadership in IT is inexperienced, childish and paranoid.  This coupled with the fact that many of the leaders have zero technical experience in the area that they are attempting to manage is a recipe for disaster.  If you are straight out of college you may like IT at United Shore, but if you have senior level experience or above stay away.  In a lot of ways working in IT at United Shore was like returning to high school...the worst parts of high school.  It is a drama factory that is exacerbated on a daily basis by leaders who just have no business being leaders.

Lastly, people in IT get fired routinely...and regularly.  They just disappear.  If you are lucky you may see HR boxing up their stuff in the middle of the day.  If not, you hear it through the rumor mill a few days later.  Your job is NOT safe.  Be forewarned."

1186,,"Unethical, Childish, and Disgraceful, Does not Deserve its Employees",2018-02-08,1.0,Senior Underwriter,"None. Do not work here, this place does not deserve its overworked and underpaid workforce.","I have never written a negative glassdoor review, even for companies that I really did not enjoy the work environment, but United Shore is so disgraceful that I have no choice.

This company does not care about its employees, at all. You are an at-will employee so that the company can immediately drop you with or without cause. You'll notice the majority of 2018 reviews are all negative; the company has gone way downhill over the past 6 months. United Shore's ""pillars"" are a complete sham. It is a ""Do as I say, not as I do"" mentality. Being a thumb pointer, for instance, or taking responsibility, does not apply to upper management. In fact, upper management constantly points the finger at someone and always needs to blame someone for anything that goes wrong.

For instance, underwriters in the company gave the United negative ratings on an anonymous survey, so all the team leads were blamed and told they have to change our attitudes even though all they were doing was implementing upper management's policies.

Working here is quite literally like being in high school. Knowledge, hard work, and talent don't help you succeed here. Being a ""yes"" man and drinking the kool-aid is what helps you succeed. I would not want my worst enemy working at a deplorable place like this.

In more general terms, lets discuss the flaws in the underwriting process. Number one, we are required to pick up our phones 100% of the time. If we go to lunch, our phone must be forwarded to a buddy. If we are on the other line, we must play secretary and put people on hold to answer the other call. Imagine how inefficient this process is. Answering the phone when possible can be a good strategy to assist clients with questions they have for their underwriter, but if we are required to pick up the phone 100% of the time, it immensely slows down our workflow and ensures that clients will always call in with every single little issue since they know we must always pick up. This is an unnecessary complication. The notion that it's a good idea to answer the phone was a genuine attempt by United Shore, and while they took this to an irrational extreme, the end result is at least tolerable. However, this was merely a hint of the direction United Shore planned to go.

Next, lets discuss how production is calculated. There are certain thresholds that an underwriter must hit based on the average number of files they did per day the previous month. However, as United Shore moves forward, they have put a huge focus on making underwriters become processors for the brokers and loan officers by adding additional steps to every file that must be completed to ensure a minimum number of conditions. In theory, this could be a good business strategy: sacrifice how many files an underwriter can do per day by adding steps to the process, costing the company money in hiring more workers, but allowing for a more streamlined process.

However, these production numbers we must hit stay the same, and the production related bonuses stay the same. Therefore, we must either work longer hours for the same pay or work the same hours for less money and be less likely to hit our goals. United Shore is not willing to change their required production or their bonus goals even though they have intentionally changed how long each file takes to underwrite.

Third, the company came up with the idea that underwriters should be sending out video messages to brokers at least once a day. They will spin this as ""wowing"" a broker or providing better service, but it's just an odd step to add to the process, and since underwriting isn't about sending video messages, many underwriters were not comfortable with the idea. This is amplified by multiple accounts of our young female underwriters experiencing sexual harassment from the brokers. United Shore knew this during the pilot of this video message program, and yet chose to ignore this, either thinking it wasn't a big deal or intentionally wanting to sacrifice integrity and a safe work environment for a few brokers' repeat business, hoping to harass that same underwriter again.

For this video program, there was no public opt out option. According to management, some people who experience anxiety trying to make these videos are allowed to opt out. However, this was never publicly announced, and I know of at least one underwriter that does not believe they can opt out even though they have social anxiety trying to make these videos. Hiding this option from your employees is immoral, and forcing us into uncomfortable and unnecessary situations that were not part of the job we signed up for is shameful.

United Shore's promise of a firm 40 is a lie. Many senior underwriters are forced to work 45-50 hours per week with no paid overtime to hit their numbers. Some of these senior underwriters are making bonus money, but I know of some who are not, and this sharp rise in overtime is based on production requirements staying the same, or rising (4.1 files per day tends to round up to 5), while the length of time to correctly underwrite a file increases daily.

United Shore has been made aware of all of these issues several times by several team leads as well as a lot of their underwriters during an anonymous survey we filled out at the end of the year. The CEO's response was to lecture the entire underwriting floor on why we should want to ""improve"" ourselves every day or get out of his company. Not only is this a blatant strawman of our complaint because it ignores that fact that there was no compensation for these additional requirements, but it proves how pointless the survey really is. United Shore does not want honest feedback, and while they may pretend they do, once you provide it, they'll either force you to become a ""yes"" man or let you go for being an at will employee.

Compensation, to be clear, is monetary compensation, not in office ""perks"" like being able to brag about working for the number 1 wholesale lender, having dance parties and free massages, and having free soda and occasional free candy bars. That's irrelevant for people struggling to pay off their student loan debt or feed their family, and it's degrading to people who want to take their careers seriously.

Additionally, in response to the overtime that many of us are forced to work, the CEO told us that no one worked any overtime. The VP of underwriting told me that no one should be working overtime. They think if they deflect enough and pretend that anyone complaining about having to work extensive unpaid overtime is the odd man out, maybe we'll stop complaining and keep producing the same results. United Shore expects results, but does not provide a reasonable framework to achieve those results.

I have provided my advice anonymously and in my exit interview several times over to United Shore management. Furthermore, if you review their responses to the negative reviews from just 2018 alone, you will see they do not take the advice seriously that is listed on  glassdoor. You can see from the way they respond to anyone that leaves negative feedback that they never address the issue, but deflect by saying they have the best trainers, the best management, the best perks etc. Take it from someone that doesn't have any agenda but to inform you of what you're getting into rather than from someone whose agenda is to try to cover up the insanity parade that goes on at this place.

Therefore, any advice I have for management will fall on deaf ears, so I will leave that section blank. This review is not to improve the company. United Shore will not improve until upper management decides to value their employees, and that will not happen until the company's best people leave or get forced out. Once that happens, leadership will consist of a bunch of ""yes"" men that don't know how to lead and only know how to spot other ""yes"" men, and underwriting will consist of overworked new hires that don't have the experience to leave and are constantly belittled and berated into submission. Once that is their workforce, they will not be able to address serious questions within the framework of the underwriting guidelines with brokers, and even their one-day turn times will not save them from their lack of experience. That will result in a slew of brokers that do not respect underwriters unless we bend over backwards to make their files work, which will give United Shore two costly options: Stand firm on our decisions and watch the business scatter, or get bullied into closing unqualified files, which will result in bad loans.

Once that happens, and once the company finally falls off their high horse, realizes what their policies have led to, and eats that massive cost, only then will they actually start looking to make changes. Only then will feedback and criticism be relevant."

Love the 1 on 1 meetings with my leader each month and the all UW meetings too.  Even the CEO came to the last meeting and talked about the growth and opportunity for all of us.  They ask for our feedback and actually listen and make changes!

They have people post pretending to be underwriters or account execs, pretending everyone is actually happy. When their accounts start getting banned, they even go as far as forcing the company leadership to post good reviews. 

The whole thing is pretty hilarious as a current employee, because you see tons of people start every month super excited, and probably 80% are gone within a few months. It’s not great when you start the year at 1900 employees, hire almost a thousand people, and finish the year at 2200 employees. Do the math. 

Here are some things they should actually fix, if management didn’t just want to keep its head in an echo chamber:
Respect your employees. When an entire department tells you they are miserable and the system is broken, listen. Don’t sit there and have the CEO try to rationalize it to the entire underwriting floor.

That actually happened. The CEO tried to sell underwriting on the fact that, although they aren’t happy, they should be because we are #1. 

Recruiters often try to sell people on the idea they can make production bonuses in underwriting. Obviously, people are upset when they learn this is a lie, and put this in their yearly NPS survey. 

The CEO had the audacity to get up in front of 550 underwriters and tell them to stop whining about not making enough money, because he just paid out $250,000 in bonuses to (leaders of) underwriting. Really? Is that supposed to impress us? Or show us what we can get if we ever are able to brown nose our way to the top?


Sure, we are the highest volume lender in terms of wholesale loans funded, but the other goals are twisted, altered, and faked until they show what the company wants to see. 

Upper management lives in an echo chamber, where they only hear whatever they are trying to sell their employees on."

The senior leadership is a good ole boys mentality, the actual work and accomplishments do not matter as long as you friends with the SVP.

- Most of the people were willing to share their knowledge and help out (you would also meet some who didn't - but they were not the norm)
-Loved their training on mortgage concepts, but unfortunately they didn't allow you the time to continue at the same pace after the initial on-boarding period
-Loved the high pace, but I didn't appreciate the noise and too many interruptions during the day which made it very difficult to focus, They need to find a better balance between effective collaboration and trying too hard to make it fun. The desks are the smallest desks I have ever seen in my 25+years of work....
-Loved the easy access to developers and some of the Product Owners. This was one of the reasons for which I had attracted of this company and their Agile practice
-The salary was decent, at the expected level for such high pace and great level of stress
- Met some great people, including the CEO of the company Matt I.","- Different company culture (great on paper.... but misinterpreted by some....almost too good to be true; Looking back I should have known better)
- No place for a Business System Analyst in their Agile IT organization
- Due to so many goals everyone had at any given time, there was an increasing trend of people becoming a bit robotic, not taking the time to listen to you
- PTO and statutory holidays were very few, even for experienced workers. No sick days either. Lots of people were coming at work sick because of this... Really bad!
-Company pillars vs.  what was happening in the company was a pure contradiction
- If you have kids this will be a tough place to work at... However, to be fair they do organize some kid friendly company events during the year, but for me these are not as important as the flexibility of working from home (which was a big issue at this company) or coming in later or leaving earlier... You had to put 8 hrs everyday, regardless... How about the many days you put more than 8 hrs because you need to deploy some functionality??? Oh I forgot, you cannot exceed 8 hrs./ day...lol!"

Still skeptical, I was thinking that once I get into my space “reality” will hit and it will end up like all my last  jobs…..horrible. Well, I have been in my space now for a little over 4 weeks and each and every day gets better than the next as I continue to learn more and get to know all of my team members.

The company is big on culture and pillars, which I really like. Overall, a very positive and inspiring environment to work in. Employees receive monthly reviews, which helps you know how you're doing and allows you time to discuss goals and career progression. Most teammates celebrate your successes, help you when needed, and help you achieve your best. United Shore boasts that it is a team and a family, and, for the most part, that really holds true.","Depending on your position and leadership, the firm 40 may not apply to you. Some IT team members work well over the 40 hours a week. Senior leadership does want to remedy this, but it is still an issue. While most leadership in IT is wonderful, there are some leaders that make work difficult. Bad attitudes, no focus on their own team, unwillingness to help their team, and making their team work over the firm 40 while they go home early are some issues that I've experienced here. Again, this is the minority, but it is an issue."

1309,,Former Account Executive,2017-09-01,1.0,Account Executive,United Shore gave me insight into my current position. I couldn't be happier in the position I currently have (and went back to). I'm so thankful to work in an environment where I'm more than just a number.,"United Shore is the best above all others at marketing. They market to their brokers, to prospective employees but above all others they market to their current employees. Expect a constant, nauseating sales pitch. Expect promises that aren't fulfilled. 

I spent nearly six months at United Shore as an ""Account Executive"". They've since changed many of their employment titles, so it looks like some of the negative reviews have been turned over. 

Let me assure you, the company is not what it appears. Like most sales jobs, you'll struggle. As an experienced sales professional I expected there to be a learning curve. I expected that the compensation wouldn't come immediately. I expected that they'd have a high turn over, as most sales jobs do. I was prepared. 

I wasn't prepared for how leads would be distributed. Your manager is in full control of what accounts you'll be given. Some managers do well at distributing fairly but most have favorites. If you aren't well liked by your management you won't thrive here. 

I wasn't prepared for the intense micromanagement. Quicken levels of micromanagement. 

I wasn't prepared for the lack of follow-through on company ""pillars"". It's a ruse..The corporate culture is cultish. The lack of transparency in management's decision making is problematic. Do not trust your leaders to have your best interest at heart. This is the most cut-throat sales floor I've ever worked on. 

Full disclosure - I was fired. Six months ago. I was fired, to the best of my knowledge, for saying that I didn't know if I could continue to work there due to finances. No write ups. No approach by management. No conflict resolution. I've never been fired from a job before. I was shocked. 

More than ten people were fired in the week I was fired. As the months went on, I received calls from others who graduated in my class. The firing had not slowed - all were similar stories. People who talked about money or the possibility of needing to transfer/find other work were let go. 

It's been six months. I check back periodically to insure that there are honest reviews. 

I was taken back by my former employer without issue. I've returned to my well paying job.  United Shore only showed me how thankful I should be for the job I presently have."

The people I am surrounded with everyday is the reason I keep walking into work with a smile on.","When you start hating negative things everywhere you turn...down a hallway, at lunch, even at the desks, is difficult to refute the hard truth.  You start to see the light. Favoritism exists, and feedback given seldom result in changes or results.  Ethical yet efficent workers get hit with more audits and lose the ability to obtain bonuses--yet they call it random audits.  The next you work, the harder they audit you.  And the efforts of those who work harder and truly deserve a promotion are lost.  I'm specifically speaking about those that have repetitively taken a test for a promotion, but score low, and are denied promotion over those who are natural test takers.  It seems as if auditors seldom research the errors assigned to an underwriter even if a valid, system issue is explained or is a known technical issue.  Instead, the error is assigned, and your livelihood is at a risk because they will not take your explanation as a way to improve their system issues, but as a way to dock your pay.  The company's motto is to make dreams come true, yet it's not apparent when they cut bonuses and incentives from their own hardworking employees."

Everywhere I have ever worked, they hand you a laptop and send you on your way to figure everything out. Here, they have a one week orientation, I assume for more reasons than one, probably mostly to slowly emerge you into the culture. And yes, there is culture shock. They get you out of your shell by creative games and activities that get you to socialize, all while learning to be positive and learn everything about mortgages. By the end of the week, I knew all of the ""terms"" of mortgages as well as a good understanding of what the company I work for actually does. I also learned all the programs that I will be utilizing, how I get paid, how I use the systems for payroll and so much more. The second week is job specific training, by the second week you feel like part of the family and well armed to do your job. The environment? Even better, there are always team activities going on, free drink stations and games everywhere to de-stress. Basketball, ping ping, Foosball, putting greens, Xbox to name a few. I'm sure the culture would not be great if you were a negative person and enjoyed being miserable.

The glass ceiling is real.","They don't promote from within unless you are in one of the larger departments that have no choice but to promote people that know their systems and processes. Unless you are related to someone higher up or are a former Colleague of a Leader you stand no chance of being promoted no matter how hard you work or how dedicated you are. Nothing demoralizes an employee more than being passed over for better positions so their Leader can Handpick, Hire and Hook up their Friends and Former Colleagues from other companies with better jobs as that happens here quite often. It is sad to say, but I'd be in a better spot if I had worked at Flagstar Bank before working here than all the hardwork I have put in at United Shore. The company brags about how well they are doing and all these records they are setting yet the employees still see the same crummy cost of living 2-3% raise each year. Investing in your employees and paying them a fair wage would go a long way in keeping your top talent from leaving. The company has thrown out a lot of future based promises to employees lately to try to keep them, which makes me think they are truly starting to take notice of the large exodus of quality employees in recent months which is nice to see."

Unethical practices from employees who do not get reparations


First off let me say, I usually don't have anything bad to say about anything. I am optimistic, understanding, and give people the benefit of the doubt. I am easy to please, if you are ethical, have integrity, and show honesty. With United Shore I have valuable and justified complaints. Great company in terms of benefits, culture, & building. As a whole the company strives & most people are satisfied. You are satisfied if you play the game, don't work too hard, and ignore the signs of how they are treating other employees...until its you. 

Top producing employees are ""let go"" ""at will"". I know at least 4 people personally who were top producers & terminated from the company. I know at least 4 other people who I heard were also let go and were top producing employees. That's 8 people alone, it can't be a coincidence, considering all of these people were getting great feedback from their leaders. I know people who were told they were doing all the right things by leaders & apparently let go for doing those same things. Probably the real reason was for making too much bonus money, considering I was told ""It's not fair I make more money then my leaders"" by my leaders. Once terminated you are told that your hard earned (yes, I mean hard earned) bonus money ($500-2000 per month) is not to be paid out to you. Unfortunately, they fire you just before checks are paid out, without explanation or reason and they do not let you go to your desk to collect any personal items that proved you made bonus money (including your own personal log). They want the most work from you for the least amount of pay.

It's hard to satisfy upper management, especially with changes every 2 weeks. They couldn't explain what they wanted. Top producers are held at higher expectations & everyone is micro managed.  No accountability from leadership. When I kindly addressed situations I was told I was attacking their character or being a cry baby. Even though one of their pillars is to be a finger pointer, not a thumb pointer, everything fell on why I was being inconsistent, when really I was just keeping up with their changes.  I felt underpaid, undervalued, & over qualified for my position. While others were under-qualified for their position. I was also told that our daily production numbers were being held from the CEO in fear of our commitment numbers being raised ever higher. 

I'm very disappointed in the company overall. I wanted to love it there but I know too many people who were let go. My advice is to play it safe if you choose to work there. Don't rely on making a bonus. They set it so its hard to make and if you go above and beyond they will try to change it to be harder and eventually let you go. Get on the good side of everyone and kiss up to people. You might have a chance if you get on the insider crowd but if working for an fair & integrable employer is valuable to you, this is not your place."

Training is paid, and it's a classroom setting where you take quizzes and tests. If you pass that, you move on two a mentoring period for two weeks, where you get one-on-one training with somebody else in underwriting. Advancement opportunities are good if you are good at the job; after 6 months you are eligible for a promotion and the pay difference is about 10k. It's a good place to start if you have no prior experience or need a job pretty desperately.","The job itself is pretty boring. You repetitively do the same thing every day, and it doesn't require much thinking. After you've been doing it for about two months you become a robot. The company preaches ""employees are our greatest asset"" but that's a lot of talk and no action. For your first year, you get 10 days of vacation; what they don't tell you is those are also your sick days, so if you get sick, they will deduct the day from your PTO balance. The cherry on top is that normal holidays that basically all of America gets off, are not real at United Shore; be prepared to come in the office the Friday after Thanksgiving, MLK day, and the Monday before the 4th of July and to be bored out of your mind when you come in because there is no work to do - because everybody else in the US is on vacation. The salaries are the lowest in the industry - by about 10K. They preach benefits but the 401k matching is not good either; they will match 50% of up to 3% (so if you put in 3% of your salary, they will match 50% of that). They don't have enough parking in their building because they've been hiring like crazy, you basically need no qualifications to get a job here, so they had to buy a lot to use as parking that's a 10-15 minute walk from their building. Chances are you will have to park here and take a shuttle in to work (not fun). Most of the clients are in California, so they will hire you for a 10-7 shift, they are not flexible with it at all and if you ask for a shift change to a normal 8-5 job, chances are they will fire you on the spot. They also preach that you will make bonuses and incentives, but the reality is that they have hired so many people in the last year that it is impossible to make a bonus because there isn't enough work for everybody; in fact, they give you a ""production commitment"" and expect you to hit that number even when there is physically not enough business for everybody on the floor to hit it. The job itself is quite honestly a joke; be prepared to get yelled at on a weekly basis by an angry or frustrated client. It can be very draining and emotionally consuming, because half the time you get yelled at it is not your fault at all. They also have 2 company-wide events throughout the year, but they over-sell them. The holiday party is fun and they put a lot of money into it, but you're not allowed to bring a date (because there are too many employees). Team outings are pretty much non-existent as well, if you make friends with some coworkers you might go to a grungy bar that's a 3 minute drive from the office every other pay day. They have a gym, but you have to pay a monthly fee to use it; it's only $7 but it's still quite annoying. Pretty much nothing is free, you will maybe get a free lunch once in a year. It's easy to take advantage of the system, so people who do their job terribly get rewarded and people who are honest don't."

I've worked at another mortgage company and I've also worked in other industries and United Shore tops them all.  We are currently the #1 Wholesale mortgage lender and we have no plans to slow down. If you want to work at a company that always encourages you to do your best and continue to get better then you would love it here. 

Our leaders truly care about our team members. Both about our success in our jobs and also our home life. 

United Shore values families and a work/life balance. Not many mortgage companies can say that.","You may read about people talking about a Firm 40. It's true. Meaning you are only expected to work 40 hours. But you better be ready to stay focused during those hours. No being on your phone. No checking Facebook. When you walk in the door, you are expected to work."
1350,,Continuing to evolve!,2017-06-05,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"United Shore is already a world class organization.  It has experienced a lot of growth in the last few years and it has provided significant mobility within the company.  The culture of the company is very 'Google-ish' and adds a positive spin to the daily grind.  Leadership drives the company forward and it continues to improve it processes, product, and personnel as moves forward.  United Shore isn't afraid to make a change to capture a competitive advantage.","I have read many reviews on Glassdoor.  There seems like there are some common threads about 'issues' at United Shore.  I think that it is what you make of it.  It isn't always going to be perfect for every team member and to be honest, that's okay.  I don't know of any company that makes 100% of their employees happy, but United Shore takes great pride in trying to do just that.  Keep employees happy."
1351,,Awesome,2017-05-30,5.0,Sales,"United Shore gave me the opportunity to change my life. It gave me the tools to be successful, and it was up to me to have the right attitude and work ethic to make it happen.

This is more than just a job - it's a career and you have the ability to grow as quickly as you'd like if you do the right things and make yourself the obvious choice.",The amount of time it takes for AE's to get up and running. It's not a hunting type of business where you see your hard work payoff over night...it's more so farming where it takes time to cultivate relationships and in turn business.

They have a very yes man atmosphere and promote a lot of inexperienced people based on them having the ""right attitude"".  They implement ideas randomly with very little foresight on how it effects clients and employees.  You will park a mile away and be shuttled in because they keep hiring and don't have enough space.

1370,,Don't waste your time,2017-04-17,1.0,Compliance Specialist,Only work here if you don't have any other options,"The benefits were significantly lower than the industry, along with the pay. I transferred to a Compliance Specialist position expecting at minimum a 5k a year pay increase, as the industry average is around 55k a year. Instead it was only a lateral promotion, with my pay remaining 40k a year. In addition, the work was completely boring and uninteresting, and the culture isn't what they claim. I was an Underwriter previously and there was a toxic, cutthroat culture as management uses contingent bonuses and incentives as their excuse to try to match the industry standard of salary compensation.

As an Underwriter II at a regular bank, you're making around 50-55k with Bank Holidays and Bank Level benefits. At United Shore, you're only making 40k with the occasional overtime, and extra ""bonuses"" are contingent on arbitrary factors. United Shore has a bad habit of making promises and then trying to find ways to keep your ""bonus"" so they can get away with you with their low salaries. 

Also you only get 4 paid holidays. If you need to enter the banking industry and just got out of college and can't find anywhere else, then I understand, as that was the reason why I got into United Shore. I would end up leaving for a 40k increase with a global consulting firm, with excellent benefits and frequent travel."

1376,,United Shore over-promises and under-delivers to Account Executives.,2017-04-06,1.0,Wholesale Account Executive,I guess a pro to working at UWM as an Account Executive is you do not have to work weekends.,"Rampant nepotism.  As an AE you are given accounts to call on by mgmt.  If you are friends with mgmt, you get the good accounts that may actually produce.  If not, you will be given non-producing accounts that have rejected dozens of AEs.  

As an AE, you are required to be on the phone calling your contacts certain times a day.  The problem is, you are not given enough contacts to call so you end up calling the same people over and over and over until they get fed-up and stop doing business with you.  This is not the same for AEs who are friends with mgmt, they are given more key contacts and the accounts they are given produce so they may actually have something to talk about.  

During calling times, (they are called ""power hour) even though you are an adult, they will not let you leave your desk even to use the bathroom.

5% of the sales floor actually makes acceptable money so they dangle their success in front of the struggling AEs like a carrot to try to get them to continue calling on the bad accounts.  Keep in mind the successful AEs got the producing accounts because they are friends or in a relationship with someone in management.

If you are looking for a job as an AE and actually have skill and a book of business, i would recommend you go elsewhere.  If you are new to the business and just want to work 9-6 with weekends off making $36k then this is the place for you."

I'm confident the opportunities within this organization, presented by the teams, leadership, and colleagues, truly offer the support and even attention required to be successful. If you come from a background in the mortgage industry or not, the company's structure, process, training, people, and relationships are the best in the industry and only continue to prosper. You'll hear it from HR when interviewing, and it's true once you're inside. What I've noticed working at a few decent other respectable companies, are that they want you to be a certain way / force you to fit in, which can be overwhelming. At United Shore, when you join the team, you truly can be 'you', and that's what should be most important to your career. I plan to stick around, hopefully for a long time, and know that with Mat and leadership in place, they will always look out for us. There's definitely an opportunity to make great money and still have the balance you need.",I think the positives trump any negatives one might have.
1389,,Most awful experience I've ever had!,2017-02-11,1.0,Lending Support,"There aren't any. This company has more drama, rumors, and ridiculously untrained management staff I have ever witnessed in my entire life.","There have been so many complaints made about two women who are in charge of lending support and closing that it's sickening. They flaunt their bestie status, their arrogance, and disrespect. They pick and choose who they are going to like, and who they arent. Based on that alone your future within the company is set. You can be like a few people who know they are butt kissers to them and they've moved pretty rapidly. Or you can be like the normal people who don't like drama they spread around, rumors they spread, and high-school behaviors. However, not a single person in that company pays attention to their downright foul behavior because well...one makes sure there's something to look at, while the other has her nose right up the cheeks! It's disgraceful and distasteful. If the ""ceo"" paid attention I'm sure he'd be appalled. Be careful accepting employment here, if you look at someone the wrong way, you're officially out! No 3 strikes, don't pass go, straight to the office and out the door! The ""positive"" reviews are indeed management (which they've admitted to, once some of these were brought up, giving the explanation of ""Well someone has to make us look good"") absolutely pathetic."
1390,,United Shore is the best place to work. Period.,2017-02-09,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Where should I start? There's so much I could talk about here but I'll try and stick to just playing the hits: 

1. Leadership -  The leaders make you feel appreciated, they're invested in your success, and they're actual leaders - right there beside you helping to row the boat, not just blowing the whistle when it's time for you to row. I'm not just talking about your lower and mid-level leaders either we're talking top to bottom. Our president and CEO's name is Mat Ishbia: Mat gets in the weeds of his business - he understands the intricacies of his business. The other day I saw that Mat was learning to write code with our friends in IT so he could get a better understanding of what they do in application development. Mat partners with his leaders and clients and he's always open to feedback to make sure himself and everyone around him gets better every day. Mat also gets to know his people and visits everyone. There's always an emphasis on ensuring team members are fulfilled in their work and well trained to be successful in their role. 

2. Culture - I've worked for a couple companies that lured me in with awesome culture videos only to have all signs of their culture vanish into a black soul crushing abyss on the first day. That doesn't happen at United Shore. Team members live and breathe the culture everyday. There are 6 pillars we live by. I won't go in to all of them here but a lot of us are big fans of pillar 6: ""Our path is paved with fun and friendship""  - Think: table tennis tournaments, a putting green built into the sales floor, 3 o' clock dance parties every Thursday, free tickets to Detroit Pistons games nearly every weekend, Nelly - as in ""It's getting hot in hurr"" Nelly performing at your holiday party, an annual Cruise Raffle competition, the list goes on, and on, and on. That's United Shore. My personal favorite is pillar number 5: ""Continuous Improvement is Essential for Long-Term Success"" I've never worked for a company that takes getting better so seriously. They have a ""Brilliant Idea"" program that's like a giant company suggestion box only, they actually take the suggestions seriously which is already more than what some companies I've worked for can say and on top of that they give you some cool hardware for your desk when you submit something that's brilliant. 

3. Opportunity - When I started a little over two years ago, there were approximately 1100 team members at United Shore. There are now closer to 2000 and we're adding 600 more in 2017. My story goes like this: I started as an Account Executive on the sales team, have since received three promotions and I feel incredibly fortunate to say that I am now helping to lead an incredible team in a different area of the company. My story is not unique. Some of my fellow team members who started on the same day as me are now leaders in sales and other places throughout the company. So much growth. So much opportunity. If you have the right work ethic and attitude and you're coachable, you will be successful at United Shore. As a disclaimer I will warn you that it's not all fun and games all the time. Know that we definitely work hard too. You must be willing to work hard for 40 hours a week. Give us a firm 40 and the rest of the time is yours.",Cons: Not enough free cake? I don't know. Probably too much free cake if we're being real serious but I honestly don't have anything bad to say about United Shore.

Very structured deployments and communication is very good between teams. 
3PM dance parties","mandatory 1 hour breaks for people who joined after 2016 and not mandatory for employees before that. That's plain discrimination. You cannot ask certain employees to take an hour lunch. It's only fair if everyone has the same rules. 
Parking not sufficient, off campus additional parking kills time

Low salaries - Below market average 

No flexibility at all - no Work from Home when necessary. There are days when we need to be somewhere or look after kids and work at the same time. Everybody needs a work from home once in a while for work life balance. 

No sick leaves - none. All we get is 10 days of leaves in first year which should cover both sick and vacation. Sounds unfair to me (esp when there's no work from home either)

No annual bonus either"
1394,,No Kudos For You!,2017-01-28,1.0,Underwriter,"Casual dress code, the power cart, the cafeteria staff makes some mean tacos.","Work life balance, less than competitive pay and benefits.

The only thing that matters is you hit/exceed your ""commitment"" of loans underwritten for the day.  Your commitment is an average of how many loans per day you are able to underwrite.  Strangely enough, this number can only go up and will never go down.

It's an unwritten rule that you don't leave for the day until you've hit your commitment.  This comes directly from the top, as most decision makers only have a background in sales.  They fail to understand that some files take longer than others.  Loan quality is an afterthought, it's all about quantity and not quality.

Since the underwriters must place a phone call to brokers on each file they work on, they are ""graded"" or ""scored"" on each call.  For each call that is made you must use certain tag lines and phrases that leadership has deemed necessary for elite client service.  They do not trust that the employees have basic people skills to make a personable phone call.  This just makes every underwriter sound like a robot since they are all saying basically the same thing on every phone call.  This is a policy that comes directly from the sales department, underwriting has no voice in the company.

There is an internal social media website that you must visit daily.  People post and ""like"" pictures of their dogs or goldfish wearing company apparel, or employees making a U with their hands.  Participation awards are given out excessively via this site.

Recent team lead promotions are all fresh out of college and have never made a mortgage payment themselves.  They lack the maturity and knowledge to be able to manage people.  They are only promoted because they smile while management presses new ""brilliant ideas"" upon them.  This is called ""running the play"".  Calling audibles or asking why are looked down upon.

Bottom line, the culture that has been created will come back to bite them.  Soon enough all of the knowledgeable underwriters will jump ship and what will be left will not be able to produce quality loans or make sound underwriting decisions.  This company tries way too hard to be ""cool"" in order to distract the employees from the fact that they are being paid less than market rate.  I know for a fact that management requires team leads to post positive reviews on this site, so be careful what you read."
1395,,Do not believe any review higher than 2 stars (they are planted by management),2017-01-27,1.0,Account Executive,Wow Pros huh?  Umm lets see...you know what? This is harder than I thought...I would say the free pop but I don't drink pop anymore so that's not a pro...Yea I got nothing.,"Ok now in regards to cons this company has them in spades. Especially when it comes to the AE position.  DO NOT I repeat DO NOT believe any positive review regarding this position.  They are clearly planted by those in management and marketing to offset the overwhelming amount of bad reviews.  This position has an incredibly high turnover rate.  No rebuttal from UWM marketing will change the fact that they have an AE class every month.  Every single month they have to hire a new crop of ""suckers"" to fill this role due to employees quitting (like I did) or employees getting fired.  I am finding out now that the latter has become much more commonplace these days.  Here is the skinny...This company and position is about as political and petty as humanly possible.  Maybe you like incredibly petty people.  Maybe you prefer to associate with unsavory foul mouth 10th grade boys locker room-esque type of people.  If that is the case, by all means this is the place for you. Maybe you like political office back stabbing and bickering.  You would fit right in here.  Even if what I said sounds like your type of dream job be mindful that you can still be let go for any reason whatsoever and not given a reason why.  I have communicated with several ex-UWM employees and the story is always 1 of 2 tales.  Story 1: I was led to believe that I could make a lot of money here and make this my new career.  Unfortunately I do not even make enough money to put gas in the car to drive there so I had to quit.  Story 2: I worked at UWM and saw some success.  Just as I was about to turn the corner and really start making some money, management took my profitable account(s) and gave them to my team lead or national account rep. When I decided to speak up for myself to voice how I felt this was wrong I was let go.  I was not given a reason other than ""we are an at-will employer and reserve the right to end the employment at any time.""  Now undoubtedly there is going to be some sort of message below from management stating that this is not true and that UWM is a pillar of the community and blah blah blah.  I encourage you to utilize LinkedIN and reach out to as many ex employees of UWM as possible.  Reach out to them and they will verify that everything that I have said is 100% true. You can also view the reviews on this website and you will see a pattern as well.  Bottom line is this job is not for everyone to say the least.  If you are willing to put up with copious amounts of nonsense and hang in there for about 2 years, you can make alot of money.  The downside is that even if you hang in there for that long you can still be fired at the drop of hat for nothing more than someone doesn't like the look on your face.  Make the decision wisely in regards to working here."

1398,,Hands Down Greatest Company!!!,2017-01-19,5.0,UW2,I have never experienced a bad day while at United Shore. This place just oozes positive energy. This is a very fast and incredibly fun environment. This is the first place I have ever worked where I feel the company truly cared about me and about my professional goals. The amount of training they provide you from the second you walk in the door really sets you up for success. Management (Leaders) are very friendly and approachable. The Health Care is very good and very affordable. PTO is awesome. The company is always doing the little things to make you feel wanted and important.,The Cons at United Shore are truly few and far between. The only one I can really think of is that parking is limited. With that being said the company has a second lot that is a 5 min walk or a 30 second shuttle ride away.

They create a family focused environment and promote a solid work life balance based on their firm 40 hour mentality.,"Pressure to hit commitments can be overwhelming and the culture can be too uniform at times.  The constant attention required in order to hit production goals can make the work very monotonous and frustrating.  The company does offer entertaining perks, but if you don't like to be confined to a cubicle, this job is not for you."

1403,,Slightly cult-ish atmosphere masks low wages.,2016-12-27,2.0,Business Analyst,Can be a fun place to work if you like dance parties and forced happiness. Pretty nice office. With 2000 coworkers you're bound to find a few friends. Pretty good entry level stuff if you're looking for a first job.,"Pay in most areas is well below market rate. They have big annual holiday parties and give you ""work perks"" like valet (not any more), in office laundry, ping-pong, and an office that looks like it was drawn by Dr. Seuss (or more accurately, the same people who designed Quicken Loans' offices)

BUT, if you are looking to be fairly compensated for your work then it's not the best option. There used to be a lot of upward mobility but now with 2000 employees the management/VP tier is bloated. When I left, there were only 11 employees to each VP. If you are in sales, go work as a broker. If you're in accounting, why haven't you gotten your CPA?! If you're in capital markets, go work for a bank. If you're in IT, go work literally anywhere else...you have endless job openings and wage potential. 

The final con to mention is the mortgage market. The Fed will raise rates  times in 2017 and USFS underwriting turn times are only a couple hours...for anyone not in the industry, this means that the number of mortgages coming into USFS is dropping and they have excess employees just waiting around for more loans. Cuts are probably on the horizon."

I mean you get a free lunch on your first day lol.,"Literally the worst job I've ever had. Most of the positive reviews on here are fake, I'm sure of it. If you ask them about turn over, they will say it's very low, however that's a total lie. I quit after my third week in training class as it was a complete joke of a job and the trainers were highly unintelligent and clearly not educated.

I kept in touch with a lot of the people in the training class after I left, and every single one of them also left later on. 

Not only are you calling broker shops that have already been called a hundred times and have no desire to do business with you, but the management team is full of uneducated jokers.

Please do yourself a favor and never set foot in this place!"
1405,,Account Executive,2016-12-08,5.0,Account Executive,"United Shore is a progressive company with a welcoming work environment. Every possible tool for success is at your disposal as a new account executive. They have a robust, knoweldgeable, dedicated training team (at 8 weeks I'm still in training 2 hours a day), call scorers and have an entire archive of information to learn from in their system. 

Coming from a background that is NOT mortgage, I'm constantly overwhelmed by the amount of information that I have to retain and apply, but with the help and support of my team and leaders, it's eased the pain. 

Training is rigerous. You'll get out of the experience what you put into it, but you'll find no other work environment quite like this one. If you're going to apply and interview here, be prepared to put in the time and dedication required to get yourself off the ground. Utilize what they give you and before you critique the ""play"" leadership calls, run it to see if it works. At United Shore you really are on a team, and your team really does care for your success and wellbeing. No regrets.","After six months you'll be on commission and you'll take a significant decrease in salary. I'm not there yet, but most everyone tells me that month 7-11 are difficult financially. This stage weeds out those who listened to training and are having success and those who paid less heed. This sales position has less to do with actual ""selling"", and has more to do with managing. You're literally a full-time consultant for each of your accounts, so relationship building with the people at your brokerages is an absolute must. If they don't like you, respect you, and trust you, they aren't going to send you business or listen to your advice. Get in the weeds with your brokers and roll around."
1406,,Empty Promises,2016-12-04,1.0,Operations,"They do find great people to work there. You will meet amazing people here. 

Also, they are unique because give people experience who have never worked in this industry before. That's not always easy to find.","That being said, there were many times employees were pitted against each other and many team/group dynamics that erred in juvenile popularity contests. No one needs that at work.

Bonuses were promised for certain tasks and going above and beyond but to my knowledge were never received by anyone involved. This was especially insulting because wages there are low to begin with. They hype up the ""perks"" of being associated with the company but some people work harder because they need to pay bills, not go to concerts.

They claim to have an open door policy, but do not be fooled. Do not share anything that can be construed as ""negative"". Once that word is mentioned, it's like a witch hunt."

The company alligns its values with team members, and they show how important they think we are every day. From fun contests to great recognition, they make sure you feel fulfilled. The perks are great: everything from Pistons tickets to the in-house doctors office, they want life to be convenient and work to only be one part of it.  I will be there for life.",I wish the lights weren't so bright. That's all I can come up with!
1410,,Underwriting,2016-11-10,5.0,Senior Underwriter,United Shore has the best culture out there. It is really pushed hard to have a work life balance. It is well known to have to work life balance that you have to be ready to work hard all day so you are giving the 40 your best. Fantastic place to work.,I would say the main downside is parking. The company is growing so fast that they ran out of spots to park so occasionally you have to ride a shuttle. Not a bad problem to have though!

1415,,Stay Away,2016-11-02,1.0,,The holiday party and some of the perks around the office.,"Juat about everything.  The real reviews you read about below are the truth. The leadership is poor. There has been turnover everywhere in leadership. The culture is a facade to lure you in. Do not believe the hype. They are quick to let people go and really do not care about you. Feedback is not welcome and everything is very, very fake.  You will see advice soon enough on this post from marketing to that will be some rubbish about some plan, stat or initiative they have going on, but it is all a ploy so the leaders can hit their bonus goal at the end of the year. If you're thinking about working here, I'd urge you to look at another company. I'd even suggest you reach out to someone on social media to get a real picture of the environment.  My guess is they will reiterate many of the negative comments below.  This is the reason so many people have left last year and this year, including myself.  Stay away if you want work life balance. Stay away if you want the ability to enjoy where you work."
1416,,"""Culture"" - ours is nothing new or revolutionary.",2016-11-01,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"The people that work there are nice, besides that there isn't much to rave about.","United Shore claims to be anti-corporate and have some revolutionary set-up. It's everything but that. Sure you only work 40 hours. Flexibility isn't a thing here either. "" if you give them an inch they'll take a mile"" has been said by a leader here. If your team members feel the need to take a mile maybe you should reflect on that. 

The benefits aren't that great either. Oh and compensation is awful. Constantly giving people the lowest compensation possible. Save yourself the hassle and go elsewhere. This company is for people who have little to no experience and need a starting point."
1417,,Underwriter,2016-10-25,2.0,Senior Underwriter,Fair wages and opportunity for bonuses if you work a lot of overtime and weekends.,"This was once a great, family owned place to work but has now turned into a greedy, status driven company that tries too hard to be like Quicken.  Management promotes fake enthusiasm in attempts to brainwash the young employees.  The  overhiring of a younger, cheaper staff is definitely an objective so they can weed out the higher paid workers that got them to where they are today.

1420,,Underwriting Department is Terrible,2016-10-11,1.0,Underwriter II,There's free coffee and pop,"management severely overworks and under pays the underwriters. You aren't allowed to leave until you hit your commitment number each and every day. The company advertises the ""Firm 40"" work week, but internally it means something different. Basically, it means you aren't allowed to do anything other than work at your desk for 8 straight hours. If you meet your commitment number, you can go home. If not, you stay late. 

As far as your commitment number is concerned, it's decided based on some very loose math. They average the number of files you normally do, divided by the number of hours you work during the month. Then that number is rounded up to the next whole number. Very ironic as that commitment number is what the company expects you to do every single day. Say, on average you do 8.2 files each day meaning you do 8 files Monday thru Thursday and do an extra on Friday. Your new commitment would be 9 and you'd be expected to do 9 every day after."

I myself can't believe their number 1 in the industry with their terrible technology. They talk about work life balance but where is the work life balance when you have us working 10am to 7pm?  I would wake up at 8am get ready for work, start work at 10am, get off at 7pm and not get home until 8pm..... the whole day is gone... there is no work life balance don't be fooled people.

They have a fun company atmosphere with a lot of great benefits that I haven't seen anywhere else.","A lot of the new hires and positions where you interact with the company's clients are moving their shifts out to 10-7. It's a perfect shift for someone who is maybe in their early 20s but it could prove to be difficult if you're a working parent, have other obligations, etc. That said, they do try to work with you to do what works best with your schedule."
1424,,"They're Doing Great Things, Butttt...",2016-09-17,4.0,,"I genuinely enjoy going to work. Yes, there are expectations and production quotas, but this is a production business. The training is second to none. I knew nothing about this business a year ago and now I can be considered an expert in my field. The company is in a high growth period and there are opportunities everywhere. All they ask is that you do YOUR best each and every day. There's always something fun going on around the office. We had Magic Johnson speak at our company rally. Magic Johnson!! It's truly a great place to work. Mat is a great CEO and he is so present and humble. It's not out of the ordinary to see him in the cafe sitting with his employees. His dad Jeff, who founded the company, is a class act as well. High regards to most of my leaders as well. For the most part, I feel like I matter and am able to speak up to make myself and the company better.","Currently the only location is in Troy so there's not a lot of mobility. We are underpaid by industry standards. While we are never required to work more than 40 hours, I find myself doing so to reach my financial goals. The bonus opportunities are strenuous and just barely worth it. Of course this is a personal choice, but it doesn't negate the fact that if you look at the salaries of those similarly situated in the metro Detroit area we are paid less by as much as 30%. It is especially frustrating as we are constantly told how much we're smoking the competition and it's ""all because of us."" We're the number one wholesale lender in the country. We're in one location with less employees (less overhead) than many of our competitors yet they're paid better. Something doesn't add up."

1430,,Awesome company,2016-07-28,4.0,,If you want to work hard and get better everyday you can make a great living. Leadership is constantly trying to improve and help younger employees grow,To structured for some. If you need to be able to not work 9 to 6 then this is not for you it does require dedication. The payoff is a 6 figure income. But it is work.
1431,,This is High School All Over Again,2016-07-21,1.0,,There is the potential to build quality relationships here with co-workers,"The company overall is marketed to be one of the ""best and brightest"" to work for in metro Detroit, however, this is false advertising - it is the trend at this company. The job positions, the CEO and ""leaders,""work life, opportunities, and overall atmosphere at this company are all falsely advertised to make the company look like something it is definitely not.

They promote a ""Firm 40"" work life but never fully implement it - if you do adhere to this then you are looked down on and judged by your co-workers and managers and suddenly are a target for them to watch. The structure of production roles is TERRIBLE - you have a commitment to hit each day and if you do not your teammates can make it up to you, only to create more stress and a hostile environment for you later on. If you do not hit commitment you also become a target for managers to monitor. You are expected to cater to the brokers' needs every minute of the day, but you also need to hit commitment, balance emails and phone calls, and make sure you are on top of your tasks and weekly tests they send out. It's INSANITY. The stress is palpable everywhere in this company, especially in Underwriting. Also, make sure to never talk about anything in your life outside of work because it spreads amongst the whole floor, and then by the time you realize this has happened you are being gossiped about by the many cliques that exist there. The entire company represents high school, only with a different age group. The level of immaturity and ignorance that you encounter in the leaders and workers there is saddening. If you aren't in the ""clique"" to begin with, good luck ever moving within the company or up to a more senior level position - it won't happen for you. 

Leaders are not leaders here. They use intimidation, threats, and demeaning language and tones to communicate with you and make you feel like you mean absolutely nothing - which you don't anyways, and they ensure that you know your place there. If you ever try to speak up about something that you don't agree with or are upset with be prepared to be scolded for it later, or just fired in the next few days. You will suddenly take on a new reputation to everyone here, and they will not let you forget it - all for trying to voice your opinion or concern. So basically, do as you are told and don't say a word about it. Seems totally fair, right? 

The new hire experience and training gets you excited for your new opportunity, and makes you believe that you have finally found your ""home."" Piece of advice - don't listen too closely to it because once you are actually in your position you quickly realize how fake that was. People either buy into it and settle into a role that they believe they are ""perfectly fit"" for - because that is what they make you believe, or settle into their role unhappily and deal with it just because the (minimal) paycheck they receive is what is keeping food on their table. 

The pay and PTO days ""allowed"" is minimal and barely enough to make you feel like you actually have a life outside of work. They offer up bonus opportunities to you when there is too much volume to handle, but make you work down to the bone to actually receive the bonus - and don't expect to be able to do much with it besides go grocery shopping one extra time. You have to use PTO days for sick days and appointments, so it goes fast and once you are out you are out of luck, praying for your hire date to renew so your PTO can restart. Forget about enjoying your life - they know what you're making is minimal and a majority of the employees live paycheck to paycheck, but they still continue to believe that you are adequately compensated for all of your hard work, long hours, and elite client service script that you are forced to verbalize daily.

Overall, this company is unlike anything I have ever witnessed before. The condescending attitudes of leaders and employees wears on you daily, so if you want to work here you need to be able to deal with it. If you want to feel appreciated and valued, keep on looking elsewhere because I promise you that what you will find here is none of that."

Collaboration, if you don't plug in an avoid people all day, you will learn about everything and with your new skill set you become the obvious choice for new opportunities that happen all the time. Team atmosphere, you have the chance to work with people who are as diversified as you are and you will learn a lot simply by listening and asking and participating! The last topic is growth: you have the ability to sit down with your leader every month if you choose or once a week if reach out and ask for the time to sit down and ask for tips on getting better. Take the coaching you are given and implement right away. Fight the change and you will fall behind.",The cons are nothing the company can do anything about. You are asked to work from the office and not able to work from home. I can't fault them for that.
1443,,Sales,2016-05-18,5.0,Sales Executive,"Great people, hard working company. Only ask for 40 hours, great events to share with family. Take great care of the people.","Takes commitment, need to dedicate 12-18 months to building your network to a position that you can be great for many years. Do you have the time?"
1444,,Wildly mismanaged,2016-05-18,1.0,Mortgage Underwriter,"You can have fun, as long as you aren't in production. People who aren't in production aren't constantly having their quotas raised, aren't fired for the slightest slip ups, and aren't forced to make up production for their co-workers slack.","As my title says, this place has awful management. They have cleverly framed their CEO to only be exciting and friendly, while all negativity comes from others lower down the chain (even though over time you'll figure out who is really putting all of the pressure on you). None of the managers know what they're doing in the long run. They make up unrealistic goals and measures and will stop at nothing to obtain them. The quality of employees, brokers, and loans have decreased significantly since I started at UWM a little over a year ago, and it's getting worse every day. They have all of these little tag lines they love to use, and I'll describe a few for you. ""Firm 40"" means you better give us every ounce you can squeeze out of yourself for at least 40 hours/week. ""People are our greatest asset"" should be replaced with people are our most expendable asset. Their greatest asset are the terrible brokers who you are expected to coddle while still hitting your production requirements. They are breeding a system of hand-holding that soon means the underwriters will be finding the loans, submitting them, collecting all of the docs, and then underwriting the whole thing. ""Fun and friendship"" can be real, as long as you aren't clocked in! This place could be worth it if you have been spending years on the streets and have no prospects for employment (they've been hiring a lot of those these days, because even talent acquisition is being forced into unreasonable expectations meaning they are bringing in almost anyone). However, if you aren't starving or about to be homeless I recommend you stay away from this place. They think they're on the some magical path to being the #1 wholesale lender, but they're actually setting themselves up for a terrible, terrible crash."
1445,,I don't understand all the 5 stars,2016-05-13,2.0,Closer,"It's a job when you need one. Free fruit, pop, etc. they truly believe in a work life balance. It's a paycheck but a small one",They pay far less than any other company out there. The freebies and perks don't make up for the la k of pay. Not enough parking. Late shift for new employees so regardless of the 40 hour work week there is no quality time with family when you are working until 7 every night. Pto is less than most companies in the industry and that's with then increasing it recently. Lots of gossiping that is distracting and unprofessional
1446,,Dont judge a book by its cover,2016-05-12,2.0,IT Team Leader,"Collaberative and great peiole work there, good people are here but frustrated about the horrible processes.",Under paid almost by 15 to 20% of the area median. Its like pulling teeth to get an increase There is absolutely no process. Leaders arent on the same page. People.tattle to other leaders about things.... gossip is worse than middle school. Bonus structure for management HA! Record year after record year $600 bonus and 350 after taxes. This place doesnt care about anyone but the bottom line.

-Politics and nepotism are rampant throughout the company. A few leaders told me that you had to ""play the game"" in order to get good accounts, let alone get promoted
-Not enought accounts for the AE's that they have and they keep hiring; give good accounts to the ""established"" AEs (which are all ironically team leads)
-Not enough parking spots for employees"
1448,,Amazing,2016-05-04,5.0,Executive Assistant,Inviting and friendly work place.  I was recruited by a long time friend and have been here for 3 years.  I used to wake up and dread going to work.  Now... I love it! Can't wait to go to work and see my family.  When I get to my desk in the morning I feel happy and ready to get stuff done. Leaders are always looking for ways to show you that you're appreciated and constantly giving you positive feedback on how to get better.  United shore has taught me how to work harder and take true ownership of my actions and attitude.  I would highly recommend for young people who are searing for their calling and career.,There are no downsides.... you will truly reap the rewards for the effort you put forth.  You are in control of your own destiny.
1449,,Best Place I Have Ever Worked For!!!!! Seriously,2016-05-02,5.0,"Account Executive, Team Lead",Friendliest environment ever! Everyone is very willing to help you get you to your goal. They are also a company that hires from within.  Your effort and attitude in the way that you do your job can get you anywhere.  Positions within the company are filled by current employees.  Again it is a very conducive work environment. Even the President of the company started as an AE. The Possibilities are endless!!!,"Entering in as an AE you have to understand that it is a business that you will have to build up, it will not just fall into your lap.  You have to earn trust from brokers, but if you guide them the right day, this is a very lucrative position."

FIRM 40 - Work 40 hours- work hard- play hard!
This company wants to always do right by their team members and external clients alike!",I really do not have any cons to add- just as my review states - the opportunity is based on how hard you work for it! Those that leave or leave bad reviews are typically the wrong fit to begin with or did not work hard enough to see the opportunity that was available to them.

They start everyone off as an account executive because ""they only promote from within"". If you have mortgage experience and know how to originate, and more importantly, can guide others to originate successfully, you can do well.","In reality, they operate on a mass hiring, mass firing system with very little training and some of the most misogynist ""trainers"" you'll ever meet. In one ""training"" session I literally listened to one of the ""Trainers"" boast about how he almost slept with a stripper at a club he worked at (because they don't pay enough for you to only have a day job). They play favorites, celebrate mediocrity, and pretend it's excellence."

Nice gym onsite. Great co workers. Consistent schedule with some opportunities for overtime.",I really can not think of any cons.

1465,,Sweatshop 'lite',2016-03-10,1.0,Account Executive,Good place to gain experience.,"The sales floor is essentially run like a sweatshop. Account executives are treated like children - there are 5 ""Power Blocks"" throughout the day, where you are only allowed to make outgoing phone calls AND CAN NOT EVEN LEAVE YOUR DESK TO GO TO THE BATHROOM. They've been hiring at such a furious pace that literally anyone who has a pulse can get a job here. Thusly, they can not trust the people they hire, so they implement meaningless metrics which are impossible to meet. Sales personnel have every detail dictated to them - who you will call, at what hour of the day, and they will even dictate what you must speak to a certain contact about."
1466,,Don't be fooled,2016-03-03,1.0,Underwriting Support,Free fruit/Free valet but most of us would prefer more money since we are the lowest paying in the business.,"Please do not let them fool you. Marketing is just adding review to boost the score. They pull you in and try to convince you they have a ""work/life"" balance HA. They have forced employees to own a minimum of 9 a day plus a few hours on Saturday because they can't hire enough people to keep up. They are losing good employees because of lies they have told as far as integral promotion. That is nothing more than a line to get you in the door. The pay is horrible Underwriting support you make 11$ and hour and you're working like a slave as I know the Underwriters are as well. They claim you get to move positions after 6 months but fill those positions with new external members. They do not care about how you feel and are treated here unless you are a close personal friend/ family to someone high up. They claim fun and friendship but those higher up on the pay scale treat you like you are nothing (rude emails, rude phone calls,etc..) and when you tell team member service they ignore you!! If you want to feel like a slave and feel as if you mean nothing to the company then this is the place for you."
1467,,Not happy,2016-03-01,3.0,Underwriter II,"Free drinks, dance party on Thursdays (if you're into that), Underwriter II pay was not bad.",The Underwriter II position was stressful and boring. The training process was tedious and there were many surprises along the way. If you don't pass midterm or final exam you will be fired. When you pass both of those exams you can still be fired if you do not do well in mentoring.

AEs are expected to turn straw into gold with horrible accounts to work. Management fires people without even giving them a reason after preaching ""Our people are our greatest asset"" and ""we are a family here."" Micromanagement. Upper management preaches ""being in the weeds of your business"" and yet are totally out of touch with what AEs hear from their accounts. Very unreasonable expectations. Only ""yes-men"" should apply. Overall they give the impression of being very cheap. Horrible place to work unless you are one of the chosen ones or don't care about making over 40k per year.

Honestly, all of the big complaints seem to only be a portion of the truth at best.  AE's are chained to their desk for 5 power hours (that by the way are 45 minutes at most - not a full hour)?  I guess whoever wrote that review went back to their job at Santa's workshop where a pay check is dropped in your lap after doing whatever you want for 40 hours.  

The paid time off could be better, but was recently improved for 2016.  It would also be more exciting if they were located in downtown Detroit.  Other than that, I find it hard to complain about the company."

Lots of room for growth and its nice that people are encouraged to seek out new and challenging opportunities in various areas of the company instead of the typical corporate mindset of ""transfers are for under-performing staff or people who don't like their boss"".  Work/Life balance is probably the biggest plus here.  True 40 hour work weeks and we only worked overtime on a voluntary basis (I liked the extra $ in my checks here and there).","Bureaucracy first and foremost.  It felt nearly impossible to get anything done without 2 or more leaders above you having to approve it.  My team leader had zero pull or decision making ability.  It was like buying a stick of gum needed to be run by the AVP and then the SVP above them, etc.  No need to have team leads if they can't really make any decisions on their own.  That kind of red tape is detrimental and slows progress way down.  Second was the pay.  Really really low by industry standards in all areas (based on complaints from friends in every area of the company).  I can't count how many times someone said to me, ""This party/event must have cost $1Million.  Give me a little more to take home at the end of the day and let's just have individual team outings."""

This is just another Quicken Loans gimmick where they promise you all of this money upfront and work like a robot. The position entails you to ""build relationships"", except you overcall the same people multiple times a week with no reason. They're a growing company which is great for opportunity, except, half of the people being promoted to Team Lead's have no idea on how to be a true leader. Account Executives are told they're smarter than any other Account Executive in the nation and any broker who's been in business for 5+ years after just being in this role for 6 months.

1528,,The best place I've ever worked!,2015-05-07,5.0,Business Manager,"I've worked in the mortgage industry for close to 15 years and after having worked for a few of the larger banks, I thought all corporate companies were the same. I was quickly convinced otherwise from the first day that I interviewed at UWM. I couldn't help but notice at how many people smiled and said hello to me as I was waiting to go into my interview. I could feel a positive energy and everyone seemed genuinely happy. 
UWM’s leadership truly cares about their team members and they are willing to make every effort to ensure professional growth. From leadership training courses to daily huddles, the communication and training stays consistent. 
It all starts at the top level. The CEO, Mat Ishbia sits among the people and takes time getting to know as many of them as possible. With over 1100 team members, I’m amazed at how many names he remembers. He truly cares about growing the company and his mission is to have a positive impact on as many people as possible, both internally and externally. Mat’s leadership emanates throughout the company and all members of the leadership team are held to a very high standard. I never feel intimidated to ask for help. I know that there will always be an opportunity for me to learn and grow. 
When you work hard, it’s not only appreciated, it’s acknowledged and rewarded. Our people are rewarded with things such as free tickets to NBA, NFL and MLB games. We also have large company events such as taking over an entire fair for our families as well as top-notch holiday parties with fun giveaways such as shopping sprees, free lunch for a whole year, trips to Disney and so much more. 
And if that isn’t enough, the amenities at UWM are fit for a kind and queen. From free valet, a cafe with great food and very reasonable prices, a market where you can purchase snack items, an on-site Starbucks, free pop and coffee stations to all team members, a workout facility for just a few bucks per month, sometimes I wonder what else a person could ask for.",Honestly I can't really think of anything. When I have concerns our leaders are able to address them right away.

1530,,"Place With Lots of Great Perks, but Make sure it's the Right Fit",2015-03-21,4.0,Anonymous Employee,"Disclaimer: It's hard to look through reviews of United Shore since, unfortunately, it depends on which team you're on/department you're in that can dramatically change your experience. It's apparent that the Sales Department lives in a bubble that is not much like the rest of the company. The entire company is allowed to dress casual, while sales must dress in a suit and tie, the entire company is not expected nor (usually) asked to work more than 9pm - 5:30pm, the sales teams are almost always asked to stay longer, or if not, offhandedly asked to work from home if they want to grow their business. So, when looking through reviews on here, you may get widely varying opinions and view points, and it will most probably be between people that are in sales, and people that are not.

United Shore has done a lot to create a ""family"" atmosphere. It's CEO does a lot to try and maintain this feeling, despite having nearly quadrupled it's size in the past 3-4 years, and I commend them on that. There is a definite feeling of teamwork and camaraderie that can be sensed throughout most departments. People are friendly, and really willing to help out where they can. They do stick by their 40 hour work week that they advertise (again, unless you're in sales), and the perks are awesome. 

Speaking of perks, I'll list some of them: Free valet parking for ALL employees, an on-site fitness center with treadmills, ellipticals, dumbbells, bicycling machines, yoga balls, and other equipment that's available for $7/month, on-site cafeteria which is decently priced and has some pretty good quality food, free pop/soda stations on every floor, free coffee, free cappuccino, great company events (usually 3 or so per year), and lots of other random things and give-aways that go on.

They preach upward momentum and utilizing the people we have there the best, and while they do a good job for the most part at this, can sometimes be hypocritical in going with an outside person over a very qualified in-house person for positions. There are ""leadership"" classes which last a month and are supposed to get you ""ready to be a leader"" within the company. While it's a nice gesture, it seems that 90% of the people that go through these classes never actually get moved upwards (or were already a ""leader"" before they were in the class). Needless to say though, there is an effort there to harness people from within, which is nice to see.","First and foremost - The pay. Do not work here if you plan on making a lot of money. In sales, only the top 5% make anything that would be deemed ""good"", and the rest of the companies positions, save for executives, fall well below industry averages. You're really coming here for the atmosphere, and it's highly suggested you negotiate for every penny you want before you come through the door, because good luck getting much more once you're here, save for the VERY minimal few who actually get promoted to a MUCH higher position. The company operates on a ""one time a year review"" system which is the only time employees are eligible for a pay increase. However, not all employees are given an increase (2% is considered status quo by many companies for economic inflation purposes), and they tell you, no matter how great of a job you're doing or how much you're lending to the companies growth, that there is a max cap at 3% increase per year. To put that in perspective, if you're making $40k/year (more than a lot of the company) and you get a 3% pay increase (which not all employees will get) you will be making approximately $0.60 more per hour, or an extra $24 a paycheck (before taxes). Aka, pretty much nothing (and that's if you're lucky). 

It wouldn't be so bad if this was a small company just trying to make ends meet. However, They tout, all the time, how well the company is doing. How many extra BILLIONS of dollars per year they are making as compared to last, what their earnings projections for the upcoming year(s) are, and have no problem asking their employees to go ""above and beyond"" to make the company the best it can be and hit it's goals. But then when they do hit those goals, refuse to shell out pay to compensate the employees who got them there. Company parties with free food and carnival rides is great, but I believe (and by talking with) most all employees would take a pay increase to actually help their means to live MUCH MORE than the thousands upon thousands upon THOUSANDS of dollars the company spends to hold events so that it can advertise how awesome it is by having these events (most of it, yes, is for PR purposes). 

If you look at what the average employee gets paid in their position here, you'll find out it's on the very low end of what the industry, or even local standard for that position is. However, if pay isn't something you're concerned about, and you're not in sales, and you'd like to have a (comparative to other financial companies) nice atmosphere to work in, then United Shore will most likely be a good fit for you. Which is sad, because if they would pay their employees something more competitive, they really would retain more of them, because as it is, many employees are forced to leave the company due to the inability to receive a worthy pay increase (even if you get ""promoted"", it usually ends up being a title change and they barely, many times not at all, change your pay), and it hurts the overall projection of the entire company. If they would look at the HR cost of hiring a new employee from new to competent, it ends up being around $10,000. If they would compensate their current, GOOD employees, better than they did now, they would keep so many more, and save themselves money in the long run.

And in case you'd like to dismiss this as ""one employees perspective"", know that this is MANY of the employees perspectives, and many just wont share with management because they're either afraid to, or don't think that there's much that can be done. I have put this review together through talking with MANY employees throughout the company, which has been able to let me be thorough, as well as hit on many different areas."

It is a hostile work environment unless you are one of the original employees or a family member of theirs. They do not promote from within, they say they do, but they make up titles to make you feel like you are important. But the pay does not match this. Very uneven across the board. Testing almost every day....ask a question to one underwriter, and ask the same question to another one, and you will get a completely different answer. They do not know what they are doing.

Having worked for Quicken Loans in the past and having a good amount of experience and knowledge in the industry, I expected this to go well. About a week after finishing training I was doing well on the sales floor and had already gotten three different mortgage brokers to sign agreements with United wholesale to send them business. At the end this week I was pulled in to a conference room by the sales manager for what I thought was a pump up ""good job"" type talk .. Imagine my utter shock when I was told that ""they had decided to take my employment in another direction"" this was their way of telling me I was being Fired. When I asked for an explanation all I was told was that Michigan was an ""at will"" employment state and that they were not going to tell me why.  I found out later on that this happens with A LOT of people. I have since moved in to a management position at another company so I am pretty sure it wasn't my abilities that caused this. Bottom line- it's like high school in there ..if you are a friend of the CEO or any of his friends you have it made ...if not ..Watch out .. you are very expendable. I found out later the  CEO was given control of the company by his Father the owner, and he has never worked a real day working his way up doing anything in his life. He has business dealings with all his friends from high school and college and it is all a very tight knit little group of nepotism."

They are CONSTANTLY plugging the fact that they are a great place to work, and that they promote fun and frienship. The reality is that they care more about finding ways to criticize your efforts and making people feel the they do not work hard enough and do not deserve any kind of pay raise. This is their biggest double standard. 

The other major issue is that they tell everyone that they have a fair evaluation process for internal moves, when the most significant factor in promotion is along the lines of a popularity contest. Many internal transfers are disguised as promotions. Offering $0 or a $2-3 pay inscrease. They are very secretive about the amount of pay a person can expect when they apply for another job, and they use these moves to show they value employees when most everyone that moves was tricked to do so with the promise of more pay. The jobs that truly offer significant pay increases are reserved for those employees that rub elbows with the right people in management."

I am writing all this to make sure someone doesn't make the same mistake I did and start working here and believing the lies and fluff they will throw at you to keep you. Other than free pop/coffee, I cannot think of pros. The Valet is great if you want them starting your already started car or stealing change out of your cup holders.  This company ONLY does nice things for their employees if they can publicize it to the outside(Media) to try to improve their image.  Holiday parties are nice and all, but how about paying or even giving your employees a raise? They will promise the world to you and follow through with none of it.  This place acts like a basketball hoop you can't play on or a gym you have to pay for to use is some type of great amenity, which they aren't.  They also put their logo on all kinds of items and sell them to employees.  You want employees to pay for items so you get free advertising?  Another sign of just how cheap this place really is.  If you do decide to come work here, you better make sure the amount they hire you in at is enough money, because you will never see more from this cheap company.  LOOK ELSEWHERE","Just about everything.  Low pay, management is hired in from competing companies(They do not promote from within), low pay, no raises, 7 days vacation in the first year of employment, never leave early before a holiday, and I am sure there are a number of others I could list, but won't.  You constantly hear things about how great the company is doing yet almost all employees haven't received a pay raise in the time they have worked there(Some going on 5 years without a raise?!).  Their number one company goal is to have a ""Exciting and fulfilling workplace for all employees"". Because that's what people go to work for, to feel excited and fulfilled, not to feed their families and make a living?  This place needs to get a clue! Notice how it mentions nothing about pay?  That's because they don't give raises or actually care about employees.  Everything this company does is calculated to make itself look better to outsiders than it actually is. Actions speak louder than words and your actions show you do not care about employees whether you say you do or put a poster on a wall that says you do, your employees know the truth!  TERRIBLE PLACE TO WORK!"

1546,,United Shore Maximizes Fun AND Professional Development,2014-12-09,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"It was clear, from the moment I saw the job posting online throughout the entire interview process, that United Shore emphasizes its culture and the environment it provides its team members. Now working there, it is so satisfying to actually experience it on a daily basis; to know that it isn't just lip service for recruiting purposes.

The atmosphere is open, collaborative and welcoming of new ideas and strong initiatives. Upper management throughout the company operates with an ""open door policy,"" makes a point to get to know people beyond the scope of their job duties, and from what I can tell, take pride in giving people the tools, resources, coaching and freedom to excel. 

If you're someone who is professionally driven and want to polish your skill set, and have worked somewhere that ""bottled you up"" into routine, repetitive tasks, United Shore is a great place to be.","I know that other companies (in different industries and whatnot) offer more PTO days, maybe a couple more paid holidays throughout the calendar year, and perhaps something like a ""holiday break"" that United Shore doesn't have. But I can also say that the smaller amount of PTO days (say, seven instead of 20) doesn't seem all that terrible because this is a place that I actually enjoy coming to five days a week."
1547,,Best Company I've Ever Worked For,2014-11-19,5.0,Account Executive,"They really take care of their people and do everything they can to make you successful. I've been there six months so far and I really don't see any of the negative things people have posted on here. There is plenty of room for growth and the company is constantly growing. Since I started six months ago I've seen 4 people promoted into management. Also the company is very open about what each A.E. makes. They post an email of everyone's commission for the month and honestly there isn't anyone that has been there more than a year that isn't making over six figures. Also from what I've experienced Management is very helpful and patient, they all are including the owner of the company himself. Quite a few times he has came by my desk to say hi or stopped me in the hallway to ask me how things were going. Management listens to their employees and our constantly improving and doing things to keep us happy. I don't believe they would have won the award of Best Place to Work In Metro Detroit if this wasn't true.- I think the people who complained about being mirco- managed are just lazy. The company is not going to let you just sit there and hang out all day you have to work but Ive never seen or heard of anyone's job threatened. It's not a perfect company, they do make mistakes sometimes. But they always own up to it and fix it right away instead of trying to sweep it under the rug or blame things on the employee. As far as the favoritism others have posted on here, I haven't seen that either. Of course you have people who are going to look out for their friends, but the management in this company knows when you succeed and make money they succeed and make money. From what I've personally experienced they do everything they can to make you successful.","This place is a great place to work. If your looking for a company that cares about you, a place where you can make good money in a 40 hour work week with no weekends, then this is the place for you. The only con I see about this place is the starting pay. They start you off at a base salary of 35k and no commission for the first six months. Once the six months is up you go to 18k base pay plus commission and I got to say the bonus structure is awesome.  The problem is it takes about  9 months before you start making good money. (when I say good money I mean at least 50 to 60k). For most people  it takes about a year before you start seeing 80k or more consistently. But once you get there you stay there. The office has about 250 A.E.'s. About 150 of them have been there less than a year and are making the 35k (6 mos or less) or anywhere from 50 to 80k. The rest of them that have been there more than a year are all making a 100k or more and there is about 5 guys in the office making 500k or more."

1550,,One Company who truly invests in their people!!!,2014-11-04,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"United Shore is a great company to work for.  Many people who work here may not know the true behind the scenes efforts that are put into making sure that employees are happy.  We have officers' lunches where four people are paired up with a company officer, not just an officers assistant but the officer to talk openly about some of the issues, suggestions, feedback,etc.  Also the head leaders like our CEO and the Founder Jeff Ishbia goes around and personally thanks his employees for a job well done.  I remember the biggest storm we had this year in January where businesses actually shut down because of the weather.  The founder came to my desk and personally thanked me for driving through the snow and the bitterly cold weather just to be here! Where do they do that at???? Not to mention all the events that our marketing team does here daily, weekly, monthly, and yearly.  Our summer picnic was in Birmingham where we had the entire fair for our families to attend.  Our holiday parties are always elaborate, last year I was in the front of the stage looking up at Boyz II Men, yep I said it Boyz II Men.  They were hired to perform at our company holiday party...I wonder who we will have this year?  I've worked at many companies where speaking to your immediate supervisor was impossible but here our CEO has an open door policy.  I've gone into his office on several occasions just to run some ideas past him.  He didn't tell me to get out or come back, he closed the door, stopped what he was doing and listened, and from our conversation...something was done about what we discussed.
This is also a great company to work for as you can truly get your start and experience here.  The opportunity for advancement is great whether you are here or somewhere else.  You will be prepared to enter your career field confidently just from the experience you get here! I could go on and on, but I'll stop.",I think there is a lot of money invested in the employees and sometime people just don't appreciate it.

They also offer complimentary valet service but they are reckless.,"There are too many con’s to list however I will list some in an effort to help future employees from making the wrong decision of coming here. First of all the company will tell you what you want to hear directly from the beginning even during the interview. It’s extremely easy to acquire a position at this company especially in IT because of the high turnover rate. All of the mid and senior level management were hired from competing organizations (a majority of Flagstar and Quicken Loans) as they do not promote from within for these high level positions. They do an extremely poor job of training, support, documentation, and mentoring. They do not value performance as they do not have a proper method to track anything and they do not consider seniority whatsoever. Do not believe the deceiving reviews by the company’s marketing team as a plot to improve the company’s image. United Shore has had a bad image in the local area for a while and they plan to terminate many IT employees again at the end of this year to cut costs. Truly consider your options and level of desperation before interviewing or regrettably accepting a position at this organization."

They promise overtime in the interview, but you will actually get in trouble by management if you work over 40 hours and don't clock out exactly at 8 hours per day. Also if you have outstanding loans you need to review for that day and its already 5 o'clock, you will have to stay after 5 o'clock and complete them WITHOUT getting paid for that time, I repeat WITHOUT PAY, regardless of how many loans you worked on for that day. 

Management insists on you to call brokers who have loans with you to speed up the process, even though brokers have no submitted any new information for you to review, makes 100% sense I guess., so they can ""close"" more per day. You have weekly tests on current policies and procedures, which is good...... but they actually fired someone for failing a test before. You feel worried everyday that you could loose your job. If you have 3 straight months with an error rate higher than 5%, you will be canned 100%. Colleague of mine got canned for this, even though some of the errors made on the loans were from Senior Underwriters......unreal. 

It is almost impossible to get your bonuses, I only know of 2 people that got them on my team of 23. Its a quality bonus of $3,000 per 6 months. You will never get a production bonus, because there aren't enough loans to go around. They over-staff the underwriting department with people that don't know what they are doing and with team leads that are nowhere to be found .

Bottom line they want you to come in thinking they have these great pillars, which sound great if only people followed them, and then they work you to death making you feel like it’s your fault for not meeting expectations that are unrealistic until you realize that no one is meeting the expectations. They micromanage, belittle and embrace you into working unpaid overtime so you can meet their goals and then once you can’t take it anymore, because you can’t work 12 hour shifts every day of the week, they hire a new wave of employees to replace the ones that are sick of their B.S. don’t buy into their B.S. You have to sign non competes and the owner is a big shot lawyer that has his son running the show. I should’ve listened to the senior underwriter next to me when she told me to “get out now” my first week of work. She left and everybody that leaves ends up with higher paying jobs and are loving their life compared to this place.  Do yourself a favor and look somewhere else. This place looks good on paper and they say all the right things but has no substance or soul. I’m currently looking for another job and seriously considering leaving before I find one because the treatment here is just unbearable. P.S. I love underwriting just not here."

Testing directly after the meeting and the following Monday these test are poorly written and often contain incorrect answers which defeats the intent of knowledge retention. Upper Management promotes those who are in their social circle. The culture is such that  popularity out ways performance. Upper management rewards their often weaker Account Executive friends  with producing money making accounts . It gets better then they prop them out in the weekly meetings as being the model AE who followed the direction of management and achieved success. Smoke and mirrors company that you must learn to maneuver through. We have hundreds of non producing accounts.

UWM will continue to get more business and grow, so long as their turn times stay shorter than anyone else (until the recent market change). 

This company may be a perfect fit for you. It just isn't for me. I'll be giving notice soon. Do your homework and make a truly informed decision for yourself.","You're sold by the recruiter of making SOOOOO much money (You'll be making like $350k a year is what your told. It is more like, you will make $40-60k a year and become friends with management and make more OR you will get frustrated and quit because the magic beans didn't work out). Compensation is declining for most all sales employees. The company has figured out how to give AE's a pay cut without telling them flat out. If any clients (brokers) submit loans that are missing the smallest of things (the company does not publish or provide a list of defined items), you are simply sent an email of everything from the _______ document is not clear (not true in most circumstances, sometimes it is), or in many other ways let known that the file is not compliant upon submission. BTW, these are employees in India not familiar with the mortgage business. If this happens AT ALL, your commission is cut between 5% to 25% and simply murmured to you my management. There are no reports to substantiate any supporting facts, etc. The company's stance is that it is YOUR (Acct. Exec.) fault that this took place, that you didn't train your brokers correctly.  While this is unfortunately legal, it's just plain deceptive, dirty, and wrong.   In short, you're going to work hard, but your paycheck depends on your ability to have your clients uniformly submit FNMA or FHA Compliant Audit ready files.

The PRO of having Valet became a CON when the Valet guys started losing keys, got caught doing doughnuts in someone’s car in the back. Another didn't know how to drive a stick and messed up my clutch. His response – “I think there’s something wrong with your car”. 

Some of the new perks are valet (for some employees), expensive dry cleaning pick up and drop off, a mini mart with higher than gas station prices, and an onsite cafeteria and gym (both cost slightly discounted rates for subpar food and services). 

I’ve been an AE for REAL wholesale lenders. This one’s a joke. Account Executive is a fancy title for Customer Service Rep. Even though it’s advertised they want experience, what they really want is a mindless LO from Quicken, so they can impress their perspective of the mortgage industry FYI – most of the company, including management has never worked anywhere but UWM. They don’t know what the true mortgage world or what world class service is. They just use words like that paired with gimmicks for marketing sake. They prefer you have no skill or ability, so that you can berate brokers with the “UWM way” of doing things. Your job is to call and harass mortgage brokers until they send you a loan. When they finally do, your job is to tell them what they did wrong and why they can’t have the promised service that you told them so much about. Inexperienced, unintelligent underwriters make constant mistakes that you will have to answer for on a daily basis. Management coaches AE’s to again, let the broker know what they did wrong in the situation. These activities are micromanaged beyond belief. 

You will get hit for PTO for every minute you are not there during your assigned hours, BUT you don't get any overtime for the extra minutes and hours you work more than your standard hours. You are not truly salaried (by definition of MI labor law), as they present. A lot of their new undocumented labor policies are legally questionable, at best. 

You are given old broker accounts (most accounts have been through 5-8 inexperienced AE’s using their newly learned used car salesman hard sale techniques.). Some are ok, most are bad. Proven good producing, new, and/or large accounts are ONLY reserved for friends of management Management will deny this over and over, no matter how obvious.  Skill and ability mean nothing at UWM.  It’s the same 5 AE's that make money every month. All given the golden cup, handed down from management to future management.  A lot of the seasoned AE’s are actually great people. The rest are brash, uninformed, and incapable of making it anywhere else. Maybe AT&T will hire them when the rates go further up. 

The only consistent thing with management is constant contradiction, lots of it. This comes from inexperienced management unfamiliar with fast growth and how to handle it. 
They continue to grow in a market where the expression of ""all boats float in a rising tide."" The integrity of Bernie Madoff is where they will struggle when the tide rolls out. 

The marketing dept. is the true shining gem of this company and the only reason it continues to grow. They are truly talented in being able to market and publish the ""positives."" Unfortunately, this is nothing more than another greedy mortgage company getting too big for itself, too quick, and screwing the employees.

I've done ""ok,"" so far. but I don't think I can handle this ridiculousness much longer."
1583,,Marketing Assistant Review,2013-02-13,5.0,Marketing Assistant,"I started to work at UWM about 4 months back and I feel at home. I never imagined that I would land a job in a fast growing company, with always ready to help staff. On my first day I remember being scared as to what they expected of me, but as soon as I entered my desk area, my team was there to support me. I have heard from many of my friends who currently started work that they were left alone to learn things and weren’t really paid much attention. Not my team! They made sure I had everything I would need and as time went on showed me what I needed to do. I didn’t get training as such, but I was taught different aspects of the business as things occurred. Sometimes that is the best way to learn. I would recommend UWM to anyone who has a willingness to try new things and has an open mind. It’s a place where your ideas are heard and implemented, and rewards are exceptional.",Not one day is ever the same. There is a lot of work to do and the time goes by fast. Sometimes I don’t even realize when Friday arrives. It’s crazy busy! Maybe that is a good thing?

1587,,It is a very pleasurable work environment.,2011-12-06,5.0,Account Executive,UWM offers individuals with experience in the mortgage industry the capability to earn a good living while mantaining a life outside the office.  This is a rarity in the mortgage business.,It is a very faced paced environment in which change is a constant.  It sometimes can be hard to get a clear definitive answer as to what the correct answer to a question is.
