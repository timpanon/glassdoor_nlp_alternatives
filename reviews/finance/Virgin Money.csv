PMO governance is very watered down & is more of a project support rather than PMO. Roles and responsibilities across the Bank are very obscured, each business area has different ways of working and when you try to align to a single way of working/source of truth, it is usually spoken about but never implemented.

Merged staff are like clueless headless chickens putting their necks on the line to make customers happier about money!! We are constantly updating red passbooks - these need to go!! This is a waste of time and company money, not environmentally friendly at all and during lockdown saw older more vulnerable customers coming into store unnecessary for a pointless interest update, treating the experience as a day out during a global pandemic!! Training is on the job, every store has multiple vacancies, staff are off with mental health, most stores are still closed on Saturdays apart from a few. Our store has just two staff members running the store with very little help from management. Yet we are still open six days a week on full hours. Staff are under pressure to tick boxes from above. Management dont know how to do the job and tell you to read a manual or guide off the intranet. In the end you frantically have to call buddy stores for simple help instead of management guiding you.

Although the back end systems can be a bit antiquated the colleague facing stuff is pretty good.","Since the CYBG takeover - the senior management layer have been largely neglected with redundancies taking place at the levels above and a desire to reduce senior management population means there are few opportunities for SMs on £60-£90k to see a direction into 6 figures and a more senior role - there's simply no opportunity to do this anymore.

It's impossible to do anything remotely interesting in the digital space due to an insane risk aversion culture and leadership who seemingly have no idea what they're doing. Not to mention the complete lack of resource and over-reliance on third parties. Don't get me wrong, there are some really talented people working here who want to do good work, but actually being able to do good work is close to impossible. Most of the best digital talent has either been made redundant or have simply chosen to leave (without any sign of being replaced). Redundancies seem to be leaderships favourite thing as well. All in the name of ""being efficient"" and ""setting ourselves up for success"". But I've watched some of the most talented leaders I've ever worked with made redundant and replaced with people who don't have a clue. Clearly no care for actual expertise and driving real change and more interest in giving the in-crowd a leg up.

No user research is done to create good and well designed products. More emphasis and where you get in trouble is in this bit for not completing internal systems/updates, or attending a million project boards a day rather than looking at the customer design and journey and enhancing this. They talk about the customer in brand or marketing, but this is all rubbish - it is the most un customer focussed brand i have ever worked for.

120,Virgin Money,Prepare to be Treated as a Resource,2021-02-13,3.0,Technology Consultant,"Some of the most genuine and heartfelt people in banking work at Virgin Money.
There's real ambition to make things better for customers, with a slight underdog mentality, despite all the big bold Virgin branding everywhere.
Company ""wellness account"" lets you claim back on purchases of things like exercise classes, marathon entries, and fitness equipment. You can also add things like private dental cover to your company health insurance. The offerings have improved every year.
You get to build things that hundreds of thousands of people may use.
Great opportunities for those who know their trade to make a real positive impact.","There's a mass exodus going on in Digital Solutions. Even new hires become jaded with the culture and lack of any improvement in work-life balance. This leads to a brain drain where nobody really knows how anything works or came to be.

The business is a huge case study in Tech Debt. A simple change can easily consume months of your life, you will see things.

There's a lot of ""Management Theatre"" going on. Your technical opinion will be asked for, considered, and then ignored or overruled halfway down the line. As your teams' project inevitably runs over-time and over budget, more and more different job titles from the upper-echelons will start joining your meetings, as if their presence will somehow fix everything. Back in the old days of office working, it wouldn't be uncommon to see multiple managers gather around a poor developer's machine expecting to see some kind of CSI hacker montage as bug after bug falls in their wake. There's just a general lack of competence in understanding how to build technology products. 

Agile adoption is largely smoke and mirrors. Most Business Analysts and Project Managers have just re-labelled their old process. They just want tickets closed at all costs. The upper echelons who control the funding don't really seem to understand the Agile process either, so by-in-large end up forcing things to be planned and estimated the old way. Agile just means sooner, right?

You'll get daily emails and announcement messages about how important it is to take a break and go outside. Developers and Designers aren't really given the chance to do that though because they're constantly on the clock or being pulled into field questions by other managers. Executive level or financial role colleagues seem to have a wonderful time though. The more useful you prove yourself to be, the more likely you'll be swarmed with requests that aren't even to do with your area, or part of your weekly Timesheet.

Due to all the Tech Debt, don't expect to be using the latest and greatest of anything.

Lots of 3rd-party agency contractors with *very* mixed levels of technical and soft skills. They work their contractors to different standards, which can often be very awkward."

- Nice colleagues, you can build real relationships within the company.

- Interesting work, every day is a different one. 

- some nice benefits, pension scheme, private medical care etc","- Pay is extremely poor for the amount of work requested, no chance of a salary review or advancement. Job roles feel clichy and not based on experience/ability in your role. People have been made managers who don't even understand the role. 

- Work from home set up has been a disaster, people on the office have been told to stay there. No plans for home working, those working at home are missing things they need, such as phones. This has caused a divide in the business because the company spends money on silly things and is poor at planning. 

- your opinion doesn't matter, no one will listen, only objection handle you.

- The business prefaces that the customers matter most, however we don't reflect that on what we do and its a ""get the numbers out"" approach, which not only is poor for the customer, the employees get punished in quality because they didn't so something that they might have with more time. 

- Management doesn't understand the morale in their department and instead of challenging directly, we get emails that are just a load of nonsense about nothing."

Collaboration comes easily and there is a great sense of being on the same journey as other colleagues. Most colleagues are willing to take the time to do a favour, and junior staff have a voice.

There appears to be no expectation to work more than your core hours, with senior managers encouraging against it, however many people do it anyway. I've always seen this as a sign that colleagues are invested in the firm's vision (although do worry that senior management takes it for granted).

The cons feel temporary (even though quite a long period of temporary).","Cost-cutting has come high up the business' agenda for the last 18 months, and I'd expect this to continue for another year. This means good ideas often can't be actioned. Technology is also very dated, or with shiny tools being built on top of dated infrastructure. This can mean that colleagues don't have the tools to do the job.

Fair pay and remuneration can become a challenge, as quite often the salary colleagues joined the company on will remain the same until they are promoted, which with an outlook of cost cutting means that I'd expect this to continue for the short term. The performance Management framework is geared to rate 98% of colleagues as the same, this means there is no extrinsic reward for working hard / excellence."

200,Virgin Money,Use it as a stepping stone for short term plan,2019-12-27,3.0,Analyst,"Good pension contributions and holidays.
If your a band A or B (dont have the title manager in job spec)  you get 25 days annual leave plus you can buy upto 10 days. If your a manager you get 30 days annual leave and can buy 5 days. You also get the bank holidays too.","Personally, everything is harder than it needs to be. Before joining CYBG/Virgin Money I read the reviews on GlassDoor and my gut feeling was this was an ""OK"" company to work for before accepting the job. Nearly 6 month in my option is still same. In my role, I was sold something completely different to what is reality. There has been alot of changes over the last few months within the bank but the general vibe I hear from people is no one know what there actual job role is vs what was sold to them on the job spec. With the integration programme I would like to assume they would do an overall review of the workforce as it seems like they replace people like for like when they leave rather than assessing if they need to backfill that resource or not.

Few things to call out which dont meet what you are told in the interview. 
The workforce is around 85/15 in favour of contractors, this in itself is dangerous operating model because turn over can/is very high meaning hand overs of hand overs usually get quite messy and key information is missed. 

Also if you get a laptop, you dont have access to WiFi, you need to be connected to a LAN cable all of the time unless you get a RAS token which you can order but you need to fight hard to get one as they cost £200 per person.
 
I think VM are pushing for a more sustainable permanent staffing model hence why you will see alot of jobs being advertised in 2019/20/21 however it's worth noting that the average retention of perm staff is around 18-24 months before they move externally again. 

If you are offered a role at CYBG, use it as a stepping stone to either move up or sideways to move up else where. There is progression internally but you will face the same uphill struggle in other departments."

227,Virgin Money,Delusions of grandeur,2019-07-10,1.0,Banking Associate,Colleagues are either intentionally or unintentionally hilarious to work with,"Virgin Money is one of those companies who believes themselves to be much more important than they actually are. Spouting numerous boasts about innovation and 'customer journeys', the company is in fact hugely outdated and superficially focussed. Instead of pinpointing a product that could actually be useful and competitive in 2019, they prefer to flit from one internal fad to another on an almost daily basis; gushing over travel insurance sales on Monday and pushing for business accounts on Tuesday. There is very little direction in the company, with many employees spending hours upon hours sending self-obsessed emails about how productive they've been or how much they have achieved (most of them fit along the lines of 'I opened a door for a customer and they ended up thanking me - what a relationship we had!') Instead of developing apps or modern incentives to bring in customers, management drag their feet with false promises and half-way houses of compromise (who on earth would want to travel to a physical bank these days to send £5 to their mate's current account?)

Implementing a new 'tracker' or 'staff sales game' (outdated spreadsheets or power points) every shift - it's clear that the company has no clue what it is doing and wastes countless hours on fickle, clunky projects. Many of these 'incentive' based strategies are incredibly patronising and ugly - 'sales = items for a fictional pool party' etc. 

Alongside this, management constantly remind you that we are not in the business of sales - then contradicting themselves 20 minutes later when asking what bolt-ons you were able to push. 

In short, the company is far too focussed on patting themselves on the back and pretending banking is fun and fair. There should be far more support in place from management when it comes to developing or implementing systems, and far less concern with fickle solutions."

> Blatant occurences of bullying, which bizarrely sees those impacted pushed out and the bully promoted.
> Far too much of internal resources tied up in integration work
> Too many people promoted well beyond their experience, eg individuals promoted into Business Change Leads / Senior Analyst roles with very limited or no previous project experience but leading teams with many years experience in project delivery and subject matter experts, then ignoring advice provided. This means relying on the information supplied by analysts rather than their BCLs / SBAs as the information is otherwise poor or inaccurate

The managers have no idea what a non-managers does, ask them a question and you are passed off to a knowledgable colleague.

VM’s rating system rewards selfishness - colleagues that help customers and colleagues are been constantly been told off for wasting time.
Whilst a colleague that closes tasks (incorrectly) and passes them on will be rewarded as they have high productivity.

Managers and TLs constantly reward colleagues who “faces fit”, even to a point that their family members are favoured over more experienced and worthwhile colleagues.

I could list more, but read the other reviews that rate the company at 1/2 will agree and expand on my criticisms."

Remuneration does not fall in line with inflation or cost of living and it doesnt seem to matter how hard you work or which objectives you hit.
There is little in the way of strategic direction from the board, all of whom seem far too comfortable deciving colleugues and dangling carrots while creaming the lions share of the profits. 
A disorganised and chaotic atmosphere ensues throughout. Technology is aincient with terms such as ""mainframe"" and ""cobol"" being commonplace. Much of the infrastructure is way overdue for replacement with end of life software and hardware all over the place and unaccounted for. In my opinion this is down to the caliber of tech support support staff and managers which I've found particularly poor, by far the worst I've ever experienced in my career. 
The working environment and facilities are just awful too. I've lost count of how many times I've had to report the smell of raw sewage and lack of proper ventilation.

All whilst the incompetent managers blather on about ‘heartfelt service’ whilst ignoring the desperately overworked and unhappy staff."
317,Virgin Money,"Good pay and benefits, poor management",2018-01-07,3.0,Customer Service Assistant,"I worked at the Gosforth (Newcastle) head office, which is quite modern and has good facilities such as on-site gym, bank branch, canteen, chill-out room, and even pool tables and arcade machines.

The pay seems to be slightly higher than average for a basic office job, and the company pension was one of the best I've seen at this level, with the company adding another 2x your contribution (e.g. if you pay in 3% of your salary, they'll add another 6% on top).

If you like overtime, then the Processing departments generally have it on offer constantly. Unfortunately this also seems to be a requirement for any sort of promotion.","Management, especially at the team leader level, can be very poor. This is part of a bigger problem that the company have with legacy staff, some of whom were promoted to team leader level or higher during Northern Rock's boom times with little regard for whether they were qualified to do the job. This has left a lot of people either in roles they really aren't any good at, or being paid their old management-level wage despite now being back in an entry-level job.

Another related problem is the 'cliquey' nature of the company, especially in the Processing departments where I worked. If you're quiet, a bit of an introvert, don't work copious amounts of overtime, or don't constantly toe the company line, then you'll have a hard time progressing or even getting listened to, no matter your achievements or ideas. If you've got the gift of the gab or are friendly with the managers, then you can get yourself heard (and promoted) no problem. Time and time again people seemed to be given jobs based purely on how much overtime they could work or how popular they were, with factors such as past performance or competence ignored.

This is of course true of many other companies, but in a bank that professes to be different than the others and open to new ideas, they really should be doing something to tackle this culture. Sadly in the years I worked there, I saw no change in this area, not helped by the legacy staff issues (with lots of old school thinking) mentioned above.

Despite moves to improve the IT infrastructure in the last year, the software in most areas is woefully out of date. Up until 2016, many computers were still running Office 97, and the main mortgage processing software dates from 15-20 years ago. A large number of processes are still very manual, leading to some boring and repetitive roles if you're unlucky. Having seen the internal IT, I am not at all surprised that VM are well behind other banks when it comes to online banking.

One other thing, if you have expectations of a vaguely 21st-century social environment in the workplace, the Processing departments probably aren't for you. They may have a majority of female team leaders, but the conduct of some of the men would've got them fired long ago from more modern companies, and many of the women seem quite happy in their role as the butt of all manner of Bernard Manning style 'jokes'."

No wonder they have a problem reaching out to younger generations.

Was my first job out of uni, I ended up with horrible and ungrateful managers, they treated me so badly that I almost got my contacts for national papers involved. 
My manager was a bully, and tried her hardest to shred my confidence apart because I got on with the team and the team hated her. She made out nothing I did was good enough but then always gave me more to do. 
Being on the grad scheme you would want to get involved with the team, but she just made me do her work for her- which she made up as she went along.

Absolutely no focus on getting the basic things right, investment goes on the CEO's vanity projects and not on fixing the things that cause customers and colleagues so many problems.

Newly appointed Executives are dumping their shares at the earliest point possible, this does not breed confidence. 

There are huge issues with legacy salaries which means that the guy sat next to you could be earning twice your salary to do the same job - not very motivational. On top of this last year's profits were up but bonuses were down and the exec team were too gutless to explain why. 

A great number of the Senior Management team are incompetent or totally corrupt. Luckily for the female managers who fall in to these categories, the CEO has set targets on women in senior positions so they are now untouchable. 

Doing the right thing and putting your hand up when something goes wrong puts you in a position of weakness so it's best to cover your backside or blame somebody else. What a great culture.

Things have become worse after the IPO and CEO panic around share price creates regular havoc with day to day running of the business.

There is no investment in infrastructure and systems that will help this bank stand out. Most of the computers still run on Windows XP and the mortgage platform dates back to the pre crisis Northern Rock era. Processes are manual and antiquated.

Branson can write articles and posts on LinkedIn etc about value of employees and people and its importance but it is all lip service and the reality is complete opposite. Everyone is afraid to speak out. Branson visits the bank once in year and it is just a selfie opportunity for people."

Saturday working is every other Saturday and is included in your wage - No overtime pay.  A bit like a headless chicken when it comes to leadership.  The new initiatives come thick and fast and with little forethought.  The stores are run with very low staff numbers so getting time off is a battle.

New CEO should turn things around and point the company in the right direction.","Overly complicated company structure, unclear reporting lines (I have 4 managers).
Very high workload, contracted for 35hrs but expected to do 50hrs each and every week just to tread water.
Little reward or recognition
There is a culture of blame, the higher you go the less likely they are to except outstanding and historical issues.
There is a lot of dead wood in the company, people who have been there for 10/15/20 years doing the same job, the same way with no desire to drag the company into the 21st century"

On-site amenities (mostly inherited from Northern Rock) are convenient. The benefits package is typical of a big employer, but not worth the unhappiness of working there in my view.","Everything! The CEO and Management Team are awful, disingenuous people that are out for themselves, have no compassion or humanity for real people and are hiding behind the Virgin brand and a whole load of bullsh*t messages that they don't even try to live up to. 

I can't believe it hasn't hit the fan there yet to be honest, and that's only because there's a culture of genuine fear of expressing or even holding in secret, a negative opinion of the place."
423,Virgin Money,Virgin on the ridiculous!,2015-10-14,1.0,Analyst,Pension. A good bunch of people working at the coalface. There are decent facilities at head office. Great PR and the brand really holds up the company. Not much else really...,"Where to start? No work life balance. This company takes the virgin brand and shows it for what it really is: all style no substance. 

Shareholders are taking their money and running, so are the staff! If you worked there you'd see the stuff that goes on that the public never see, really shady stuff. In fact, how some of the things don't make it to the public eye seems a little bit sinister to me.

There is no strategy nor direction. This is because the CEO is too busy with her own ego (being a celebrity and all) to care too much about the success of the company beyond the glorious shareholders. Also, there is no flexibility in the company structure because the CEO runs the company like a middle manager would, not like a CEO. Fred the Shred's right hand woman indeed.

As for the pay, well it's ok if you can negotiate a good salary on joining the company or are a contractor. But if you're a long serving member of staff or don't have another bank (RBS) on your cv then you may as well resign yourself to 1% payrises if you outperform. None if you don't.

Don't believe the hype if you're thinking about joining as a career. Speak to people who've worked there, and read reviews! I see other review sites have glowing reviews, however I'd advise caution, these are likely to be shills as VM has a dedicated team who are in charge of 'external communications' (pr) and actively review their own company. See for yourself, they are usually on employment agency websites.

Formerly working in an area that influenced the short and long term business aims, I can see that this company is really on a knifedge, however knowing the brand it will probably end up ok because the public lap it up (amazing pr).

I wish I could say more, but I really don't have the strength anymore, this is such a letdown of a company"

425,Virgin Money,Sad to see,2015-08-13,2.0,,"Decent pension and benefits to choose from. Add in up to 6% and Virgin Money will add in the same, giving you 12% annual contributions. To others and third parties, having a recognisable name like Virgin Money on your CV can count for a lot.","Mirroring what other reviewers have said, if your face fits, you play the game, and you have RBS as a previous employer, you might actually have an opportunity. Otherwise, you are pushed from pillar to post, treated abysmally and given little option but to get on with it. 

The HR department have no integrity, going straight to management regarding colleagues concerns. 

The management are excellent at working with HR to orchestrate roles, interviews, job changes, all to suit the main objective which seems to be employing as many of their friends from former employment as possible. 

The change function is a joke, and is seen as an ironic name for a department so wrapped in it's own importance it fails to address underlying issues with colleague engagement (which by the way is being taken out for a single beer, two weeks before engagement surveys come out) poor infrastructure, lacking technology upgrades and with seven different layers of management. 

Poor colleague morale in most lower graded departments, particularly Operations and IT. 

Little opportunity for promotions - poor career paths etc. 

Being truthful and pragmatic is generally frowned upon."
426,Virgin Money,Local culture vs organisational culture,2015-08-04,3.0,Anonymous Employee,It is a great place to work when in the right team; the work life balance is excellent and the relatively small size of the organisation means opportunities to get access to senior people is great.,Management hubris is often present and a tendency to blame failings on prior leadership while making the same mistakes happens.

Neither side of the company trusts the other, sometimes with very good cause.  Complete lack of external training.

436,Virgin Money,EBO - Executives Better Off,2015-06-02,1.0,Risk Analyst,The offices have great facilities with an onsite subsidised gym and great coffee shop and plenty expensive fish tanks to stare at if you so wish.,"CEO runs a dictatorship with some 'inner-circle' friends on huge pay with massive bonuses. The real staff are treat with contempt, forced into real term pay cuts even when performing well in their jobs. Cost cutting for staff is bordering on insanity as the Executives refuse to embrace the company motto of 'Everyone's better off', enforcing these cuts whilst they all take home millions each (check the 2014 accounts if you don't believe me).

The risk department is ran by faceless, ex RBS mannequins who'll stab staff in the back at the first opportunity. An awful atmosphere has staff morale at rock bottom, reports of management bullying staff, threatening staff, with a constant stream of long term sick and even people managed out of the business. 

Don't speak up or your life will be made a misery.

Has a very obscure view of delivering change which is built on a broken recharge model forcing projects to do the bare minimum at the detriment of doing the right thing.

Culture is more inclusive and less aggressive than most banks. Staff care about their work and will strive to do well. Most staff are allowed to work as they like provided that they deliver results. Management are pragmatic and approachable.,Bank's direction is unclear. It's difficult to achieve anything due to complicated procedures and lack of capacity. Staff cuts have left many areas overstretched and you can expect to work long hours to compensate. Long term prospects are uncertain because parent bank NAB are planning to exit the UK.
