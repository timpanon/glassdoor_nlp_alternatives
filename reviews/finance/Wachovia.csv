Opened checking account for customer with temporary license (account was opened with cash deposit, no withdraw allowed for funds beyond initial cash deposit until presentation of permanent license.

As a full-time college student, they made me write a written statement, just stating that I chose school over working. (Like, c'om seriously?).  They litterally sat me down to pick out my school schedule for me.  Instead, I just turned in a written two weeks notice."

The immediate supervisors I had were great teachers of the position.","The commitment to customer service was ostensibly driven by employees who are experts in working with clients but it was more about working the system.

If you have any hesitation about selling a financial product, this is not the position for you.  Before 2008, the focus was understanding your customer, knowing their goals and objectives and then matching those needs to a product.  That changed as the banking environment deteriorated to using double-talk to sell product first, grabbing customers, and worrying later about the connection to their financial situation.

The technology in the branches was terrible.  Very old computers and software made things painfully slow."
