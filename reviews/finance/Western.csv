I'm part of WUBS and am being sold off, thank goodness. They took credit for a MasterCard deal that Western Union had nothing to do with. They are selling the future of the company. After the sale is complete, you will see the new CEO get rid of 25% of executives. All EVPs will be gone along with the leadership. That's how bad they are. 

Look at the stock price. Look at it. This company grows by increasing dividends. They have nothing to offer and were asleep at the wheel while fintechs ate their lunch. Sure, Transferwise is tiny compared to WU, but give them time. They'll take over.

So sad to see what could have been a tremendous company go down the drain."

This shows the inefficiency of the management who designed a strategy so as a junior-level employee had to cost his job within 3 months of joining.
They gave me a 2 hours notice to sign the exit paper or else threatened to terminate me without giving the compensation for the month. 
It was a personal trauma for me and still did not come out of it after 2 years. I perhaps will be skeptical everytime I join a new company throughout my life and will live in a fear of getting fired any fine day.

Despite being an American company you feel rather 'safe', in terms of your employment, your manager relations and overall. You don't feel that you can get fired at any time - as you could in many American companies. Pretty relaxed environment. 

Possibilities for a rather fast career - if you accept lower salaries and old-school corporate bureaucracy.","High turnover of employees creates an attitude that do not exactly encourage people to stay. Loyalty appears low, even the most dedicated colleague would constantly look for another employer. Majority of colleagues appears to be regarding the company as a career starter but nothing else.

483,,Catfished,2021-01-07,2.0,Software Engineer,"Benefits and compensation are good, technologies are interesting","Each role is different, however, when interviewing, I expressed how important a separation of work and life was in determining which company I wanted to work with, going as far as saying it was my number one priority. I was assured hours were close to normal with a Monday through Friday schedule and very occasional work that may exist outside of regular hours. Upon joining the company, which took nearly two unexpected months in normal background checks and red tape where income was lost waiting, it was immediately clear that the expectations of time included major inconsistencies including overnight weekend work, meetings as early as 5 AM and as late as after 11 PM (depending on time zone), often back to back, to account for a worldwide team.

Communication is BRUTAL as it is almost completely based on very noisy emails and the dreaded Skype for Business, making collaboration incredibly difficult. Expect access requests for basic functionality in your role to take up to three weeks as you sit and wonder if you actually even get to do your job. Expect incredibly vague definitions of work responsibilities and to generally feel in the dark about expectations.

Overall, the job that was described in interviews and the job that truly existed were very different. It would have been quite a bit easier to cut line early upon realizing this mismatch, but the nearly two month process it takes with no income to start working makes it difficult to come to that decision, so figuring out how to make it work is necessary."

Today I am celebrating one year at Western Union and to be really honest - that one year passed like one month. During this quarantine I would like to share my biggest findings:
- The team is one of the keys to your success. Meaning that you can be the best individual contributor in the world but without a good team it gets pretty hard to move forward.
- Company's culture and its' values. It is really important to identify whether your company's values coincide together with yours. It is far more satisfying to do the job when you believe in the purpose and the cause.

While some are open to change and dynamic, many are rigid. People who were relatively new, like me, would smile and roll our eyes at some of the embedded culture that made getting things done difficult. A just do it attitude wasn't evident enough. The culture and politics seemed to reward patience and bureaucracy more than entrepreneurial thinking. There have been too many ineffective reorgs and new management themes that long timers are skeptical of any new ideas. There is also excessive politics played at the higher levels, director and above. This results in people tending to guard what they say and do rather than being open and honest."

720,,"Antique clock in a digital age. No clear direction, HR terrible, outsource everything.",2019-11-19,2.0,Analyst,Casual work environment and a generally relaxed style of management. Flexible WFH options is a plus.,"Pay: US pay is based on the ""national"" pay-scale even though it is well known that the Denver cost of living is well above the national  average. When I inquired HR about this and provided published market pay studies to back up my question, all I got back was how great the benefits are, which in reality, the WU benefits are average at best for the Denver area.

HR: HR has way too much power and gets in the way of it all. Many of my coworkers have departed in the past year due to better pay, benefits, HR blocking their growth at WU and a general feeling of actually having a voice within the organization. I thought they were wrong but as it turns out, my decision to work at WU for as long as I have was wrong. My Sr Manager, Director and SVP have all approved a pay grade and title change for me as recognition of using new to WU technology to improve processes and save the company money, but HR has been pushing back on this change for 5 months now, one excuse after the other and its to the point that the SVP scheduled a meeting with me to apologize and has admitted that he himself feels as if he has no say or voice at WU anymore. Leadership preaches good hard work is rewarded but HR has some other ideas. 

Leadership: Every single sentence that comes out of the CEO/CFO's mouth starts with ""returning shareholder value""....I get it, we are publicly traded but employees are starting to feel that we mean nothing when it comes to shareholder value.

Returning value to shareholders: Outsourcing, outsourcing and more outsourcing seems to be the only way that leadership knows how to cut operating costs and in turn, all this creates is a system and data flow nightmare for all those left at HQ to deal with. If you love a non-stop stream of IT tickets being opened for reports, daily and manual process to fix data issues, and inaccessible data being processed half-way across the globe by individuals that can barely communicate with you, WU is the place for you! WU loves layoffs as well in the name of ""saving-costs""...but then we LEASE a new HQ while the old HW campus (which WU owns btw) sits barely occupied?"

People from the top down have no vision or point of view of their own and are merely executing someone else’s demands 24/7.

Because of lack of vision, escalations are frequent and misinterpretations aplenty.

People work ridiculous hours, joining calls with India as early as 8 and not hanging up for the day until midnight. Talent is subpar. It takes 20 people on a call to get a status because no one understands how to use a dashboard. Engineers are mostly in India and super junior, and need to be spoonfed what to do. The few design and product stars that have brought vision and analytical acumen to the company were never rewarded by the inept leadership and are on their way out.

It makes me angry to think how much time I’ve wasted at this company, for a fraction of the pay of a tech company.

Why because they are relentlessly laying off people every single year. I survived six different layoffs in the seven years with this company. In 2017 working for WUBS my job was outsourced to Lithuania smh I move out here to Denver just for my new position! Only for a year and ten months later to get laid off again last month.  Western Union does this to put money back on the books to show the shareholders that they're making money while the rest of us lose jobs. Western Union lacks so much innovation and leadership; it's quite pitiful. I really won't recommend anyone to work at least not long term. Even with the great benefits, the pay and lack of leadership aren't worth the headache. Better of applying to Venmo, CashApp, or PayPal."

780,,No ambitious plans; just staying alive. Is leadership trying to slow the sinking ship to sell the company?,2019-09-04,2.0,Director,"Most Western Union employees are proud of the work they do. They work very hard to “move money for matter”. That’s why Western Union has been and is still the leader in money transfer. 

People here genuinely care about doing the right thing and making sure we follow all the rules and regulations so that we move money only for the good guys and keep the bad actors out. 

I am inspired by the passion of my coworkers. They are great people to work with and I learn from them every day. 

Western Union also offers decent employee perks and benefits. It acknowledges that there is life outside of work. For example, it has an above average vacation policy and a decent 401K match program. Other unofficial benefits include discounted or free tickets to games and events and a flexible work schedule, although that can depend greatly depend on the team and its leader. The flexibility is helpful for parents with kids.

The pay is also competitive. It’s not the best paying employer (like Google or Facebook) but it by no means is cheap with compensation. Most appear to be quite satisfied with their pay.","There is a major disconnect between what the leadership says to its employees and the public, and what they actually appear to be doing on a daily basis. They are not doing this intentionally. It appears that most of them are just going through the motion because they don’t know what else to do. 

The management is not positioning the company for growth. They just want to cut costs to stop the share price from falling. Of course, they use flowery language with the media because that’s what they are paid to do.

The company has become highly dysfunctional over the years and that’s now made worse by the layoffs. Morale couldn’t be any lower. Knowledge gaps will grow when valuable employees who’ve been with the company for a long time are gone. Any near-term cost savings from reduced headcount will be offset by the operational inefficiencies. 

Some admirable CxOs take a voluntary pay cut or spend their own money to buy company stock to boost morale and demonstrate confidence during major layoffs; not Western Union leaders. Ironically, I think some of them actually sold shares recently.

WU Way that the leadership loves to talk about as the transformative agent for the company is an over-priced re-branding program. I’ve seen this show before with other companies, and it rarely ends well.

This company needs radical change and that’s not going to come from shuffling people around at the top and calling the same old thing something different only after making minor changes. 

It’s time to go big or go home."

As a remote employee, being able to plan my own work schedule, travel and and work from home was a great benefit.  Unfortunately, this also has it's own downside, even more so in the past 2 years.  The work/life balance is nonexistent so working remotely only promotes 60+/hour work weeks.  The representatives responding to posts on here mention WU being in a transition period, unfortunately the transition into exactly what, is unclear, even to its employees who have been beat to death with the ""WU WAY"" initiative. 
They also mention promoting a healthy culture but that cannot be further from the truth; to say otherwise is a fabrication.  Colleagues of mine who have 10-15+ years with the company are leaving in droves which speaks volumes.  Morale is at an all time low, the word most used by my colleagues to describe our company is ""toxic"" and it comes up in almost every conversation.  I'm not aware of anyone in my department who has not at minimum interviewed for another job or has some irons in the fire.   Most of the low morale can be attributed to unrealistic expectations, high-volume of work with constantly changing internal procedures, and poor leadership from upper-management who don't have the time nor want, to address the concerns of their personnel.     Most of the leaders who I highly respected have left the company and we're left with managers who are burned out themselves and have no drive to lead or instill any positivity into their staff.

Some good benefits,"I have written and then deleted reviews for WU for a few months thinking, why bother...I am not there anymore.  But the company is a good company that has gone down the wrong path.  The issues start at the very top with a passive board and a ceo who is checked out and isolated from his workers.  He was slow (and late) to digital and his one big bet (Business Solutions) is a billion dollar bust.  He gets paid more than 300 times the average employee, flies around in a private jet, spends large amounts of time out of the office and focuses on a political agenda over the business.  He has surrounded himself with yes men and women and does not tolerate dissenting voices.  He has a leadership team that is mostly not qualified to do anything other than sales and prop him up, a terrible HR team that schemes to distract with bogus programs (WU way) and a compliance team that is troubled.  The Board needs to step up but has not to date.  This place is deeply flawed and troubled. Morale is non-existent. Toxic is the word that pops up most in the non-HR prompted reviews on this site.  Save this once great company!"

There are serious issues with code of conduct within the US regions.   Frightening  stories and it appears senior leaders are ok with this management style.   Toxic is a word that is used to describe the work environment.   There is zero work/life balance due to the strategically created sense of fear that you will be fired if you are not always available.   The standard the US operations and sales team is held to compared to the support staff is both frightening and comical.   The support in Costa Rica, Mexico, Philippines and third party vendors is dismal.   The impact of the high turn over, lack of training and knowledge of US operations makes it impossible for sales success.   This is not a company you will feel valued, respected or should be thinking long term."

We currently offer lower commissions to prospective agents and decent exchange rates with an annoying approach to compliance that will close new agents faster than they can begin to transact. New senior management feels that the best approach to sales is an antiquated car salesman approach from the 50’s. This new leadership has no clue how to run the US Market. Micromanagement has become the norm. While sales processes and activations are a struggle and out of the sales teams hands as the enrollment process is handled by a team in costs rica that is always understaffed thanks to the WUWay.

You can be in the same position for 10 years without any natural progression in your career path. The only way to move up is to apply to a position once it becomes available. Those positions mostly are people management positions and the company seems to hire those without any proper people management skills. 

Management will also let their talented individuals leave the company without trying to keep them. Everyone seems replaceable. 

The New York office is also segregated from the rest of the company. There's minimal HR presence and no culture to be had. That office has become a very sad place to work on a daily basis. Senior Management are either fully remote or hide out in their offices. 

No product innovation. The current product and project management team keep recycling the same product based on a reactions in the industry.

The boys club network is very alive at WU, at least in compliance. Is every department in compliance like that? No, in some of them it only matters if you are willing to work tons of extra hours for no extra pay, and kiss up to certain people.
I did work with some great people here. I also worked in a position that I loved, and was very good at - only to have to leave that department and position because I was told I would never get promoted, because the Director's buddy was going to get it instead (and that my experience didn't matter). And, mine is not the first or last story to have that ending.
Finally, just know that as a compliance employee, you will be treated as a minion/peasant by the CEO and his people. After all, they all went to a brand new glitzy building, and stuck compliance a mile away in an old building that has seen better days.
Salary and bonus %'s will vary by who you know and, depending on the department in compliance, what your gender is.

To be so openly bureaucratic, status oriented and out of step with the reality of having a global workforce is extremely disappointing.  It is clear this policy has been written by someone who has likely not traveled outside of the US and would have no idea that to actually reach some parts of the business you need to take a 20 plus hour flight. The expectation that this 20 plus hour flight is taken in coach and you are then in the office the next day or same day is absurd, short sighted and will cost you valuable talent. Since when is the health and well-being of the senior executives more important than your average worker. This isn't about being precious it is very short sighted thinking to save $$$. The new policy makes no mention of providing additional time off for rest after landing from a day long coach flight. Where is the HR Leadership on this finance centric policy? Do you care about your people like you claim to? Do you care about the state of health you will place your frequent non-VP long haul travellers in and the impact this change has not just to them but to the stakeholders of the company who are relying on that employee to perform at their best while away for business - not to mention the additional burden you are placing on the families of these travellers who get returned to them a shattered family member unable to carry their family responsibilities due to their tired condition. 
Talented staff will make their own decisions about this policy, both to reject future long haul travel and unfortunately for this business with huge growth plans, they will vote with their feet and take their talent elsewhere. 
Think carefully about joining a ""Penny-wise and pound-foolish"" business like this one."

Recently lots of offshoring, stifling turnaround time on development, sync on requirements or issues, and meetings with India folks became very early in the morning or late at night. Lots of architectural dependencies on multiple systems, causing long turnaround of product launches that can bring huge value to the business. High turnover rate in staff and management. Because of this, you are constantly spending time dealing with new folks who need to be brought up to speed. Big changes with each new management that come in, without preparation ahead for the negative impacts that should be so obvious to any good leader with a brain. So either they don't care, or they are not experienced enough to foresee them. Be prepared to work with developers with no clue on how to keep the code base intact. Lots of bugs discovered during UAT phase, and often a fix breaks something else. No accountability when escalations occur, which means weak individuals stay for a long time, slowly decaying any motivation and good culture that's left out of the org.
Heavy processes set in place, too many approvals required from various stakeholders before being able to start development or before a launch. The lack of trust is warranted however. So many production bugs found should've been obvious to anyone who knows the business fairly well. Again it's caused by 1) contractors offshore with below average knowledge in the business, 2) product teams are not on the same page in terms of the user experience or prioritization of features. Expect very little before a planned release, something will come up and delay launch.
Diversity is lacking. Prepare to feel out of place if you are a hard working individual who wants to do the right things. You will work lots of hours doing ad hoc stuff for your manager that's not expected any place else, mostly because other people are not doing their jobs."

-The pay is ok for starters (0-4 years of experience), but any manager who is aggressive about career development is under paid. If one isn't a go-getter then his/her salary is probably in-line with the industry, but any go-getter who stays with WU is essentially taking a big pay cut.  An analyst role with a big firm will pay one more than a senior manager role with WU. I guess what i'm trying to say is that there isn't much advancement in terms of salary to be found at WU for a serious career minded employee. The company higher ups like to say that they conduct studies to ensure their pay is in-line with the industry, but they don't understand that top talent needs to be paid MORE than the industry. To put it simply, WU is utterly incapable of keeping top talent because they pay an average wage, and what happens when you pay top talent an average wage?

1064,,Beware of a dying company. The next Blockbuster,2017-11-18,2.0,Senior Manager,Talented workforce. Decent pay and benefits. Decent severance package when you get laid off. Nice on-site amenities that will soon go away when they sell their campus and downsize to leased space in a high rise (Red flag),"Where do I begin? 
The company is in a constant state of flux and reorganization in hopes of saving what is a company dying a slow death. 
Constant...and I mean constant...reorganizations of the business. Not only is this a problem, but the bigger problem is the reorgs involve the same leadership that is still stuck in the prehistoric retail location business model that is causing the company to die to begin with. It’s the same people in different positions. The proverbial shuffling the deck chairs on the ship mentality. No matter how you arrange the chairs...it’s still the same chairs. 
There needs to be a complete overhaul of the leadership team. That isn’t happening with the current board. Meanwhile, competitors and fintech startups offering better, cheaper, faster are rapidly eating away at WU’s market share resulting in very low single digit growth. 
In order to show growth, the company is cutting in other areas resulting in constant layoffs. Every November a d December involve mass layoffs. It’s a holiday tradition at WU. Although this year it went well into the spring. 
The company is closing offices all over the world and consolidating. The most evident is putting their global headquarters campus they own up for sale and leasing several floors of a high rise just north of their current location. Again. Cutting costs in order to show what little growth they can. 

To those interested in joining this company:
-Be ready for layoffs. Lots of them...under the disguise of the “WU Way.”  AKA how to cut costs but still be able to pay for things like million dollar building ribbon cutting events, $15m logo sponsorships with sports teams and multimillion dollar salaries for execs. 

-Be ready to deal with plenty of politics and heiarchy. It’s real at WU which operates very much in an old school heiarchal workforce model, which in turn impedes growth and decision making 

-Be ready to work for a company getting its tail kicked by competitors including PayPal, Venmo and Transferwise. WU is trying to market to millennials but missed that boat years ago. It’s only a matter of time before the majority of their migrant market is able to utilize these new services and will leave WU for better, faster, cheaper. Money transfer is becoming a commodity market and will soon go the way of how services are bought such as cable, internet and cell phones. WU can’t get in a price war because they can’t afford to...mainly because they have to keep their 550,000 locations afloat...therefore sticking to the prehistoric business model and continuing in the death spiral. 

-Be ready for lots of bosses. Turnover is real and talented execs are leaving and others constantly being forced out. 

-Be ready for lots of processes, protocols and review. Thing is it bogs down performance and getting work done. The company has launched one new website the entire year. One. And that was for Kuwait of all places 😂😂"

Fast recruiting process, relatively good facilities. 
Good choice for people who want to study, since they can fit their courses in their daily life by working night or morning shifts. 
Opportunity is given to the employees to share the knowledge they have in various fields, by having annual sessions on literally everything, and it's free.","Salary could be better, as employees who speak 2 or more of the major operational languages are required to get paid one bonus for the most ""expensive"" one, without having any extra benefits  to receive for the rest of the languages used. You can find yourself working 20% more just because you said you speak one more useful language. No extra benefits from that... So people avoid mentioning any additional skills sometimes.
Bad recruiting process, as they sometimes tend to hire in a fast-track way even people who are obviously interested to stay 4-5 months. Then these people leave and their position cannot be covered, giving extra responsibilities to the rest. 
Internal decisions and under-the-table agreements regarding promotions, where you see people that are locals getting the escalation or managing positions by simply using their PR skills or by simply being natives of the country. People are being rejected constantly when they apply for promotion, since usually the person to be promoted is decided in advance, before any interview.
Constant charity reminders where they ask from the employees to contribute for donations, which means they take from the expenses to donate. It's like saying to your 4 friends ""I am buying pizza tonight, but I have to ask from one of you to give me his part back"". Sometimes it makes you wonder if you are actually working for a big company.
There is not enough time to rest during your day offs, especially if you have 5 days in a row early morning shift from six and they give you just one day off and then again 5 in a row...

I love knowing that our core business makes a very tangible difference in people's lives all over the world. I also really enjoy the team I work with. WU has employees in over 50 countries (and does business in 200+), so thinking globally is a must. Also, after a few attempts, I feel like WU is now seeing some real traction from its heavy investments in technology and compliance capabilities. The legacy of innovation to stay not only relevant, but a market leader is impressive. Nice benefits as well (maternity/parental/military leave, etc.). Fairly casual culture, while still very performance focused.","Being a global company is a two edged sword at times. Pretty much anything you read about in the global news, impacts our business in some way. Sometimes positively (e.g. surging economies in some countries), and sometimes negatively (e.g. a soft oil market at the moment). Also, since the company is currently rapidly expanding its digital/mobile money transfer and payments strategy, there are lots of things that are still being figured out. Lot's of ambiguity at times as WU charts its course in fintech. Again some people thrive in that environment, but it's not for everyone."

They're always in the process of building new products or re-branding, but before reaching their stated goals, the direction changes. Despite the size of the company, it's difficult to move-up internally, however lateral movement is generally an option.

In engineering this is even worse; many engineers feel beholden because they have H1B visas and will be sent back to India if they don't perform. The leadership team has produced nothing after 4 years, so they're trying to make up for lost time by pressuring the workers to work harder, when there's nothing left to give.

1316,,Western Union's Executive Management and Technology Department - the competitions best friend.,2016-04-10,1.0,Information Technology,"WU is large enough to make a difference in the market.  With many capabilities to pull from, they have a foundation to deliver amazing global solutions.  With proper direction, they are currently large enough to recover from the last couple years of gross errors in technology direction and general business strategy.","WU has purged top executive/senior talent over the past few years. The common opinion, these executives proved to be competition to their leadership. This is a theme in WU, managers surround themselves with unqualified subservient employees to protect their position. New executives joined, pushing short-term, shock and awe management approaches to build personal resumes.  Time and again personal gain is selected over a concern for the customer or a lasting business strategy.  Gone were the leaders that really cared about the customers, their employees and love for the business they helped build.  

The technology industry slogan to ""fail fast"" is a misunderstood goal of the new technology department. WU acquired TGBP, along with it came top technology talent which WU was not accustom to.  Within a few short months, this team completed not only their own integration, they completed the 3 year old WU/Custom House integration. Development teams produced huge volumes of product enhancements driving the speed of business.  This creation of WUBS Technology raised the bar beyond the reach of the legacy WU Technology teams, which created a large divide.  Instead of combining proven technology trends WUBS technology teams were mostly overrun and dismantled.  WU IT Infrastructure were the least prepared for the complexities of WUBS and still struggle to understand what they manage today. In a move to build resumes and follow proven failed industry trends, core design and engineering infrastructure roles were outsourced about a year ago. The following outcomes have been realized; high cost, low flexibility, stalled innovation, poor uptime, slow issue remediation, security issues and huge teams of people that can't help the customer. A quick 24 month comparison of any area; project completion, budget, stability, security and customer and employee satisfaction is solid evidence of a failed strategy."

Work is constantly changing and there is never a dull moment!","Heavy workloads, everyone doing more with less, must be a strong game player with highly astute political savvy to thrive at HQ, several people share stories about working for narcissistic leaders and selfish jerks to the point where it simply becomes unbearable.  These leaders are very good at playing the game, managing up, taking credit for work, lying, manipulating people, and doing whatever they have to do to get ahead.  I've heard stories of how they've gotten away with sexual harassment, tarnishing reputations, gas lighting, etc..and you suddenly start to lose respect for leaders around you, that is if you happen to be working for someone who behaves this way and discover what is really happening.  It's hard to get help too, because no one will believe these things about this person.  They are just that good at covering their tracks.  Read up on narcissistic personality disorders in order to know how to cope with such a leader.  As for me, I had to take some professional hits but that is what the emotional abuse of a narcicisstic leader will do to you....and it appears as if you're the one with a mental illness/personal issues.  I really loved the work I was doing, but could no longer withstand my environment and unfortunately was not able to move to a different department.  I was fortunate enough to break away gracefully.  I am also very secure in who I am and what I stand for, so I was able to take the hits, learn my lessons, and bounce back into the next chapter of my career with zeal and high energy.  Obviously you come across these types everywhere, it is Corporate America after all.  Just be prepared for some serious political games at HQ, and if you're not in with the in crowd, you may have some challenges turning things around.  Particularly if the leader with symptoms of a narcissistic personality disorder feels slighted/disrespected in any way.  Good luck and hope you don't end up working for such people.  Everyone told me to get as far away as possible from my particular leader, who I truly admired and respected, but eventually I saw what they were talking about and got away."

Working at WU I get to talk with people all over the world and it makes me feel good when I show up for work and I know I can do something that could improve lives, make the world more connected and do some good for others in need. 
The process of starting at a new job is generally a total disaster; your computer takes days to be ready, no one talks to the ""ugly new guy"" and you have no idea what is going on. At Western Union my computer was ready when I showed up, everyone is very nice and my first line managers actually take the time to see how I am doing as well as give me guidance on expectations. I have had the chance to speak Spanish, Arabic and most people can understand my broken english (I was born and raised in Florida, so you know it can be difficult for people who didn't grow up ""redneck""). The multicultural feel is amazing I love going into the cafe and hearing all these languages it is like walking around Heathrow Airport.
My experience with WU really started some time ago, after attending a veteran's recruiting event. The recruiting staff were very engaged they called me regularly to get status updates and advocated on my behalf. I am very grateful for the opportunity and I hope to repay that kindness and professionalism with hard work.","1. They only occasionally have coconut chicken curry in the cafe (I feel like there should be a permanent curry bar section)
2. The elevators are terribly slow, good for conversation bad for being late to Skype meetings.

1365,,Great customer-focus and strategy for the future,2015-12-21,4.0,Manager,"I've worked for WU for a number of years now, and have seen the company transform to position itself well for the future. A few years ago, WU seriously stepped up its investments in technology and regulatory compliance. Those investments are now bearing fruit in terms of industry-leading capabilities in both those areas. WU is pretty unique among Fortune 500's. It's incredibly global (doing business in 200+ countries), but yet has a small enough global workforce (about 10k) that I don't feel like a small cog in an enormous machine. It's also a very purpose-driven company. I think everybody here feels proud about the impact our business has for good in the world. Lots of companies have a ""side focus"" on how they ""give back"" to the community. For WU, the very nature of our business, has a powerful impact for good, as people send money to each other across borders and currencies. Money that helps fund housing, medical care, education, etc. Overall, a great company to work for.","As with most companies I've been a part of, there is some level of bureaucracy and politics to navigate.  I feel like some improvements could be made to ensure individual performance is assessed/rewarded more fairly. Also, there is no shortage of great, bold ideas. The challenge for WU, at times, has been executing on those ideas and sticking it through to completion. One factor influencing execution seems to be a tendency toward being a bit risk-averse. It makes sense to some degree, since WU's business is moving money across borders and currencies in a safe, compliant way. However, I think there is opportunity to be more open to embracing learning through the iterative process and truly celebrating individuals who go out on an educated limb, even when an idea doesn't work out at first."

There are a number of staff that have been with WU for over 40 years, so a long career there is possible.  Depending on your position, there may be opportunities for international assignments and travel.  WU is a very ethical company and emphasizes protecting customers and being compliant with all laws.","WU has a reputation for lots of layoff waves.  Fortunately, they have a great severance package that softens the blow and makes employees more willing to ride out the uncertainty rather than bail out for new opportunities.  Some management and upper management are uncertain of WU's long-term viability in the face of all the new payment options.  Montvalle NJ office staff is always in fear of office closure/outsourcing, though complete closure seems unlikely given the systems expertise in that location.

They have a gym in house if you love working out (if not get in that habit, its easier to deal with bad environment if your body is healthy).","The people in managerial role (sr manager and up) would not be in that position had it been Amazon / Google. You have a leadership that believes in putting pressure instead of being hands on and helping. Since promotion is based on rear-end kissing, the person at bottom of pyramid is often abused, over worked, and humiliated when things go wrong (symptoms of increasing work and no hiring). With min technical knowledge, the heavy lifting is done by the foot soldiers and the upper management only delegates with no hands on helping when things are difficult. So ensure that you stand up to the bully. If you don' then you'll be crushed. The environment encourages bully supervisors and it is up to you to watch yourself.  Also, do not expect any training or smooth transition to be up to speed. This shouldn't be surprising if promotion is purely based on favoritism rather than actual people's skill. Do not expect a change of roles / project. You'll most likely be stuck doing grueling work on the same project because there would be no one hired to free up your time. Most importantly, DO NOT be stuck for more than 2 years especially if you are starting your career. Always be on the look out for better opportunity."

By the time it is implemented you can be on to your next job.  For those who are offered a job - focus on base salary.  Do not get caught up in promises of bonuses/commissions.  The executive management will change the plan if there is a risk that they will not make their bonus.  You want as high of a base salary as possible.  Bonus/commission should strictly be an after thought.","This division of Western Union is such a mess that it is very possibly going to be sold.  My guess is to private equity.  So if you have the flexibility to get in and out, it would be a wonderful feather in your resume.  Some think a con would be the management, but that it actually a pro in this environment.  You simply must do what they say without question and praise them.  Concentrate on a high base salary.  Do not accept promises of future raises and large commission and bonus.  They do not materialize.  What you get in your initial agreement is it and get it in writing.  You need to go into this environment with your eyes wide open.  It should be viewed as short term.

If you complain you get labeled as a bad employee and you get retaliated against. My manager has actually been keeping information on policy changes from me so I can't do my job properly.

The internal politics of the organization is absurd, brown nosing counts for far more than anything else in getting ahead. The above manager actually received an internal commendation for his ""good work"".

Another manager promised me extra training and career development if I took on extra work. Afterwords, the manager had miraculous amnesia. Next time this manager promised it, I asked for it in writing. He absurdly denied having ever made the promise, that he had just made.

The same manger above claimed that he knew of no plans for layoffs. A few months latter, it turns out that sure enough he was aware of planned layoffs.

Upper management is in a state of dysfunctional narcissism, despite having gotten repeated poor reviews in internal employee surveys, the company hasn't made any changes and appears to be getting worse. I know several employees who have stated that working here has caused them depression.

With just a handful of people, all (for all practical purposes) of them reporting into a single general (way apt than manager as a word), this boss has no one to question him for his attitude - his managers are based out of the US and the India HR works out of Mumbai. If you are harassed and feel depressed, you would have no one to reach out to. This comment might be very specific to a particular individual and one may choose to ignore this rant. But for a center with just 13-15 employees, its very important to understand the attitude of this one person. If you don't happen to like him (which I am sure no reasonable person would) you would have no where else to go but quit.

Potential for promotion is limited and mostly related to how well you can schmooze with management. If they dont like you, expect to be marginalized. 

Management appears to be overall uninterested in how work is done. One really gets the sense that they often dont understand the basic processes they are supposed to be overseeing and could not fill in themselves for absent employees. This lack of understanding will not stop them from meddling of course.

Stellar work is taken completely for granted, while any mistakes you might make will haunt you for the rest of your days. 

Overall corporate strategy seems confused and very short sighted. the term ""slash and burn"" comes to mind-- short-term gains at a potentially huge cost down the line.

While the company continues to post huge profits, virtually none of that wealth gets to non-management employees. Enjoy your 1% semiannual raise (if youre really lucky).

Company surveys are actually sent out to determine employee's thoughts and ideas for corporate improvement. The employee responses are completely ignored by management and no suggestions are implemented.

Employee morale is extremely low. Watch your back and document every single thing you do or you may well end up in a serious bind. 

Interdepartmental communication is often difficult and can become openly hostile depending on who is involved. This has obvious implications for workflow and work quality.

It's a global company, which provides a fantastic opportunity to work with colleagues world wide. This has been my favorite part.","Since the new CEO took over, the company feels like a sinking ship. It's too bad as it has a lot to offer. This CEO focuses highly on customer service (WHICH IS A PLUS), but you need to start with employee satisfaction first, which includes appropriate benefits, pay, training, recognition, work/life balance, training (yes again), etc. in order to positively impact the customer.  

We have no funds to do anything, we practically have to get executive approval for so much as t-paper (yes, it's an exaggeration, but you'd be surprised on how close this is), and are expected ""to do more with less,"" which in this environment is not effective as it's more of a salt mine mentality. Due to the RIF's that occurred over the last few years, we have the same amount of work (A LOT) with less people to do it in and of course a short amount of time to get it done in (and leadership seems oblivious to this). 

They (the leadership) talk about empowerment, but manager's, directors and even some VP's do not have any approval authority whatsoever. 

I've loved working at Western Union and I've been here many years, but in the recent years, it's falling apart and it doesn't really feel like we have any leadership at all nor any loyalty to it's very hard working employee base."

1691,,"Good, but always room - for better...",2012-09-11,4.0,Anonymous Employee,"1.  I believe a lot of the employees that have been around for longer are still suffering from PTSD as a result from the lay-offs, transitions and changes that occurred under the new CEO (generating some of the negative responses below).  Generally I like the changes that have occurred.  They fired 30, hired 20.  By doing so, they brought in a lot of new higher quality people across many departments that have since helped enhance many of the processes and replaced many people that were not pulling their weight.  A lot of the changes are still underway in many departments as the company is full of innovations and growth with products and services it provides; also being heavily regulated - some of the changes are forced by the government.  As it goes - there are not very many open cubicles around and hopefully those will be filled with worthy employees.
2.  As others mentioned - the 160 year old name and fortune 500 status always a plus.
3.  Good benefit package.
4.  Possibility to work with people all around the world.
5.  Work hour flexibility - most departments have a ""get it done"" mentality, meaning - that if you do your job, no one is counting your hours.","1.  This next point could either be a pro or a con, depending on what kind of employee you are --- it is virtually impossible to get fired from Western Union!  As I mentioned above, they had to liquidate full departments to get rid of the people they really wanted to get rid of (a lot of employees who got laid off ""as departments"", got hired back on in other departments/positions because they were not the ones who they wanted to get rid of initially).  Unfortunately the bare minimum is still prevalent among some employees, especially ones who have been around for a longer period of time at a specialist/analyst level.  This is why one of the comments below surprised me - it seems like there is some kind of hidden sense of seniority rather than merit - ""I've been here longer so I should get the job instead of someone who's done twice as much in half the time"" -- WRONG mentality.

2.  As one person noted, personal relationships CAN play a part in the workplace and career progression with some people who have ""been around"" and have made the right connection can be ""promoted out"" rather than terminated when they are not up to par with the set standards.

3.  Possibility for a career advancement also very much depends on which department you end up in and who your manager is (whether the manager is concerned more with retaining the best talent on their team, or encouraging growth)

4.  Pay is below average for the comparable pay grade levels in Denver or in the industry."

- 98% of the people you work with on the daily are fantastic
- Recognized name and brand, Fortune 500, global colleagues, travel opportunities (depending on role), flex time and work from home opportunities (depending on role and immediate supervisor)
- On average, pay is competitive (see comment in cons below)","On paper, WU is an awesome company to work for, and when it comes to things I mentioned above that don't necessarily pertain to you on a daily basis, the company has things figured out and seemingly treats employees really well.

After reading the other reviews on this site, I agree with 90% of what is said.  The fact is that your experience in your role on a daily basis is highly subject to which group you are in and who your immediate supervisor is.  Some groups are very high profile and have a very cheerleader-ish culture and are constantly being recognized and applauded by all levels of management.  Others are seen as back-office support functions that shouldn't even really be seen and certainly never heard.  

Senior management is really guilty of recognizing, supporting, and investing in business units directly responsible for revenue generation and either marginalizing or outright cutting support for and investment in business units that are revenue protection, cost savings, and/or shared services to revenue generating units.  While this makes the stock price tick up in the near term and is way more fun for our CEO to talk about how ""innovative"" we are, it can only last for so long before neglected yet critical business units crumble.  There is a very clear message to ""do more with less"" beyond the point where diminishing returns kick in.  There is no appetite for investing in and/or upgrading critical infrastructure (kind of a ""if it ain't broke, don't fix it"" attitude).  

There is an overwhelming tendency (some exceptions of course) to hire from outside of the company even when clearly qualified internal candidates exist.  External candidates get outrageously generous salaries while those of us who have been here and put in the work are told that there simply isn't any room in the budget for annual raises higher than 2%.  Attitude of ""you're already doing what you're doing for what we're paying you - why on earth would we pay you more?""   

Management is obsessed with outsourcing and acquisitions.  Soft costs like integration efforts, support, language barriers, time zone issues, compliance requirements, technology differences, etc. are outright ignored so that these decisions look good on paper while those of us in the trenches are left to pick up the pieces.

There is no respect or appreciation for the tribal knowledge and loyalty that exists at a company where still a large majority of employees have been around for over 10 years (there is a not unsubstantial number of people who have been here for over 30 years).

A lot of business units are way over-worked.  Vast swaths of employees are rapidly approaching burnout (if they're not already there), and management thus far has not expressed sympathy or concern for what the consequences of this will be.  Employee morale has been in the toilet for the past 2.5-3 years because of constant layoffs, poor planning and execution that results in constantly changing priorities, flavor of the month type strategies, and clear message that the stock price and external company image are all that matter.  It's painfully obvious current CEO's goal is to position company for a sale/buyout in the next couple of years (if they keep him around long enough to execute).    

New CEO has some good ideas, but execution hasn't been thought all the way through.  There is also a big disconnect between senior and middle management.  Good ideas and concerns from the bottom are ignored, while senior management appears to just be a team of ""pie in the sky, don't bother me with details or logistics"" thinkers.

Bottom line - WU could be a truly amazing company if they could fix a lot of these cultural issues that plague the company.  It has been an overall decent experience for me thus far, mostly because of who my direct supervisor and team members are.  The writing's on the wall though and I won't be sticking around for the long term."
