1. Read the job description 10 times because what you read and expect is not what you will get to do.
2. HR is pretty much useless.
3. You will be negotiating salary with your senior and not the HR, which means there's very low chances of you getting paid based on your experience but instead you'll be relying your senior.
4. You'll be paying for everything including visa fee, tickets, hotel etc.
5. HR will promise you many about how they will be supporting you and all but when the time comes, there will be no one to help you, you will be on your own. 
6. No one will help you find a flat, and the German language is not going to help.
7.HR will be putting a lot of pressure on you to get you all the required documents like KVR registration, police certificate, bank account etc but no help from them to sort these out.
8. There are a thousand teams that you will have to figure out on your own and not even one person would want to answer your questions with authority and responsibility.  They will tell you something and then ask you to confirm with 10 other teams....it's like corona virus...the questions keep travelling.
9. Lack of time management.  People tend to have 10 meetings just for a very small, not so important thing...something that can be answered by a responsible team or person (if that existed). Read #8
10. If you like to take responsibility and manage something personally, this is not the place. Read 8 and 9 + hierarchy."

Plenty of learning opportunities (Technical aspect of the Job)
Brand new top of the line office space (Love it)
Open door policy where the employees can freely go have a conversation with senior members of staff
The best HR department

390,Wirecard,Fast growing global financial services and technology company,2017-01-03,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Working for Wirecard is something special to me. Not every department works the same but those departments which I know are very interesting (especially where software development is involved). The company offers a huge variety on financial solutions. Most of them are developed by Wirecard itself. The aim is to stay on the forefront of those financial technologies, which is very challenging. With the high number of acquisition the company is currently growing a lot. Nevertheless in my opinion the company is not overburden with bureaucracy like other bigger German companies and therefore you will more often have the chance to take decisions on your own. Definitely there are so many challenges that you will not get bored easily. I would say employees get compared to other similar companies more responsibilities and also changes to step up the career ladder if performance meets the expectations. On the other hand I also have to say that probably not everyone can cope with the high number of challenges and not everyone wants to take over responsibility. Besides that Wirecard offers some noticeable amount of free amenities like Gym or languages classes.",Sometimes it´s hard to keep the overview of all upcoming challenges. The disadvantage of less bureaucracy is that sometimes processes are not fully clear or just not existing.

395,Wirecard,PGS opinion,2016-06-21,1.0,Anonymous Employee,- innovative product development,"Today I take an oppurtunity to give my opinion.

What can I say and where to start. There are some people who get promoted just with politics and has no clue of they are doing and what they know. 

Within a span of little time some people are trying to reach high position. 

Most of the work has been pushed to international people, the team leads , management team and heads just gossip around and work for few hours hardly . Some people even can't  leave this company because they know if they leave this company they have no oppurtunities outside.

In regards to salary increment if asked they try to negotiate and push off completely what has been asked for. Moreover , work pressure to bring in diamonds is unbelievable!!! Then, people here show an attitude that they think as if they are disciplined perfectly working employee ,in reality that's not.

For every conflict they try to make fuss , make politics ,gossip ,instead of bringing up a solution. 

They are also trying to bring in the processes which by far will take a lot of time."

- Too much stress
- No strong processes in place and the different departments are not really acting as they belong to the same company! they just push back
- Too much politics
- Salaries are not up to the experience
- The customers for sure are so unhappy with the provided service from the company and the massive number of incidents each and everyday

398,Wirecard,Looks good on the surface...,2016-05-27,2.0,Application Engineer,"Gym, international working environment, german classes, nice little coffeeshop/bistro inhouse. Flexible working hours, as most Munich based companies you also get to go to the Oktoberfest.","Where do I start? 

There are little to no chance of improving yourself in the technical side of things, also a very big struggle to get promoted, big promises with no execution or constant ""change of priorities"" hamper any progress. There is little room for R&D with new technologies: Docker, forget about it. Personal VMs: forget about it.  
Also no transparency with regards to the structure and for planning your career here.
A very cliquey culture centred around partying and being one of the ""boys"", disregard this and you can forget any advancement.

Home office is not an option, however if you know the right people it seems that it is possible, even on a weekly basis, got love the favouritism at play here.

My biggest gripe  is the complete lack of competent management on some levels. They would rather employ more low paid employees than to improve their existing ones, the same employees who then take double the time to be on-boarded and also lack some basic IT skills and no independent thought and action. 
Management also means earning the respect of your team, to lead them. Not let them fend for themselves but then play important when projects are running late. Constantly having to escalate basic level tickets, having to explain to other employees how to do their job is not my job nor is it making it an enjoyable working atmosphere."

Maybe Wirecard technologies is trying ride on the long standing lame of wirecard AG which again is a borrowed positive.,"I can *COMPLETELY* agree with the other online reviews below describing the Poor company culture and entirely incompetent high management.

During the most of the process their Heads came across as arrogant people with very low standards of technical knowledge and looked like complete manipulators. How such people be get such high positions is beyond me. Probably reflects on the high Management's poor choice of professional at the positions of ""Heads""

They try to manipulate you to get you at a lowball salary and if ask for a competitive salary they are quick to take their offer back in a clear act of frustrated arrogance. Also came back with a reason that we are already giving so and so X salary to the current employees and we can't go beyond that, I wonder how badly they are manipulating the existing experienced employees to work on such un-completitve salaries.

Also send you all kinds of fake promises about work culture before to try to ensnare you and they think that the candidate is stupid enough not to read the online reviews?

Clearly this is a company where employees are treated badly and the work culture is damaging professionally.

I empathize with the current employees who are enduring such culture and any god professional candidate I Wouldn't recommend such a company at all."

419,Wirecard,Mixed feelings,2014-07-22,3.0,Systems Administrator,"Nice office, flexible working time. Intelligent, friendly co-workers.","When I was there, opportunities to grow would have been plenty, but upper management preferred to hire new people from outside the company in higher level positions over promoting good candidates internally.
Money was spent in bad ways, for example hiring external consultants to work on projects that ran for years, instead of hiring more people internally (which would have been way cheaper, even when paying well above average to those hires), which would have also made sure that the knowledge about the inner working of such projects were kept internally, making future care of the results much easier.
Management sometimes makes promises, and breaks them unnecessarily. (In business, there are always some promises you break, even if you don't mean to, but I know some examples that were intentionally not kept.)"
