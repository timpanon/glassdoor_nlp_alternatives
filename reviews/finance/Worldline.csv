81,Worldline,BIG NO,2021-10-12,1.0,Software Engineer,good location in Hoofddorp and nice office,"horrible toxic work environment. on my onboarding process, my first impression from HR department, I was asked if I ""ran from my country"". on the third day, my teamate asked me to ""go back to your country"". beside to that, racist behaviour makes expats to fireback and and the end, you end up in a meeting that everyone's trying to humilate others to prove something. 
another problem, is that you have to use windows and it's not mentioned anywhere in interview process, this is not a problem by itself but it becomes if you have to run VMs on it while the laptop is too outdated and most of the time crashes or BSOD (believe me, getting BSOD become part of you daily life).
management, they just don't care. I changed 2 laptops at first month but none was working as it should, I was promised to get a new one every month (apparently they though I'll be quite if they keep promissing over and over).
another problem with management was that I never received a feedback, NEVER, that's the first thing a manager should do. they've received many complience about toxic behaviours but no action happened at the end.
there is a set of scrumMaster/Developers there with +5 years of work in there who not only can do proper coding but also they are fresh learnt scrum masters, at the end of each week, we had a meeting to fix their bugs in code.
on the infrastructure, no one's seem to be working, for instance, I got my internal git authorization after 2 weeks. another instance is that can't ever have a vm to work on for yourself, hunderds of similar problems exists.
on the coding side which is more concerned for a software engineer, I DONT RECOMMEND HERE AT ALL. almost no one is open for commenting on merge requests, you can't comment on the design of a code, and if you do people start crying and calling meetings for it. beside that, code quality isn't good, that next to code review problems makes the code smell so bad.
last but not least, on my leave, after I announced the resign, I was never given a time (during corona all meetings was online) to say goodbye to my coworkers, it seems that manager thinks you should be happy in such environment and never let go. that's funny because there are like 3 leavers every month, just in a flat of office."

Excellent knowledge in their fields, hardworking and just as good with customers. Quite simply the sole reason the company has any business in the UK, although customers are noticing quickly these staff are leaving at a rapid rate. Management of course are burying their head in the sand and lying as ever.","UK CEO has major deficiencies in honesty, integrity, sincerity and competency. To lie as much as he does he’d be perfect in government. 
Everything. Pay, benefits, work / life balance regardless of level. Current attrition rate in the UK will see the company with no staff in just a few years.
Quite simply the most toxic work environment you could work for. Many staff tried raising this concern and were simply told “if you don’t like it, leave”.
The most top heavy company you could know. The CEO having sacked a load of support staff to create more sycophant execs is hell bent on creating his own 'club'. Current estimates are there being 25%+ managers and increasing. Of course, don't ever disagree with this petulant CEO or he'll shout you down on a global call, or just completely ignore you from then on, regardless of your position in the business and that includes his own exec.
They will push harder and harder for you to work more and more hours that you don't get paid for and to be doing work many levels above your grade as they dangle a carrot in front of you. Even if you do exceed your objectives, HR will change the score your manager set for no other reason than they don't want someone to be exceeding.

As for pay, don’t ever expect a pay rise but a continuous pay freeze which in reality is a pay cut as you have to do more and more to cater for all the staff leaving."

Senior Management will bend over backwards for clients as they are so terrified that they may leave which means clients usually run the show and you will not get any support or protection if the client behaves poorly.
