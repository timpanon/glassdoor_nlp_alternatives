The worst part is the CEO of the company Pavan Agarwal.","1. The management doesn't know how to speak to the employees and they teach us email etiquettes. You guys should learn it first. The CEO is unprofessional that he literally shouts on the email. 
2. No empathy towards employees. The environment is always tensed and employees work their out of fear.
3. All the managers are idiots. Employees are not allowed to speak their mind, the mangers consider it be an indiscipline act.
4. You are forced to work on weekends. You are not allowed to say NO. So if you join this company you just have to forget Family Time, Me time everything. They call you continuously on your personal phone on weekends.
5. There is a team called Jr Delivery Management where the entire team disrespects the employees, their work, and just barks.
6. I have cried almost everyday. The worst 10 months of my life. HRs are soooooo desperate to fire employees. They are just looking out for a chance where an employee makes a mistake. Instead of making them understand they just go on firing employees.

I request you all just don't get impressed at their big packages. Peace is more important. Make a good decision. Or else you are gonna regret it soon."

The company is strictly ""ruled"" by HR. Every step, every breathe you take is determined by the HR. A small misstep and you WILL be fired. Even if you apply for holidays(and you have extra Paid Time Offs), you may not be given holidays due to lesser work force.

2. The amount of work they make you do for the salary they give is completely unjustifiable. On the offer letter, they say that your salary is 41,666.33 INR. But, in reality, you get something around 32,000 INR. I personally, never got anything above 33,000 INR. When you go and try to reason this with the HR, they will give some lame reasoning and be done.

3. The lack of proper training in the induction days is also one of the biggest cons here. They will give you training on easy Conventional loans and will force you to learn quickly and put you on live loans, which may be FHA, VA loans."

127,XL Dynamics,Decent company but a bit demanding,2021-08-27,3.0,Financial Analyst,"My experience with XL Dynamics was really good, make a lot of good friends and I learned a lot.

Mostly, recent graduates are the one complaining a lot in the company and spreading negative vibes about the culture and all because they have recently seen the world outside campus fun and chitchat in lectures.
Almost all the managers are very supportive and respectful.

HR will take care of you till the time you don't misbehave or do something unethical.
The rules are pretty basic and one should understand that company is paying for the work not roaming around and the progress in terms of salary is good if you are doing good.
I went from 3.5L to 6.5L within 5 months in the company.
Internal job postings is the best thing in XLD.","The problem is few HR policies which does not allow you to talk to your colleague or use phone on the production floor.
However, you may go to your locker anytime and make a call.
There are some seniors who doesn't understand the fact that there is life outside office and work, only because you choose to spend all your time for company, you can not expect everyone to do the same."
128,XL Dynamics,Alright company to work for,2021-08-25,3.0,Senior Analyst,"Money is good sometimes. They will keep changing your package based on their policies. One does not have a say much. If you luck out, the benefits and package work out in your favour.
Senior managers are really good in general. Strict but fair.","HR policies are extremely odd.
Bathroom breaks are monitored.
Food coupons are minuscule.
There is a hint of nepotism in hiring and increments."
129,XL Dynamics,Nice,2021-08-21,5.0,Associate Analyst,You can have meals along with your works,Work load and no face to face communication
130,XL Dynamics,Okay place to work,2021-08-18,3.0,Associate Analyst,They provide Work from home to ladies for night shift,"The in hand salary is much less than the CTC as they deduct Rs. 3500 (also Rs. 7000 in some cases) from the in hand salary for the system that they provide to work on. This is for first 12 months but then you'll only get the lumpsum amount at the end of your employment i.e. when you'll return the system which could be years from now. Also, the majority of amount is given as variable and for the team I worked in we didn't have much work even if we were willing to. Hence I have never received the variable part of the salary. Although my CTC is Rs 450000 I only receive 26000 in hand 
 The HR policies are over the top strict. You'll be threatened to be thrown out at your mistakes."
131,XL Dynamics,Good company for starting career,2021-08-16,3.0,Anonymous Employee,"Salary hike is quite High

135,XL Dynamics,Please stay away from this company unless you want life time bad experience.,2021-08-09,1.0,Financial Analyst,"Salary, I mean seriously they pay really high as compare to SKILL set and experience.","1) Every positive review is fake as HR also come under HIRE and FIRE POLICY.

2) You will always see vacancies as they don't want to pay more so they chose to fire you and hire somebody with less package.

3) Before joining please contact former employees on LinkedIn ( at least 4-5 candidates ) to know the truth.

4)Company had shifted its backed operations in India as we provide them perfect SLAVES (using word slave not even laborer )

5) It's company where if you TALK to your colleague then watchman right down your name (like school where class monitor do that) and you will be asked by HR for show cause notice. JUST ONE OF MANY EXAMPLES.

6) You will never have future here as they have history of FIRING ENTIRE TEAM without notice and compensation.

7 ) I had joined one of 50 candidates and after 7 month five of us was remaining (excluding me 4 only on 8th month)

8) I am writing this after 7 years as I felt it is my duty to inform people how cruel this company is.

9) I wasn't terminated by them as I was best performing candidate, was offered a 50% hike and yet I chose to LEAVE this organisation to join with other organisation with 60% LESS CTC than current.

10) I have worked with 4 companies and faced so many difficulties with organisations but never been treated like SLAVE(and credit goes to XL DYNAMICS as I feel everything is better than XL DYNAMICS)"

1)Good training
2)No politics only monarch
3)I am assigned to a team with great learning was fortunate to have an amazing supervisor who understood and also motivated us.
4)You will learn to respect time and words.
5)Work from Home (not sure it is pro/con coz you have to work extra which can extend to any time)
6) cant say more because i was been removed during training period . 

Cons

1)Mind your words!
We all were encouraged to give an opinion about enhancing the organizational structure and was told in a friendly manner""You can tell anything you like we are a team here"".
And one of my colleague spoke about an issue all of us were facing ""which was security was kept to look after us, We felt as if we are in Jail .
2)They hire and fire as per requirements.(Even if you are working for ten years still they would not care firing you)
3) Depending on team you are assigned, probability of fire depends i.e the least you were trained faster you'll be fired.
4)A really bad pay structure, base is 15k for fresher's out of which 3.5k is reduced for the stupide laptop , although on day 1 of joining i mentioned i want to work from office still they will take it from your salary forcefully then taxes are reduced that brings the pay to about 10k.
Now,is the twist they reduce the pay from this base pay as well reason being, production should be 8 hrs i.e 100%. Now the thing is not that we don't want to complete the target but
1)Time is wasted in some or the other miscellaneous work given by them. And when I say eight hours of production that means exact 8. And any team you want even if you were having 10 years of experience.It will sure take more than that ETA assigned.So, you will end up losing your production time.
Example: To make you understand the system lets say task of eating fruit.
ETA given :2 minutes as per time to eat an apple.
Now to assigned task will be watermelon,papaya, Coconut, jackfruit,etc.
Hope you get a idea about it.Also,at times there aren't enough work to be done and they system does not understand that you do not have work to do so actually what you get is ₹7,500/-.
Don't take what I say there are many working over there you can just confirm it with them.

327,XL Dynamics,My dark and terrible experience with XL dynamics,2020-12-07,1.0,Associate Financial Analyst,Senior management and supervisors were good.,"Trainers - Trainers are very bad. They will use hard voices to get work done and will ask to do more. They will ask to come on weekends and holidays.

Training - They said that we provide 3 to 6 months training. But they don't they rushed training modules within 2 to 4 weeks. In a month training + work will be taken from you. You will have no time to manage. How can a person do 6 months training in 1 month and then start working with zero errors.

Career and growth - You will have no permanency in your job. You can lose it any point of time. They believe in hire and free fire.
They say we are growing faster. They will hire every Tuesday and fire you without paying anything. I joined and half of my colleagues were fired before me. Within one month I got fired too, without any salary.

You will see your colleagues are getting invisible as days pass by. They will take work from anyone but will pay no rupee to them.

You need to work and work do not complain forgot your family in the end you do one mistake and you are gone.

They expect from their employees that all the employees should perform their allotted task within the ETA but the management don’t follow the ETA they are not releasing the salary on time.

Nothing much.","Before I write a long para, I want to make it clear that if you want to earn more and have no future career plan then this is the company for you.
Now cons are unlimited, pros is only one- high salary.

1. No talking, no interaction with peers..you will become dumb and deaf. Security guard always keeps eye on you if you're working or sitting idle. UnProfessional treatment of employees.

2. You have to work like robot to complete your 8 hrs assigned work because if you are a human you'll at least need 12-15 hr to do that work.

3. You have to complete 8 hr work in 8 hr only. If you'll not, your efficiency will come below 100% and your 10 % Salary is gone!!!!!

4. If Security guard writes your name for any unknown reason even if you're self talking
then 20 % of salary gone!!!!!!

5. This is not the work for engineers, you will waste you career and life if you join this company because you'll learn nothing. Work is just to match 23 documents if they are correct. EVEN 10th-12th pass student can do, so think about how you'll be treated once you join this company.

6. Management sucks, even HR fear that they might loose their jobs. Even 5-7yrs
experienced are fired with no reason. It seems like Management people don't have their families so they treat you like SLAVES. Because they aren't social so expect yourself to be alienated from SOCIAL LIFE.

7. They think that money can buy everything, even FREEDOM so your freedom, worklife
balance is taken away by few thousand rupees.

8. Total holidays is 8-9 only and that too US holidays. So, forget your HOLI, DIWALI, EID, Valentine etc. because you've to work on that day.

9. Your holiday will not be approved, one day of emergency holiday can deduct your 10% from earned salary. You take 5 day holiday, your half the salary of month is gone!!!!

10. Work culture is like slaughter houses where every animal awaits for their slaughter turn. You will be fired with no reason.. and if you're earning much then definitely fired because they will hire a new people on less salary and replace you.!!!!

11. There are endless others, skipping all because I too handle this much stress and still work because I have to feed my belly. Once get employed somewhere, just leave this company without caring about pay."

717,XL Dynamics,Review,2016-08-24,5.0,Team Leader,"I am a Team Lead at XL Dynamics India Pvt. Ltd.

First I would like to correct information in the negative reviews provided:

1) XLD does not fire people. Only employees who can no longer be employed as in any other company for reasons of Integrity Breaches or history of low performance even after they are moved to simple teams are asked to leave.

2) XLD does not have long work  hours. Work is assigned for 8 hours as per defined ETAs. Some people take long to finish it and stay back. It happens in any company.

3) XLD does not force people to work on weekends. People have a choice to work on weekends and earn extra incentives or not.

4) XLD has very strong HR policies which are explained to every employee in the HR Handbook and success meetings. Everybody knows them.

5) XLD expects people to work when they are at their desks. If they would like to chit-chat, they can take breaks at their convenience. There is no break schedule. Every employee is expected to be mature.

Pros:

Very good company for people who are serious about a career and about working.

Excellent training, domain, financial analysis profile and growth opportunities.

Excellent Salaries.","Some people fresh out of college want office to be like college as well. They like to Bunk Work, Not complete tasks and leave, be dishonest when questioned.

The Training was good and the expectations of the job were well set. I received salaries on time, incentives are paid on time. I had an interim appraisal where my salary increased 70% to Rs. 6 Lakhs. 

I was moved twice to higher level functions and have been given every opportunity to grow and advance my career. I have also enrolled in the MBA program.

Incentives and Salaries are the best. There are also other perks like buffet lunches in 5 Star restaurants, cricket tournaments, diwali celebrations, etc.",The company strictly expects employees to be very honest. No useless chit-chatting is allowed on the floor.
723,XL Dynamics,Worst company,2016-08-21,1.0,Associate Financial Analyst,The only good thing is that they pay good. That's it.,"Everything, from HR policies to Environment is horribly disgusting. They have fired around almost 135 people in a single day! Almost the whole of the department was wiped off. It's like Hell on earth where every moment you will feel that they will fire you at any moment."
724,XL Dynamics,Associate Analyst,2016-08-20,1.0,Associate Analyst,Good money and great incentives and free meal on Saturday if you work on weekends which they will force you,"Hire and fire. Will hire you and employ you for 6months to 1 year and as soon as you earn money they will fire you.
Extreme Pressure."
725,XL Dynamics,Financial Analyst - The Real Picture,2016-08-19,5.0,Risk Analyst,"These  negative reviews are appalling and disrespectful of the Company I work for. 

A common trend in all these negative reviews is that the Company pays well. If it pays well, it also expects that you work well.

I have been in this company for 4 Years. Yes the job is demanding but equally rewarding. I got a 100% increment in my first annual appraisal (which company does that)?

I work efficiently and know my process very well. I finish work in time.

Negative reviews are only written by ungrateful people who fat salaries without actually working for them. Not one of the reviews say that they have not been paid well.

Management always considers compensating employees through spot incentives. My colleagues earn over Rs. 1,00,000/- a month only in OPI. 

We have a good work-life balance. In fact we can afford to buy good things for ourselves and families and even pay off the student loans we took when we did our MBAs in no time.","There are none. ""Haters will be Haters and write bad reviews"". 

XL Dynamics is not a place where you will get paid for not working. Those serious about a good and long career, can join. I completed 4 years and can never think about leaving here. There is job security only for achievers."
726,XL Dynamics,Good job for Graduates,2016-08-18,5.0,Analyst,"Graduates are given an opportunity to work with a Multinational company. There is a career power path in which I was able to move one level ahead in just 4 months from joining. My Salary will also be revised due to this. An employee can have 4 hikes in Salary and responsibility in one year. I also enrolled in an MBA program which would be reimbursed by the company once I complete it.

The incentives are just great. I worked on a weekend and earned Rs. 12,000 over and above my salary.

I also love that the company sponsors a dinner in a 5 Star Hotel when I worked on a weekend.

Everyday I learn something new from my colleagues who are all MBAs or Post Graduates. We work in an environment which encourages us to only focus on work when we are at our desks. This ensures I finish my work on time and leave on time.","I would not say it is a down-side, but people who are not used to following targets and being focused on work do not adjust well. I am pushed to meet my targets everyday."
727,XL Dynamics,Not so good option.,2016-08-17,2.0,Risk Analyst,"Facilities are good like subsidised meals,free breakfast and snacks. Colleagues and team leaders are good.

- Good Infra
- You can have snacks or even lunch at your working desk.
- Ramada buffet if you work on weekends.","1. Workload : Regardless of which team are you in , you will be working for approx 10-11 hours in a day and atleast 2-3 weekends in a month. But, You will be paid for your extra work. So if you want just money this is the right place for you.

2. Job Security : Just forget about it. There is NO Job Security. There is a possibility that you came to office, doing your work and lets assume  you made 2-3 mistakes (unknowingly) and on the next day suddenly HR calls you and gave you your termination letter.

3. HR Policy :  HR policies are very strict as well as weird.
 
-You can't Talk to your fellow employees or friends during working hours. When I joined XLD and during my training (CIP) around 30-40 employees were got terminated just because they were talking personal stuff(like let's go for lunch together etc.) during working hours.

-No mobiles phones allowed.

-If you take break for more than one hour then give explanation to HR....blah...blah

4. Post graduation program : I was also a graduate when i joined XLD. So, this point is only for graduate students. If you are thinking that this company is providing you free post graduation or something then think again. Because initially you are supposed to pay the admission fee etc. and after two years once post graduation is complete then XLD will reimburse that amount back to you. So, here indirectly you are in  a bond of two years with XLD and meanwhile if you got terminated or leave then NO REIMBURSEMENT.              

No experience counted : Xld is completely US Finance based company. NO experience will be counted if later you want to switch to Indian finance."
758,XL Dynamics,"Do not damage your career by working here, especially MBAs",2016-05-21,1.0,Associate Analyst,"The only pros I can think of are Decent Salary, snacks served on desk, good infrastructure
Also for graduates, the company pays for a part-time MBA program.","The cons vastly outnumber the pros I have mentioned the main ones here

When I was recruited through campus, the company used fancy words in the JD such as Risk Management, Credit Analysis which was misleading. Actually its a subsidiary of a US Mortgage company and is not even categorized as a Fin. Services company. It is an ITES or glorified BPO company. 
Coming to the actual work itself, its just process and there is nothing to learn. and is not recognized in the market. You will be treated as a fresher while changing jobs as the knowledge is irrelevant for any good Finance jobs.
There is very heavy workload, unreasonable TATs, working weekends without comp-offs, and no Indian holidays or sick leaves - work even on Diwali day. Only 8 federal holidays and even in those they expect us to work citing heavy workload.
No recognition for good performance. The team leaders are just people with more experience anddo not have management or leadership skills. They are good people but do not have any authority. 
HR to employee ratio is very low and they just enforce the management policies and do not care about the employee's grievances. Errors are marked to people for no valid reason and their repercussions are huge - incentives hit or PIP.
Extremely high attrition rate, employees are asked to leave without any reason and not even severance package is given, people are always depressed as their is no job security
The work culture is worst, always a tense environment where employees are forbidden to even talk with each other.
Unfortunately, there are certain people who trhive in such conditions the management also doesn't change policies, instead just fires people who dont fit.

Absolutely no work-life balance,forget social life you will be treated as a slave and the experience here will have no value addition to your career or to you as a person."

762,XL Dynamics,Possibly the worst company to start with,2016-05-05,1.0,Financial Analyst,"The only pro in this company is the high pay but after a certail point of time, if you are smart enough then you will realise that it is more f a con than a pro.","There are only downsides with working in this company and I could possibly write a whole book on that. To keep it short let me just highlight a few below:
I. Extremely bad HR policies and work culture where you are not allowed to interact with your fellow colleagues also. Use of cell phones on the work floor is not permitted which to a certain extent is still acceptable but why can a person not interact with a colleague is beyond my understanding.
ii. Your hardwork and efforts will never be appreciated or recognized unless and until you are the favorite of the manager or supervisor or even the team leader. And ofcourse if you manage to be one of them then you can easily chuck out a hardworking employee for the silliest of reasons possible.
iii. The company strives on integrity and expects the same out of its employee. Wrll honestly it is false. The company lacks integrity on its own so expecting the same out of other people is not justified. At the time of the interview I was assured that there will not be any weekend working unless there is workload and federal holidays are the only vacations we will be given. That too was a lie.
iv. Within 2 months of employment you will realise that holiday is a myth in this company. They will ask you to come on weekends including sundays and say there is month end volume, then comes month start volume, then mid month volume then year end volume and volume only. There is no sigh of relief in this company. They will make you work day in day out and kick u out if and when they feel like without any proper justification howsoever. They promise federal holidays as off but that too is false as it only depend on your supervisor. If they think you deserve a break then lucky you else who care if it is a federal holiday? you have to come to work.
iv. There is absolutely no form of recreation in this organization. No team outings, team parties or Christmas or new year party. Well I believe that is the least you can expect out of an US base company.
v. Policies in this company are so bad that you literally have to beg for a leave for your own wedding even if its your right. Its not surprising to hear that its just a wedding so 4 days leave is fine, by your manager. 
vi. The work environment is extremely negative with ppl trying to demoralize the little happiness out of you every now and then. The HR s of the company have absolutely no idea about people management. 
vii. Please don't be disheartened if you get a 1% hike in your pay where as others are getting a 60% hike and both yours and a less experienced persons salary is made the same after a year of struggle. It might as well happen that a person with 6 months exp in the company is getting more pay than a 2 yr old employee. 
viii. Do not stay back with the hope that 1 yr of exp in this company will fetch u a higher package when u switch or a better profile because this place is not recognized in may other companies and u are as good as a fresher to them even if you have 3 yrs of work ex in XLD. The work exp just doesn't count anywhere and there are ppl who are still struggling to find a job after working in xld for 4-5 years.
ix. It will seem to be a very rosey picture when u sit for interview but its a different ball game all together. DO NOT start your career here or even switch from a separate company to here as it will not help in your career growth.
x. No worklife balance.
xi. And oh yes for all the finance and economics students out there who are lured by the job designation of ""FINANCIAL ANALYST"" let me tell you there is no analytics or finance involved. Its a trap. Don't fall for it. They do not use any analytical tool . Its a job that any 12 passout can do."

Also, washrooms are also very neat and clean all the time.  Ans the best thing you can have as much cigarettes you want because u will need at least something to make you stay here and come  every night.  
Yes,  these are the pros which I can actually write.","No career profile after this job.  The only option you are left with is to write cat and go for MBA.  Work life balance is highly negative.  Forget family friends etc.  Even after 2 years,  u may end up learning no skills at all.  After all as XLD claims, it's not actually a financial firm.  But a BPO.  Also,  your designation may be anything,but it may be possible that you end up calling people in US. (calling profile I mean.)  
All in all, the zest is,  after working at xld.  Options are very very less.  It would become very difficult to search job in a related firm because there aren't many who deal in US mortgage (it's the xld core business which is often confused with finance firm.)  I REAPEAT XLD IS NOT A FINANCIAL FIRM. IT'S A BPO please don't go by there tags.  It works as a captive of sunwest mortgage US.  

People think it's like an any other It firm,  that after two years they can easily switch,but guys,  re think,  you are able to switch because you learn some skills. And on that basis you can switch to other where is demand.  But the skill set which you earn here after two years is like,  1: how to type faster than the fastest. 
2.How t talk to people in US.
3.How to manage emails etc.  

It firms can make you learn many aspect like java,  sap etc,  but XLD is not an It firm.  It's a BPO if a financial company which is in US.So even if you are thinking to make your career in finance,  it's of no use.  

I would suggest to join XLD only of you aren't getting job any where else of your choice and is in real need of money. Else,  please try other places and exhaust every option before coming to this place.  

One more thing,  
1. Attrition rate is extremely high.  
2. Half the company is always on notice period. 
3.  Do ask your supervisor before going to toilet or break."

This company isolate its employees by increasing huge salary in market and after 2-3 years force that employee to leave. This company works as a monopoly in Navi Mumbai as it is the only US mortgage company and they do not use the resources properly into work. The HR have the authority to sack any of its employees anytime. They use some camera on the floor to watch the employees. Overall this company Should spend some money to purchase robots not the human. A person Should never run his company like this where the employees are not even happy. No place for Culture and values.

You have to plan to get sick because XL does not understand the concept of people getting sick and taking leaves without 15 days of prior notice.

You will not be appreciated no matter how much work you do. The amount of work or your contribution in anything won't be remembered. The only thing they remember is the one mistake that you made. The management is bad and the employees are even worse. No person in their right mind and even with a little talent would survive this robotic company. They expect you to always be on time and never leave on time. Almost in every meeting they say leave on time without actually meaning it.

Appraisal and incentive scheme. However, they are getting over with the yearly appraisal thing so make sure you check before joining.","- Will treat you like non-humans making you work for average 15 hours daily and weekends may stretch to even 18-20 hours.
- Work is monotonous and no career growth given except appraisal and incentives of 30-40% every year. However, you will not get job outside XLD because no one cares for this work and gives you so much salary.
- There is no HR policy or engagement activities except termination on even one error or on no farewell parties allowed on last working days.
- You cannot connect with colleagues or even talk with them for one minute on floor.
- However, they are abolishing the appraisal and incentive scheme so be sure before joining (if you do)."

783,XL Dynamics,Do Not Join,2016-03-11,1.0,Associate Analyst,The only pros about this is High salary at short time but later switching to other company it is very hard to justify the same and need to start from the base. So better Beware Salary is not everything.,"The Cons are follows.
This company only cares about its customers and checklist. they do have any importance to employees. There are no employee engagement activities. The worst part is you are not supposed to talk on floor if you are found you get a HIT. only some authorised people with whom you can talk. There is literally Gaurd which take round to check the same.
The another major problem is company has defined the work at so deep level that you end up doing same work. In shrot work is like any production line you end up doing same thing.There is no room for any innovation in the work you perform 
Even your slightest of mistake is magnified and you are awarded with ERROR. And All your future is depended only on error and productivity. No matter how hard you worked in past if you are happen to make some error then your future in company in danger.
The company believes in simple rule you do work we will throw money at you and when we dont need you we throw you out.'
Being an employer of 1800+ employees but you will find very less experienced people on floor. that in itself prove the instability of employee.
You get very less holidays only 16 official holidays. and Weekends are off but they also become mandatory sometimes.
And there are many more but a simple advice to job seeker if you get offer from this company keep it at least priority because your career is at stake."

Each and every process has a preset unrealistic ETA which needs to be achieved. Daily ETA has to be a minimum 8 hours otherwise you cannot go home. At least 20% of your CTC is directly proportional to this ETA achievement. Working on weekends is a must. Even on long weekends.
Employees are not allowed to talk to each other on non work related topics - 0 social interaction. there is actually a security guard who notes down Ids of employees who talk - No Kidding. 
Unfortunately most of the finance industry knows the work carried out here and hence this experience is not valued any where, I know this from my own as well as experience of my colleagues. 
Only for people who can copy paste for 10 hours a day."
839,XL Dynamics,Resist yourself from the money trap!,2015-12-10,1.0,Financial Analyst,Unexpected rate of salary increment.,"No HR policy. All HR related decisions are taken by senior management or supervisors close to management. HR just carry out orders.

No standard metrics used to judge the quality or contribution of an employee to the process. (holds true irrespective of the role - team member/supervisor).

No tools/software used for any work/function. Hence for any profile in finance, the experience will do no value addition.

No work-life balance. Extremely stretched work hours. Weekends become mostly mandatory.

All decisions coming from top management are reactive. Once a damage is being done (loss incurred on any loan) in an effort to appease the US management for covering up for earlier mismanagement or poor decision making, either involved employees are made scapegoats (fired or warning letter issued) or the entire process is being changed without putting any effort to actually find out the root cause behind the miss, using some scientific method.

Senior management have very little professional qualification to back the experience and quite naturally very rarely does justice to their role, specifically when critical time arrives for mortgage business.

Job security is elusive. Team work is not appreciated. 

Salary hikes and promotions are provided based on intuition of top management and not based on appropriate structured evaluation process.

Extremely unfriendly, unprofessional and unproductive  work environment. Almost all sorts of restriction are there on employees. In an excuse of maintaining floor decorum, all the employees are even banned from exchanging normal welcome greetings.

Tried to highlight a very few obvious reasons why one should not ideally pursue a career in XLD.    

In case you are running out of options still reconsider before joining XLD as it can have further poor consequences."

4.You can be terminated from the company any time whenever the management wants. They will manufacture their own reasons to justify it. Would not think twice before spoiling people's careers.
5. Recently terminated 300 people together over a very minor issue which was initiated by the Senior team members themselves, other people we sucked into it unknowingly and no training or warning was provided regarding it, probably just to save money for the disbursal of Annual bonus.
6.Join only if you have no other option or if you badly need money and if you do not mind being terminated any time at the whims and fancies of the poor management for no fault of yours.It's a career suicide.No job security and no sense of self respect for a human being."

The more you stay with this company, the more you ruin your chances of getting job elsewhere.
No finance related company considers XL dynamics work experience as relevant work experience.
Because of ur bloated salary package you are not considered for entry level financial analyst jobs.

Currently the company is on a mass lay off firing people right left and center for the silliest of reasons.
If u want to fire someone you will find some reason or the other thats wat they are currently doin. They are asking few employees to find issues for firing people.
The strategy is to get rid of employees with package of 6 lakhs and in place of them hire employees with package of 3.5 lakhs. 
Stupid company with no corporate ethics.

-Sincerely an employee who was not fired but left at own will but couldnt stop myself from writing this as I do not want any mba fresher to ruin their career joinin this company.

During my Interview (in 2013), Mr. Rohit Agarwal told me that I would be asked to extend my shift, to work on weekends, and informed me about work pressure inside. When I joined, I found same, so I have no right to complain about work pressure, weekend working and extended shifts. 

The problem with us (mostly jobless guys) is we agree on each and every employer condition before joining, and when we face these conditions, we complain (Why exactly?). My advise, Do not mis guide recruiter by telling that you are ready for night shifts, extended shifts, weekend working, if you are not because it would result in dis satisfaction only, and ultimately one more fellow abusing the company on Glassdoor.

During my span with the company, I never complaint about any of the above mentioned scenario, because I agreed to all those prior to joining. I had one issue, regarding which I spoke with Swati Mam. Yes, she had taken action on it.
I know, not everyone would second me on this. I don care. I believe, If you work good, they will listen. I was un noticed best performer of my team (Pre Risk), when I had trouble, I gathered all the data of my performance as well as performances of others. I was right, she validated and took action.

Lots of negative aspects about this company have been posted already. But this is a HUGE company with way too many teams and further sub-teams. A lot of your satisfaction / dissatisfaction would depend upon which team you are put in and more importantly, how your team members are.

My suggestion would be- The first ten days of training right after you join the company should NOT be taken casually at all since that decides which team you are put in. Needless to say, if you fare well in those 10 days, you are blessed with a better team.

Sometimes exceptions can be granted. Everyone knows that work is important. Everyone is a mature adult working here. If it's not of utmost importance, nobody would beg for a leave. I think it's safe to say, that we are not in school or college anymore so we have that much capability to understand our responsibilities as a working person and realize that the time has gone when we wouldn't go to school because it would rain or bunked tuitions because we got lazy. 
So, I would really appreciate if this company would bother to hear its employees reason to take a genuine leave before imposing the VARIOUS consequences it would incur.

This is not a place where you will find extremely warm people but if you are lucky, you might find yourself around a few good people who will always acknowledge you with a smile or a nice ""hello"" even if they don't know you. 

This is also not a ""cool"" office where there's lots of scope to have fun, but if  you are lucky enough to be in a team with a few good members who bother to voluntarily ask you if you need any help before leaving if you are still sitting at your workstation beyond time, you won't feel too bad."

2) Bad HR policies not at all employee friendly, they don't even care about your problems.
3) Have to stretch there is no one to keep a tab on ones shift end time.
4) Once you are into night shifts you cannot change, I do not understand the logic behind this rule, there is no point people are going to stay permanently in night shifts, this will not only hamper the interests and the productivity of the individual but also in the long run company is going to face the difficulty is maneuvering the man power."
