Coworkers are friendly and look out for and support each other
Staff networks

Wish I could rate this higher and give more positive examples but those days are gone - it's stunning how far things have fallen under this leadership team","Teamwork sadly lacking at more senior levels. 
Grasping hands out for themselves at the expense of others and are sneaky with it. 
Genuine talent is overlooked if you're not in the right place, don't expect to get on.
If you want to get on prepare to suck up to the senior managers, their vanity will lap it up.
Too many overpaid contractors.
Systems are pitiful and ineffectual - can't even get the basics right.
Managers pay lip service to work-life balance, but they don't have the tools to recompense for the time and effort put in (no extra £ or time back) it's expected ""You're lucky to have a job"""

Benefits are good","The culture is stuck  in a decade and a lot of inclusion and diversity is for show.

They have sold lots of the business off making it a nightmare to actually get on with your job. 

Failed getting everyone one on window 10 
Service desk is awful and takes longer to get anything 

Outsourcing companies are faking their stats so that they can pay their employees. If they suffer penalties they deduct from front line staff in India. Not very ethical considering it’s a global company 

Lots of brown nosers in senior management…lots of heads that have failed projects but still there! 

Non white people won’t get promoted."

Bizarre rebranding effort in early 2021, which yielded an enormous amount of public criticism. 

Wage stagnation. Annual raise and bonus cut for many in 2021. Unclear criterion for new bonus structure.

Low morale within the company due to change fatigue, disillusionment with management, poor performance and low pay.

Their diversity is apparently diversity of thought, says the COO who has joined the company as a graduate and has clocked in 25 years and never worked anywhere else in his career except in this company. Competent people get fired to be replaced by the friends of the C suite, case in question, their CTO who boasts of his porsche in townhalls while claiming there is no plan B for an extremely complex transformation project, ends up pushing the project 2 years over schedule. Hypocrisy beyond measure. Their ""meritocracy "" is completely about who is related to or is friends with who in the organisation.

One example I was not comfortable with was that there were no female Senior Analysts, despite having the most experience/qualifications/highest appraisal. Unfortunately it was very clear that significantly higher hurdles applied for females than it did for males. 

Those who have been there for years (decades even) have it sweet. On the other hand, ambition is not welcome. This was confirmed when I asked in a townhall about funding for professional qualifications - I was told we'd likely struggle to get the CFA funded as they tended to find that candidates were ambitious.

111,abrdn,Restructureception and hypocrisy,2021-06-17,2.0,IT Professional,"Salary and benefits are very good. Their D&I working practice is great and prior to the HR leader leaving they had some really progressive work coming out such as the parental leave policy. The merged company really were very good at this and I enjoyed sharing cultural difference as formal events 

Work from home was made easy though the IT system was slow as could be some days. 

They started to get much better with communications towards the end after hiring someone to look after it. previously you had no clue who did what.","Completely rudderless leadership in a complex business. You literally couldn't predict the volume of work as people ignored processes and did their own thing. One or two long term employees were allowed to do whatever they wanted and it became an office joke. 

The CEO took his full bonus after announcing that there would be no bonus or payrise for anyone else despite people often pulling 80 hour weeks to land projects on time. Great show of leadership there and when challenged hid behind ""but they (the board) said I should take it"" . Do better if you are a leader, at least own it and say you felt more valuable than anyone else so wanted it.

It was completely pointless budgeting or creating resource plans based on metrics or evidence. Everything is managed on gut feel and micromanaged to a huge degree. The answer is always make the team work overtime and they aren't getting training. 

There is no career progression to be had at all. They have entry level roles but no plan for what happens at the end of an apprentice scheme. senior roles get handed to mates with no due process yet everyone else is expected to go through a panel interview (only to find the role never existed and it was given to someone on the Leadership teams mate with no experience).

The management culture was confrontational and demotivating (they call it challenging) often failings were called out in front of everyone. That's a real shame as a few years ago if anyone was struggling the leadership asked who could help that person. If you stay long enough you can watch very pleasant team leaders move to management and quickly change their style to match the aggressive stance of fault finding. That's a massive shame

Nowadays outsourcing is the thing they want to do, that in itself is a fine idea but you have to know what you actually do first before moving the problem elsewhere."

214,abrdn,Not sustainable in long term,2021-01-10,2.0,Investment Director,The people and work/life balance. Always had good people but will struggle to retain them. Junior staff joining will typically have pretty hands on managers so it is a good starting point for learning.,"But increasingly challenging to have a long term career as senior staff don't appear to be incentivized to stay, 
 
After you have been there ~10 years if not before, your salary will stop rising. They try to make out that they have performance driven pay but they don't, they just go through the motions. The numbers seem to be decided well ahead of reviews and they seem to make a lot of effort in figuring out how little they can get away with paying people. In recent years it doesn't matter how well you/team perform, you get no pay rise, in fact there have been massive cuts in bonuses/total salary. You can get promotions that come with no pay rise. The more senior you are the worse it is as your salary has to be curtailed to make some space for junior staff. People that leave often report getting 20-40% pay rises for similar roles. No transparency to pay process and not based on the profitability of your team. 

No firm direction from senior management, felt somewhat directionless the last few years and internal surveys of senior management score poorly, not really clear what the broad strategy is. The new and very expensively hired CFO seems to mainly be interested in cutting costs. 

Your environment will depending on where you are located, in UK and Edinburgh, the facilities and office are good as are some of the European offices, but elsewhere it can be a bit hit and miss. Benefits are not standardised globally so those may also depend on location, naturally you are quite well taken of in the UK."

297,abrdn,Toxic working environment and a company in total disarray,2019-10-27,1.0,Anonymous Employee,There are some good people.  There is not a long working hours culture.  Edinburgh as a city is just fantastic to live and work in.,"So many useless middle-managers and 'lifers' with zero career experience outside that company let alone Edinburgh.  Global company?  Not likely.  They struggle to communicate between offices in Edinburgh let along between countries.  

They are in the middle of integrating legacy companies and there is a complete leadership void.  No clear corporate direction, no clear people policy.  Investing in people and skills has fallen down priorities massively whilst the company drowns in legacy IT issues.  When everything is a priority, nothing is.  The lack of leadership has created a void which has been filled with bullying and demotivated teams.

There is such a lack of congruence between the outward image they try to betray and internal culture.  For example, they sponsor LGBT groups in Edinburgh but it is the only place I have witnessed homophobic bullying in the workplace.  They claim on LinkedIn or host diversity summits to proclaim to be fantastic for woman in the workplace but the culture is institutionally misogynistic and ranked shockingly 96th in the FTSE 100 Hampton-Alexander Report.  Rather than throwing their hands in the air and saying the company is shocking and needs to improve they get out the corporate whitewash.  There is zero, absolutely zero, diversity and it really shows in the culture in a horribly bland way.  The lack of congruence is so demotivating.  The white, straight, middle-class, male with the title of global diversity champion who literally does nothing on diversity actually made me feel physically sick in the office, as if it was some weird twisted joke.

Management in this company is male-driven and arrogant.  On a daily basis I witnessed behaviour in senior and middle management that I simply have not witnessed in by 20 year career before that in other cities.  The very few senior woman are either meek and drowned out by men or are more masculine than their male 80s throwback contemporaries.  Neither of these should be tolerated today.

Siloed in every conceivable way, no two areas or departments work well together.  Their ways of working are confused with, at its heart, a complete lack of professional respect for colleagues.  They do not value or skill their employees to have meaningful, respectful conversations.  Whilst the industry is moving toward skilling up and valuing risk/ finance/ investment qualifications, no credence is given to them at all.  They hire in many talented contractors, pay them handsomely and do not trust them to do their job, listen to their experience or engage them to complete the project.  The arrogance of unskilled, inexperienced managers undertaking huge programmes of work with no relevant experience and not listening to those you hire to help is staggering.

Mergers are never handled smoothly. Management is poor at communicating leaving employees extremely uncertain and nervous. Corporate structure is far too flat and makes it nearly impossible to move up in the ranks unless someone from the company leaves and opens up a spot. Extremely below market salaries. They say they invest in their employees but they really don't and only invest in other companies. Far too UK-centric. Systems and technologies are 10 years behind other companies.

• Generous vacation time
• Flexible working environment, you can work remotely as needed.
• UK culture that promotes work / life balance. This will certainly vary team by team.
• Good people.","• Leadership needs to get their heads out of the clouds. Maybe focus on employee morale first instead of the next mediocre acquisition.
• Company grew way too fast for it's own good. This includes rapid fire acquisitions that made/makes life hard for employees. Rather than building a strong foundation that is able to support expansion, they continued to pile on more. Outdated systems, processes, etc. Someone in a ""leadership"" position comes up with an idea, and the rest of us are expected to tack it on to our already hectic workload. They wouldn't know the impact on employees because they're too busy getting involved some new social committee. Here's another idea, let them focus on LEADING the company. 
• Huge disconnect between the amount of work we have to do vs what Leadership thinks we do. Plenty of ""we appreciate your hard work during a difficult time"". News flash, the company has been going through a ""hard time"" for years!
• Pay. Ha. Notorious for being below the industry average. The amount of inefficiency is staggering. Here's another idea, pay your loyal employees. Genius right? Well that message is too difficult for our leaders. On the flip side, plenty of poor performers here make way too much. 
• Be honest. Everyone sees through the rehearsed corporate lines.
•Again they're UK centric. Big decisions get pushed down from the UK. That means you're just employee #X. And the best you'll get from local managers is ""our hands are tied"". Try again.
•The GBA program. The budget to pay employees isn't there but there is plenty of money to pay glorified interns."

Main pros
- City centre company
- Potential for interesting projects and new technologies
- Aspiration to improve project delivery culture
- Merger with SL and Aberdeen provides potential to shake-up the culture.","Efforts to reform how they reform their ability to run Technology changes has been both time-consuming and ineffective - the Theresa May approach to  Technology and Change Management.
- Too focussed on time and cost aspects of technology project delivery, at the expense of quality, which is rarely seen as a priority
- A number of IT departments have been demoralised by the lack of clear leadership, which has been the case for many years, up to the merger.
- Over-reliance on external consultants to run major projects.
This comes at the expense of major projects not working well with internal teams, plus once the project completes, the management team can walk off into the sunset, regardless of knock-on impact to the business of residual issues.
- Graduate programme does not provide a consistent, positive experience - many internal placements don't offer participants useful experience.
- Still a very hierarchical, top-down led organisation. Efforts to 'agile-ise' the development environment has been very piece-meal and not led to supportive cultural changes.
- For the size of the business, it has an intensely political atmosphere, quite factionalised.
- Top heavy management - not enough doers, especially in key technologies."

Good team vibe, everyone is a team player that is willing to help you if you are stuck. Management very welcoming and easy to get along with.","This is a call center job, even though employees will never admit it. If you enjoy being treated and monitored (i.e clocking in by the minute, and keying in when you have toilet breaks etc) like a call center employee then by all means go for it, but i hated it.

Salary was a call center salary. You get a review after one year where you could gain up to 10% salary increase dependent on your performance and the company performance. But apparently you are lucky if you get something in the region of 6%.  

Be prepared to be on the phone all day dealing with customers like financial advisers who are rude and are out to see you slip up so they can get you done for best pricing etc. I get a sense of pride when i put a suit on as it motivates me to do well, the dress policy is pretty much jeans and trainers with a t-shirt. Perhaps people are comfortable with that but i just couldn't get it how such a major company like that incorporates a policy like that. 

If you are a graduate like me who has made the stupid mistake of jumping at working for a major company like 'Standard Life' but has not really gone through the job profile, do not make the same mistake as me.

493,abrdn,Avoid like the plague,2016-12-05,1.0,PA/Secretary,good compensation scheme and private benefits,"I spent about 2 years working for a company that was acquired by Standard Life and I was then moved to work as a secretary for Standard Life where I spent about a year and a half. I was overqualified for the role, which was very basic and repetitive without making use of my skills or offering any chance for progression. I found the environment unfriendly and the people dedicated to specific ways of working. I even found that unless you used specific language people would complain and/or seemed to find it difficult to understand you as well. The secretarial practice was then formed and it was all change again. In the process of a year I changed about 5 managers. Some of them were not based in the same office as myself and the people I supported were also based in Edinburgh, whereas I was in London. It really didn't make sense. What I saw was that people were being promoted because of their allegiance to the company and its internal culture rather than because of their skills. The person that was appointed as our manager in the Secretarial Practice had been with the company for 20 years and boasted that she'd been getting outstanding performance ratings. However, she had no experience of managing people before and lacked core skills such as attention to detail and spelling that should have been a requirement for an entry-level secretarial role. In the course of 8 months 4 people out of a team of 10 resigned. The whole appraisal process relies on how liked you are rather than the quality of your work. And apart from the fact that there are very few non-Brits working there I felt that not being British put you at a disadvantage if only because you did things in a different way. A few more points to note: SL shamelessly ignored Health and Safety Law back then at least; if you raise a grievance, you are forced to leave; people disappear all the time without an explanation and there is generally a very bad atmosphere in the office. Some of these disappearance cases made the national news, so do your research before you commit to working for SL. The company thrives on mistreating its staff. There used to be an internal organisation VIVO that was meant to support people having ""problems"" with the company. However, VIVO are employed by SL and any advice they give you either is too late or is not the full picture, so that you can't actually defend your interests effectively.  When I left they underpaid me because they had miscalculated my leave. When I asked HR why they hadn't checked how much leave I'd had before I left, a standard leavers' process at the time, they were unable to say. The IT was also quite bad while I worked there and it was frustrating dealing with it all the time. Overall, SL has been my worst employer so far and I would advise anyone to avoid working there. It is generally people who don't have other options who stay there long-term, so, by default, people with low skills, and they are being kept because of their support for the company's unprofessional practices and culture. If you are looking for a clique to join, this will be paradise for you."

510,abrdn,Graduate impressions of Standard Life,2016-09-09,4.0,Anonymous Employee,"After receiving a job offer for the graduate scheme, Standard Life were really great and keeping me up to date in the leading up to my start day. Communication was often, clear and helpful. I was also paired up with a buddy who was a slightly older graduate within the department I was due to start in. We met up prior to my starting and it was a great opportunity to learn more about the company and ask questions in an informal, relaxed setting.

Since joining Standard Life, I feel like I've been thrown in at the deep end but in a good way. Right from day one I have been given responsibility and been able to join important projects within my department. Staff both within and outwith my team have been really helpful and welcoming and have answered all questions happily. They have been willing to give up time to sit down with me and explain more about their roles and some projects they would like me to help out with. It's been a huge learning curve but one I am enjoying. Additionally, employees are offered an impressive set of benefits and pension options which you are able to sign up for from day one.","The application and interview process is long and cumbersome. There are four stages (online application, online testing, phone interview, assessment centre) and at times it felt like I was jumping through hoops to try and secure the job. The assessment centre itself is a big undertaking - a full day plus presentations, a tour and dinner the night before. At times I was unable to see the point of certain exercises which we were made to complete. The vetting and background check process was an absolute nightmare. This is outsourced to another company and I had lots of communication back and forth with them as they wanted some types of documentation which I did not have. They made what should have been quite straightforward into a complication and long process and kept passing my emails onto other staff members which meant I had to explain the situation multiple times. It was not a streamlined process working with them."

In 2012 they mismanaged a layoff plan and too many people signed up for it. Then, surprise in 2013 they had a big backlog of work and not enough people to do it. Then they went through re-recruitment only to find themselves over staffed at the end of the year all over again.
Projects are managed Jan-Dec so often projects are left hanging around until Jan budgets are unfrozen - hopeless.
As is the nature of big companies, there are big budgets but also endless workings and reworkings of powerpoint presentations just to get the right nod from the manager you never see who is 6 levels above you and by they time they do eventually sign it your project is late. This is a prime example of management being a bottleneck rather than an enabler.
In a company which has gone through so many layoffs, there are also many petty issues around ""my tuf"" ""your turf"" and power politics.
All in all, probably best avoided. The pay is good as a contractor but that's probably because so few people want to work there. When I saw the equivalent pay for the same permanant jobs I just about fell off my seat in disbelief - they seem to underpay by around 25% min relative to the industry norm."

Minimal promotion"
584,abrdn,Great company,2013-04-29,4.0,Manager,"Very friendly staff, good culture with execs generally acting  well. Great team work. Investing in technology to bring us into the 21st century. Processes and bureaucracy gradually improving with a commitment to do more. More commercial than in the past but this was needed  as some staff lived in a bubble and didn't understand what real work was. Much, much better than most FS companies. Makes a profit and is still trusted by its customers. Good work life balance for most people. Internal movement is encouraged.",The old timers harp back to the days of when SL was a mutual and don't realise that things had to change. Holidays are only average and pay is the same. Some incompetent people still tolerated (even at senior levels).

Salary is not too bad.","Disconnection of management to front line employees.
Not doing what is talking.
Changes come out of blue, not consistent to what is talking (Ideas disconnect to front line employees).
No system to really help employee to grow in the company or management is not really consider it as a priority."

Advancement opportunities seem limited although they do make efforts to give opportunities to reward hard work and skills. 
Training is rare at present."
593,abrdn,One of the best employers in the UK - fun place to work,2012-05-20,5.0,,"Best professional experience ever thus far in my career.  Extremely bright, hardworking people who are keen on helping others, sharing information, and providing mentorship to junior associates.  Strong culture of promoting a work-life balance, though it's not uncommon for top managers to work 11+ hour days.  Secondments are a brilliant way of retaining talent, while encouraging cross pollination of associates across divisions.  High degree of internationalism within the workforce and international business travel is not uncommon in certain areas of the company.  Nice canteen with a Starbucks to fuel employees throughout the day.  Management easily accessible and approachable, including its executive leadership.   All-around, a great place to be and a name you'd proudly have on the CV.","Office renovations can't be finished soon enough - the bathrooms are antiquated, if not downright scary.  Lighting is dim on most of the floors, and the lack of assigned seating in some areas is a bit of a nuisance, considering this is the HQ of a global company with oodles of assets.  Meetings are used overzealously, when a quick phone call or a sametime message will suffice."
