2,deVere Group,This company is a pyramid scheme and has several national financial authorities trying to stop it.,2022-04-05,1.0,Recruitment Consultant,"-The offer to work abroad is exciting.

-They paid for my flights there and the first month's accommodation.","-A toxic workplace culture. There is bullying in the office, favouritism, there are threats and intimidation tactics. I have seen numerous people be sexually harassed.
 
-The behaviour of the senior management is awful, easily the worst I have ever seen in a workplace and it happens right in front of the CEO, who lets it happen.

-You will get brought into the company on false premises 'high salary' 'you could be an advisor in 2 years' '£50,000 in your first year in commission
 if you work hard' none of this is true. They will tell you what you want to hear so you choose to work for them. There is no career progress there: the longest-serving member of staff in the office I was in had been there 5 years before they let her start sitting her CIIs (I was told you need to build the 'soft skills' up first before you can sit your exams because otherwise, you won't be a good advisor). In the UK at any financial advisory, after your probation period, they will let you sit them. At deVere you essentially work for a call centre where they need you to get good on the phone because if you ever did get to become an advisor you have to sell deVere's financial products to British ex-pats over the phone. There are no roads that lead into deVere, everything is sold to people over the phone. No clients ever apply and request their services because they are awful. 

What I learned as I started talking to more people is that all the financial products they sell will lock you into really long contracts where the client does not make any money, but deVere does. As a result, deVere trains all their employees to get excellent over the phone so that they can sell these awful products. 

-The company is essentially a call centre, no matter the role you are brought in to do, (they commonly advertise you will be a business development associate or a wealth management associate which right as you are about to join they change to something else) you will end up picking up the phone for several hours every day and trying to sell to people why they should work for deVere. I joined the role on several false premises given to me by the recruitment consultant who sold it to me, and then I am the one over the phone selling the same false premises to the next person.

-They have been raided numerous times by the financial authorities and escaped conviction. In the office, I joined we all started together as a whole new team. What I later learned after moving back to the UK is that they had to let everybody go who had previously been in that office so that the financial authorities had no one to question when they raided the office. All the paperwork and computers were taken to find information that could be used against them.

I couldn't suggest more strongly, do not work here. Unfortunately for the other graduates and new staff that work there, for a lot of them, it is their first role in finance and so they are naive to all the lies you are told by management and don't know any better than the daily bullying and harassment. 

There will be plenty of other opportunities available for a first role in finance, so I strongly implore you not to work for this company."

Tell someone you work for deVere and watch them physically step away from you and roll their eyes. Senior staff don't bother to get to know you because they don't expect you to last.

Lastly, the training department do not manage your expectations correctly, by stating you will be moving onto other things after cold calling for 2 weeks or so, yet there is colleagues there for 2+ years who are still doing the same job you do within them first two weeks, the way to succeed is to ensure you're motivated by a goal."

Success is dependent on hard work and lots of it, persistence and time. This is not a nine-to-five job, but a professional career. There is a salary for assistants (with a share of business earnings), but ultimately your income is up to you; your hard work; your skill and your willingness to apply what you've learned.

1. Before considering taking this job (especially if you're willing to relocate) keep in mind a simple fact that you won't have a basic salary. 
They brutally lie about how much you're gonna get and what the job exactly is, usually lies starts with the recruiters and passes on throughout the employment process.
""Retainer"" is what your salary called, look it up.

2. As i've briefly mentioned above they also lie about what the job actually is, and it is not what they tell you, nothing to do with financial sector nor advisory, it is simply telesales. You're gonna have to call people off LinkedIn all day every day, at least 100 of them, that's all the job is. 
If you're down to cold call random people practically begging them to book a meeting with deVere, then this job is for you.

3. They train you to lie and manipulate people on the phone (must say trainings are good, but again it's a sales training, not a financial investments training).
I will just say if the company had a good reputation you wouldn't be trained to call yourselves different names other than ""deVere"".

4. The environment is toxic. Cutting-throat atmosphere which gives you nothing but stress, you're being pushed over your limits, physically and mentally, just so you can at least get out of your retainer and visa fees.
Abandon all hope, ye who enter here.

All in all don't trust a soul and keep yourself to yourself if you're still willing to work for them, and may the odds be ever in your favor."

You do not get a mentor straight away as suggested. The time span for this job can vary from 1 week to a couple weeks. They over hire and exploit graduates for their work. Once fired, you may not even see the commission you may have brought in after they let you go. They only give you 50% off your flights after 4 weeks of working, therefore they make sure they get rid of quite a few of you before then. It's heartbreaking to see so many people not given a fair chance. They expect you to work over the weekend and you may have to pay for extra subscriptions to do your job (e.g. LinkedIn premium). To succeed at this job you have to practically live in the office. I did not believe the other reviews at first but after experiencing it first hand it was all true. Good luck if you are coming out here. Do not bother about the attestation process because they do not even apply for your working visa. Most end up working on tourist visa and then fired."

The management structure rewards those who are committed. I was putting in 60 hour weeks and although I was not seeing the monetary gain at that point, I was given access to the world class training I needed.

18 months later my earnings are reflecting the work I put in, and everyone knows the earning potential in this industry. The thing with the role is that most people do not stick through the tough times to get to this point and that is a shame.

My best advice is to come into the company fully committed or don't come into it at all. Look at the people who have succeeded and follow their example.","Long hours are expected - but if this puts you off then financial advice is probably not for you.

They operate a pyramid scheme which means that as the last mug to join, you are working to support the massive structure above you. They sell products with heavy fees to support the commission structure, so most clients are deeply unhappy too. This is a terrible place to work, filled with awful people.

Every single individual in the company cares about your development and is always there to support you regardless of their own work load. Truly, It makes you feel valued.

Joining this company has been the greatest decision I've ever made. I spent my days talking to prospects, building relationships with them and most importantly, helping them with their finances.

253,deVere Group,A complete sham,2020-06-06,1.0,Trainee Financial Adviser,Good locations available across the world,"Everything ? 
The salary is not a salary - it’s a retainer. Meaning that to be able to make this commission that is so highly emphasised, you have to REPAY the salary amount every month to the company before you see a bit of commission I.e you essentially pay your own wages as any comission you receive you only actually see AFTER it has covered the cost of your retainer. Do you see the issue here? You’re working for free essentially 

There is literally no HR department, people would be Called out of the office middle of the day randomly and be fired because they didn’t fit the company’s taste. They wouldn’t have any notice it was literally “grab your stuff and get out you’re fired” - despite the fact I might sound bitter, I was infact not fired. I left of my own accord. 

Management talk to you terribly. I’ll not elaborate on that as the language is unseemly. 

I actually witnessed a group of employees doing the wolf of Wall Street mmmm Chest thump whilst walking past one of the offices. 

The majority of management/advisors do not have relevant qualifications in financial advisory, it’s a chop shop, they get clients in with smooth chat, get papers signed and jobs a good’n. There’s no regard for the clients investment performance long term, they're just after commission. In this case you can’t entirely blame unethical employees because the very pay structure forces them to do get clients in and out like revolving doors, if they don’t sign commission their retainer builds up, if the retainer builds up over 2/3 months, they’ll be fired. 

Basically the whole company is a scammy slimey embarrassment to the financial services sector. Don’t fall for the sweet talking recruiters, they’ll woo you with promises of a competitive salary, freedom to be trained or live where you want, Christmas parties etc. It’s not that sweet, you work 12 hr days for no extra benefit. Comission never makes it to your pocket. And the management will take every penny you make as far as possible."

Due to the great mentorship, coaching and regular training programs that are provided by my line manager, Paul White and other key members within the deVere Group, I have gained a wealth of knowledge since my start date only six months ago and continue to learn every single day. Not only have I learned more about the industry, these programs have developed and strengthened my skills within a sales role and encouraged and motivated me to succeed.","The 5 day training program was intense and very overwhelming. I was originally brought in to start as a consultant, however coming from a company that provided very little training and provided very few products, I very quickly learned that I was not ready to step up into that role. I think at that stage I very much felt like a failure but decided to be realistic and move at my own pace. Thankfully deVere provides continuous training to allow me to eventually move up into a consultant position.

Another con, I would say is that the office in Kuwait could definitely do with a lot more TLC."
258,deVere Group,A fantastic experience with the Devere Group,2020-05-16,5.0,Business Development Manager,"With DeVere it’s very simple- if you put the work in you’ll get rewarded- that’s not only financially but within the company you are recognised and respected globally. The CEO Nigel green is always there to pick you up and motivate you through every step of the way which is amazing and very very rare in global companies. The training is second to non- and you are constantly improving week by week as you are being trained on new products, techniques and bespoke sales methods for you. As well as that we have a top training manager, Rebecca Ward, who trains and prepares you for relevant international qualifications and she is literally one of the best teachers I have ever been taught by. What I love about DeVere the most is that people are always there to help. Even from being in the role under a year I am confident that I can reach out to any top person in the company and ask for tips and they will be open to sitting down with me and helping me. I work under a very successful consultant who helped me so much the last 4 months and who not only understands what it’s like for us as new starters but who supports and pushes me to become better every single day. All in all I could not recommend DeVere enough as a company to work for and if you are a hard worker and you are determined to make it- this is the job for you.","I don’t really feel like there are any cons specific to DeVere that you won’t have in any solution sales role really- be prepared to learn, work very hard, think on your feet and find out what drives you because that will be your main aid for success. If you don’t have that want, determination and thick skin then it’s just not the job for you but then again sales probably isn’t for you and maybe you should try an alternative route altogether."

- Opportunity to select an initial overseas location as well as future world travel (I've now lived and worked in 3 different countries on 2 continents).
- Genuine earnings potential, which far outstrip UK national averages.
- Focus on developing graduates with focused training, relating to the Financial Services Industry.
- Largest independent financial services company in the world, so access to the best 'products' on the market. 
- Lots of different roles to branch off into, should you choose a field of particular field of interest.
- High tempo offices, create a 'buzzy' atmosphere which, as an extroverted person, I thoroughly enjoy.
- You get out what you put in.","Depends what you'd classify as a 'Con', as it differs for individuals. 
- Need dedication and to be a self-motivated individual, so often work long hours (although weekends are always off).

Doesn't pay anything, not even a basic salary.

You have to rely on your consultant to make money for you. You can do your job so well and book 10 meetings a day, but if your consultant doesn't close anything, tough luck - you're broke.

Regional ""managers"" just try and sell you a dream and think the world all wants these illegal products. Might as well throw your money away in the trash for better returns.

Expect to work 60-70 hours a week with no pay. If that's what you want, go for it. Get a job at McDonald's - it will surely pay you better."

-Realistically takes over a year to get up and running unless handed deals and clients to close because other Advisers have left.
-The company uniform. Looking like a knock off Wolf of Wall Street tribute in the office each day. Many guys in the office looking like their wardrobe was furnished by George from Asda thinking they look like Patrick Bateman from American Psycho.
-Dated sales environment built exclusively around the art of Cold Calling. The company wouldn't effectively allocate resources into marketing and advertising schemes to target clients. Instead dedicated calling sessions to get through to people who've been called dozens of times before.
-An appalling reputation within the industry for a mismanagement of clients and prospective clients alike.
-Setting up a fund management service to entice clients with better returns and lower fees. Instead it's an LLP in which the Senior Manager's for each region are listed as Directors on Companies House in the UK."

-Travel (all at your own expence)","There are just too many to even contemplate...

-Promises are made all throughout the intervies and on boarding process. I must admit, I had alarm bells when in the contract, they say how much you ""could"" earn ... 40K in year 1 is a pipe dream and they know this. 

-Their reputation is utterly tarnished hated all throughout the world. Any financial professionals who hear the word ""Devere"" really have a great laugh in pity towards you. I was even told ""...please stop what your doing and leave there before you waste any more of your time"" you realise after you leave how right they were. 

-the dreadful co-workers...where do we begin here...first, the CEO who pushes for cryptocurrency and awful funds to clients as he has a vested interest in these. You will hear every day how clients are angry due to the awful charges and lose money due to the mismanagement of financial products. Second, only the upper management and advisors who have been there for a LONG time get any kind of real returns. The rest are just TOWIE wannabes and SERIOUSLY UNDERQUALIFIED advisors who deal with clients life savings. 

-The horrendous salary or shall we say retainer. Your always in debt to the company as you are paid on a retainer basis. So if you dont get those deals coming in..your in debt, which is hard due to the reputation of this company. The retainer is not even enough to live..so be prepared to burn through savings like wildfire just to keep yourself afloat. On top of this, you pay your own flights, accommodation, visa and all expenses. I was told that all of this would be at least supported by the company..

-They preach about being the world's biggest financial  consultancy, but have you not ever wondered why they are not established in the UK, New York, or any true financial hub? Oh that's right, they have been kicked out of numerous locations around the world for selling awful financial solutions to clients. These are all of course geared towards the company and the upper tiers of management. 

-they insist you leave positive reviews on glassdoor when you go to location. This is in order to keep that recruitment door rotating for the company. Deluded grads are walking in everyday and realise they have no support at all..sink or swim..you will eventually get used to seeing people quitting or getting fired every single week because they are not selling."

- On the phone for long periods during the day.
- Cold calling unsuspecting individuals
- Spending your life on LinkedIn trying to ""source"" people to call
- Being an investigator/stalker - seeing where individuals work, checking out their history to see if they could be rich or of ""high net worth"",  gathering phone numbers of their companies - calling their companies and asking to receptionists to speak to them.
- Be ready to use your savings to keep yourself afloat. The base salary they offer is not great. (In the country I worked in,  bar/restaurant staff would earn more than me)
- Towards the end of my employment, I had successfully helped the Financial Advisor/Regional manager make some deals and secure business - I was told that I would see the results in my pay packet..... This never appeared.

- If you stay long enough as an Advisor, there is a high earning potential and you can get quite successful but the first 2 years will be very tough financially

- Really good investment products not available on the hight streets

- Positive colleague environment

- Inspiring CEO and Divisional Manager","I have been working for two and a half years at deVere as a Trainee Wealth Advisor/BDM, and they promise multiple things  and don't deliver: 

- To become a Financial advisor in deVere they want you to pass a series of exams (CISI and RO) but expect you to fund them by yourself ( there are 8 exams in total and cost 500 £ on average each)  with no internal training, so pretty much self study while trying to make some business.

- The only training we get are provider demonstrating their products but mainly about cold calling and the reasons why a specific product should be interesting to the prospect. ( no in depth training on why we should pick a similar product over another, mainly just for commissions sake) 

- 90% of the advisors there are unqualified and don't know what they are doing except having a selling pitch and know what to sell in a specific situation. (I have seen advisors with no financial background and after 1 months training in Malta, jumps in the office and start working and calling themselves professionals, for example cherry picking funds in a savings plan because the name of the fund comes from a big bank, so pretty much wasn't looking at how the fund was performing....)

- Very low salary provided in Switzerland for a Trainee/BDM at deVere, that is almost impossible to survive on( high rent and obligatory health insurance) , they provide you with 1800 CHF net p/m (Initially we used to get paid 3500 CHF p/m but the director decided to half it to ""make us more hungry for money and work harder"") and provide you with a 10% commission off of what your consultant makes (if you end up being paired with a bad or unqualified consultant no mater how hard you work you won't see any commissions come in, hence the huge turnover) 

- Commissions might take up to two to six month to hit your bank account.

- High amount of Trainee/BDM turnover, after being there for two and a half years, I have seen around thirty people come and go (you are seen as disposable and they do not care about you, they tend to say that the door is not locked from the inside....)

- Most of the advisors will sign up a prospect but once they see that they can't sell them anything more, they tend to send them off to client services.

- Worst management you can possibly imagine in the Geneva office, very micromanaged environment, the manager appoints unofficially a consultant as his right arm and let that person act as a manager and boss people around...

- deVere has a really bad reputation due to its cold calling, so it's quite hard to schedule meetings with prospects."
281,deVere Group,"It's a sales role disguised as ""business development""",2020-02-25,1.0,Business Development Associate,"Few nice and welcoming employees at the London offices, but otherwise, it's not a nice place to work.","The BDA promises “huge money opportunity”: insane earnings growth after 12 month-ish, but at the expense of soul-crushing hamster wheel of doing same thing every day yet not having freedom to try new things (limited creativity). Role is tough in the beginning yet you are not expected or even encouraged to stay after 12 months on BDA position. The BDA (Business development associate) role is the hardest role they have and is all about KPIs and doing Cii exams for R01-R06. Most people at the company hate this role . I had an impression that this is sales role with nothing but cold calling and emailing. Manager said “we don't do  cold calling any more” but ex-employees as well as employees sitting right in the office said that they indeed do cold calls. After the first day it was clear that the role is quite boring and is “on-the-rails”, i.e. you do as they say as creativity or doings differently is essentially not encouraged at all. I am assuming some people got bored after a while, tried some other approach to their tasks and company did not like that, as all they care about is KPIs and “stick to what works and don’k questions” mentality.  It's very number-based, if you cannot do what they ask in first 3 months, you are out.

I was not shown my contract until after the training course, therefore I was unaware of this until arriving at my ""assigned destination"". The success rate of the company is extremely low, and If you haven't got ""what it takes"", then you will be destined to fail. Hard work isn't valued, as the company is a meritocracy.

To be thrust into a challenging yet rewarding environment was exactly what I was looking for. The programme was extremely well structured and a lot of thought had gone into designing this programme to ensure that I was ready to hit the ground running once starting in location. We also had Nigel come and take some of our training sessions and having such senior individuals in the business educating us was greatly valued and I felt fortunate to be able to learn and ask questions directly from his experiences. 

Previous to deVere I actually completed a graduate development programme in a FTSE100 engineering firm, so I was able to compare the two experiences. The differences in the two are quite vast. deVere holds extremely high standards in comparison and this is translated in the quality of the training and the skills I have developed.

I am now based in the south of Spain and I am so happy in my new role. The staff have been very welcoming and willing to help and the general office atmosphere is a very good place to be. The standards of work are high and this is pushing me to continue developing and learning so that I can soon start delivering and achieve high earnings.

313,deVere Group,Employment Review,2019-11-04,5.0,Business Development Manager,"I was apart of the September training academy in Malta this year and following the completion of my training, I was allocated to the Zurich office for my 1st year.  The training was fantastic and the gentleman running the program are very energetic, motivational, and brilliant at executing this two-week intensive course. The course goes by very quickly since you are constantly business throughout the day. I even got a bit sick during the academy and missed a day which they were all very understanding. This industry and job is not for everyone, but all you need to succeed at the academy is effort and attitude as with most things this will get you pretty far in life. So far I am very happy in Zurich and I feel as if I made the right decision on choosing deVere Group as my new employer.",Possibly allowing us to take the CISI exam before leaving the academy?

Only the top 5% of humans will survive in this fast paced financial advice roles , so if you are thinking if you are in top 5% of achievers, then you are probably not, so save yourself some time and look elsewhere.",If you join deVere already with a wealth of experience in the financial services then starting back at the beginning along side the kids learning what you did years ago is a little hard to swallow.

The training is excellent, it's difficult yes, but not impossible, there is always more than one way to do something and the members of staff are always on-hand and willing to help with any troubles or problems you may face, they're also the first ones to congratulate and recognise when you achieve, they put everything into making sure that you learn and achieve over the training course.","There seems to be quite a miscommunication between the different offices in terms of the information that gets relayed to the new starters, this is something that I feel needs to be addressed.

- Daily exams and early starts
- Wage is actually a loan to be paid back, same for visa and exams you sit
- Unrealistic comission structure
- This is not for the general Academic. You must have knowledge of the finance industry
- Looks promising with the luxe office in Doha Dubai and more but it is a Telesales role where you hammer the phones till you get an appointment. Usually takes 2 months

The company has an EXCELLENT training program on sales + technical finance. You get unlimited commission from the start but don't expect to make a lot in the beginning. You need to snowball it.

You get the necessary support for taking all necessary exams and you're encouraged to move on to higher responsibilities pretty fast.

The training was in-depth and direct and not until you start in an office do you understand the benefits of the structure. I genuinely loved every minute of the time spent in Malta. Recruitment process was detailed and they are informed of everything. The office environment can be challenging. Not all managers are the same or treat their staff the same. A few left within the initial few weeks I started due to a touch of confusion. The opportunity to earn is truly astonishing if you are prepared to work hard. Hard work has never frightened me so I could say that why I am still here. I will become an adviser in December this year.,"Not for anyone who thinks this industry is easy.  You are advising on retirement, investments etc and you need to work hard at this.

1. webinar. this is pre recorded. Do you really think the ceo has time to continuously pump out this video!!
2. recruiters get paid to put a bum on a seat on the training, if you get through the training they also get paid again. it is so easy to get a job at deVere!!! what does this tell you?
3. do not be dictated to on where you have to go and work, it is your life, choose where you want to go to. if they say you cant go there, leave.
4. the company do not care about the clients, at all. do not be fooled. people are there to make money, yes this is normal. but morally, this company crosses the line. the language used, the sexism, sometimes racism, the lack of empathy to staff who have travelled to work in another country, is genuinely embarassing.
5. they talk about not needing industry experience. this is because they know that people who have worked in banking before, know that what this company does, is wrong on so many levels.
6. the pay is atrocious. 
7. it is 2019, lots of companies now especially in london, have flexible working, as it is proven to improve productivity. join a small i.f.a and learn the business from the top down. do not join devere for a career in financial services.
8. if you join as a co-ordinator, you will learn jack all. you will have to make x amount of calls a day, it is a waste of your precious life.
9. the ceo, pushes fintech and cryptocurrency as he has a vested interest in these markets.

The BDM course was easily the most challenging yet rewarding 2 weeks of my career so far. I was trained by the top people in the company who all have the highest level of professionalism and integrity as well as being well humored and engaging and having a vast wealth of industry knowledge and life experience.
I would say the only requirements to complete this course is to have a good attitude and give 100% of your effort at all times. If that doesn’t sound like you then I wouldn’t bother.

When I arrived on my first day in Malaga I was well received and welcomed by everyone. The first two weeks have been challenging but I was well prepared by the guys in Malta.

You’re nothing more than a sales person in a call centre/boiler room, trying to fool people into handing over their life savings to a bunch of crooks who will sell products with high commissions (anything over 2% is theft and devere will take 5-10% easy; there are probably saps paying even more but devere is not required to disclose fees in the UAE) and crazy restrictions that are banned in countries with real regulatory bodies that protect consumers. There’s a reason they had to shut down in the US, UK, and other more regulated countries.

They mainly target Brit expats because their pensions can be moved out of the UK and into unregulated markets, so unscrupulous devere can take a big fat cut of those pension pots. Please note these are scum who told prospective clients that their pensions would not be safe with BP!! So they will lie and cheat to line their pockets.

The people who remain at devere after the hard sales training boot camp are either idiots who don’t ask questions (which seems to be the case of most of the Dubai staff because all they care about is the next brunch or nightclub) or immoral, unethical thieves who think nothing of ripping off people for their own financial gain.

If you want to be able to look at yourself in the mirror (and not go into debt chasing a pipe dream because they lie about the pay structure and relocation assistance and more than a few recruits had to hurry home after racking up credit card debt), stay away from devere."

No work life balance (12 hour days) and the job has little variety. I believe the job isn’t  difficult, just mind numbing and can be done by anyone. The reason why most people leave. 

You have to find your own people to cold call. Meaning that they encourage you to pay (with your own money)  pizza delivery guys for contact details of their customers, or persuading a phone network provider to show you a list of their clients with names and numbers. If you have no one to cold call, you probably won’t make any money. Either that or you stalk people on linkedin to call (fun as you can imagine) 

Very laddish culture, doesn’t feel like a professional environment. (I worked for 5 months, so I gave it a shot)

You do not need a degree and felt as though I was wasting mine. Wouldn’t recommend to anyone who has a good degree from a good university. In fact wouldn’t recommend for anyone who has prospects to get a good job anywhere else. 
The company has a terrible reputation in the industry especially in the UK due to misselling etc, so I believe working here can taint your reputation if you stay long enough. So if you actually want a real job back in the UK, keep that in mind. 
 
 I worked among people who had zero qualifications yet were providing financial advice to people.  If you’re looking for a good job in finance, this is not the job. If you’re looking for a job in hard sales, then it is for you. 
The whole thing is very disorganised and unprofessional — my starting date was moved about 3 times and then they finally changed my starting location from Malta to dubai. Contrary to what they say, your flights are not fully funded. I spent about £1000 relocating which was not paid for by the company. 
Exams and Visa not paid for either. (which they also mislead you on) 

At the training they tell you to ignore the glass door reviews — don’t. Everything you see is true.

Most BDM's will work for around 3 years to become a financial advisor.","There's no basic salary, only retention when your a BDM which builds up as debt.
I'ts a pyramid scheme.
The company does not care about you.
There are no benefits.
You dont have the luxury of going wherever you as in the end they do choose for you.
They will make you try and recruit  50-60 year olds in the training for 3 weeks non stop from CV's  that were bought 7 years ago.
It's a business inside a business.
They use you for advertisement in training to add 100 linkedin connections each day and also make you post stuff that will market their business.
Once you become a FA  You will have to use linkedin to get all your leads.
It's a call centre job.
My recruiter lied to me and told me i would be getting 1200 a month basic salary + half my rent up to 900 paid for + travel expanses and NONE OF THIS WAS TRUE

I also decided to leave the training early after i realised that my recruiter was actually just a sales man, my roommates the day after were than brought into the office and told them that if i didn't leave the apartment that day they would be kicked off the course so I was left without a place to stay for 4 nights.

All in all, it's a corrupt company with a even more corrupt CEO.
Also the webinars with the ceo are not live. you could literally attend the same one every day if you wanted I know this as i was trying to recruit people during training.

If you apply you will get through, they take everyone since so many people quit so at least it's an easy process.

Some people will make commissions, this could earn you an average amount within the first year. These people are in the minority, a number of factors out of your control will effect it. 

You will have fun on training, its basically a boozy holiday with a bunch of other 21 year olds. There is no actual training though, we were forced onto the phones to recruit other people for the course.","This is neither a graduate course nor a finance role. It is entirely sales. You will dredge through LinkedIn to find prospects then cold call 100 of them a day, everyday. There is no personal development, financial training or knowledge. 

You advise clients to transfer their UK pensions or save. But there is no thought to suitability for clients hence the trouble the firm has been in around the world. Do a quick search for ""devere group"" then either ""fines"" or ""suspended"" or ""complaints"" before you apply. There is a striking lack of ethics at the company. 

You will be placed on a draw so you will earn no immediate income apart from in one or two select locations. Even in these locations, salary is below the living salary.  You will require significant savings and be prepared to burn through this. 

There is very little assistance when relocating abroad.

They recruit 50 people anticipating many will leave. Including myself, there are 5 people left from my course of about 30. They tell you these people leave because they could not put the hard work in whereas the truth is the work is basic and monotonous. You are essentially a glorified secretary. As an example, some people doing the job were floor fitters back in the UK, which there's nothing wrong with but just don't go expecting a tough graduate course that will develop your financial knowledge.

They will actively lie about how much they will pay and what your role in the field will be. Personally, I felt scammed when I arrived in the field. We were not paid the promised amount after the training course and certain expenses we were told would be covered in the field were not covered when we arrived. 

The salary listed online of up to 40k or 80k is simply a lie. Certain places will give you 27k GBP or lower, then you may get commissions but almost every office you work in has employees on a draw. 

During the training they scrape your LinkedIn and send recruitment messages to your connections whilst mentioning your name . They ask your permission but you are pushed into doing this. 

Be aware that moving to a new finance role after is challenging because the company is not viewed very highly by others in the industry.

I would never recommend this role to another graduate."

They contribute towards your flight, cover your accommodation, and the cost of the first exam.
Once in your location, there is a rental allowance on top of your pay, which is quite useful.
The company allows you to work in a different country than the one you're from. This for me is excellent.

I have only provided two ratings as I am new in my career and not experienced enough to provide feedback on work/life balance, senior management, and culture and values.","You can take the first two points from above. For some, they will be cons.

They push you very hard. Unless you have a goal in mind and see deVere as the means to achieve it, then you will probably drop out. The recruiters go out of their way to tell people it will be a difficult course, but many only understand the meaning of the word without truly having experienced difficulty in their lives. This leads them to underestimate the amount of work and discipline required.
Before joining the the company, I decided that my priority is to earn money so as to rid myself of financial worries. For me, deVere is the best vehicle to achieve my goals, so there was no way I was going to quit. 

Others did quit. They were more comfortable maintaining the status quo in their lives. 

Whilst commission based pay means that talented and hardworking people can earn a serious salary, it also leaves the possibility of not earning much at all. This is something you have to weigh up. It makes sense for me, does it for you?

Some on my course were happier having the safety net of an entirely salary based job and left.

If you only want to work in the UK, this company is not for you, as it is a given that you will be required to start elsewhere.

Ridiculously high earning potential - without doubt the most lucrative Graduate scheme available - with plenty of scope to earn £100k+ in the first year (if you're good enough)

Meritocracy - harder work = higher pay

CEO is savvy and has created more opportunities for employees to make revenue.","There will be no training provided once you are on location.
95% of the consultants across all locations are under-qualified and subsequently giving shady advice often on customers life savings.
Double standards between coordinators and consultants - consultant job significantly easier than coordinator, yet the  commission is much higher. Consultants rely on coordinators to create business but offer little in the way of support.
Sexist and Chauvinistic working environment.
On location retainer/salaries are extremely low and promises on pay e.g. half of your accommodation paid for, are held over your head like an incentive, they aren't guaranteed.
The company requests Malta graduates write glassdoor reviews on site creating a false sense of security to potential employees.
This is a telesales job - 100+ calls a day, don't be conned into thinking you will be a finance professional within 18 months. The financial knowledge around the offices is fairly abysmal outside of a handful of senior figures who are based in Malta.

I was with a smaller group, would highly recommend not going in the summer as the groups are larger and you will be overlooked. 

I approached it with an open mind and very little experience. It gave me experience and now I have a good job back in the UK. I left DeVere after 4 months.

You do get to meet Nigel Green, that's the only good bit about hime,  he is a bit of a cult figure within the company (he is very good at sales after all).

If you have nothing else going on, go for it, it is difficult to get a foot into the financial sector and this is a good/dubious way to do it.","You have to data mine your own prospects, no one will tell you how to do this as you ultimately would 'steal' their potential prospects. 

It is more for people who have nothing to lose, either they've lost it already or just never had anything to lose to begin with.

The company still seems to be still acting like a start up when really it should be consolidating its existing clients and not going for exponential growth as before. There are competitors with a much better reputation (amongst the public and staff) and after I left at least a third of the staff went to these competitors. 

Switzerland was apparently the best place to go and from what I heard from other cities it was. You could only sustain a decent standard of living if mummy and daddy helped you out.

Coming from a financial background I can say that Josh's depth of knowledge and ability to teach are unparalleled.

504,deVere Group,A good opportunity to get in to Dubai... that’s about it.,2017-11-18,1.0,Business Development Associate,"Malta training course is fun

Industry exposure

You learn a lot about work ethic and financing vehicles 

Meet people 

Company is structured fairly well with good HR practices.

The company runs nice incentives for performers.

Lots of training sessions.","You’re constantly made to feel as though you’re never doing enough and made to feel bad for not putting in 12 hour days and working weekends.

Very toxic and cut throat environment.

Lots of swearing and unprofessionalism (especially from Nigel Green. Never heard a man of such stature come out with so much foul language and general unarticulated babble). I will note that Nigel is quite a nice guy though. 

You’re not really paid a salary. You get borrowed enough money to survive and then pay it back with commission. Which doesn’t come all too easy unless you’re paired with a top advisor who puts you on their deals. 

Being publicly berated and called out for your mistakes is common. No one ever takes you aside to tell you what you did wrong. The entire room finds out. 

You are constantly battling with a people over the company reputation. Devere has a HORRIBLE name in Dubai. You never ever say you’re from Devere because everyone see’s Devere as the ‘boogeyman’ of Dubai. Those evil financial advisors who are out to steal your money and screw you over. Everyday you have to deal with a VERY oversaturated market that is completely resistant to financial advise. Everyone here knows about Devere and hates the company. I got turned on by a group of guys in a bar when I mentioned who I works for. Not nice.

 Most appointments swerve and never sit. You can but 5 appointments in a day and I promise you only one will sit. People don’t want this service. 

Nothing is being done to combat Devere’s bad name. It’s almost ignored completely by management. You’re told to compare Devere to Apple. Everyone complains about Apple but has an iPhone! That’s the principle they use to actively combat the company reputation and its left there... 

You’re generally just a ‘phone monkey’ if you’re a coordinator. 

They give you hour long training sessions that after ten minutes you’re generally asleep.

The managers tend to be bullheaded, aggressive, cut throat jerks. The company rewards these types of people and escalates them. Not everyone is like that but the majority certainly are. 

Staff turn over is ridiculous here. People come and go all the time. In six months must have seen at least 30 people come and go. I’ve seen someone last no more than a single day! 

Very stressful job where you start at 7:30 am. 

This work environment is a real shock to the system if you’re new to finance/ sales and can turn you in to a miserable, depressive wrecked for months until you adjust. 

Being an advisor is incredibly difficult and most people fail. 

The earning potential they advertise to you, although achievable, is very unrealistic for most. 

Many people who work here have a criminal background. The company literally does not care who it takes."

Basically as a recruiter I had to hire unqualified people to waste their money relocating overseas. These people would then gather data for a few months and then quit as they had not been paid. 
Finally a select group of seniors at the company would use the gathered data to sell front loaded expensive and unstable financial products to unsuspecting clients who assumed they were dealing with financial professionals - when in fact they are ex used car dealers and double glazing salesmen with a copy of the financial times and a laptop.

- They are straight-talking, so you know exactly what is expected of you
- If you do not meet standards, you will be told. I felt this was great as this reduces the chance of you repeating tasks incorrectly in the future
- Development of a true hard-working ethic
- Sales training is second to none
- Staff who genuinely want you to become the best you can be
- Meeting so many like-minded graduates

While the position isn't for everyone, there is no other graduate scheme that comes close to providing the income progression, nor travel opportunities that deVere offer. Sometimes the tough stance can seem extreme, but it does genuinely get the best out of you and looking back, I wouldn't have had the training delivered in any other way.

I am now moving to Kuala Lumpur, which was my first choice location, to start an exciting career. The opportunities on offer for the right individual are genuinely unrivalled.","The one thing that was frustrating for me was the advertised rate of pay for the training in Malta. Despite advertising a rate for the month, the fine print states payment is on a pro-rata basis, so you actually end up with a lot less than the initial figure. 

Outside of this though, I found that the cons other people mentioned (such as long office hours), actually instilled a sense of resilience in me. So, I guess it depends on your personal outlook and what you want from a job. The deVere Group expect high effort levels and portray this throughout the recruitment process, so I don't see how this can be considered a negative when you are consistently told what is expected."
537,deVere Group,Associate Wealth Advisor - Graduate,2017-08-23,4.0,Trainee Wealth Advisor,"The Graduate programme at deVere, starting with a 3 week intensive training course in Malta provides you with an amazing opportunity to work internationally in some amazing locations straight out of University with all the support to do so after teaching you a vast amount over a relatively short space of time. The process allows you to gain valuable life skills and CISI qualification, meet like minded individuals and push yourself before entering into the field.","This is not for the faint hearted, you must be the right type of person and those who aren't are probably where the bad reviews come from - don't believe everything you read.

Watch out: Most competitors have their employees with picture on web page-devere hasnt because employee changing rate in a year is 100-200%! Not good for clients...
If you wanna be a SALES MAN doing hundreds of cold calls work there...or at vodafone...or movistar, or sell stuff in Media-Markt (at least you get a fix salary there...). If you wanna be an investment adviser, financial professional, taking care of your clients, aboid to work there at any price. Before (and now again) I was an equity and options trader, institutional adviser for mutual funds, hedge funds, family offices for over 20 years...so after only a few month of the ""devere-experience"" I had to leave.

Not very often someone can say they started their first job in Dubai overlooking the Palm Island.
Uncapped earnings is very rewarding if you're the type of person who is ready to put in the effort. By that I mean 12-14 hrs of work a day, 10 hrs in the office and the rest at home. Good feeling when you realise you're miles ahead of everyone back in the UK doing other grad programs.  
Learn a lot from the training program, would honestly pay for it. Offsets the low income provided for the first 3 weeks till a certain extent. 
The management does look after everyone pretty well  and they do their best to find the best fit for you. However if you are not you in the training period you may be placed with the wrong advisors and not meet their expectations. 
Best part of the 3 weeks of training is the training management. If you like a LADish banterish environment, you will love it. Honestly miss them.","The program is not very clear with regards to earning structure in general. 
The training program can be disheartening when you realise that you're being overworked for very little pay. The reason given by the management is for tax liabilities and to make you less reliant on salary and more on results based commission. 
The diversity in the offices around the world means that goals of local offices could be different to the company. End of the day, there is very little you can know  or a managers in Malta can know if you are the fit for the office."

First of all, if you're a graduate, this is NOT a grad scheme. They employ every and anyone, it only operates like a grad scheme when you're in Malta.
Once, you go to your location, 98% of people will probably not even have A-levels including your senior manager.

- Yes you will do a deal here and there but it will not reach your pockets.
- You are paid a ""retainer"" of £800 - £1100 depending on your location. The small commission you get will be used to pay this off every time.
- You'll probably need at least £3,000 in savings, which you will go through fast.
- It is possible to find a big deal, BUT it is a needle in a haystack, by then you have done little/no deals and have months of your retainer to pay off.
- There's no such thing as a HR department.
- You will probably be smarter than the upper management.
- It is 99.9% cold calling (apart from countries where it is banned)
- This is not a job for grads, all but 2 of the people on my course are left in this company.
- The company has a really bad reputation.
- This is the worst way to enter into the financial industry, don't do it to yourself"

Nobody would give you any advice, to my experience. The management is completely lack of leadership in my opinion, unfortunately. They don't know how to motivate people, only doing there their own things when they are in the office. 
Very little sense of belongings in the office,  I just felt like I only used the desk and phone there.

Unless you go through graduate program do not expect your visa to be completed within 6months- basically meaning you are working commission only despite the advertised £2000 a month salary.
Promise of becoming a wealth manager (where earning potential is genuinely brilliant) in 2 years. Most proficient coordinators take over 4 years to reach that level. 
Average earning for coordinators is around £20k- way under the advertised amount.
Reputation of company is very poor."
579,deVere Group,A blessing in disguise,2017-05-08,2.0,Anonymous Employee,"- The sales training is the best I've had in fairness
- The delivery of it may seem harsh, and they're brutal if you get something wrong. Having said that, if you're thick skinned, it does actually ingrain it in you.","- Definition of boiler room management and culture from senior staff. During a morning office meeting, as a new starter with no training what so ever on QROPS I asked a question, as I had been given a client who's portfolio was a complete mess, he hadn't been dealt with by an Advisor for years and he was angry. I told the senior manager that I didn't really know what I was doing with it,  it was too complicated for me at this moment in time as I had been in the industry for a couple of months and like I say with no trainign on QROPs and the client was angry. In front of the whole office, I was told that ""maybe I wasnt cut out for this role and that all future QROPs clients which you can earn good commissions from will be given to other people instead"". And that was the end of that... Except I still had to manage the client.
- The bonus structure is ridiculously complicated. Might as well have been in hieroglyphics. No one in the London office earned bonus other than one adviser (who was handed the best clients by a country mile. NO ONE.
- Which leads me onto my next point, at the interview stage I was told that no one earned less than 60k in their first year.... No one was earning above their basic salary.
- The level of arrogance within the business was outstanding too. Waltzed in with their gold Rolex's, tailored suits, Louis Vuitton briefcases, while the advisors and particularly new starters were brought to the front of the office and endured their suits, shirts, ties and shoes being ridiculed by the senior staff for not being 'deVere' (perhaps something to do with a minimum London wage salary and no bonus potential). We were also never told what the dress code was... So if you show up on your first week with anything other than a white shirt with double cuffs, dark blue, dark grey or black suit and black shoes with black socks... You're told that you must go out and buy new suits etc..... Again, on close minimum London wage, so that'll be a Primark number then."

Not only are you cold calling, you are in fact doing the same job as middle aged people that have been to prison, but you wasted 3 years at uni and he didn't.
There is no grad programme whatsoever.
Management are promoted due to how much money they have made, absolutely nothing to do with their management skills - Because none of them have any.
The company culture is shocking. If you have not seen the movie 'Boiler Room' I would suggest watching that before applying to get a feel for how they talk to you in the office. 
You are not even  salaried, you work off a retainer - which nobody is out of.
deVere sell you a dream, and when you get to location you soon realise it is not what you thought it would be.
You have to bribe and pay people to get expat's telephone numbers in order to cold call them.
The reputation of the company is absolutely awful.
The training is terrible.
They do not help you in any way to set your life up when you move overseas, you get 1 week in a hotel and then you are on your own, good luck finding somewhere nice that quick with no help!
THEY EMPLOY ANYONE! 
A lot of employees are only there to make their commission whether or not the client can afford their premiums.
Everyone is replaceable. The turnover is ridiculously high.
You will be told to succeed you must work 24/7, there is no work/life balance."

Malta is a good opportunity to learn different sides of the business, and about yourself as a professional. Go in with a thick-skin, but be prepared to learn, a lot, and quickly.","I don't personally see this as too much of a con, but maybe the working hours are excessive with regard to some people's expectations (as I said, I think this is not such a con, but some will see it that way.

605,deVere Group,Grads - Read this before applying,2016-11-22,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"Easy interview process, do not feel like you have achieved anything by getting the job. If you say you want to make money and you are determined then they will take you.

Looks good on your CV when getting another job, as long as you say you didn't agree with how devour works and thats why you left.","I went to Malta for the 6 weeks and then got sent to Dubai. Malta was very unorganised but fair play to Mark Reed he does his best and is an extremely nice guy. Lindsey has been the best person I have worked with. Nigel is an exceptional speaker. 

At the end of Malta they ask you to write one of these reviews on the office computers and you have no choice. 

Malta is completely different to Dubai, Malta has a structure but Dubai is embarrassing. When Nigel comes into the office in Dubai managers change and are really nice to you and then when he leaves they just motivate you through fear and tell you that you are worthless and if you don't get a good call time or don't make business you are going because you are a waste of space basically. even couple of weeks they tell get all the coordinators in a room and tell you how bad you are all doing and you need to sort it out. When i was there for my stay around each month there would be 15 or so new people start and around 10 leave. You are just a number to them, if you don't make money you are invisible to them. You are expected to go out and find data and even buy the data from companies like car rental places, go back to the office and then call them all day. I had a meeting because i wasn't working hard enough, i was working 8am till 6:30-7pm and then i got questioned to why i didn't come in on the weekends. In Malta you have CISI level 1 paid for and then after that you have to pay for everything and you are not allowed to look at you book in working hours. so you have to do it all after work. To be honest they couldn't care less if you got your qualifications or not. Some advisors who have been there 2 years have only got level 1 and they don't get questioned because they are making money. 

You do not learn how to be good at your job which is a financial adviser/wealth manager, you become an expert on selling the fees of saving plans and an expert on answering questions potential client have about the fees and that is it. that is what makes the money. After that and after they have got the money out of them they either are passed to a new adviser who skips the coordinator role and they have to deal with the complains of the plan not making money. 

This job is a sales role in a call centre format. all you are assessed on is your call time and amount of meetings you book, that is it. 

Get your visa before you go to dubai, if you don't you have to do a visa run every month which is a 5 hour drive to Oman and costs around 50 pounds each time (you do this on a weekend).

Managers have no idea. seriously no idea. seriously. They try to motivate through fear and go on about how great they are and how when they started they made loads of money and how great they are, one of the first conversations i had with my senior manager was with a fellow graduate, he stood there and pointed to us both and said ""i make more money than both your parents combined"". 

What they say you are going to earn is also not accurate, in one of our weekly meetings all of the coordinators got told why are you going out so much (even though the weekend before we got told off because we wasn't networking enough) anyway he said why are you going out so much, this job is made so you can only afford a couple of pints on the weekend, when you get adviser/consultant thats when you make the money. Numerous occasions you are threatened to being let go. We also got told if we are thinking about taking any holidays in your first year then you need to question your commitment to the job. 

If you think you are gods gift, arrogant and think everyone likes you then you will fit in perfectly. 

Mark Reed and Nigel are nice guys, I don't think they know what actually happens in Dubai with the grads and coordinators and thats why the staff turnover is 80% each year. They let anyone through the door knowing some will stay and if you leave then they don't care anyway. 

Simple diseconomies of scale, company has got to big to fast and poor Nigel cant control everything, I'm sure if he knew he would change it.


My advice to you if you really want this job is to stay in Malta. In Malta they only sell pension transfers and yes some people will really benefit from a pension transfer but what some people don't know is that if you transfer your pension that the advisor get a healthy commission from your pension, around 5%. 

If you want to get good at your job and get qualified then do not work for deVere, if you want to wait 2-3 years to be a consultant and then have the chance of making a lot of money OFF OTHER PEOPLES MONEY then this is the job for you. 

If you have a degree then there is better options."

The company is run by unprofessional, disrespectful con's that do not value staff, only regard them as numbers. Excessive swearing, unrealistic targets and general aggressive attitude by senior staff is normal. 

Job descriptions are not accurate with selective wording of 'potential' benefits without any consideration of the restrictions. One example includes many locations having requirements such as specific ages or licensing restrictions meaning only a selected few are actually available out of the ones advertised. Further, each employee would be sent out on a tourist visa, not working visa. Secondly, earning potential is unrealistic and given a location that living expenses are high, wages would not be sufficient for covering the cost of rent and living. Thirdly, there is no work life balance. If you don't work 14/15 hour days, including weekends then you fall behind. 

My time with deVere ended being publicly humiliated for simply mishearing a time and shouted at by a senior member of staff like a school child. 

All members of staff that have progressed to another level are unhelpful, unfriendly and rude to new staff. It is based as a hierarchy and without 'getting in there' with various members of staff to share their secrets of gaining data it is easy to become isolated and fall behind. 

Overall, I would not recommend this job to anyone, of any age - especially those looking for a career internationally or to grow within financial services as you will be sat on LinkedIn each day cold calling individuals not interested in dealing with a company with such a bad reputation."

Incredible work ethic instilled to employees throughout the 6 weeks programme makes you realise what you're capable of within the work related arena returning to the UK's 9-5 hours after Malta seems like you're working part time.
2.Opportunity to live and work within Malta all flights and accomodation and transfers to and from the office and airport and meals during the first week sorted for you all of which ran impeccably which was some achievement given the amount of graduates on the course.
3.Oppurtunity to work in anyone of 72 offices post Malta which generally all are open given you meet deVeres criteria at end of the 6 weeks.
4.Gain a professional qualification in the form of your level 1 in CISI
5.Truly meritocratic environment some of deVeres most succesful employees are in their 20s and have been promoted/gained clients purely through their own means. Promoting individuals who are good enough regardless of age or experience/qualifications(could also be a negative)
6.Very hands on CEO(again could be a negative somewhat of a marmite character and divided the grads)
7.Earning potential truly is colossal all the senior managers and consultants are very transparent with their earnings and we also were sent figures every week there are employees out in the field earning truly vast sums of money far more than anything advertised in the city.","1.THIS IS A COLD CALLING SALES ROLE!!! I was aware that the role was sales based as most IFAs are ultimately salesmen who go out to attract new clients. The majority thought that the role would be much more technical due to professional qualifications and being within financial services.
2.One or two individuals polluting the office culture which truly needs to be cleaned up casual sexism,racism and homophobia throughout the training period.
3.Respect graduates more making graduates do press ups and putting bags on their heads for asking 'stupid' questions,i thought i was joining the worlds largest financial consultancy, not the parachute regiment.
4.Very inconsistent ranking of graduates, being given poor ratings for having a rubbish suit or a poor selection of ties. 
5.Setting unrealistic targets during training encouraging making yourself physically ill when mining for names through getting 2-3 hours sleep per night in order to gain more points and a higher ranking than whoever is sat next to you.(some may see this as a positive and it may spur them on but 99% would be put off by this)
6.Taking on too many graduates and not having enough data to complete certain rotations of the course being sat for a week cold calling the same numbers or random companies and pitching products to them.
7.Retainer payment far less than minimum wage 1100 pounds a month for 70 hour weeks works out at £3.90 an hour without including the hours of mining outside of office hours."

4. Brilliant management in certain areas. If you're paired with consultants who can take you under your wing and train you, you will do very well. 
5. Motivation, Hard Work, Dedication are implemented and integrated in the culture and work place daily. I've never worked in an environment where there is so much competition. 
6. Currently just completed the 6 weeks of training in Malta and if you work hard, you will come out of top. Simply put, if you work harder than everyone else you will reek the benefits. 
7. Only the hardest working individuals successfully make it in this company so you will be surrounded by like-minded individuals when you get to the top.","1. Sales orientated role. People who want to be in Wealth Management and use technical finance skills will find this role difficult. Being an independent consultancy it is selling particular products. You can make it what you want and you can use in-depth financial knowledge when advising but it is limited to the investment vehicles that deVere Group use. 
2. Mainly a phone role for the first couple of years. Mining on LinkedIn and calling potential clients is a unusual way to find clients. 
3. Professionalism is lacking in some areas. Colleagues with un-ironed suits/loose ties etc... You get the impression that they don't uphold the highest of standards in every aspect which is what you would want from a financial institution.
4. deVere does give you a good platform to learn the in-depth fundamentals of finance and wealth management but you have to do it independently.
5. A lot of morally/naive/immature individuals, but stay away from people like that and you will succeed. Do not get peer pressured into the unprofessional attitude some develop here. Work hard, be morally in-check, professional and you will do great. 
6. If you have faith that you're good enough and that you will literally work hard to be the best, you will succeed. If you only apply only half of your true effort then you will not make it. People have left because they feel the company commission structure is too risky and unethical and it is more of a sales role. At the end of the day, it will pay better than 99.99% of financial institutions everywhere in the world if you're successful, so it is up to you to decide whether you are willing to put everything into work that may not pay off massively for a couple of years.

This in turn means you are working along side likeminded individuals who have the drive and intelligence similar to yourself. This is a huge part for me. 

The graduate programme is an extremely intense start into the world of financial services. The training you receive in the first 6 weeks will certainly enable you to hit the ground running. The management in place are very knowledgeable people who are always will to advise and help.

The opportunity to go to one of their 71 locations is a fantastic scope for travel, the international aspects lets you engage with differerent cultures in and out of work.","deVere sometimes receives a bad reviews as it is one of the largest financial organisations in the world, and with that comes some negatively. Something that I have not known before I arrived was cold calling is a huge factor of the business and needs to be done 3/4 hours a day. This can be tedious and sometimes pointless if the data you have is not sufficient. 

Also the contract states that working hours are regular working days however in reality you have to be in the office for 6am and leave around 6/7pm - this is a problem for myself, however the wage for the amount of hours doesn't correspond. 

Graduates are not seen as graduates to some degree, they are regarded as 'expendable employees' - which can be demotivating at times. Also for my intake we had the largest amount in the company history, which sometimes became a organised mess as people were thrown in the deep end so to speak."

- You will become more thick skinned and hardened to the world of sales","- Bad firm reputation; you will fight against this in the field (when trying to get clients) and when applying for new jobs.
- Bad ethics and practice; the firm operates in grey areas of morality and legality
- As a grad you feel massively undervalued by senior management and those you are directly working with.
- Asking questions is discouraged, and is seen to be ""rocking the boat"". You are dealing with salesmen and will get a sales answer, i.e. BS or no answer, to most questions asked.
- Compensation structure means that many people fail before they get to see any returns. By being paid with a retainer you effectively become more and more in debt to the company until you get a commission which then goes to them, or you leave the firm.
- deVere do not care if you have any mental ability; the only thing they want is someone who will work hard without thinking too much; this is why graduates from poor universities with poor university grades will be accepted onto the course. This I felt eroded any value of the grad scheme on day one.

The job description was for a Financial Advisor but it was simply a cold calling job. You had to bring your own computer, pay for any work done by unpaid graduates and suffer some very poor management. 
Sales meetings consisted of long boring speeches by a very boastful sales manager who told you several times a week how much he was earning, and what tacky things he wasted his money on. Targets were like a weird religion to them. Having listened to how many sales he made in his first 8 weeks I beat that in 5 weeks as I knew people in the local market. 
Fortunately I'd walked out by then (as had 25% of the office!), so I gave the business to one of their local competitors. They seemed to have no respect for professional qualification and got around UK regulations by basing themselves overseas. Restrictions on who you could contact meant only the managers could contact potential clients that might have any interest in their products (leading to more boasting about how wonderful they were and how awful everyone else in the office was). Many local expats had little time for them and had banned their cold calling (understandably as it took place during their working days). Basically it really is a firm to avoid."

Search Devere group in Google and you can read all about them !!
Ask yourself why such a large and prestigous financial advisor is not based in London or New York ? but instead in the great financial centres of Malta , Cyprus and Dubai !!! ???
If you were a rich person should you really invest large amounts of money with a company you have never heard of ? why not invest with one of the larger more well known global banks that have the size and breadth of knowledge to actually be able to give advice and know what they are doing.
The advice given is really about earning commission for the commission hungry sales people and managers, not at all in the interests of clients."

A company that highly rewards hard work.","Definitely NOT for everyone! Certainly not for the faint-hearted.
For 6 weeks, although we have been assured that it is very different in the field, there is no work life balance for graduates. Expect 3-6 hours sleep and 12 hour days minimum. Expect to be pushed well beyond the limits of what you thought was reasonable.
The general culture of some employees is decidedly lacking in empathy which can make you feel uncomfortable, but provided you stick to your own personal views I don't see why this would  be a problem.

Your fellow grads and the wealth of experience in the office. As you endure early morning after early morning, often arriving in the office in the dark and leaving in the dark the on thing that gets you through is the camaraderie. You have a great laugh and the competitive edge keeps a buzz going in the office. As for the learning opportunities, the Malta office is home to some of deVere's top people. A fountain of knowledge which will satisfy your thirst for learning.","You will have bad days without a doubt. You spirit will be crushed on multiple occasions but its all part of the process and you wouldn't have been chosen to be there in the first place if you didn't have the mental energy to pull through. You have to give up any notion of free time, this scheme has no weekends off and you will find yourself sat at your kitchen table working as soon as you get home in the evening."
698,deVere Group,Very disappointing - Proceed with extreme caution (or better still AVOID),2016-02-14,1.0,(Trainee) Associate Wealth Consultant,"Good opportunity to earn lots of money, but you've got to think differently from everyone else who's trodden the well worn path of failure before you. 
The training course in Malta is quite good fun","Where to begin? Here are my top 10
1. Commission only for the 1st 3-month probation period, but you don't find that out until after the training course
2. COLD CALLING: If you aren't comfortable with calling strangers who are generally too busy to speak with you, or trying to get past receptionists who are well practiced at bouncing phone sales techniques, avoid de Vere completely and save yourself the discomfort. 
3. Virtually no support to get you started, you're on your own. When you do get a coordinator you have to pay them to support you, on top of all the other expenses you've already incurred to get started.
4. Expenses: You need to pay for all your own flights, accommodation and living expenses from any savings pot you may have already built up. If you're prepared to risk £5-10k to see what's possible, then you're probably OK.   
5. Everyone for themselves! Established consultants (in Switzerland at least) don't share their referrals. Those that have been successful will get more referrals than they can possibly handle. Rather than sharing them with new starters, the normal behaviour is to hang on to them. Not good team players
6. Useless information: The ongoing training assumes that you've already got a portfolio and can put that information to good use. Not in any way useful for new starters that need help building their portfolio.
7. Rubbish local managers. I can only speak for de Vere Switzerland, where the two country/area managers spent more time back slapping each other and presenting themselves with achievement awards than managing and developing people.
8. Unrealistic target setting: Shout outs each Monday morning of what business you thought you could pursue were always challenged upwards which made them unachievable. 
9. Pedantry: To be 'told off' for getting in to the office 4 minutes later than normal (while not actually missing anything important) was not only highly annoying, but missed the bigger picture mentioned in points 1 - 8 above
10. Negative press: de Vere Switzerland is widely reviled by people who are utterly fed up with being pestered by successive calls from different consultants trying to break through. If you're going to pick a country in which to work, go somewhere the negative press hasn't built up."
699,deVere Group,Great experience - ignore the bitter reviews,2016-02-11,5.0,Trainee Wealth Advisor,"Great experience all around, good training and promising career. It is difficult, there is no denying it but it is a fact that people earn the figures that are spoken about, but these are only earned by the  advisers that put the client first and offer realistic and helpful advice. Advisers that come out to make a quick quid will find them selves out of luck and on the first flight home. Don't take this job if you are afraid of taking a risk/ or expect to be paid a huge salary for doing very little. 
If you want to be challanged, work hard and earn good money in a different country, then there is absolutely no question. Malta as a graduate was by far the best thing i have done so far, and i have no doubt that my new location will be just as good.","Tighter recruitment, some awful employees are allowed to location - admittedly they don't last. lack of transparency between job roles, everything can be misconstrued as smoke and mirrors tactics."

Lack of progression

Overall I have found working for deVere:

•	Gives you the opportunity to work in some exciting and dynamic locations

•	Gives you the opportunity for high remuneration very quickly. Rather than joining a company and not benefiting from high remuneration until you reach a senior level. 

•	Allows you to earn an amount inline with your work ethic. There is a simple formula to success in this company. If you work hard you will succeed. Even if this isn’t the case immediately, the management will help you if they see your efforts. 

•	While you are expected to work hard, I enjoy a great social live in Dubai and work with great people.","If you are looking all the rewards working for such a company as deVere can bring, but are not willing to couple it with a strong work ethic. There is no point.

From time to time there are new recruits who unfortunately don’t succeed and try to bring you down as well as slate the company.  This is often reflected in forums like this and is why I have decided to write this review!"

Its challenging but very rewarding. You get the chance to work in some of the best places in the world. Half your accommodation is paid for which is a massive help when you are starting up. If you are hard working and self motivated you will be noticed and you will be rewarded for it.,"It can take a while to build up a client base so in some locations the basic can be difficult to relocate on but for most its more than enough. People can be negative about this role because you're not spoon fed. You get out of this job what you put in so if you want everything handed to you, expect amazing money for little work then thats why this job is not for you."
712,deVere Group,deVere Group Graduate Scheme,2016-01-11,5.0,Financial Coordinator/Trainee Wealth Advisor,"I have been working with deVere through the graduate scheme since March 2015. I am having an excellent time so far. Malta was extremely challenging, much like the job itself but as are the rewards. I am working for to two excellent consultants who push me too succeed but are both extremely adept and caring when it comes to working with clients. As well as the rewarding nature of the work in general, deVere offers a variety of unique opportunities that few other companies can, such as trips to a variety of sporting competitions and exciting destinations. Some of which I have been lucky enough to qualify for. The graduate opportunity also provides a fantastic platform to go on to achieve great things within deVere and the wider financial world. Whilst on the programme I have been able to complete two professional exams and am in the process of completing a third, which combined with the knowledge one picks up simply by being in the everyday environment has put me in excellent stead to eventually step up to become a consultant. Finally the experience the company offers to live around the world is fantastic, I am currently living in Switzerland and am relishing the potential opportunity to move elsewhere in the future.","An issue that is often raised by a number of successful and unsuccessful grads is the demanding nature of the work, particularly with reference to working hours. It is true that the job requires 100% commitment and late nights and weekend stints are not uncommon, but from my personal experience such efforts always pay off and I personally have no issue with putting in this level of commitment to reap the benefits it presents.

Another issue is that achieving fantastic financial gains is not immediate. Whilst the money does eventually come, the first few months can be difficult and whilst a retainer is in place and rent is contributed towards, not everyone is comfortable getting by on just this prior to eventually achieving a more sustainable income."
713,deVere Group,Trainee Wealth Advisor,2016-01-11,5.0,Wealth Advisor (Previously A Trainee),"I have been working with DeVere Group now for just less than 2 years and was part of the graduate programme. I first started my training in Malta, with everything paid for (flights, accommodation) and a base salary before I was put into the field. The training in Malta was excellent, the management have one-to-one training and you are able to gain insight from the CEO Nigel Green himself who is an inspiring individual. DeVere also aid you in passing level 1 of CISI (The Chartered Institute for Securities & Investment), they pay for your exam and provide study aids throughout the Malta training course. After Malta I was sent to Shanghai to continue my training and work one-on-one with a consultant. This involved para-planning, dealing with existing clients, learning about financial solutions and passing my level 3 CISI. I have now been a fully qualified wealth advisor for a year and the opportunity is like no other. I now have associates working under me who I train, while expanding my client base in Shanghai. The role has a massive learning curve and is not for the faint-hearted as the hours are long but extremely rewarding. DeVere Group provides you with all the tools you need to become a successful advisor, and the reason people fail is that they do not have the determination, hunger for success or positive attitude that you need. I would recommend this role for any graduate that is looking for a fast-track to success in the world's largest independent consultancy that has the right mental attitude!","This role is not easy, they are certain requirements expected by DeVere graduates; positive attitude, dynamic fast paced learning, hunger for success. I am positive that no other multi-national company can provide you with the training, tools and opportunity that DeVere does but please do not expect it to be easy!"
714,deVere Group,advisor,2016-01-08,1.0,Investment Advisor Representative,the senior management hide away in malta and filter away millions in peoples life savings. They are over priced and completely rubbish financial products stacked in favour of the company not the client.,"yeah cons, the place is one big con and it starts when you start working for them they are worst organization I have ever come across full of failed double glazing salesman with inflated egos. Zero ability and a streak of arrogance i have never come across anywhere before, they have been kicked out of Singapore for miss selling and have a very very bad reputation"
715,deVere Group,Horrendous,2016-01-06,1.0,,"I have not one single good comment about this company. It is an absolutely awful, dishonest, delusional mess with no standards.","I worked in the middle east office for less than what you could afford to live on - wages didn't even cover rent. This is a company full of uneducated 'financial advisors' (sales people) who use the likes of Bloomberg app to educate themselves enough to blag their way through a pitch. Some complete the minimum basic exams, but for the most part they know nothing about finances other than which savings plan will earn them the most commission, with a wide spread attitude of your money is better in their pocket than yours. 
'Management' are given the title based on how much money they've earned in the past, not their actual suitability to the job. So should you have an issue you wish to escalate, you will be passed to someone even more dishonest than the last. The customer service department are not there to deal with complaints or offer any kind of help, they are there specifically to catch missed sales of existing clients after the first advisor has pocketed their commission and all of a sudden can't be reached any more. 
Apart from the dishonesty and ruthlessness of the whole company, the most infuriating thing is that these people actually think they have some sort of entitlement to clients money. Before they've even met with a prospective client, they're counting their commission and planning how to spend it. The disregard these 'advisors' hold for people and their hard earned money is unbelievable. The way they treat their staff is incredible and I guarantee these 'managers' would NEVER be given a position in any respectable company.
My advice to anyone looking to take up employment with this company is to be extremely careful, if you are the dishonest sales person looking to feel important and pocket a lot of cash at the expense of a family man handing over his savings in the hopes of a better future - this is for you, however, don't believe all the promises they make. Many of the 'financial advisors' wearing tailored suits and groomed to perfection are living in construction prefabs in the middle of the desert - really hit the big time! 
The months I spent here were honestly some of the worst, pathetic little people trying to strip your confidence and scaring you into accepting this kind of treatment. If you have any respect for yourself, or indeed respect for other people you should stay away from this absolute deluded world these little boys have created for themselves."

Excessive charges on products that go straight to the pocket of the top management and Nigel Green. Just google Devere UAE review to see the extent of the damages they have caused to clients. Don't believe the lies of the recruiters on the amount of money new employees make. The truth is that 70% of new starters give up after 2 months, and after a year the figure is up to 90%."

You have to paid for your expenses ( While you are in training ) I mean ( Flight Tickets, Accomodation, Food )"
731,deVere Group,Good IT team and SEO,2015-08-04,1.0,,"They seem to have started to make a move in online platforms adding there positive comments to balance the ones coming from the people who left deVere. I suggest the ones interested in working for deVere, check all the available opinion sites, and do not get lured in by the Amazing/Incredible/Supranatural-type comments on the ones that deVere team has found out about. Other pro: great stay at Hilton in Malta for a week!","The rotation is still quite high. From my group in the Malta ""training"" 14 out of 14 people are not working already for deVere. And that was in April. Something to think about."
732,deVere Group,Life changing...,2015-08-02,5.0,Regional Recruitment Manager of Middle East & India,"Having worked for some of the largest companies previously, I have never seen such a large opportunity for personal progression, career development and earning capacity as deVere-Group provides it's employees. 
I am personally experiencing it and have now worked in two different locations, Europe and the UAE where i'm currently based in the Dubai Marina office. 

The working environment is top class, lots of driven, motivated professionals in a state of the art office striving to be the best and working hard. Really gets the best out of people and has a great management structure leading from the front.","Not many I guess but some new starters come a little ill prepared and unfocused. More preparation and planning should be done to give the best chance of success. I found it a difficult move in the early days, but more than worth it looking back."
733,deVere Group,Graduate Programme,2015-07-15,5.0,Graduate,"During my time on this programme I have been pushed to my limits and discovered skills and attributes that were previously hidden.

For those leaving University wanting to work for a company that offers early career progression, the opportunity to earn impressive remuneration that is uncapped and work in some interesting and dynamic cities around the world, this is the perfect programme for you. 

The company culture is very much that of rewarding your for hard work and encouraging you to progress in terms of qualifications, targets and overall understanding of what is a fast paced and constantly changing industry. 

I am very happy with the programme and feel part of a company that is as enthusiastic about my career as I am.","This is not for the faint hearted. Although the company does offer high earning potential, early career progression and the opportunity to work abroad, they have very high expectations from you. If they feel you are not giving 100% they WILL let you know. 

You can at times be expected to work long hours. During the Malta Academy phase, you can expect to start work at 6am. This is due to differing time zones.  

Although the opportunity is far from exclusive to those with a financial background, you are expected to be a quick learner. You need to arrive, learn and add value almost immediately. If you are not naturally motivated, self sufficient and thick skinned you may struggle. At some stage you will definitely be out of your comfort zone. I have been multiple times. 

The role is extremely front loaded. i.e. it is very difficult at the start but gets easier overtime. You will likely doubt yourself and your abilities at some point during the first 6 months. If you have high career ambitions but are unable to match it in terms of work ethic and determination, don't waste your time."
734,deVere Group,financial co-ordinator,2015-07-15,5.0,Anonymous Employee,You can earn uncapped and are supported by a great team of people. You also have the chance to see the world and experience new culture. An exciting challenge.,"You need to be very driven. You need to graft because the rewards don't come at the click of a finger but you just need to get over that wall, which is the most difficult part."
735,deVere Group,Incredible Global Opportunity,2015-07-14,5.0,Trainee Wealth Advisor,"I decided to work for deVere because of its culture, earning potential and the opportunity to work in one of our 73 offices located globally. This is a firm that believes hard work pays off and nothing is handed to you on a silver plate. If you are driven, determined and hungry for success, this is surely a step in the right direction. 

I was on the Graduate Scheme in Malta for 7 weeks before moving to one of our ASEAN offices. In regards to Malta, it was a boot camp for Finance. It was tough as you had to work long hours as well as study for a professional qualification. Effort paid off and I now work with a highly professional team who are also a great laugh. Continuous training and support is provided and the Managers go above and beyond to make sure that we are pushing ourselves and gaining the knowledge we need to succeed within the Wealth Management industry.","10-12 hour days are not for everyone and I guess some would see this as a con. This is not for someone who wants a 9-5 job.

There is a lot of calling involved and a lot complain about this aspect as it is a big part of your job for at least the first year. However, i'm going to use this as a little rant, you have to look at the bigger picture. Financial Advisors aren't going to have High Net Worth individuals throwing themselves at you asking to advise them on what to do with their money. A lot of trust is needed. A successful advisor writes business with referred clients, but obviously to get the clients in the first place you need to build a foundation."

The only down side is said individual has to be utterly without scruple, prepare to be bored senseless and make cold call after call to unsuspecting individuals around the world. In the office before 6am for 80% of the scheme, hours before anyone else, making 4.5 hours worth of cold calls per day and given no stimulation whatsoever. There is no actual learning about the industry or products, simply training so you can make continuous cold calls. The management team are very 'hands off' - you don't receive regular updates on your progress save when they simply look at a graph and generalise. You will be asked to work 12/13 hour days and do 2/3 hours of homework every evening on top of this."

755,deVere Group,International Graduate Programme - Challenging but rewarding,2014-12-06,5.0,Trainee Wealth Adviser,"Malta is very challenging and it pushes you outside your normal comfort zone. The company believes in you stretching yourself, and if you're not outside your comfort zone you are not  really growing. You are put in teams for most of Malta with work in recruitment, FX and Investment/pensions. And you have several days on deVere the industry and the products. Its good that there is assistance for the Chartered Investment Certificate before you leave. Most get through it. Trainers are excellent and you really feel you are learning and growing and developing skills. Quite a bit of responsibility. Competitive for sure. In the offices networking is paramount. You need to be able to get out there and mix with people, clubs and societies etc. Being a people person is a must.","You are definitely challenged and it it sometimes soul searching, sometimes frustrating, sometimes annoying. But on the whole great fun. You are sometimes up at 6 because of other countries time zones, but you expect that from a global company. You have a lot to get through especially if you don't have a business degree and prioritising can be difficult but somehow if you are a positive  person it gets done. In the offices its usually 8 am start."
756,deVere Group,Work harder than you ever thought and have the time of your life.,2014-11-27,5.0,Financial Coordinator,"deVere gives an opportunity to anyone willing to work hard, apply what they are being told and are genuinely hungry for more. I spent a year in their offices and every morning going to work was exiting because of the challenging environment and great work place atmosphere. The CEO is approachable and attentive. There are so many rewards for positive results, so much so that your potential earning power fades in the background (although extremely large).","One day you will feel like nothing is too hard and nobody can stop you. The next can be the complete opposite. This is where most people loose faith in their abilities and leave. It is those who push through who will see the light and be successful. This is the difficult part and is just the way things are done. Colleagues and superiors will all tell you the same thing when you are down, it is hard to believe them at that point and motivation can reach new lows. Devere doesn't have the time or the patience for demotivated workers. Don't rely on a salary, there is an option but it takes a long time to come through and battling with your superiors is not what you need when you start. Walk in the door with enough savings to keep you going on the bare minimum for at least 2 months because in the beginning it can be very hard to earn any money at all."
757,deVere Group,No Support,2014-10-15,1.0,Wealth Manager,There is potential to earn large commissions,"only commission based, but more importantly no support when in role, this was certainly the case in the Moscow office.
I saw many many people come to Moscow to follow a dream, only to receive no support when going to see clients and failing, leaving Moscow having spent their savings.
No a great way to treat any employees,  but the deVere mentality is simple, they didn't make it because they didn't work hard enough - maybe this always the case!"
758,deVere Group,Associate Wealth Consultant,2014-10-14,4.0,Associate Wealth Consultant,"-Great earning potential if you put effort in - All a numbers game. 
-Work environment is extremely friendly.

-Managers are always willing to assist with prep all the way through to the presentation.","-Commission only position. 
-Commission payouts can take up to 4 months - Very irregular. It can become a headache to fight with deVere payments department to get your commission. 
-Commission earning talked about in the interviews are not realistic in the first year. 
-Do not see promotions within the company due to managers being there from the beginning."
