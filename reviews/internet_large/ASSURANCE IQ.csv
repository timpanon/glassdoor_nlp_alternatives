6,ASSURANCE IQ,"Strong corporate culture, exciting business vision",2022-03-11,5.0,Product Management,"Despite acquisition by Prudential in 2019, we're not integrated and maintain a separate identity and culture. While de facto no longer a start-up, a surprising amount of that mindset has been retained. It's a safe place to try ideas and fail fast. CEO and Technology leaders are relatable, and open both to sharing their thoughts and hearing yours. Invests in building and maintaining a culture that people want to be part of, including not hiring ""brilliant jerks"". There are several ex-Amazon here, and none are the toxic type. Comp can be competitive, and there are good opportunities to move up, or move around. Offices in Seattle and Toronto are lovely, but plenty of people are long-term remote.
The evolving business strategy is an experience you won't get many places. The legacy business vision is profitable, but future growth will require a more customer-centric model. Changing the wings on the airplane while the plane is still climbing is a fascinating problem, it's like living in a business school case study. I want us to be successful, but even if we're not this might be a once-in-a-career journey.","Hard to feel proud of the legacy business model that doesn't put customer experience first. How many employees would recommend shopping for insurance to their family and friends today?
Though Pru gives us a long leash, being part of a public company stops us moving quite as fast in some directions. This is understandable...but can still be frustrating."

Good steady money (When system works)","To many to list.
This used to be a wonderful place to work where I could make a great living.
When I worked as an agent I made more money than I ever had in my life....
Until they started farming their ""leads"" from surveys for gift cards and bait and switch ads.

Everyday I take calls for things as asinine as people responing to an ad where they will get a free check in the mail to pay for life insurance because they are born before a certain year and much worse things than that. My business tanked due to the lead quality changes.

About a year or so ago I changed to doing lead gen for them as a ""guide"" same thing was making great money until the lead quality changed yet again.
Now they have 98% medicare advantage ""leads"" that should be dialed in OCTOBER as they wont be eligible to shop until then. Only eligible shoppers for these are DSNIP clients and very rare SEP cases. And when you do ask these prospects if they are looking for a better plan their respone is almost always the same. ""No I was trying to apply for this free cash card online."" Meaning your lucky to generate one useable data piece for every 100 calls.

Hopefully it goes back to how it was a few weeks ago where it at least dials a fair mix of data types so you can at minumum take a swing at what your dialing."

Wait times of 45 minutes??? They do outbound calls and the majority of people have no interest and ask to be put on Do Not Call list. They have very bad computer systems (a joke), no support with the numerous problems. Problems such as need to change payment date: can't. Have to start application all over again. Client gives incorrect health information but finally has correct information: can't change application while still in the process? Client doesn't have the money to cover premium; multiple contacts and still no luck. Many prospects are only eligible for Final Expense Insurance. $150 a month for $5,000 face value. Do the calculations. They play so many 'games' with the way leads are transferred. I can't even guess them all; week by week they change mostly for the worse. Recently, while waiting as long as 25 minutes for lead calls, I received calls from people for health insurance (I don't sell) to file a claim with Global life, to place an order for food, from an Amish woman who wanted me to work for her multi-level marketing company, from lots of people who asked to be put on the Do Not Call list, from people who are looking to replace their existing life insurance (I can't do that at this company and have to transfer?), and so many more useless leads. It's a hard way to make a living with these kinds of mistakes, leads and no support at all from system problems and application problems. what possessed Prudential to purchase them for $2.35 billion is baffling to me????"

My manager is cool and helpful. Gives insights and help to increase sales","In Life Insurance as an independent agent, you typically have the opportunity to get between 80-90% of the first year premium that you sell. At Assurance, you start 114% of the FIRST MONTH. It’s really a rip off. As a 1099 agent, its 225% of the first month and that’s not really any better. 

You have to sit on the phone for HOURS with extremely long wait times for calls. The calls that you do get are either about a bogus ad eluding to $15 for $150k of insurance for seniors. Now there are some people that do not have long wait times and those people are also getting the most sales....... but how do you make more sales if you’re getting maybe 20 calls in a day?"

In addition, they also deceive you by telling you that you will not make outgoing calls. It’s a lie.  the system calls the number for you so technically you’re not making the call but the truth is that all the calls are basically outbound.   They tell you that the job is only temporary and that in three months they will make you an agent by graciously paying the $50 for your insurance book but in reality you’ll be waiting a year and a half before you can get an agent position with them and once you do it sucks anyway.
