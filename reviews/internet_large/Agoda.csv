3. Diversity is a joke. The only diversity Agoda design pays attention to is White diversity.
4. Skill and career development support is lacking and it's a shock that we continue to work as an agency and yes-man to suit Business needs.

5. Experimentation often encouraged, outcomes always measured which keeps the business profitable.","1. Long forgotten managerial rifts seem to have encouraged large monolith projects which prohibits standardization of best practices.
2. Seemingly set-in-stone organizational structure where tech departments are arranged to maintain silos, as a result producing systems-upon-systems rather than refactoring.
3. Very little done to promote knowledge transfer and professional development in tech.
4. Too much pride in inferior internal toolchains, with teams dedicated to maintaining them instead of switching to industry-standard alternatives. Only open-source friendly as a consumer, not at heart as a contributor.

Good international environment where you have interdepartmental colleagues from all over the world

Pre covid there was monthly pantry mini parties to celebrate birthdays every month, with buffet and emcee and fun.

Singapore office located in CBD very convenient with lots of f&b options

Two very nice pantries!

Office very well renovated

Fair remuneration

MNC efficiency e.g smooth onboarding and staff administration","1 star experience only at the Singapore customer service department.

Kindergarten style of management. If you need to go toilet when it's not your fixed break timing, please inform the class monitor or teacher.

Micromanagement

If you need to go to toilet beyond an arbitrary ""reasonable timing"", be prepared to be questioned. 

Office politics. To be fair this happens everywhere, but I was very surprised it happens in a call center because other call centers are well known to be free of politics at agent level at least. Was pretty glaring too. Like I said it happens everywhere, even in schools, just like in school, where you have teacher's pet and the rest.

Extreme high turnover rate gives clues about the environment. Vast majority of agents do not stay beyond 2 to 3 years, those who can stay 1 year and longer are considered seniors. Most leave in a matter of weeks or months, you see people come and go all the time. People leave due to high work stress (not easy to meet the kpi and multitasking, work processes are also tedious and everchanging) and on top of that still need to deal with people issues aka office politics. In other call centers you see people staying for decades.

Not much leeway for keen new agents who are late bloomers or need more time to cope with the steep learning curve, as it's very stats oriented. 

Management critical of agents but don't apply the same level of standards to themselves. Give just 1 example, it is only fair to be punctual yourself before you criticise others for lateness.

Rules not equally applied, most glaring example is with regards to usage of handphone at workstation."

+ Compensation/benefits are good for a Thai based position and at times can be even comparable to Singapore/HK for some senior level roles.

+ A lot on the corporate side (HR, onboarding, financials, business processes, L&D, legal) has been improved in the recent years thanks to transformational ex-leaders.

+ A highly likeable CEO. The con to this will be... who is next?

+ Interesting balance between being very progressive and yet conservative. Either way - this has brought a lot of growth/success to the company. Whether the past pre-covid years are a stroke of luck - will remain to be seen.","1. There's a degree of messiness that one must come to accept in Agoda... mostly in the systems side of things.

2. Sometimes too conservative / pragmatic to my liking - wish they could do more for the hotel partners and the industry.

Genuine interest in helping others. 
Your ideas are valued and you have the freedom to carry out your ideas to execution.","The overall standard here is very, very low across all areas: 

- Management team is incompetent and no one seems to have been trained properly on managing people. There are way too many ""managers"", some managers are surplus to requirements. 

- Short-term focus, strategies are set up to gain some quick wins (like undercut hotel's prices) but changed monthly since quick wins and taking shortcuts aren't sustainable for building a business. Hotel partners are usually upset with how the business is conducted here. 

- The work is very challenging, not hard but challenging because there's a complete lack of support from other teams, you're pretty much on your own once you start. Your peers will help you if you have questions but other than that, you have to do everything from small to big tasks to handling tough conversations from hotels as a result of bad business practices. The root cause here is the wrong business focus, if they were to focus and care more for partners, they would have invested more in building strong support teams to make sure partner's satisfaction is at the highest level. Of course, that mindset doesn't exist here. 

- The tools and systems are poorly maintained and break down all the time, local operations team aren't capable of handling basic business needs.

- Average benefits and salary, if you're exchanging your labor for money, and for all the little things you have to do here, you aren't compensated fairly."

4. Decent benefits
5. Frequent sharing/FAQ sessions with management","1. Difficult to apply for leave. You often need to give wayyyy advance notice.
2. Shift (work hours and off days) changes monthly, and the schedule is only shared 0.25-2 months (usually 0.25-1 month) in advance. Hard to plan your life around work, more so with point #1. 
3. Bonus not fantastic. 
4. Change is the only constant- agents can be suddenly pulled into team / project without brief and be expected to learn on the go."

We have tremendous opportunity to try new things to move the company forward, with freedom (and the expectation) to speak to whomever we need to to get the job done, learn from mistakes, and have a growth mindset, always open to new ideas and new data.

Big plus: a good sense of humor is welcome here.","Because we move fast and change all the time, there is not always clarity and structure to the level that some prefer. Also, because we have grown very quickly, we are still developing as a more mature organization while still working to retain the spirit and agility of a startup, which can sometimes lead to confusion as we apply our values to new situations.

I never planned to be promoted or something. It was just pure hard work and all I ever wanted is to earn good money for my 2 kids back in the Philippines. I started working in this company on February 2017, did what I am told/instructed to, did more than what's expected (KPI/Behavior), was sent to Philippines to be a mentor for almost 3 weeks to our outsource company, returned back to Thailand and became Team Captain on October 2018 and now, got promoted to Team Manager on July 2019.  That was the summary of my career path here in Agoda. 

This company also gives all the training you need to be successful. They listen and help the best possible way they can.","My own experience? Just 1 I guess, like some time last year, targets were not clear and just basing it from the team's average. But this has changed a lot and everything is clear now and very achievable.

- The offices have an incredible location. If you are relocating in, you will have no worries about having access to all the creature comforts of back home. 
- The workforce is very international. You might be on a team of 9, with 6+ different nationalities represented. As an expat, you won't be an exception. Many of your coworkers will have gone through the same experiences you will go through during your relocation and onboarding. This shared experience is bonding. 
- As an online travel agency, the 'travel culture' is pretty strong here.
- Compensation is good. No, it doesn't compare with what you get in SV, but it will go much further here.","- Quality of management is highly variable. There are a lot more bad managers than good managers here. Be careful. Make sure you meet multiple members of the team you're joining and find out what you're getting into.
- To expand, there are a lot of 'rent seekers' who have found their way into Management positions, and use politics and their position to protect the kingdom they 'rule over'. Be wary of ex-Management Consultants. There are a couple of good ones at Agoda, but the rest don't have any functional experience and have a hard time managing those with functional experience.
- Agoda tries to sell itself as being able to offer a Silicon Valley experience in Bangkok. The closest thing to this exists in the Product teams, but only there. If you are coming in on the business side or in operations, expect a very sub par employment experience. 

Living in Bangkok is great. The opportunity to travel, diversity, low cost of living all make Agoda an attractive place to work. But if these things don't matter to you and you are looking purely for a career move, give Agoda a pass. You'll find yourself frustrated."

Processes are over complicated, unnecessary and not very well thought through. Most tasks are conveyor style like as Agoda does not  believe in empowering people.
Favouritism, bullying and illegal practices are a daily thing at Agoda, especially since the new Managing Director for Europe moved from her UK role into this position.

Agoda people across seniority levels also understand numbers and how to interpret/make use of them well, and do not work in silo at all.

-Open to ideas from developers","- When they hired me in Bangkok, in the interview they were bragging about how good they were and how they could get anyone they wanted in the company and how they only employ 1% of applicants.  Everything seems... over exaggerated. Despite all this, I come from a western country and left a very high paying job. Their offer was MUCH less than my offer back home. I told them I would only stay for a short time in the job and wanted to do it to enjoy my time while it lasted in Bangkok. Despite this, they were so confident and arrogant that I would stay more longer than the time I quoted that even during my exit interview they were like ""when we hired you, we knew that you would stay for more longer than xxx time"" after I told them I was quiting.

I found them to be quite cocky and over confident of their worth to my career. For a whole year, they bragged on about how they could pay anything to get westerners to come and work for them but when push come to shove and I told them how much they needed to pay to be just as good as my offers back home, they turned around and said ""You're not worth that much"". I would personally tell them that they aren't worth MY TIME either, but that's above their heads at the moment because they are arrogant..

As for the person that said this:
""There's a tension in the company regarding the low salaries paid to the ""local"" Asian workforce vs. the high salaries and stock options typically awarded to Western expats (or Asians educated overseas) and senior management.""

They do this because they have to, to retain these staff.
The offers are STILL not attractive even for the western expats anyway despite what Agoda says.  The salary after tax verse the cost of living is still worse with Agoda than back home in most western countries. The only westerners who work in Bangkok are there for just lifestyle reasons and not money which is understandable due to the nightlife and beach scene."

-	Good benefits: 401k, Aetna medical, Delta dental and vision, fitness reimbursement up to 240 USD yearly
-	Laid back company culture – you are not being evaluated on after call work time, handling time, calls taken. You kind of work at your own pace. If you do not avoid calls then it is easy to reach all the targets.
-	There is an annual bonus depending on your performance, which is nice.
-	4 weeks paid training
-	Multicultural company, you get to talk to many people from all over the world
-	Possibility to relocate to other offices within the company","A lot of the previous posts seem somewhat exaggerated, which is understandable. People come here to post anonymously and vent about job dissatisfaction, which is unfortunate that they cannot express their concerns at work that might actually result in change.
Managers are more concerned with whom to fire than putting in the time to learn the job in order to better help agents. There is constant drama going on – people reporting each other for every little thing, warnings, excessive amounts of callouts, people being out of work for long periods of time due to alleged “medical reasons”.
There Is also a lot of gossip which would be fine if it weren’t malicious. It almost seems like there is a need to bring down others for your own benefit.
Compared to other locations, company events are very reserved and conservative with a small budget that aren’t fun. The attendance at these events shows the disinterest people have in getting to know each other outside of work. 
Many agents have very dysfunctional families with issues that they bring to the workplace. It is not uncommon to hear about domestic violence, spouses going to prison, single mothers’ struggles with their 2-3 kids at home.
The hiring process is flawed – they look for call center experience, so we get many people who are burned out from working years in abusive call centers, getting used to customers screaming at them and reverting to the status quo of “there’s nothing I can do for you”. This place needs people who are excited to start a new job, are passionate about doing well and actually care. It doesn’t matter whether they have call center experience."

951,Agoda,Life at Agoda.,2018-09-17,2.0,Customer Service Representative,"Great location in downtown Providence
Your co workers are people that will be friends with beyond the workplace
We have a chromecast in the breakroom, potlucks, team outings, in an attempt to make the people come together a bit more. 
Pay is higher than in most call centers in RI.
Sunday is time and a half.","This is not your typical call center job. Some of the reviews below are accurate and some arent, ill explain what i can.

Apply, you will have skype interviews and phone calls from Bangkok as well as Singapore. In about a months time, you will know if you got the job. Once hired you will have training from 845 - 545. The trainer is from Europe and has worked for Agoda for a few years. 

 Once you have completed the training which is 4 weeks, you will be in ""nesting"" which is where you are on phone calls and emails all day and 2 agents from the floor monitor you if you need help. During nesting, the person who is supposed to help will be walking the floor, talking to agents, eating an apple and do nothing.

Your numbers are important. The better your numbers - the better your schedule. The hours are 10-7 and they will soon be back to 9-6. You get 18 PTO per calendar year.  Your base salary in the hiring process is $35K. If you think you deserve more, tell the interviewer or else you will get the base pay.

There is alot of drama. The job is not terribly hard its what you have to deal with. We are the midnight shift for our headquarters in Bangkok. 90% of the customers are from India, Singapore, Malaysia, Dubai, etc. 90% of the customers wont speak English but they wont tell you that during the hiring process. It's your responsibility to make sure that you work through that, and when you complain you will be told to get over it and that its  cultural differences.'

After you are on the floor, you will be placed on a team. There are 3 teams currently.
One TM is oblivious to the job itself and leans on other agents for help. One TM called in an agent on their day off and offered to pay them overtime because they were so frazzled. The same TM called another agent while they were out getting their hair done and asked if they could have their phone on if they needed additional help. This is a call center not an EMT position, there is no need to have someone on call because a TM cant do their job.
One TM is newer and seems to have a great team dynamic. Although this TM cannot assist with alot, they are eager to learn.
One TM is brutally honest and has a smart mouth as well as a sense of humor. This TM is a bit removed and is not as personable as they should be with their teams agents.

Not that long ago, the payroll in Bangkok overpaid the floor $10K and the agents that were overpaid had $100 deducted out of their check until the company was repaid. Many agents who worked overtime from May - July didnt have their overtime paid on time and it was more than a headache since the payments were late, some were a month late. After this illegal practice from the company, the site leader informed us that this wouldnt happen again so were waiting to see how the future of payroll is being rolled out. You are paid every 2 weeks. 

Agoda is not a career dont bank on it. The behind the scenes drama is enough for any soap opera. Don't be fooled by the advertisements that look cheery with all of the colors, its fake."

The truth about this place is that it is being ruled by few directors, all happen to come from the same small company, and they just behave like a Mafia. Unbelievable, but true. Not meritocracy like they would like candidates to think,  but more like Mediocracy or Idiocracy... as all the professional people are leaving (some of them after less than half a year unbelievable), and what's left are mediocres. They would do anything for their personal survival, one year after another, one bonus after another - that's only what in front of them. Lies around performance, treating employees disrespectfully, arrogant managers' attitude, playing with Kpis and headcount. You would feel like a slave. You have no say on what's going on, all the decisions are made by this group, and with zero visibility. So many good people are leaving!! Just in the lasy half a year - around 150!"

Some managers consistently apply favouritism to their decisions  and promotions at the expense of much capable individuals.

There is also a bad and negative atmosphere in the office due to employees being extremely unhappy with their roles, bosses and day to day tasks. I don't know anyone who actually enjoys the company and Friday lunches are just an excuse to complain about management and colleagues.

Employees do not have good benefits, pension is just the minimum 1% requirement by law. Agoda has waited until the very last moment it was legally possible before adding a private pension to its offering - this should be an eye opener."

974,Agoda,iOS Developer,2018-06-24,2.0,IOS Developer,"Some great people, absolutely loved to work with them!","Mobile Team Review:

Frustrating management that do not enable but rather blame to an extend where people avoid meetings with certain meetings.
There is no culture of knowledge sharing or collaboration. Managers here rather delegate tasks they come up with themselves instead
having broader discussions. The resulting pull requests are usually merged without the knowledge of the broader team.
If you come up with own improvements they are usually down talked or it is argued that they do not bring business value. Until this day
there has been no meeting, discussion or any other session by the management to explain how business value is defined and how
it can be delivered, instead suggestions or even done work is simply down played or rejected.

It happened not once that meetings completely derail, change topic or someone got roasted.

All of this might apply to you in milder form if you are a Russian speaker. It certainly helps to get promoted.
That might also help you to understand some of the management style and some of your team mates that regularly speak Russian with each other.
There is a clear segmentation in the team by language/culture that that is in favour of Russians to a point where it is uncomfortable.

I just would love to know all this things before I signed up and before I saw a lot of beloved and talented developers departing from the team.
Don't get me wrong it's not all that bad - you just have to like managers that tells you:
""Ideas are nothing"" or who see all solutions as ""nothing magical""."

No career opportunities - as other reviews mention, it's about if you are lucky to be liked by your management. Nothing about effort, commitment or skill. If you are lucky (liked) enough to be promoted, it will take at least a year of doing double work before you are 'ready'. It's normal to see people who are 1 or 2 levels lower in the hierarchy (salary levels too) but do precisely the same job. Great, talented people leave as senior positions are filled by people from the outside who often have no experience. Agoda just doesn’t promote their own people.

Compensation is OK and about industry average. If you join as someone dealing with hotels and you most likely will, then you will be screamed at a lot. In some periods daily. Nothing to do with how good you are at what you do, it's the direction that the company is taking in recent years. With that in mind, compensation is not OK. I don't know what figure makes it OK to be constantly embarrassed on the front line with angry screaming hotels but what Agoda offers it's just not enough. 

Agoda try to come across as a company where you can deepen your skills and ‘grow’ (whatever that means). Chances are that the moment you join you will already know far more about the market, job and the industry than your manager. All the reporting, analysis or tools are developed by entry level people and it’s disguised under ‘coaching so that you can grow’. Put any of the managers in front of the system and ask them to do any of the above and they just won’t be able to. Even training for new starters is entirely conducted by people in ‘normal’ positions as the management simply don’t know. They won’t help you with difficult hotel conversations or meetings but will quite happily jump in when a big deal is about to be struck. 

On a positive side however, most of them are nice and often a good laugh to have around. Still, it’s unforgivable that they managed to ruin what once was a great environment. 

So if you need a job, this is a job. But if you have a choice, go for the ‘other’ one."

People seem to be very passionate about technology and genuinely want to understand it better and not just ""kick the tiers"" until it works, so that goes well with my own culture and beliefs","sometimes can be a bit hectic, might be intrinsic to the online travel industry these days but we do shift our attention quite rapidly which can be distracting at times."
987,Agoda,Please read carefully before joining,2018-05-16,1.0,Market Manager,"Unfortunately towards the end of my career at Agoda, the only pro was the 25 days holiday","Agoda used to be a great company to work for, you work with the suppliers to achieve customer expectations whilst maintaining a excellent relationship with the hotels, i used to look forward to traveling on business trips for a business need and not because it was politically correct to spend the companies money because there is a budget to do so.


After new management came into the team with no consideration for anyone apart from themselves and making life even more difficult for the team, everything changed for the worse, the team shrunk by half, you were pushed away all the time with ideas to help move business forward all because of a hidden agenda and more senior staff than actual people on the road supporting the growth of the company, in fact you were only helping the management look good whilst being made to do all the work. All the fun stuff you would love to do slowly turned off including fun events in the office every Friday evening.


Unfortunately the last year and a half new people joined whereby instead of supporting staff, they were giving out warnings for poor reasons including handing in the holiday form 2 days after the request should have been handed whilst other senior management were able to request holidays 2 days before they needed to take there flight. There are more people in the team doing nothing than actual work (1 senior manager for every 2-3 people whereby they mostly had no clue about the challenges faced), the majority of senior management don't even know how to use the system in place and make all the staff do the bi weekly report and then take credit for collecting the information.


Dont expect much from this company but expect to give it your all, you need to wait 3 weeks to be paid your expenses even though its from your pocket and if your a driven individual looking to make a real impact on the business, forget about it. Luckily the people who have left have moved on to good positions however if you want to be in a call center environment and be measured on how many tickets you solve from a machine which does not work, i wish you all the luck. In fact, its now even worse as the people in the head office who initiated to work against the suppliers are now an even higher position and nothing will change.


If you want to succeed in the European team, be prepared to laugh at everything, behave like a dog and you might just get very far."

995,Agoda,Fast-moving company with a weak culture. Your success and enjoyment would depend on your manager,2018-05-07,3.0,Anonymous Employee,"* Agoda is a fast-moving company. There's hardly any red tape relative to other companies and, depending on your manager, you have space to try out your own ideas. In that sense it really feels like a startup. Priorities, org sturcture and roles can change very quickly.
* Learning oppotunities in some roles. Due to the lack of structure and the high growth in the business, you can get some pretty awesome oppotunities to learn
* Online travel is an interesting business. Depending on the role, you could get to go to different offices around the world (and there are many).
* Agoda empowers managers and the role of HR is administrative only. Managers have a lot of power and little oversight from other stakeholders. That's a pro and a con","* Stratified compensation model. Employing ""cheap"" labour from Asia is part of the Agoda business model. The company hires cheap labour for functions or roles that are deemed non-crusial to the success of the business (customer support, sales, some developers and other roles), while investing heavily in others. There's a tension in the company regarding the low salaries paid to the ""local"" Asian workforce vs. the high salaries and stock options typically awarded to Western expats (or Asians educated overseas) and senior management. The management hasn't been able to address it properly.
* Weak culture. Agoda prioritizes growth over culture. This means that employees that create a toxic environment are not punished and are sometimes promoted, as long as they can get results. ""Be  humble""',  one of the company's core values, is very out of touch with reality.
* Ruled by the Product team. Agoda is ruled by the Product Owners and while many of them are smart and nice people, some are arrogant and difficult to work with. Other important voices in Tech and Business are not heard.
* High fatigue leading to high attrition. Lack of oversight on managers, changing priorities and teams and toxic environment can make employees feel unsafe and quit with a very bad taste. I have seen that in multiple occasions and it was very painful to watch."

1001,Agoda,Agoda is BAD!!! Expat developers - don't even think about working in Agoda,2018-04-14,1.0,Senior Software Engineer,"Thailand and BKK are great, weather is not cold...","Agoda is a bad place for developers - both junior and seniors, both locals and expats.

The organizational structure in 
Agoda is so sick, in such a decadent state, that you’re going to suffer badly: You’re hired as a backend or full-stack developer, with lots of promises about agile and cutting edge technological environment - but in practice you’re a code monkey in a third-world sweatshop. Surprise!!

In the last couple of years the ""Product organization"" had taken over and drained the ""Backend organization"" - to the point where developers are actually product slaves.
The “Product organization"" is basically a clique of micro-managers, acting like an arrogant junta who knows nothing about software development (nothing!), and don't really care about technical and architectural debts. 
In a better company there would be a positive and productive tension between product and development.

But not in Agoda. You’re going to do nothing substantial other than small ridiculous features and business experiments, most of them are either failing or copied from the competitors… You’re explicitly not required to think, improve or suggest anything. Don’t step out of the box - and once you did, you’ve been marked. You'll face the consequences in the next yearly bonus, or just get fired because your performance was engineered. Hard to believe, but that's systematic.

Expats and Senior developers - are leaving sometimes only after couple of month, facing the absurdity and the lie. There’s a very high turnover rate among expats, and for a good reason.

Junior local developers - are anxiously coming to work here for almost no money, because they want to gain experience, but in fact are being ruined in their first year by learning the worst management and technical practices in the market (literally).  

And as for the overall working culture - sometimes tend to be less communicative and collaborative. That’s a culture thing - Everything is OK, everyone just say “Yes” but actually “Losing Face” on you (Google that), nobody complains about anything, nobody shares anything. This leads to difficulties in sharing knowledge and working in a productive team. 
And you know what - if I knew nobody really cares about my personal development, and that the expat sitting next to me doing the same job is getting payed 5 times more - I wouldn't cooperate as well. There is this kind of antagonism and disengagement in the air.

The reviews here looks mostly genuine, apart from the 5-star-all-is-awesome reviews written by Agoda HR - ~300 technocrats of the worst kind, that wouldn't embarrass Vogon bureaucracy..."

- The younger workers (anyone there from roughly 2014/2015) are mostly cool and I still hang around with some of them, unlike the ""core"" mgm that has been there since forever
- Experience started out ok, progressively went south; company's now headed into the wrong direction","- Salary is miserable, even when compared to the avg salaries in the same location, level and sector
- They love to talk a lot about having a startup mentality, while they're at the polar opposite (=corporate bs) - if you actually have been in startups, don't be fooled by their claim, you won't find anything similar here
- They also love to talk a lot about integrity, while backstabbing behind the scenes you won't be aware of until it's too late happens regularly (and of course if you point this out then you're the toxic element, not them)
- If you're not in senior mgm, the moment you have an idea or opinion of your own, you're fired; you read that correctly, it's not just going to be ignored, it's going to get you fired. No matter if it was good and something that increased productivity. Again: polar opposite of a startup. Pure corporate bs
- The hiring trend I've seen from about 2016 on seems to have shifted to finding more passive, mellow, meek employees who will just follow instructions and kiss senior management's butts, and pay them a miserable salary for as long as possible (if they start to look ambitious it's just easier to fire them and find a new passive college grad to instruct). If you fit that profile, enjoy. If it sounds like the definition of slavery, you might have a point.
There's just one person in mgm trying to fight this trend, but with little success - that also adds to the confusion, since you constantly receive mixed messages about how you should behave. I wonder why that person still works there, since it's obvious they don't actually care about what that person thinks."

It is simple, you get a random discount between 8 to 14% but you never get 14% (after 50 bookings I never get this discount amount).","- No mobility plan for employee - turn over is massive in the Customer Experience Group. The probability that you get promoted is lower than 0. In other department, they still have a huge turn over... They try to attract people with videos of Bangkok... Will they understand that people will come for Bangkok and not for the company?
- Managers aren't skilled for most of the position: the HR recruits the wrong person for the wrong job and previously, the management has promoted a few people who had been working in the company for ages. However they still don't have any skills and they ruin the company because they have to manage more skilled people with more experience. However these person will never get promoted because the company is now hiring externally or prefering to promote people who are good friends or thinking the same way
- Jobs are repetitive and no place for suggestion, creativity and no leadership is given to employee: do your job and don't ask for questions even if you do something not logical or if your task is non-sense
- Not ethical: the company has a code of conduct to respect as part of the Priceline group. However, no one is totally respecting him: personal (and more) relationship between employees, favoritism in the workplace... This is Agoda!
- The tool you work with are so old: old software, computers, keyboard
- Only a few benefits: Insurance (which in many countries wouldn't be seen as a benefit). Note that the coverage paid by the company per year is not more than 30k

In fact, Agoda is loosing a lot of good and talented Backend people (and booking) every month.
Why? This is hell wrapped up in a shiny cellophane. The working environment is just pathetic - huge technical debt, no collaboration between teams, no visibility what-so-ever of what's going on, daily production escalations, bureaucracy and bad management practices. Everyone's little interests are their own KPIs.

Product management is basically owning Backend team and development, while Backend management is weak and almost dis-functional. Guess who made sure the current and previous technical management is so weak? 
Dev management is absent, as they sit all day in meetings and are occupied with sending emails.

That means it's all about product, features and micro management. So boring! 
Nobody makes any architectural decisions and there's a huge technical debt that slows development and created a LOT of frustration.
Developers don't really have access to technologies (kafka, cassandra, ...) - if you need something, just send an email and wait... Things that should take days takes weeks.

Does any of those sound like lean?! 
This code-monkeysism approach is a long tradition here. Developers are at the bottom of the food chain, and are being replaced yearly - others make sure they get the yearly bonuses at time!

Everything counts from the moment you leave training (which is all over the place) and hit the floor. Most customers can barely speak English and the headsets are garbage. Immature, high school minded coworkers who gossip and talk trash about anyone. It’s almost completely impossible to stay under the radar and have people leave you alone.

He doesn't give any room for people to think and expects everyone to execute ""tasks"" which he himself writes. He just trust anyone and micro-manages.
Add to it, extreme favouritism and nepotism shown towards people who he likes personally and who will do whatever he asks them to do. Take for instance, one of his former colleagues who he personally brought into the company without any interview. This person, though is technically sound, but doesn't do any work at all and is having a happy ride because the manager backs him to the core. But if you are in the bad side of the relationship with him, your happiness is spoiled. There was even a team member, who is this extremely hard-working guy, was forced to leave because he wasn't in good terms with the manager. 
He also treats the team members as if they are a throw-away paper. He questions them with a curt, indifferent attitude and shows faces when you make a mistake and makes you feel extremely sorry. I can see a few of the team mates mentally disturbed to the point of talking to themselves while walking down the hallway."

Departments with legacy solutions prefer to work in silos, outdated and tech management prefer not to jinx it.

Few managements are highly unqualified hence they hide themselves busy in meeting, resolving people's issues, demands leadership recognition , procrastinating  & taking interviews most of time. Such toxic work atmosphere becomes a necessity for them to survive. Thus learning and career growth might get affected under them.

Nepotism is very high and quite visible , while CEO is aware of it. HR is powerless but will try there best to help any employee.

Living in Bangkok, executives get silicon valley salaries, why not you ? They dont follow Bangkok market value and recruiter will convenience you with little better than Bangkok market rate.

For bugs, put in workarounds. Try finding the root cause, and fixing it, then you are not fast enough. They would rather put in a workaround to delay the issue by a month than spent time to fix the root cause.

Open to hiring all w/ customer service experience, you don't need 'call center experience' to get hired.
POSSIBILITY to transfer after a year of being at company.
Not everyone is paid the same, negotiate salary for what you think you are worth for 40! Calculate wisely!","*About 2 month process to get hired (may be shorter since they are already open)
MICRO MANAGING from your team lead
*The GM hires people from his old jobs as the new team leads, so you will not be able to move up to a manager position within a year, its impossible at this location (although they tell you that until your ears bleed through the interview experience)
*The 'travel discount' is laughable.
*Paid twice a month but not every 2 weeks.
*If you need a check, take the job. If you want something more, don't.

They are actively hiring as you can see, they will email you back and it seems like such a fun company to work for. There are not alot of reviews for this location. Hiring process is VERY thorough w/ alot of skype interviews with recruiter in Bangkok. Make yourself available. Three major skype interviews until you get the job w/ many emails & phone calls in between. Agoda is a partner of Priceline but you will not be taking ANY priceline calls. 90% of your calls will be with people who don't speak English from Asia, who will say 'hello, hello, hello' when you answer the phone. You will have alot of pending cases that you can't close because of the time zone. When you are working, it will be midnight in Asia. 
*You are also promised the 9 - 9 schedule - that's a lie, they won't even CONSIDER that until March!
*When you get hired, you will be in a training room w/ two trainers - one that is a TM in another country in Europe, knowledgeable, has some patience and sometimes they can move a little fast. The other training is not as knowledgeable, a little condescending with a bit of an attitude. Training is for 4 weeks, schedule is 9 - 6. You cannot take paper onto the floor so notes must be written in Notepad.
Once on the floor, you will be under a team lead who has never taken a phone call in their life, they will 'help you' by walking up to you and giving you their idea of what needs to happen and walk away. You are scrutinized for being two minutes late, meanwhile, one team lead is late EVERY. SINGLE. DAY.
*Numbers are quite important here, hold time, average talk time, etc. everything matters.
Your lunch time is mapped out to the minute, so even if you're on a long case (which happens) you will be sent an email as to why you were late.


Again, if you need a check than give Agoda a try but go in with a good salary and a game plan. The job is stressful. Long days - it will take all of the patience that you have. 3 people have already quit. Join at your own risk."

This is not a place for talents, and juniors joining are basically ruined by learning worse practices... Here is all about emails, meetings, and micro politics. 

I worked here over a year, coming from a strong technical and innovative background, to find a bad working culture, bureaucracy, tribalism, code monkeys. Development is practically stopped due to bad management decisions and daily production issues. 
The salaries differences are just disgrace - local decent hard developers are payed peanuts, while great innovations are intercepted by young and ambitious mid level US managers and product owners, recruited by their fellows to... basically take the credit while doing politics and waiting for the yearly bonus. Some of the mid management are stuck here for few years, probably afraid to go back to the market - and for a good reason. Agoda is a bad line in your CV - assuming you're coming from a western IT market - believe me I have to find a lot of excuses while interviewing now.

Sad to see a company built by the hands of the great ceo Robert Rosenstein becoming a swamp full of day-job opportunists working hard on... failing the employees!"

- Small team and if you're in a good one, you have a good chance to make impactful things
- Flexibility and work/life balance (no such thing as working overtime) 
- Good location - in the center of Bangkok. Lots of things to do before and after work e.g. good restaurants, gym and entertainment. Easy to commute to via BTS
- Travel perks, company events 
- Multicultural environment","- Hard to find growth opportunity. It's really a flat structure. 
- A lot of politics and somewhat flavoring some races more than others
- High base salary but really small increase year by year, which is okay except since Agoda has been hiring madly, they increase their base salary every year to attract more people. So chances are, your salary will quickly be less than the people who join after you despite the same or more experience
- Discrepancy among employee in the same position. Have to be vocal about what you really want, otherwise it's hard to be recognized.

TL;DR

Working at Agoda could be a big boost to your career or could be a standstill, it really depends on what team/project you work with. The company has been recruiting heavily over the past few years and they cannot manage to keep the same practice or culture across the company. Agoda's vision is to move fast and to be a leading accommodation booking platform. However,  it's really hard to collaborate among teams when the company gets very big and everyone just cares about getting their work done rather than the company's best interest."

Management is literally a big con. 
You do not get recognised or remunerated for good work. Instead, your good work gets taken as theirs.

Management is more concern on protecting themselves from making mistakes, living in fear of the CEO as opposed to doing what's right for the company. 

Social grouping is also a big concern where Ivy League, consultant hires takes centre stage but has literally little clue on what's going on.

1198,Agoda,Operation Monitoring and Incident Manager,2017-02-25,1.0,NOC Team Member,Good company to work for if they re-organize their management system and removing top level managers who are just doing micro-management not what they are getting paid to do so.,"Due to lack of business knowledge, people management, leadership and selection of right smart and skillful people at senior management level within Agodo we all been struggling to have a solid KPI and ITSM (IT Service Management) in place. There are few good ITSM professional out there, have applied for the role ""
Operation Monitoring and Incident Manager"" but got knocked back because some senior managers scared of having smart people (smarter than them) on board, feeling insecure and really can't manage, not providing vision for the tech team and not move things fast enough. This particular role (
Operation Monitoring and Incident Manager) been open for months but for various ridiculous obvious excuses senior management team keep pushing back people and not hiring.  What they really are lacking is a Vision which should have a good impact on the growth and opportunity of the technology organization but they don't. They don't even allow candidates to show them what they are made of and what they can do for the organization. As soon as they feel that candidate is smarter than them - that candidate will be a history. They are an absolute pro-bias. So over all management suck. And regretfully, HR managers not only have no say but also under influence by senior management team - They are the one will knock candidates out not HR."

- Cutting edge techs: this is also a con and it is why developers are not very technical, you are supposed to learn and apply new techs in one week! plus Agoda follow trends, I don't agree on following technology trends as the online activity is made by teens who just get excited with new things that don't actually have real value

Decisions can be made at any level, as long as you involve those who are affected by your changes.  Many people take on new roles and responsibilities flexibly over time; job titles do not mean much.  People are very collaborative and willing to give new things a try.  What surprised me most when I first started is the permission to give things a go and then get lots of feedback and change things while they are running.  It's very collaborative.  Having measurements at hand to quickly find out what works for customers helps of course.  That does not mean that there are no differences of opinion, but focusing on trying out and improving continuously makes for an energising and stimulating environment.

The flexibility in taking on new roles also means that careers can take interesting twists.  I've seen several people start new activities and getting a team to follow their lead.  There are things to learn in terms of technology, management skills, leadership, working with partners and customers, and running projects.  Because of the impressive people we've attracted there are many people around to observe and learn from.  You can also build a real part of the business.","The fast pace of change implies that things change around you all the time.  While that sounds attractive, some people are taken by surprise.  It also means needing to speak up and building relationships to make change happen.  It won't be given to you on a platter.

1273,Agoda,No other job I've had comes close.,2015-11-04,5.0,Software Engineer,"Ownership:

All about ownership at Agoda. The management have faith in a bottom-up management style. This means as an engineer I still have the trust and belief from management to suggest and work, and live MY ideas. Not only is this OK - it's actively encouraged. I just cannot see a situation at Amazon where I go to Jeff Bezos - hey jeff, let me rewrite your whole taxation engine. At Agoda - that's nearly the reality; management worked with me on my idea, suggested changes, put me in charge, I chose the team, and... OK I was a little late, but the project was hugely succesful and made us a tonne of money! Really, really satisfying.

Technology:

Agoda surprised me. I didn't think their technology base was that impressive on joining - I quickly found out this isn't true. Kafka, Cassandra, vertica, Hadoop, it's all part of the repetoire. In my time at Agoda not only have I been exposed to a heap of technologies that ordinarily wouldn't come across - but I've done the research and made the suggestions myself. I've learned java, scala, python, R in addition to the tech I already knew.

Business:

I've always worked in small enteprise companies - basically, they pay well. Agoda is the first big company i've worked for. if big companies are like this - i'm not working for a small company ever again. Agoda has exposed me to the business, I make business decisions. Whether to prioritize issue A, or issue B it's actually up to me. Now I'm not making choices like buying companies, or where to create the next datacenter, but... I can decide that working on the maps will increase conversion and create a whole heap of new features about maps and work on them. I just have never had that level of autonomy at another company. 

Thailand:

Living in Thailand is awesome. I cannot begin to compare it to my life in London. Everything is cheap, everything is accessible, people are wonderful. This for me is a major bonus.!","Ordered chaos! Agoda is growing very very aggressively and still growing at a high rate. This means that sometimes we're unable to clean up the code as much as we would like it to. This is kind of frustrating. I do understand it's a function of a succesful company, but at the same time it would be really good to find more time to do some of the clean up work.

Testing

I know I shouldn't say this but... Agoda tests so much. Every line of code we have tests for. Unit tests, javascript tests, system tests, database tests, api tests. Honestly - I don't enjoy testing. I totally see the value in it, and we have way, way less problems when i first joined. But testing is boring - i want to code more.

Communication downwards

Agoda is real big - and I know the bosses they try to make sure there are opporunities to talk with senior management. our CEO Rob will fill a movie theatre and let us know what is happening. but it would be much cooler to have this more often and from other people."

- Lack of leadership and support by management - unwillingness to spend 50 US$ on software that could make your work so much easier. 
- Daily overtime taken for granted while you got scolded like a 10 year old schoolboy for being 5 minutes late in the mornings. What a joke! 
- Low salary compared to the size of the company and to competitors
- Almost my whole team (10 people) left the company within a year due to lack of perspective and leadership
- Bi-polar manager in customer service (TO) who constantly talks trash and puts subordinates down in front of everyone. Putting up with his mood swings is a complete nightmare"

2. Company was competing with blue OTA and wants more contracted hotels than them and was only concentrating to new acquisition. This was causing bad relationships with existing hotels. 
3. All staff will be given KPI for each quarter however some of the KPI are highly not achievable. In chis case it will be measured by the % of achievement, so in this company, there is nobody who achieved the target and having some extra time for their own work."

They rather keep you in same place and do your good job and promote you, and whoever got promote is the one come to manager and said i want to promote, otherwise i will leave.

Personal Development - I have been able to take control of my career and focus on my development along with the support of my manager. I was actually able to create my current role when I saw there was a need, I really like it that this type of behavior is encouraged here, there is a sense of constantly trying to improve and if you have good ideas shout about them (that could be the next project you work on). Training- I've had the opportunity to go to management training and cross- training in other offices. Culture- the people are awesome, we are encouraged to collaborate and share best practices amongst  our team. I love how everyone gets to contribute no matter what your level you have a voice here!","Change is constant- if you're a creature of habit and routine, the constantly changing business can be frustrating. Fast paced environment- it can be difficult to keep up if you're not used to it. Keeps you on your toes. A bit unstructured (fiercely anti-bureaucratic),  makes for a refreshing change for me - I have seen people struggle however if they are not used to such a company. If you like to be told what to do, and need structure you probably wont like it here much."

For most of the job roles you have to sit in front of the computer all day and there are some very monotonous tasks.
A big problem is that the leading management and CEO don`t communicate what is their strategy and where is the company going and what is the reason behind some major decisions. This makes you feel like a little ant who doesn`t know anything. I also have the feeling that the middle management doesn`t know much more either..

There are a lot of pros in working in Agoda. First one would be the relationship you build does not end in the four corners of your office; you’ll be surprised that you end up chatting or communicating with someone from the other side of the world. From there, you learn more information about the different markets and get insights on things you would never thought of.
