0,Airbnb,Airbnb needs to restructure HotelTonight ASAP,2022-04-07,1.0,Customer Experience Agent,Great benefits and lots of opportunity outside of your role to learn.,"HotelTonight CX team is managed by the same people for years and they seem to simply move teams around instead of breaking up the sorority that is our management team.

Airbnb has failed at fixing morale on this team and even worse seems to want us all to quit. This is a toxic environment that I had to leave for my sanity.

The D&B team is extremely discriminatory and only seems to believe in elevating black colleagues/LGBTQIA, meanwhile hispanics are struggling for an ounce of recognition and white co workers are demonized for their skin color even when allies."
1,Airbnb,Not the Airbnb it was pre-IPO,2022-04-01,2.0,Staff Software Engineer,"- There are still some amazing people who work there (for now)
- Compensation is solid and the stock is doing well
- CTO has really helped improve the technical direction of the company
- There are interesting problems to solve
- D&I efforts within the company have seemed to improved","- Since the IPO, the company has shifted to twice yearly release cycles, and they still haven't quite figured out how to do it in a way that doesn't burn out all their employees
- Work-life balance is something you have to fight for, not something that's assumed
- Management quality is a mixed bag, and there's not consistent training for managers to improve
- Currently, all designs have to go through CEO review, which creates a large bottleneck on decision making
- Deadlines for projects frequently aren't based on the size of the project, but the desire for an idea to align with an upcoming release
- Lots of reorgs, especially when leaders from a different company join"

Surrounded by very smart and highly skilled people who are constantly working hard to improve their craft. Most people check their ego at the door, everyone is helpful to one-another with the common mission in mind. Management is compassionate, caring, and clear on expectations. Employees feel supported with the right tools, resources, and are very well-compensated for the hard work. Total comp is on-par or better than FAANG in many cases.","Company is at the intersection of travel and sharing-economy, with focus on mostly traditional idea of travel lodging. While the travel industry is on the rebound from the pandemic, the long term future of the model is not without uncertainty and risk.

15,Airbnb,Golden handcuffs,2022-02-23,3.0,Safety Specialist,They have great benefits and a great community of people working there.,"It's very cult-like, or at least it was before the pandemic.

Would not recommend anyone to work there now."

The company spends way more time on race and diversity training then the actual product, and customer service and the way deadly incidents are handled suffers greatly because of this. The ironic part is, that I have never worked with such a diverse group of people in my entire life. It was great! So why the company spends so much time trying to be a social justice warrior is way beyond anything someone would expect. The bottom line is this: the company does not care at all about safety.

-Brian and cofounders are very genuine","I have several friends who asked for referalls and I could never recommend for them to work here. You will probably think this is your dream job but in reality, there is so much hype to working at Airbnb.  I know how it looks pretty from the outside but  it isnt.   

The organization is badly designed and career growth is often decided by nepotism and backstabbing.  The review cycle and performance ratings are actually arbitrary and inexperienced managers get way too much power without any accountability. It's notoriously bad in some business units compared to others. The review/promotion cycle isn't even the core of the problem though. 

The real issue at Airbnb is the middle management problem. This layer of management contains some individuals who are truly inexperienced, too immature, too young and ineffective at managing diverse talent. They are good at managing up and fooling the e-team into thinking everything is fine when in reality, their teams are suffering.  There is a lot of dissent that you hear when you grab lunch with people and employees often do not feel heard because of this middle management layer not signal boosting the real issues to e-team.

What's frustrating is that at the company/org level, there is lots of talk about diversity and belonging at Airbnb but zero actions to back it up. The murmur/belonging survey scores never improve YoY for this reason and that data really speaks for itself.  

Some orgs also have a really toxic culture that feels like being in high school instead of a 21st century company and the saddest part is the e-team seems to have no idea about this or takes no action.  There are several employees who have voiced concerns and seen nothing get fixed."

- Toxic work environment, including managers and directs openly bashing other employees, clients and partner businesses.

- Lack of career development or sales training
- Dishonesty from upper management and middle management about the organizational changes coming up, causing employees to waste time not looking into their other career options.

Regarding compensation - there are dozens of employees responsible for bringing on new accounts and growing existing accounts, however there is no pay structure that rewards employees for doing such.  It's all base pay and no bonus and no incentive to be successful financially. 

Although leaving Airbnb was a difficult decision, I am confident it was the best for now given the severely negative updates I receive from my former colleagues.  Hopefully someday the upper and middle management of the VR/Hotel organization will work through these issues and find a more functional and productive work environment for people to thrive in."

-You will work with some of the nicest people in the industry who are truly exceptional
-Great benefits including free lunch and snacks, quarterly travel coupons
-The CEO truly cares about what the company is doing and it's mission; he holds regular Q+As with employees and makes a visible effort to connect.","-Pay is not that great, I started out at $18/hour and after 3 years at the company, I was only making $20.65 after being promoted 
- Little room for growth in role and lack of transparency with how employees receive raises. My lead could not or would not provide me with a direct answer or explanation as to why I was making significantly less than other employees at same SL.
- Metrics can be unreasonable at times due to the nature of the work. You are expected to close X cases a day and maintain a certain NPS, along with other metrics, although you are usually handling mishandled, escalated cases from external support teams that can take days to close. You never know what kind of call/ticket you will get, if it will be a case that takes days to resolve, or if it will be a simple account questions. You are also expected to answer questions with little resources for you and silo-ed departments, with the company motto being 'build the plane as it takes off'.
-Along with having to be compliant with 'call controls' just trying to stay afloat making your 14 cases, you will get pinged throughout the day asking if you can take over other mis-escalated cases. Even if you are overwhelmed with casework and know you don't have the bandwith to take these on, you will quickly lose favor with upper management if you don't.
-Casework can be very stressful, and while the company does it's best with trying to offset this with a fantastic food program and seminars, it emotionally drains you. CX work is more of a mediation role. 
-Within the 3 years that I was there, it increasingly became more like a call center, with more micromanaging  of your time within the call controls, breaks, etc. Ultimately, this work environment along with poor compensation and lack of upward mobility left me no choice but to accept another offer at a different company, which was one of the hardest and most bittersweet decisions that I ever have made career wise."

They also bump everyone to above midpoint of the range, which is really kind and close any gaps for pay equity.

- Business is doing really well: we're profitable, have money to invest in employees + new ventures, never worried about money. Not even having a round of funding for this far out is amazing.

- Great benefits. Free airbnb credits (never expire), lots of PTO and time off, easy parking lot next to the building (they reimburse the price), free lyft credits, top notch food program, etc.

- Management is honest about their pitfalls and is honest about fixing it. I appreciate this because they could sweep it under the rug.

- We're heavily invested in our infrastructure as a 2019 focus. Even hired a CTO who has decades of infrastructure heavy lifting under his belt. Sweet!

- People are really kind and helpful. Fairly rare. There are always going to be politics because people befriend eachother, but honestly you can set up a meeting with a director and they will help you resolve easily. As long as you speak out, people will listen.","Typical growing pains for our size, honestly. For a long time, Airbnb was flat and you could grow your career quickly since the company was small. Now they're trying to add ways to grow your career and make it defined and achievable since there's not low hanging fruit from a flat org, which is good. There's also increased attrition for people who have been here 5-7+ years, but honestly I think fresh people who are excited and new have been better for my team personally.

Another complaint I have is on the engineering side. There are many talented engineers hired from top schools and FB/GOOG/AMZN/LNKD/MSFT, but miraculously the quality of Airbnb's engineering is not that good, as you can tell from how slow the website and the app are even today.

257,Airbnb,Explosive growth with an excellent culture and mission!,2018-08-06,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Summary: I'm really happy here and it's the best job I've ever had. That said, details:

1. People: The people here are really smart, really nice, and really accommodating of healthy work/life balance which is CRAZY important for longevity and long-term happiness. The people are a pleasure to work with, they're helpful, knowledgeable, and REALLY passionate about the company. I have an amazing Manager who advocates for me and it's been such a great experience.

2. Projects: The projects here are those you can't find elsewhere simply because Airbnb is a one-of-a-kind company. A lot of the operational problems we're building and fixing haven't been navigated before. You have a chance to create new processes, projects, and impact in this industry.

3. Culture: This place is serious about its culture or ""Core Values"": do the right thing, advance the mission, don't backstab, don't throw people under the bus, and stand up for the underdog. To give you an idea of the kind of people we want: one of our people raised $20 million for immigrant kids separated from their parents on Facebook-- the largest fundraiser in Facebook's history. 

4. Benefits + Compensation: They'll comp you properly, trust me. Airbnb gives a generous total compensation package with lots of stock, fully covered health care/dental/vision for you, $500 in Airbnb credits per quarter, free food (breakfast/lunch/dinner), and all the cool Silicon Valley perks.

5. Flexibility: Work from home, work remotely, take PTO-- just make sure your projects get done. A+++ on this.","1. Disorganization: Hyper growth mode has created some disorganization and issues with accountability. It can be difficult to get things done with random PTOs and a softer culture when it comes to communication.

2. Career advancement: Upward mobility/ career advancement expectations can be slow or unclear because of the disorganization. You have to advocate for yourself and develop a great relationship with your manager.

3. Liquidity: Airbnb isn't a public company so those looking to sell their stocks need to wait for a liquidity event or for the company to IPO. As much as stocks are great, they can't pay the bills so giving employees more opportunity to cash out is important for those of us who aren't billionaires. FYI leadership listened to this complaint and they recently gave us a new way to cash out some of our stock + comp which is a great start."

3) I really like our internal tools - both Airflow and Superset are two of my favorite new tools since joining Airbnb.  Also our internal experimentation platform.
4) I'm excited to work for a company that I think is genuinely making the world a better place by helping people connect and belong.  I came to the US as a refugee, and Airbnb's stand for refugees made me proud to work here.  
5) Internal mobility on the data science team is strongly encouraged and supported.  Once you've been in your role for a year or two, you can start looking at other roles if you're interested.

Data university is an incredible program to empower the company with data, and it's a reflection of how awesome the data scientists are that they drive and support this program. It's also neat that unlike at other companies data science experts are in every part of the business and yet keep in touch with each other and have forums to share work (like a weekly learning lunch).

The company itself is fantastic as well. Founder led after 10 years and Brian and leadership have made some great hires recently, driving an inspiring vision for Airbnb.

- The pay is pretty paltry, no bonus structure, equity package is nothing to write home about.
- Decisions are frequently based on ""feelings"" rather than data, which can be infuriating. Data-driven decision making and overall rigor is not something that's naturally part of the culture. It varies team to team based on whether someone came from a company that was better at utilizing data in everyday work.
- Airbnb likes to do everything their own way even if there are existing solutions in the market. Not very smart if they think reinventing the wheel is always the right decision.
- The caliber of employees at Airbnb is not nearly as good as ones I've worked with at ""Big 4"" tech companies, but they sure think they are hot shots. A lot of arrogance  fuels the company at every level. There's a lot of style over substance here.
- The SF office looks great out in the atrium, but the desk areas tend to be dark, cramped and loud. Not the best environment for concentrating and getting things done.
- Employees get their personal items stolen off their desks on a regular basis with little assistance from Security team.
- This is very much a hospitality company first and foremost, and a tech company second. Quite a culture shock if you're coming from a die hard tech company (consumer/enterprise software, AR, VR, robotics, gaming, etc). I've experienced this numerous times: mentioning something marginally technical and being faced with blank stares.
- The company is a hot mess internally. No standardization in software, minimal cross-team collaboration, no version history in the codebase (well there might be some but not for everything that gets committed), lots of politics and jockeying for position/visibility, teams are very protective rather than collaborative seemingly forgetting we all work at the same place for the same goals."

It's great if you fall very much to the left of the political spectrum like the rest of the company (and SF). But if you happen to have a couple right-wing sympathies like me such as expressing your admiration for Ben Carson in a team lunch, you will be met with frowns and disdain. I overheard an argument where a co-worker said he opposed universal income and everyone around him started to argue with him. I'm pretty sure if you said you liked Trump in any way, you'd be out of the building with all your possessions in a box.

Also the co-founders are infallible and worshipped by everyone on the team. Their ""Is Mankind"" campaign was a terrible ""Emperor's New Clothes""-esque flop but no one dared to correct them."

Good mission
Interesting product and problem to work on","Culture is hypocritical- the founders might not mean to have the culture become what it is today but reality is that people only being a host to manage up. The outside image and recruiting brand definitely looks much better than the reality inside. They recently cut the food team while taking about the brand of AIRFAM when recruiting - no family is disposable for financial reasons, if you cannot stand for your culture then do not say or brand it.

Broken operation - I have been working for several tech companies big and small, the management at Airbnb is definitely on the chaotic side.  Teams step on each others’ toes, nonsense frequent reorganization, people get promoted by taking others’ credit. Mid management  focus on growing their own career here rather than helping  team or their reports be successful. Setting up your authority in the organization or being an early employee is more important than doing actual impactful work. Many managers promoted within the company from early days do not know how to manage and often meddle with employee’s work.

Lack of innovation - most of middle management here, as a result of trying to promote their own career, do not take bold innovative approach to the business. The result is a lack of innovation to make impact but rather fine tuning to make their performance review looks good or please their upper management.

No work life balance - you are expected to work A LOT sometimes 70-80 hours when you are on certain teams."

Over the last 6 months, they've brought in top talent from companies like Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter, and Google. It really shows when you see what's planned for the next year.

- Some great tooling. The development environments leave something to be desired, but their core infrastructure (esp. some of the backend services) is really impressive. Tons of companies in SV are using many of the tools Airbnb has open sourced and this is only a fraction of what's been built.

- They're aware of technical debt. Current stack is very ruby heavy and monolithic and they're migrating to well-defined java/scala microservices which is great.
- Very little red tape to actually deploying code.
- The culture is a thing. If you're a ""gilfoyle"" you'll probably hate it here. Thankfully, they do a good job at bringing in people that actually want to be there and care about the product.
- Food is amazing. Better than Facebook. Also great benefits and fantastic compensation if you're on the more experienced side.
- Massive potential. The exec team is focusing on the right projects to get to a point where we can IPO. We're not quite there yet, but it's an exciting time to be here.
- They actually care about their customers.
- Brand new hardware
- Epic office. This place is an interior design marvel.
- Health insurance, etc. are excellent.
- You can pick your team as an engineer! This leads to better chemistry and keeps all teams focused on making themselves appealing.","- Last year or so they promoted some people to management that really need more training. So on some teams, you're not going to have a great time.
- If you're not an engineer, YMMV. I've heard the food team, facilities, etc. is largely being phased out for contractors.
- Tiny 401k match. But this should probably change when they IPO.

People don't even think twice about sidelining those who they think aren't cool enough I.e. Have families whom they have to get home to, don't drink. This is a alcohol heavy culture and it is NOT inclusive of those who don't join in. Also, pay raises, promotions, spot bonuses, are VERY random, no transparency.

Whether people want to admit it or not, countless people are here for the equity, and won't hesitate to jump ship when things go south. There are prank emails titled ""Important IPO Update"" to get people's attention; I've overheard countless conversations with people 1) reminiscing about their old company and not willing to leave until they vest, 2) not being truly passionate about the product, or 3) directly comparing how much equity they got. The IPO is a constant question that's asked during all-hands and is frequently the most upvoted.
-- The Kool-Aid here is stronger than ever. Buy into the cult or leave. A ton of people are hesitant or afraid to tell upper management about what they don't like about recent/upcoming product(s) such as Magical Trips. Several coworkers whom I've talked to and I have been part of conversations (even involving middle management) where people have openly voiced their concerns or complaints.
-- Really poor transparency. Political. Depends on your team and YMMV. Your manager may verbally tell you that you're doing great and dole out compliments every so often, but you may be shocked when your performance reviews come out. 
-- ""Culture"" can be described as how well you embody the company's mission and core values, and is ridiculously subjective. Lots of talented people don't make the cut because they failed to make a good impression on the core values interviews. It's Airbnb's way of weeding out people who aren't a ""good fit"" for their clique.
-- Very cliquey, feels like a frat. If you fit in, you'll like it. If you don't, you won't. Emphasis on drinking at company events. Overheard multiple people on different occasions making straight up sexist remarks during and after work.
-- Poor work-life balance. People appear happy-go-lucky but many are in fact stressed out. Lyft drivers often tell me how people complain about work. Coworkers I've talked to complain about the constant pressure to do well for performance evaluations.
-- Lots and lots of growing pains.

Honestly not at all surprised they plunged to #35 on Glassdoor."
331,Airbnb,An inspiring and fulfilling place to work!,2016-12-09,5.0,Software Engineer,"- Genuinely supportive and invested coworkers 
- Founders are very focused on not stagnating as we grow
- Engineers can choose their own team, so you can find a team that suits you in terms of work-life balance / productivity. There's no global company culture of ""workaholics"" or ""slackers"", you really can just find the right role for you
- Similarly, it's easy to find the kind of eng role you prefer (product, front-end, infra, etc)
- Diversity efforts are the best I've ever seen or heard of in a large tech company. Estaff is very committed to increasing our internal diversity and also making sure there are no problems with discrimination of any kind. (Our mission is ""belong anywhere"" and leadership takes that very very seriously, including internally.)
- Leadership is constantly working to fix any employee issues that arise, we take tons of happiness surveys and have lots of communication on how they're planning to improve things that are issues
- Basically Airbnb has always seemed very committed to employee happiness, via perks and transparency and inclusion, and it works!","- Sometimes the growing pains can get frustrating and things can move kind of slow, but in my experience it's better than most companies this size
- Gym memberships are not included in perks"

- Great mid to lower level team members, who are fun to work with, represent the culture and make the challenges bearable
-Amazing perks, culture...they spent absurd amount of money on their employees everyday
-Great offices to work in, well designed, great environment
-Hyper growth company
-Amazing recruiting team","-Incredibly junior executive level leadership with founders who are more disrupting than beneficial
-Chaotic internal operations, lack of clear strategy, decision rights, process alignment...you name it.
- Access to information, data and decisions is incredibly difficult

If you completely buy into the culture in all aspects, this will be the best job you ever have.","There is not a lot of room for dissent, and the organization is aggressively political in nature. There is a heavy emphasis on fitting in and being the part of the ""Airbnb culture"", and those who don't fit in usually won't last very long.

Most co-workers on your team genuinely care.","It's a call center, with every horrible feature that job entails. I was micro-managed by my last manager, who previously worked at Google and probably couldn't have worked customer experience herself. Burn out happens fast. Though there were all the ""perks"" they opportunity to take advantage of them was slim since you had to be strapped to your computer for incoming calls at all times. NPS is the metric they use on whether you did a good job, which is about as effective as allowing the general population to vote for our president. In short, I hated the job but you might not if you can stand working for a middle manager who doesn't really need to be there in the first place."

A good IPO will be a big pay day to employees but if you don't care much about money maybe other companies can be more challenging and better for your career.,"Engineering management is really bad. Managers do not pay attention to career growth given that career ladder is taboo inside the company, nobody talks or knows their position is, so don't expect your manager to advice you much about how to go from level a to level b, c ... etc. 

When people get bored at their current position they either switch teams or branch out to management (lateral moves) which feeds back into the problem where management focuses on reporting green numbers to upper management."

1. The emperor has no clothes. Everyone seems afraid to tell Brian Chesky that nobody and I mean nobody thinks the upcoming product is a good idea.

2. So much Kool-Aid I mean its organic and locally sourced but you better be ready to drink from the fire-hose. If you can go full Stockholm syndrome you will enjoy the ""culture"".

3. Core-values are mostly phony-baloney and a way to sort out the cool kids from the rest. The company misses out on serious talent due to people being eliminated in core values interviews (google it).

4. Work-life balance does not exist yet. people are trying but dont be fooled you will suffer for trying to maintain balance in your life esp. if you have a family or priorities outside Airbnb.

5. Emphasis on drinking at company events and off-sites is not like anything ive ever seen. If you arent a drinker you will feel left-out at events.

6. Most middle managers are inexperienced or coming fromm non-management roles.

There is nothing I want to be promoted to within customer service and getting out of customer service is nearly impossible, especially if you don't want to move to the god-forsaken city of San Francisco. 

I started working here because I really believed in what Airbnb stands for and the service it is providing to the world, but it turns out that ""belonging""is just their overt mission. In actually, Airbnb is like every other mega cooperation - focused on making more and more money for billionaires. Over the past year a number of our perks have been chipped away at and office culture is plummeting - right now everyone I talk to in the Portland office wants to quit. Additionally, every since we got a new CFO - who on his first visit to the Portland office called Bernie Sanders a crazy person (way to know your audience, dude), the belt has been tightened more and more one what resources we have access to to solve our customers problems.

The metrics we are held to were raised significantly right before I (and a bunch of other people) got hired. So there are a bunch of longer-tenured employees in this office who were promoted quickly within their first year of working here because their ""excellence"" was based on much lower standards  than newer employees are held to. Now it's nearly impossible to get promoted.

They introduced sick time last year (it used to be a part of our PTO - 15 days for sick and vacation AND no holidays off) as being unlimited, and then about a month or two ago backtracked and said it was never meant to be unlimited and actually we only get 40 hours of sick time a year. This was announced mid-year after many people had already used that much time up because they had been under the assumption that it was unlimited. Our managers tried to tell us it was never unlimited, which is frankly a bunch of BS."

I wish that concept was celebrated more often and people weren't hamstrung by an unwillingness to buy into the cult and saturate themselves with Airbnb Kool-Aid.

Pay is out of this world.  Office is located in the city so no hopping on a bus to South Bay.","Leadership is still figuring things out.  Half of the staff is contractors.  They claim to never have headcount to hire anyone new, but the company hires 50+ people a week.  Because everyone here is so talented, everyone feels like they need to have an opinion on everything which causes confusion and things to happen very slowly."

The perks are superb such as on-site chefs to cook you breakfast and lunch, premium free health insurance, monthly commute reimbursement, company parties, dogs in the office, and lots of swag.","As an employee who joined near the end of the hiring cycle in Portland, a lot of us were lost in the masses. The company started out being tight nitched, and it was easy to feel unwelcome as a new employee. Other workers had a sense of annoyance by the presence of new employees, not really welcoming. 

Leadership is sometimes based on tenure and not on whether or not they are the best fit. If you're not doing well, is easy to get reprimanded for it without much consideration for what support you need from leadership. 

The schedule was once consistent, and now it's all over the place. We were told we weren't have to work weekends, but that quickly changed. Now employees will only get one day off between five day stretches, which is really exhausting with all the energy this job takes. 

There's a lot of emphasis put onto the social aspect of the job. If you're an introvert, it's easy to get worn out on all the social events and need to be social in order to advance in the company.  

Career opportunities are few and far between. Although you can adavance every six months within your role, getting out of that role seems impossible. 

Burnout and bitterness can be seen in the workers who have been here for awhile. Some employees have gotten bonuses in the office, while other people who have achieved great things and global recognition in the company have received nothing. The ones who have benefitted from these perks make it loudly known to other people in the office, disrupting other people's work and morale.

-Family environment
-Great culture 
-No micro management
-Lots of room to grow

It also seems like there may be a little favoritism within the teams sometimes which causes the wrong people to get promoted faster than others.

-Caliber of hiring for unique combination of functional expertise + cultural fit. The result is a cool blend of great people from the early days, as well as experts from their respective areas, all working together well.
-More data-driven decisions than some aesthetic-driven decision from early days. I've met some of the smartest and friendliest data-scientists here, all who have surfaced interesting insights from our data.
-Accessibility and transparency of senior leadership. I'm amazed that, even at our company's size, there are still at least weekly company-wide meetings where we can hear about various topics from Brian and other senior leaders.","-Operations and internal processes are generally quite inefficient, but things are getting better. Its a downside of the rapid growth, but sometimes its difficult figuring out who decides on what and how those things should be coordinated through the org.

Young leadership who expect growth despite their lack of ability to coach effectively or measure productivity. There is no communication or cohesion amongst junior managers, while senior managers are unable to properly communicate the vision and expectations with those below them. Many are unwilling to change. Example. different managers expect different things, even from the same individual.
People with disabilities are often seen as more trouble instead of proper coaching. Example, if you suffer from mental disability you are often seen as a weak link.
Competition creating nightmares for many employees. Example, everyone applying for the same job with generally the same experience because they want to get away from where they already are.
Coverups by senior leaders so their junior leaders aren't looking as bad as they are. Example, leaders not knowing boundaries when it comes to hooking up with coworkers or borderline alcoholism.
Lack of accountability for all the above.

It's been a year now, and I don't feel like I belong anymore.

Reasons for this:
- Yes, you can bring your dog to work, but your name won't exist anymore.  Your name will now be your ""dog's name + mom/dad""
- If you don't like going out all the time, and prefer to do your work and come home, not a good place for you.  I'm an introvert at heart, and this is an extrovert workplace.  It's expected that you go to happy hours, events, etc.
- Your life outside of work is important, until metrics take over.  When I first started, I was told my schedule could flex for my commitments outside of work.  Now I have to leave early because they are strict with the 1 weekend day schedule.
- If you need quiet to get work done, this is not the place for you.  You are constantly surrounded by people either on the phones, or socializing, and it can get very loud and distracting."

I've already learned a number of new skills in my 4 months here.","The way the leadership team is structured is confusing and, I think, convoluted.  The team leads are hired externally, and thus don't have a clear understanding of the day-to-day work we have to do.  When I have questions, I have to go to someone else off of my team, which puts me in a weird position when my manager is constantly asking what they can help me with.  This is not my managers fault, it's just the way the structure is.  I have been told that my manager's job is to help me develop my career goals, but since my manager is just as new as I am, they don't have the network connections or knowledge of the company to really help me develop where I want to go."
441,Airbnb,Rocket Ship Full of Amazing People,2015-02-12,5.0,Manager,"Past places I've worked at have really messed up on the culture and Airbnb is the opposite. You can tell the founders care a lot about the company, culture and their colleagues. You can tell people are happy right when you walk in the door. I used to dread Sunday evenings because I would have to go to work and now I look forward to them. 

The hiring process may be a bit slow, but they really do hire well. Everyone here is super nice, smart and hard working. 

Also, because of the fast pace that this company is growing at you get to work on a crazy amount of cool stuff and have a huge impact.","The work life balance here can be tricky sometimes because there's so much to do. Also, I never thought I'd say this, but sometimes there are too many social events which seem to be focused on the party crowd alone."
442,Airbnb,Best damn job I've ever had...,2015-02-12,5.0,Customer Experience Specialist,"Airbnb focuses a lot on company culture. I work with friends, which generates an open environment for me to be my best self and put my best ideas forward. I feel respected by my colleagues, and I feel taken care of by my workplace. We have a world class food program, travel credits, enough time-off, and a beautiful workspace to call home. Our leaders are approachable and want to work with the ""troops on the ground"" to ensure our product works.",Work/life balance can be a real struggle. Unless you're fine with your work/office/colleagues becoming the center of your life/home/friends.
443,Airbnb,Words can only begin to describe Airbnb,2015-02-12,5.0,Community Organizer,The company ethic and culture are so vibrant and supportive. Every day I go to work I feel like I'm part of one big family and everyone supports one another both inside and outside the office. Working for a travel company that provides such memorable experiences to our guests is really a treat. The hours are manageable and pay is excellent.,"Like many others have said, it's hard to not get wanderlust working at Airbnb! They even give you travel credit every quarter so that you are incentivized to go out and use the product whenever possible!"
444,Airbnb,"Crazy fast growth, awesome people and pay, often exhausting",2015-02-12,5.0,Customer Experience Lead,"Airbnb is one of those rare employers that really cares about what you think. We hire only the best of the best, so opinions are welcome and heard from anywhere -- whether you've been here 6 months or 5 years. The perks are great: travel to SF at least once a year, the chance to visit other offices (including outsourcers), breakfast and lunch daily, dogs in the office, great pay, ""open concept"" office and work station options... it goes on and on. We also work effing hard and the work is fun and challenging. Managers trust you to make best judgement calls and empower you to do your best work. Even if you don't particularly get along with your direct lead, there are several others that are there to support you. There is a lot of opportunity to move up and around. We all trust each other with our lives.","Hyper growth has meant some things, like basic training, can be overlooked. If you aren't someone that can work without guidance this may not be the place for you. Initiatives often live for 2 weeks only to die and be brought up again months later. Change is constant. Communication is improving, but not perfect. Work life balance is incredibly hard to make work for a lot of people. There can be a atmosphere akin to ""drinking the koolaid."""
445,Airbnb,Ok perks and looks great on your resume,2015-02-12,3.0,Anonymous Employee,"Perks are ok. Free breakfast, lunch, and dinner. However, the food options are not varied and dietary restrictions / allergies are not taken into account. You also receive a quarterly $500 travel ""coupon"" to use towards an Airbnb listing. 

The people that work here are extremely friendly and it truly is more like having a second family than having ""co-workers"".","Compensation is NOT competitive and raises (or even cost of living increases) are few and far between. Positions that warrant a salary of $120,000 at other bay area tech startups, only receive about $60,000 at Airbnb. Many people (including myself) have had to take a significant pay cut. Essentially this means that Airbnb is not good for the long term, but alternatively is a great short term option to buff up your resume. 

Working at Airbnb is pretty much like belonging to a cult. If you don't fit it (introverts specifically) you will not succeed. Promotions are not given to the people that are the best fit for the position, but are given to the person that spends the most time socializing outside of work. 

Also, work life balance is practically non-existent."

- Partial weekend shifts (personally I prefer to work one weekend day)
- Dogs allowed in office (again, I love dogs, but some folks don't or have allergies)

They are often here before me or working later than anyone in the office. Coming from another start up where the founders were constantly traveling or just MIA, this dedication speaks volumes about the overall energy in Airbnb. The founders show a genuine wonder at the company they've built, and that humble attitude translates into an incredible work environment. The culture and core values are actively embraced by everyone. I would look forward to grabbing lunch or happy hour with any single coworker. As a rapid growth company, the work is challenging but rewarding. You will impact the company with the work that you do.","This is not a company that hands out gold stars. Everyone works hard, and they expect and trust others to work hard. You are not micromanaged, which is a Pro in my book.

 - there's a lot of flexibility in when and how you work -- although there is a lot of work

 - for data science, there's encouragement for us to be continuously learning and developing our skills
 - two weeks off (for almost everyone in the company) over the winter holidays","There are some things that could be improved: 
 - accountability is lacking in a lot of ways; some teams could be challenged more to meet goals/targets
 - the environment at the office is really chaotic and makes it hard to get much done (this should get better once we move onto our new floor)
 - we spend money on things that sometimes seem frivolous

449,Airbnb,Airbnb employee from the early days,2015-02-11,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"The employee experience at Airbnb has improved over the last year and I believe it will keep getting better. I started as an hourly employee and the company has rewarded me for hard work, creativity, and ongoing contributions by allowing and encouraging me to work in a variety of roles. I've been able to learn from multiple teams and mentors and that has strengthened my cross-functional skills. The company also encourages travel and they help employees offset the cost. Additionally, I'm constantly encouraged to take ownership of my primary role within the company and I feel like a business owner within the business. I feel very valued as an employee here!","I do wish that employees could work remotely more, and not just under special circumstances. But I understand why we can't. I also think there's some managers within the company that still ""look down upon"" those who strive for work-life balance. They need to stop that or people, really quality employees, will leave."

Several of our teams have been formed by a couple engineers deciding that something needs to be improved, and rather than telling management that there is a need, they just filled the need themselves.","For a lot of engineers, the tendency is to automate everything.  It can require a fair bit of discipline to do things that don't scale, but at this stage of the company's growth, the opportunity cost of working on automation for a couple weeks can be significant."

The rapid growth makes it a great place to learn, since you're constantly solving new technical and social problems.

The company really does care about the users, and has a fundamentally positive impact on the world.","The office is crazy crowded, which can make it hard to focus. Hiring lots of new grads means a lot of time is spent answering questions and trying to train the recruits. Also, the interview load is pretty heavy.

+ The mission is life changing. Knowing that you're working to help people around the world connect in meaningful ways, see parts of the world that they wouldn't otherwise be able to, keep their homes, follow their dreams, etc. drives the workforce and fuels the energy. Everyone knows and speaks the core values regularly.

Plus, every perk speaks back to our core values.","For all of these, the executives are aware and are working on it.
+ The work/life balance needs improvement (it can be especially hard on relationships), although it's gotten far better over the years. (Just a result of the incredible growth over the past few years.)

+ Last-minute requests (including business travel) come up more regularly than they should. 
+ Inter-departmental communication is challenging, and sometimes totally lacking, as we're growing so quickly. 
+ Meetings should be more efficient.

People who would be bored without constant change flourish here.

462,Airbnb,Strong focus on mission and culture,2015-01-04,5.0,Software Engineer,"I would not like to reiterate all the pros and cons other people have mentioned. To me, the most defining difference of Airbnb from other companies I have seen is the company's mission and positive, well-cultivated work culture.


 Although Airbnb is a for-profit corporation, we put a lot of stress on in our mission - ""belong anywhere"". Before I traveled on Airbnb after becoming an employee, I had different kinds of traveling experiences and have started to think traditional quick and hurried ways of travel is not right and even possibly wrong. Although Airbnb makes money from guests and hosts, we also try hard to communicate the reason why you should start traveling with locals on Airbnb, instead of using hotels. Travel experiences on Airbnb are very different from person to person and can be transformative. I feel I work for a company that can change the way people think about traveling.

Airbnb has a distinctive culture. People are smart and at the same time have interesting stories to share, and everyone values learning from others. During my cultural fit interview (Airbnb is the only company for which I have ever done a culture fit interview for an engineering position), one of my interviewers asked me “what can you teach me right now?"" That was one of the most difficult interview questionsI have ever had. After a bit of hesitation, I taught my interviewer how to practice standing meditation, which I learned just a week before the interview at an Insight Meditation session. We ask this question to many candidates. We encourage people to share a ""fun fact"" when you are first introducing yourself or when you are presenting at team meetings. I have learned people at Airbnb have so many interesting experiences to share and feel humbled to work with them everyday. We have a ""Hands on Nerds"" session organized by one of our engineers where we teach ""skills"" to each other - these can be technical or be non-technical like how to do screen printing or how to dance Bhangra, an indian traditional dance. This culture also applies to day-to-day work. After an incident caused by human errors is resolved, engineers write a postmortem and share it with all product team members to teach and share, not to blame and ask for an apology. Senior engineers are willing to spend time discussing your mistakes to help you become a better engineer. Every weekly engineering meeting starts with appreciation time when people thank others who helped them or had done great work in that week.

For a general perspective about working at Airbnb, read other people's reviews. Factors like compensation, hours, and perk matter to me and what is being said by others is largely true. But for me, the mission and the culture are more important reasons that makes me feel excited to go to work everyday.","I cannot think of major cons except for things might happen at any other hyper-growth company. We have a crowded, noisy office on one floor of a building, but early 2015 we will open up another floor and things will get better. We had not invested much in new engineer onboarding, but we just started a new 3-weeks extensive program with classes and code labs and will keep iterating with the program."
463,Airbnb,User Experience Design at Airbnb,2015-01-02,2.0,California,"If you want to learn about the branding, community, and messaging parts of customer experience Airbnb is a good place to be. Airbnb was able to shift a paradigm of how people think about the space where they live and how they travel, and that's no small feat.","Airbnb design culture resembles a college design course, which isn't completely surprising because this was the founder's first job and success out of a design school. There's very little looking at real data, qualitative user feedback or real user empathy. Airbnb has forced out all of the best people who think deeply and holistically about interaction problems. The designers who are most successful are the ones who can quickly create multiple iterations of visually compelling ideas. As the result the design is beautiful but still disjointed, unintuitive and arguably results in a much less successful bottom line for the company."

I was really looking forward to being a part of something I believed in. I'll admit I was struggling, but I thought I would be given the benefit to improve my self.... Nope.....

- Management is under a lot of stress to produce results, this creates an environment where employees are constantly under scrutiny and numbers results.
- Lost my job over a bureaucratic mis-understanding, no discussion just let go. 
- Worked to try and bring a culture of open communication. I don't work there any more."
465,Airbnb,"great company to work. lively and fun culture, lots of people to learn from",2014-12-29,5.0,Software Engineer,"I've been working at airbnb for a year as a software engineer. Top two things I like is how helpful people are. Instead of wasting 2 hours trying to figure it out on my own, if I get stuck, I ask for help, and people spend the time to both answer the question, and explain a bit more so I actually understand what's going on. Within my first few weeks, I was amazed at how much I learned, and now a year into the job, I feel very knowledgeable in my area, and pass on the favor by helping new hires. The second favorite thing about Airbnb is the people. I'm a new grad, and I really like the fun culture, a mix of people who are chill, but also those who like to go out and party a bit more. Nothing that crazy, probably doesnt compare to facebook's epic parties, but I'm more than happy. And it's a great crowd. Also, our office is amazing, just google for ""airbnb custom spaces"" to see pics. I love bringing people to the office because they always like it. In terms of the job itself, it's very reasonable, flexible hours, only occasionally work late when I choose to, supportive and helpful team. All in all, there's nothing that I really dislike about Airbnb.","I would definitely say the company has more focus on product development and growth, than on engineering quality. That means that currently the code base is a little messy, and there are times where you'll have to ask a few people before you find someone who understands the code well. However, this is definitely being worked on as we expand, and different components are being refactored or rewritten. Also, I feel that designers get too much say in the things that are built, occasionally at the expense of functionality."

Our purpose is to ""create a sense of belonging"". I just find that really compelling. From lots of other companies that would seem kind of ""pie-in-the-sky""-like, but here, it feels incredibly genuine and gives meaning to all the smaller tasks that make up our work here.","Most of the ""pros"" could also be considered ""cons"" if you can't adapt properly. For example, the open, collaboration-inducing floor-plan could be distracting for some (I bought a good set of earphones and don't even think about it anymore). The fact that our company is young and growing quickly provides a huge opportunity for someone with initiative looking for personal growth – however there's not (yet) much in the way of organized career planning.

It is not uncommon to see people, mostly at entry level and mid-level roles, working late into the evening hours. Exec level needs to make this a top priority, as it will end up sapping the energy and production levels of the corporate team. Recently when employees were hounded (with top brass approval) outside the office and in the lobby to vote for a particular candidate in the city elections, many associates were offended at this crossing over the line into personal life and personal political choice."

482,Airbnb,I look forward to each day at Airbnb,2014-11-19,5.0,Data Engineer,"Compensation/Benefits:
Industry competitive compensation (including equity program), 100% coverage for health, dental, and vision insurance.  This year (2014), we'll be shutting down the office for the last two weeks in December (in addition to my 2 weeks of vacation + 5 Holidays).     

Day-to-Day:
Working in data at Airbnb is an exciting place to be.  We're currently a small team (but scaling upward), which allows for a lot of creative input into the future direction of the company's data culture.  In my 6 months at Airbnb, I've gained ample exposure to trending Bay Area data technologies (Hadoop/Hive/Presto), and work with a highly capable team of tremendously smart individuals.  

Food Program:
All meals are provided (free of charge) by our world class culinary team.  This includes breakfast, lunch, dinner, and various snacks throughout the day.   We also have an excellent coffee/tea program (Da La Paz coffee/Four Barrel Espresso/).  If it's your thing, you can also make your own espresso drinks on an industrial La Marzocco machine (after going through a training session).

Office Space:
The Airbnb office space is incredible.  Ours is an open workspace with tons of natural lighting (skylights and large windows).  The workspace has become a bit crowded/noisy in recent months, but things should improve when the 3rd floor renovation is complete.  This will increase our available floorspace and meeting room capacity by 150%.  We're also planning to move to 100% self-actuating sit/stand desks in the future.  

Culture:
The working culture at Airbnb is very relaxed, allowing you to show who you really are.  People are very accepting and genuine, so there's no need to put on your corporate work facade each day.  The company also works hard to keep a good social element.  Weekly Friday happy hours (rotating between creative on-site events, and bartabs at local establishments) are always a good place to start your weekend, and meet folks in other teams.  We also have seasonal parties (Thanksgiving, Winter Holiday Party, Summer Celebration, One Airbnb ), which are highlights on the social calendar.  For Summer Celebration this year, we bussed the entire company to Russian River for a full day on the river.  

Travel Culture:
Being a travel/hospitality company, we're highly encouraged to use our product.  We're given a $2000 travel stipend on Airbnb ($500 quarterly).  Long multi-week vacations are encouraged.","No 401k Match available

Airbnb is a relatively young company, where there still figuring things out.  Things are moving fast, which can be frustrating for some people.  Yesterday's strategy may differ entirely from todays, which may require more adaptability than is typical for most jobs.  Prior to joining Airbnb, I worked for large companies with more traditional data cultures.  Best practices were better established, and the tools were more stable.  At Airbnb, things are quite the opposite, which has often led to frustration.  But, overall, I think the challenge is worthwhile."

Airbnb takes great care of its employees - more so than any company I've seen to date including Google. The perks and work environment are carefully thought out for what people really want instead of creating a laundry list of things to try to impress people.,"Work-life balance is challenging and there are definite growing pains. Many early employees are learning to adjust to the change of being a growing, now mid-size company - some are doing better than others unfortunately. This causes some politics from time to time and leads to some employee turn-over. The average age of employees is in the mid-20s and the social activities definitely cater to younger people.

501,Airbnb,"For an engineer looking for product / technical learning and impact, Airbnb is an amazing fit",2014-11-03,5.0,Software Engineer,"Airbnb has a strong positive culture - People are genuinely invested in the company / product and constantly talking about ways to make it better.  It's intoxicating and makes it a lot more fun to go to work and think of your own ideas to improve Airbnb.  For an engineer, a relatively small team (~140 engineers) working on a complex product makes for lots of opportunities for impact and ownership, even in the first couple months. The fast growth also adds to the ownership and career advancement opportunities, since a relatively short tenure at Airbnb can become seniority with all of the expansion and hiring.  Additionally I feel like I've learned a ton both from other engineers and working collaboratively with designers, data scientists, and producers (product managers).  Overall I don't think I would have shipped nearly the diverse and impactful set of projects at another company, nor feel the same sense of community among my team and coworkers.  I interviewed at many companies before choosing Airbnb and I've never even been tempted to look back!","The product development process at Airbnb is chaotic.  Features usually start as a brainstorm with input from designers, producers, engineers, etc. and coalesce into a (slightly) more concrete roadmap, with the producer taking the lead on shaping the plan.  This roadmap can then shift as priorities or situations change, meaning you need to be able to roll with the punches and thrive on a little chaos.  But it's not all a con, as having input into the product as an engineer is fun and the system gives engineers a lot of autonomy and discretion on their projects."

While in my eyes it's pretty awesome to be a part of a company that's young, dynamic and rapidly growing, some may find it a bit too crazy. We're still figuring out things as we go, and it's not always clear what the process is and who owns what. It gives those that are proactive and interested in having an impact on how Airbnb does things, a lot of opportunity, but it's admittedly not for everyone. Some may find it a bit chaotic.

You feel the positive and energetic atmosphere when you walk in the door.","The company claims to care about fair and competitive employee compensation, but has repeatedly botched efforts to ""level"" and ""adjust"". It's clear they count on employees to stay because of the mission rather than the compensation.

The company has grown really fast and hierarchy and process have been slow to follow. It's still a bit of a mess when it comes to decision-making and execution. This comes straight from the top - the founders and execs are the worst offenders.

Atrocious management.

None of the other lovely benefits mentioned by engineers and HQ folk here count if you don't work in the office

If you work in CS, chances are you will feel taken for granted. That is because you are being taken for granted.

Drama. Obvious favoritism as people are promoted or passed over with more regard for their social status than their competencies. Bias towards promotion of men in CS, even when an individual is less qualified than a woman in that role (and there are more women in the pool than men)."

I'm a big fan of dogs in the office (since I like most of them more than the humans),"Management is a uneducated group of thugs who don't have any real-world people management experience. Airbnb needs to invest in a management team (from the top down) that understands people management and employee retention- not just those who repeat what HR says to them with deaf ears.

HR - This is a group you go to when you have an issue and need help deciding on the best options available for you. I hardly talk to HR as I've heard nothing but horror stories of the team overall. Ive had colleagues talk to HR and mysteriously ""quit"" very soon after. It's honestly a bit crazy.

I definitely feel like my coworkers make me work harder, but in a really healthy (read: not cutthroat) way.  
Energy, Creativity and Quirkiness: It's a very design-centric company (probably most largely influenced by our founders, who come from RISD), and we value aesthetics, quirkiness, and a light-hearted sense of humor. We laugh a lot, but still maintain a serious work ethic and professionalism; I think we're really lucky in that sense.  
Love of Product: Airbnb really doesn't hire people unless they are passionate about the product, its implications and its future. You can be off the charts in terms of brains, experience and technical skills, but if you come off as blase about what we do, you won't get hired. I think that really distinguishes us from other companies and ensures that we're all invested in the company's future, not just financially.","It's an extremely scrappy, lean place. If you like adventures, daily challenges and a constantly-changing environment, you'll love it here and excel. If you prefer knowing what to anticipate on a day to day basis, this probably isn't the place for you.

526,Airbnb,A frat house with a lot of macs,2012-12-12,2.0,Current Member of Remote Team,"-fabulous product - the ability to help everyday people expand their income and make friends around the world; it's really a wonderful thing that is changing the world one reservation at the time
-The ability to work from home from your first day of employment (if you're in a remote position, but even the SF-based employees can work from home one day a week).
-depending on your job, a new Airbook laptop for your use
-quarterly travel credit (although they put a bunch of restrictions on the use of it, which sort of makes it feel like a rebate)
-the actual Airbnb hosts out in the world, for the most part, are really interesting and remarkable people
-The Customer Support team is full of genuine, friendly, smart, and reliable people.","Many employees do not receive health insurance or other standard full-time benefits until 6 to 12 months after they begin work with the company, so do not be fooled by the shiny promises on the jobs page. I have had 4 different managers in 1 year and none of them had/have the experience or skills to effectively lead a team. (Leadership is not having a big ego or ordering people around.) No one's word means anything at Airbnb. People say one thing one day and then the next day they do a different thing. This is not me being resistant to innovation or change. I'm talking about basics like meetings you've set up, human resources issues, or even just responding to emails. You really can't rely on anyone to do what they promised. People don't communicate well and there are few people who take responsibility for their actions. People with no experience or expertise make decisions that make absolutely no sense to the people putting those policies into effect. Management rarely communicates to the employees who have to execute these changes nor the community of users who rely on the site what they are planning to change. Airbnb is losing the group of hosts who first joined them before it was a cause celebre, the ones who helped them get where they are today, and it's a shame. It's also losing smart, devoted employees who are tired of being subject to the whims, empty promises, and poor management skills of their supervisors. If you are a smart, mature person with integrity you will have a hard time here because most of the employees are not grown up and do not value or possess critical thinking skills. There's so much more I could say, but these are all the things I wish I had known before I accepted a job there. Working at Airbnb has been a real disappointment."
