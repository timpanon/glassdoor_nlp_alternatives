206,Allstream,Process and Support Analyst,2015-02-15,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"Highly skilled employees, casual dress","This is old news but I had to share. Where do I begin? I worked here for a brief period of 2 years in the 2000s. None of the people who were there at the time are still employed by this company. The axe-wielders ended up getting it in the neck. Live by the sword and you die by the sword...
They began to implemented a system of ""Quality"" throughout the organization which was really nothing more than a witch-hunt to lay people off and to assign blame.
- PM Teams were nothing more than projects sponsored by managers who wanted to get stuff removed or shifted off their plate
- No accountability by managers they were just scared of ""day oners"" well-placed with management 
- stock bonuses were prime drivers doing the ""right thing"" for the customers was laughed at and derided as a flaw in thinking
- naked ambition would pit employees against each other to save their behinds
- In case of men or women going for a job reporting to a male manager the hottest female candidate will be guaranteed to get the job (especially one with the biggest rack)
- Matrix Management - this company is the poster child of this style with disastrous results! See Microsoft downfall as the prime example of what not to do. High prospects of conflict and bad internal relations were day to day normal functions
- open challenges and HR type pay discussions held in the forum of team meetings
- meetings 20 to 25 hours per week - 60 to 70 hour weeks i.e. no work life balance
- the quality teams especially brought out the worst in people"
207,Allstream,Continually changing without any changes,2015-02-13,2.0,,Good pay. Good experience. Union,"Lack of good upper management direction. Continually say and do the same things and wonder why they get the same results when looking for change. Consistently lose or let go of good talented employees while continuing to protect and nurture the same old less talented employees who are much better at conversing by the water cooler than they are at doing there jobs.

209,Allstream,"Picture an innovative, collaborative, proactive company. Allstream is the OPPOSITE of that.",2015-01-14,2.0,,There are many good people at Allstream. They work hard and fulfill their duties. Colleagues are gracious and kind.,"Senior Leadership complains about a culture of indifference. And the President perpetually claims ""It Starts With You!""  However, he fails to see that it starts with him. Management style is closed off and reactive. I applaud the ""Visions 2015"" Summit - However, a single event cannot change a company's culture. 

A colleague of mine said in all of his/her time at Allstream  ""I've yet to experience collaborative and proactive management."" This is frustrating to employees who want to see the company succeed. Non-negotiable, unrealistic timelines are coupled with a lack of resources. By the time employees complete projects (often times with little pride as we are not given proper lead time and feel that we have been forced into a ""bare minimum"" situation), we are so run down that the thought of promoting change seems impossible."

There are still dedicated employees who are holding out faith that things will improve.,"Lack of vision. No stability. Employees are not valued. Constant layoffs. The ""do more with less and without compensation"". It is my belief that those of us who still care about this company are loosing faith steadily. Working 15 hour days is now the new normal. Many employees who choose to stay  are either too exhausted or lazy to pursue another company or are holding out for a package. We can't seem to attract or retain talent or young people. 

No capital funds. No backfill.  Unable to build or enhance the systems we use to automate and streamline many of our processes. No controls over our suppliers. Frontline repair team are focused on call pick up times and not actually managing/restoring the service. All of which resulting in an inability to meet our customer's needs."

229,Allstream,No investment in employees,2013-09-20,2.0,Senior Analyst,Working from home. Nothing else.,Still laying key skilled employees off. I worked in IT and I left several years ago. Best decision I ever made. The Toronto based management are still reducing their staffing levels across Canada. I know a few IT people who worked their with years of experience in Calgary at Allstream and they have been booted out this year. I would not recommend this company to anyone. The company is made up of an aged work force close to retirement. It does not invest in the future.
230,Allstream,"Disorganized, optics driven organization run by dinosaurs",2013-09-19,2.0,Anonymous Employee,"- If you know how to work the system and suck up to the right people you can actually get really far without actually doing any work!

- Great opp to make $$$ provided the above foundation is established

- In the heart of downtown, there is always something going on or places to go at lunch or after work

- Work from home with top notch hardware/network to facilitate this","- Rhetoric, triteness, and lack of creativity (i.e. we differentiate ourselves by the customer service that we provide, we have so and so amount of market share which means there is a lot of opportunity to grow and we'll accomplish this by doing things the exact same way that we always have and by doing things the same way as our competitors)

- Not a very friendly work environment on some teams.  Obviously, like any organization, you have your good and bad people.  But the ratio of good to bad is surprisingly close  

- Redundant processes.  When in doubt additional barriers (paperwork/processes) are created to offload or mitigate what is not known.  It is actually quite amusing 

- A BS driven organization.  If you look or act a certain way you can get very far.  Notice how this is also a pro? I guess it depends on whether you are skilled or blessed in this department.    

- People that work here will get the joke, the elevators! I have come close to losing my life or accidental dismemberment on many occasions."
231,Allstream,Good place to work,2013-08-02,4.0,Anonymous Employee,"Teleworking, knowledgeable peers, Dean Prevost - the President","lack of staff in positions where there is a lot of work and too many where there is little work, too many re-vamps in short times."

233,Allstream,Satisfied with Allstream,2013-07-17,4.0,National Sales Support,Good benefits and working culture,Constant restructuring and process changes.
234,Allstream,Poor Management,2013-06-16,2.0,Anonymous Employee,"Administrative Assistants can move to management positions quickly, as long as their Director moves up in the rankings.

Customer facing groups tend to have better pay and perks.","(Network Service) Managers are disconnected from their staff, and have very little management skills.  This is not entirely the fault of managers as directors appoint managers based on the availability in the existing management pool,  rather than appointing the right person for the position.  This is not a union environment (Allstream) yet they still make management appointments as if it were.   This creates a very dysfunctional relationship between the front line staff as management has no knowledge of their direct reports, or the function of the group they manage.

Expertise in a functional area (or areas) will ensure you do not move up.  As much of the knowledge base is close to retiring, and management with little knowledge, there is little incentive to promote the experts.  As a result,  morale is low, and many are just waiting for retirement."
235,Allstream,Good products - unable to sell them to my customers,2013-06-13,2.0,Anonymous Employee,Products are great and once installed have far less challenges than the competitors,Process to quote is painful. Compensation plan hold sales accountable for margin yet they do not have impact on actual margin (rather than the 'as sold' margin). There are many clients that Allstream has chosen not to pursue due to network footprint.
