There is a lot of untapped potential in improving the product and intra-organizational mobility.","Growing pains as the organization and product transitions to broaden its reach to more diverse customers segments.

44,Ancestry,Mass exit in product,2021-10-06,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"Ancestry has had leadership ups-and-downs through the years, often brought on by changes in investors. At the forefront, the company day-to-day is executed by a team of passionate, talented individuals both in product, design, and engineering. My review would have been glowing with positivity 6 months ago, which is sad given the time I spent at Ancestry, in spite of several changes in leadership over the years. (Over five years)","The latest change of C-level leadership has been chaotic, at best. The new CEO comes across as uncaring and robotic, though she oddly has a mass following on social media which is sadly attracting candidates to Ancestry for the wrong reasons. She connects with her social media following through her blog posts more than she connects with the real people she works with.

 A newly appointed CPO lacks experience to run a product of this magnitude, seems to have had an ""in"" with the CEO in order to get the role, and has directly attributed to a significant level of disruption and attrition across mid-level leadership. Many talented individuals have left taking years of product knowledge with them."

They give employees outrageous and impossible monthly goals. They don't pay a salary that makes it possible to live there. I made $17 an hour and my monthly rent in Salt Lake City was $1100 a month. They say they want to groom the future of genealogists but don't want to make any effort to do so they get rid of anyone under 30 and replace them with folks over 60 who have no corporate genelogy experience. They end up fired, and the turnover rate for emoyees is disgusting there because of it. Don't ever speak your mind about issues or they'll find a way to get you on the chopping block. All management there cares about it numbers. The employees at ProGen might as well be prisoners with a number instead of a name. I frequently faced harassment from coworkers. When a complaint was filed with HR, they told me that since I wasn't a ""protected class"" that my harassment didn't count and they blew it off."

Ownership changes hands to new owners who then proceed to make mistakes which are almost identical to those of the previous owners.

Ancestry just let go of two of their most critical and engaged product leaders, people almost universally valued and beloved, so that it can ""can innovate"" more quickly. On the other hand, parts of the company that are almost universally understood as serious issues are given more resources and authority while continuing to be equally ineffective.

164,Ancestry,Rudderless and adrift with very poor senior leadership,2020-03-28,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"I worked with a great team, most of whom are not at Ancestry anymore. The rank and file employees were kind, nice to work with and be around. There was very little politics in my team. The product was once very promising and exciting and they had good brand recognition. Due to privacy concerns and revision of DNA results for many customers Ancestry and other players in this space seem to have lost a lot of customers and the trust placed on them.","Read the other reviews closely, most are clearly talking from experience. This company had a promising product but due to a combination of poor leadership and ownership by private equity firms whose only goal seems to be to milk the company financially its been on a downward spiral. This company seems to have frequent mass layoffs, apart from the one in 2020 there was one back in 2016-2017, the reviews from then are still on here as well. Apart from this it is also plagued by several other problems, poor pay in the SF bay area office, below average facilities and worst of all a very shaky business model. 
Due to the unstable work environment and dim long term prospects I wouldn't recommend this place to anybody. 
Ancestry's performance seems to be linked to how many DNA kits they sell, this became apparent during the recent layoffs. The problem here is 2 fold, the DNA kits are a one time sale, nobody is going to buy a kit more than once for themselves and due to the shifting DNA results and privacy concerns the number of customers buying the kits started dropping precipitously in the year 2019 (with little hopes of recovering again). Institutions like the US army have also come out with guidelines for their recruits to not buy such DNA kits due to privacy concerns.  This was inevitable and leads me to believe companies in this space including Ancestry don't have a business model that is viable over the long term.  

Finally the senior leadership's callous attitude towards the lower ranks became apparent during the lay offs. Ancestry threw a company wide extravagant New Year gala for everybody in San Francisco at an offsite location in January and couple weeks later had a mass lay off saying they were financially strapped.  Affected employees were given no notice (they were asked to not come back the next day) and I was thinking how bad it must have been for all of the employees with families or those who were on work visas to be sent home at such short notice!!"

This is one of many reviews which also highlights terrible senior leadership with no sense of innovation, product roadmap and accountability. This was not always the case. Once upon a time, this company used to care about its products, customers, and employees. This changed with the current cancer in senior leadership who are in place today.
All Senior executive leadership is based out of San Francisco, many of whom are woefully disconnected to their respective teams and the product. They had no clear direction and no winning strategy. They were unable to even utilize the potential of some of the teams. 
They are responsible for the recent failures of this company, and fail to hold themselves accountable. This includes the declining revenue, professional atmosphere, and ultimately, downsizing its workforce.
Lack of diversity. This manifested itself very badly in a racially-insensitive commercial which was aired on April 2019, which resulted in a huge backlash. The people who approved of this commercial are apparently still working for this organization. This speaks volumes regarding senior leadership.
Below average pay for San Francisco.
Advancement from within this company is a pipe dream.
Most of the top talent who actually built this company have already left the company. Some were forced out, while others left on their own free will. Roughly 100 employees were recently laid off, some of whom were hired only a few short weeks earlier. Made no sense. Anticipate another wave of exodus of the remaining top talent away from this organization, which has been a direct result of poor senior leadership."

Large company verticals are marching to different orders and priorities, making cross functional collaboration a major uphill battle.

Director and above levels are a revolving door of overrated “talent”.  Tens of millions of dollars have been spent on beefy signing bonuses and severance packages as the company has fired or forced out long standing UT leadership and replaced it with short sighted talking heads from big brands that play well on a pre-IPO roadshow.  The heads all attempt to build out their empires by hiring more heads. When they fail to get results they are given golden parachutes and replaced externally - leading to a very top heavy company with very little chance of internal advancement into any serious leadership position.

This company used to care about its products, customers, and employees.  That is no longer the case, and I don’t see things getting better. There’s a reason the best and brightest in the company are getting out."

Many very competent employees","The reorg was so bad, with the random layoffs and forcing people to certain teams, that upper management (not leadership) refuses to hold management accountable. It is sad to see friends suffer from the hands of managers that should never have been promoted. It is depressing watching people's passion that they once held die. I witnessed ordinary people try to help with the reorg, only to be told it wasn't their job by poor middle managers. I have seen people's project change almost weekly because people can't get their act together. If a manager or a situation is so bad, you have to force people to stay on a team, they will leave.

While many left, there are still a lot of great people. Many have just taken the duck and cover approach. Gossip is now much more common. You may be hired on to a team with a great manager but then be forced to work for a bad one, with no way out. I feel bad for a friend who got out from the domain of a very poor middle manager only to have that manger transferred to their new one, after decimating their previous one. I saw another friend beg for help from his manager with a personal conflict only to have the manager and the manager's manager refuse to intervene for over six months.

The best advice is to stop caring, if you can. Leave if you can't."

Everyone is scared of their supervisor and as a result, the work suffers. Ancestry has had massive staff turnover. Management does nothing to empower their staff, teams are super-cliquey, and everyone is trying stab others in the back. This is one of the least professional and most draining jobs I’ve ever experienced."
244,Ancestry,"Okay Callcenter Job, Bad Overall",2018-11-13,2.0,Customer Service Associate,"+ The people who work there are INCREDIBLE. The other agents were nothing but the nicest, most amazing people imaginable.
+ The stories you hear from customers will sometimes move you to tears. You really feel like you're doing meaningful work for these people.
+ Direct management (the supervisors on the floor) are very nice, overall as helpful as they possibly can be, and engaged.
+ Benefits are quite good (option to sign up for a pension plan with company contribution, health/dental insurance, sports & social club, some money to spend every month on wellness, one free lunch per week and a bunch of snacks and breakfast items in the kitchen).
+ For a call center job, this is quite nice as customers tend to be older and usually just need help figuring out technology and like telling you about the histories they discovered.","- You essentially work over an hour every week for free despite being paid by the hour because signing into your computer and all the programmes needs to be done BEFORE your shift starts and because everything is slow and broken, it can take up to 15 min for all that to be done. If you don't sign in on time every day, you get in trouble! You also have to read up on current/upcoming promotions in your unpaid free time if you don't want to get nasty surprises later in the day.
- Communication within the company is abysmal. I've never worked in a job where even the managers were so woefully uninformed I was actually scared of going to work towards the end because everything was falling apart! Departments don't communicate with each other, Dublin doesn't hear anything about what the US office does until everything is broken and nothing works and customers start asking why.
- The service is fundamentally broken. The website is just not well made overall, coding wise, and so whenever anything breaks (and it breaks a lot) it sometimes takes MONTHS to fix things! Agents get no updates and have to deal with customers who have called in about the same issue every other week for six months!
- It is a call center job so you do deal with irate customers quite a bit. Sometimes the website is just broken, sometimes they made mistakes with their subscriptions, sometimes Ancestry's system made a mistake with their subscriptions.... You bear the brunt of that and the company doesn't really support you.
- As nice as the managers are, they follow company policy and company policy treats agents like criminals. If you think this is a full-time job, you are wrong. You get paid by the hour, which means every MINUTE you spend not working is a minute the company pays for and gets nothing of, which means they police every single bathroom break you take. If you're over the allocated time for breaks, expect a stern talking to from your manager. If you're sick more than three times within a certain number of months (less than a year), you can get an official warning because again, you are a number to them, not a person. You will get no support here, no matter how nice they like to act when you call in sick.
- The company doesn't care about your well-being. We were even called in during an unprecedented snowstorm that closed the whole city down for a few days because Ancestry likes to think they're a vital service people can't live without. They are not. Employees' well-being is sometimes more important than being available 24/7.
- There are zero ways to advance in this company or change jobs. There are no senior agent positions and it's downright impossible to move into another department even though they will tell you about their ""training programme"" that exists in name only.
- They just don't have your back overall. The customer is always right and if you claim otherwise even within the company and in private to your colleagues, you'll get in trouble. Again, the company is very big on policing your every second and move."

I believe that Ancestry’s business actually does good in the world.  Ancestry’s product helps connect their customer with their loved ones.  How often do you have customers who crying tears of joy from your work’s mission?

* CEO:
Margo, our new CEO, started recently.  So far, she has been doing a pretty good job at cleaning up the mess that the previous execs made.  I have faith in her ability to lead the company towards a better light. 

* Internship:
Interns are spoiled and learn a lot.  I think Ancestry’s internship program has matured a lot and would be a good place to apply to.","* Glassdoor Reviews:
A lot of the recent 5-star reviews here are BS.  With the influx of bad reviews, a lot of managers have been asking employees for good reviews.  They go out of their way to ask the interns to review the company because interns have good experiences with their internship here.

* Product:
In my opinion, there’s some limitations to how an engineer can contribute to the product.  DNA is mostly selling DNA kits and the family history platform is built out.  Most of the work is just either adding some features to the bread and butter or building tools to try to clean up the mess at the company.  I like the mission but I don’t feel like I’m part of it.

* Management:
With the exception of the new CEO, the execs are terrible.  They are so out of touch with what goes on with regular employees.  When an anonymous employee asked a genuine question about this, the interim CEO called his question BS in front of the whole company.

* Recently, the company had a massive layoff in February.  The layoff was sudden and didn’t follow any procedures like PIP that was in place and as one employee described it, “it felt as if we were dragged out in the middle of the night and shot.”  Some execs responded that the people who were laid off are welcome to reapply to the company for open positions.  Some of the responses were so ridiculous that it felt like they were trying to cover up bad decisions the way that they would with their children.

* Engineering:
There is no standard other than “do this and figure it out yourself.”  It is an uphill battle to get anything done and some teams find loopholes in order to be able to do their work.  The company is 25 years old and the amount of technical debt and poor engineering decisions is staggering.  It feels that some engineers are making technical decisions based on paradigms from the early 2000’s.

There is tension between the teams between Utah and San Francisco teams.

* Recruiting:
The company is bleeding talent.  Experienced engineers are leaving all the time.  The company is starting to offer RSU’s to employees in general (before, it was only for directors) and it is of my opinion that this is a move to counter the exodus of engineers.

The recruiting here is so disjointed that sometimes you don’t know what kind of engineering position that you’re interning the candidate for.  Some of the worst engineers that I have had the displeasure of working with do interviews and I can only feel empathy for the candidates on the other side.

* Benefits:
With the exception of HR-sponsored benefits like health insurance, a lot of the perks are bare-minimum offerings so that they can put them on paper.  
 1. Snacks and drinks? The SF office is overcrowded and the refrigerators and snack bars are empty by lunch.
2. Gym reimbursement? Have fun getting all of your inquiries ignored.  Your claim also won’t be declined.  Instead, it will just be ignored so you’ll never know the status (since your emails are ignored)."

For starters, the job ad did not state that this is call center work, so the disappointment was rather great when I figured out what this job actually was, and I was not alone! It took me a good few months to notice it, but management absolutely does not have your back. Everything you do (every call you take, every email you write, every minute you may spend away from your desk) is monitored and then thrown at you in 1-1s where you need to explain why you may have forgotten to offer something to the client (even though the job description never mentioned sales) or why you have spent an additional 3 minutes to go to the bathroom. I don't know how many verbal warnings I received for the smallest things. After calling in sick, you are to meet with your manager and then have to state the reason for your absence and sign a document promising not to be sick in the future. I don't know about you, but I'd rather not be treated like a criminal each time I'm moving around the office. The job is not easy to begin with as you often deal with frustrated customers, and when you know your manager won't have your back, it makes work all the more difficult.  One of my favorite moments was being yelled at by a customer for verifying her account. Insisting on the company policy and data protection, I had to call the manager line a few times, where I was told to keep insisting on the policy. When said customer was finally put through to the manager, she was all of a sudden able to get what she wanted WITHOUT the verification of her account. It's nice to see that one frustrating call could have been avoided, but I suppose it's easier when your employees are dealing with these calls. This is one of very many examples. I'm very glad those days are behind me."

Earlier this year (2018) Ancestry let go of 50+ employees at our corporate office. Just this month they announced they are closing the call center. Don’t worry though- their press release in the newspaper states that it only affects “less than 100 people”. It’s not like those “less than 100 people” have families or house payments or anything. 

Ancestry doesn’t care about delivering a functional website or app, they are worried about how much money you’ll spend on an AncestryDNA kit. 

Ancestry “releases” each new feature in “BETA testing” that way when members are complaining for over 3 years that their DNA Circles aren’t working- you can explain it’s a “BETA feature” so the development team is “still working on Improving the feature.”"

Most of the employees are delightful.,"The company always says ""Degree's aren't a requirement that we follow to closely.  Sure they help, but we will always hire the person best for the job""  FALSE!  I'm walking proof this is not true.  I've applied for several positions, some of the positions I've literally been helping do the job, and have been passed up.  The reason?  Only one I've ever been given is ""because you dont have a degree""

The company recently laid off employees in February.  Told everyone their jobs were safe.  Margo joins the company, helps reassure everyone that their jobs are safe.  2 months later, in late July, they announce they're outsourcing the Tech Support call center and lay off several people.  

People complained in the employee survey, and somehow management was shocked by this.  They said ""we're going to implement changes"" and yet things continue to spiral down.  As of writing this, the company is actively losing more people than they can hire.  Not just any people either, people who have put 10-15+ years into this company.  

There is ZERO work/life balance.  People here are unofficially expected to put in horrendous amount of hours, give up tons of personal time, and give priority in life to the company.  I've literally watched people cancel anniversary dates because they couldn't get away from work."

273,Ancestry,10+ Years at Ancestry and this is the worst I've seen it,2018-06-26,2.0,Anonymous Employee,"Margo joined the company recently as the CEO and within her first 2 weeks was able to sense that things were a bit tense.  Since that time, she has been meeting with groups of employees to gather feedback on their experiences and why there is so much dissatisfaction. She is working on a plan, with the rest of leadership, to work towards regaining employee trust and bringing back a culture that makes people want to stick around. 

Ancestry is currently reviewing all employees, including contributions, skills, performance, as well as pay. The rumor is that they are looking to increase pay to be competitive with other companies in the same area, in the hopes that people will stop leaving for other employment opportunities.  I fear this may be too little, too late however.  
The services that Ancestry provides are invaluable and have changed many lives, we constantly hear stories from grateful customers. This is why I have stayed on for so long and why I'd previously planned to stay indefinitely - that now depends on how leadership decides to address the current state of the employees.","With the exception of Margo, remaining leadership has been shocked and confused at the results of the most recent employee survey. How so many in leadership can be so disconnected from the people the ""lead"", I will never understand. All you have to do is walk through the building and you can feel the dissatisfaction. 
The changes that have come over the last 15-18 months have changed the company so drastically, that it will be years before it recovers. The changes have affected employees satisfaction and enjoyment of working at Ancestry to the degree that people are leaving in droves - Ancestry is bleeding people, so much so that many teams are shorthanded which in turn, is affect not only the quality of work, but the quantity."

I know with growth spurts (which Ancestry has been experiencing) the ground employees are familiar with can feel unstable.  All employees had an opportunity to share confidential feedback.  In our all-hands meeting, all concerns were addressed and then it was communicated that a plan will be put in place to ensure we correct all negative impacts the employees feel.  I appreciate hearing from the CEO level, first of all an apology for how these changes have felt and then a confirmation that we want to be better than this and do want to put our employees first so we can continue to deliver the passion we all have for the product we produce.  I feel thankful to be with an organization where we create a product so full of purpose and connection.  I've heard and read reviews from current employees and it makes my heart sad; however, I'm feeling and believe there will be much improvement in the next year and years to come.  I believe it's a great time to be a part of a company who has the correct intent and purpose behind our people and our product.  Cheers to people and leaders who care!","There is a lot of work to be done, this last year has been hard on a lot of our valuable employees who have been the core creators of who we are.  For those who left when it was scary, I worry the grass will not be more green and regret could come into play.  Even with our rocky-road this last year, our product's purpose is still a great reason to be a part of Ancestry.  The con here, is people jumping ship creates more work for those who of us who still believe and stick it out through the rough times.

Nearly all of the current senior leadership was hired in San Francisco within the last year, and have single handedly decimated the amazing culture that Ancestry was known for. They fly first class, stay at 5-star hotels, and dine at the most expensive restaurants on their trips to Utah. They rent limousines to take themselves to and from the airport in what looks like a presidential motorcade, and constantly brag about the amazing locations they go to for their offsite leadership meetings. They rule by fear and intimidation, and have no problem taking credit for the work of others while still having the audacity to tell product teams that aren't producing enough and that concerns raised by employees aren't credible.

They will give you the worst possible shift, which is usually super early in the morning or very late in the evening. The company presents itself as being very caring about their employees, but it's really filled with workplace politics. That shows in their 'transparency' and 'giving everybody a chance' when it comes to internal recruitment for a new position. The truth is everybody knew who will be given the new position (and that suspicion was later confirmed- on more than 1 occasion) and so there was really no need for the whole stressful and ridiculous process. If you get hired here, make sure your health is top notch! Cause if you get sick more than 1 within 6 month, get ready for a thorough investigation. The company is SO fake. If you call in sick they will seem like they actually care and will tell you to take all the time you need - which sounds excellent. But then you will be treated like you've committed a crime!

Engineering leadership is lacking.  They repeat the same old meaningless slogans that nobody buys.  In fact, everything that is wrong with Ancestry right now, is due to the new leadership's failures.  The leadership does not understand the core values of this company and the customers it serves.

Weekly reviews with a manager","I registered a disability when I was first hired there and spoke to HR within a week of my start date. That was the last time I felt they were willing to work with me. The next two months were difficult due to unforeseen circumstances and ended with a termination of my employment for medical reasons. (They claimed hardship) Before that, they nit-picked every email and doctor's note and submitted each part to their legal team, who ultimately decided the accommodations. HR had no power. This also made responses take forever. I was constantly left waiting. 

HR also made no effort to speak to my supervisors. They were in the dark the whole time and in the end I had to break my legals rights and explain aspects of my condition just so they knew what was going on."

Don't expect to be inspired by your co-workers or tackle hard problems. Your biggest engineering challenge will be navigating through TERRIBLE code bases and no one is interested in making them better because... They just work. Also, lots of core engineering work is being outsourced to India, so there's that. On top of that, there's virtually zero promotion from within, and when someone from within is promoted, his ""role"" is terminated soon after.

All Upper management talks about are how their Executive retreats went while they were being wined and dined. Meanwhile back at Corporate some of us are working 80 hour weeks with ZERO additional compensation. They work you to the bone and expect you to be grateful that they are paying our salaries.

363,Ancestry,A Great Place to Work,2017-06-03,4.0,Senior Software Engineer,"Ancestry offers competitive salaries and generous bonuses, and they are very family-friendly and flexible. Ancestry is in a period of growth and improvement, so there are lots of opportunities to acquire new skills and exposure to new technologies. Upper management is very concerned with staying ahead of the curve in efficiency and technology. We're in the middle of an exciting  ""tech transition,"" moving from .NET and proprietary technologies to open-source ones like Node.js, Python, and others.","Because Ancestry is in something of a transitional period, things can get a bit bumpy. That is, while there are many new projects and initiatives, often times the infrastructure or other support for them is not yet there for you, or it's in the process of being developed while you are working on your end. This can get a little frustrating, though I suppose it's par for the course in a transitional period.

Also because of of this transitional period, teams can get laden with what seems like a rapid or near-simultaneous succession of high-priority objectives, which can sometimes make it challenging for teams to be productive (or to feel like they're being productive).

The IT department is rather under-developed and could use some help in their processes."

- There are guys at ancestry who will literally point fingers for no reason. And a lady who yells all the time over the phone and snaps at people but unfortunately as in the pros, they wont fire anyone! Can we be more professional at work? 
- Cafeteria food could be better and not so good variety
- Too many different managers who give all the raises and bonuses to their favorites.

Having all the perks like:
•	a fitness center (with personal trainers and classes)
•	locker rooms (with hair dryers, towels and hair care products)
•	showers
•	free food (fruit, oatmeal, soda, spa water, etc.)

•	great indoor/outdoor dining area with amazing view of Utah County
•	gym reimbursement program
•	fitness challenges
•	ski passes
•	adjustable desks
•	recognition programs
•	etc, etc, etc.
While some of these perks may seem small, they give me the sense that the company really cares about their employees and the environment they work in.  When I feel like the company is investing in me, it is natural to want to invest more of myself in the company.  This is by far the best environment I’ve worked in and it makes coming into work all that more enjoyable.

In addition to the perks, the people I work with have been fantastic.  I appreciate my team members and my supervisor for all the help they have given me, to get me up-to-speed on my responsibilities so I can be productive.  All-in-all, this has been a great first couple of weeks.","Like most IT departments I've worked in, the cubicles are a bit small, and don't have much privacy.

Promotions only happen one time per year, so if you aren't promoted at the start of the year, you have to wait a whole year to get another opportunity to move up.  Also, pretty high turnover rates for lower positions."
414,Ancestry,Can't think of a reason to unlike,2016-02-23,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"I actually had to think hard to come up with cons, so most are actually pros.

To start with, the pay is on-par with, if not slightly more generous than, other Silicon Valley companies, considering its not the name everyone talks about when finding a job here. But when you take into consideration of the benefits its definitely above average.

I am just going to list them here: Unlimited paid time off, free caltrain pass, parking sub, VTA, gym sub, phone, home internet, food, snack, drink, ski lift tickets, medical, dental......

This is one of the best list of benefits you could ever get not just in the bay area, but in the world.

The most important factor is the work/life balance, even senior managements want you to have consideration for your family and look after yourself. read 5pm, sharp, off work.

I forgot, you get to choose any computer, desk, monitor as you wish. Which may sound normal, but you'd be surprise to hear how many companies in silicon valley don't have this luxury.

In terms of talents, at the very least, everyone is very committed to their roles since they are not being pressurized. The company can afford to be selective while attracting the right people. Its a tech/internet company, so all the cool tech are being used, e.g. spark, hadoop, kafka, machine learning..... I don't have the feeling of not wanting to go to work. And yes, you can work from home at least one day per week.

Career progression is just like any work place, you have people holding the same position for years, while there are people moving up grades and grades within couple of years. It all depends on you.

For sure, ancestry is a household name, but its not considered one of the top tech companies. However, in the industry that its in, it beats the next competitor by miles. There is no company having 1/10 as much content as ancestry, even the government needs to work with ancestry to get content. The DNA team is second to none, the scientists there are top top notch academics and all are committed to better the product/service. 

The health industry is ever increasing and ancestry is right at the forefront, i have very good outlook for the company.","May be no free lunch everyday.... but there is free lunch here and there most days during the week. Free snacks and drinks all the time. Plus this is one of the best neighborhood for trendy restaurants and good food, this is just another reason to social.

I know, right, how absurd it is to say no free lunch is a con. How spoiled!"

There are some free lunch sometimes... well you might enjoy it if you are lucky enough to be working day shift on that day and your lunch break is at a normal time (so quite unlikely).","As a Customer Solutions Associate - This place is a fake friendly workplace
- Bad working times (late evenings and weekends unavoidable) and there's no rotation. They will tell you during the interviewing process that the working times are flexible and that you will be able to arrange them to your particular needs but this is not exactly true. The groups of new recruits are given different schedules to chose from when they start (recruits are left alone in a room to fight among eachothers for the schedule they want) and once the schedules are chosen you keep it for as long as you work with them. Everybody's schedule is different but everyone has to work at least one weekend day and some late evenings each week. 
- Bad atmosphere. They sell themselves as a very friendly company with a relaxed atmosphere, it could not be further away from the truth. I've worked in a few call centers, none of them was so demanding and unfriendly. You are so tightly monitored that not only your calls but also your screen is recorded. You cannot put your headset away for a minute to talk to a collegue because the phone does not ring out loud, it rings low in your headset. The targets are almost unacheivable for any normal person, they will fire you without hesitation even if you arrive on time, are never sick and work hard everyday just because your calls are 1 or 2 minutes longer than they should be...
I spent 6 months in that company and it felt like the toughest and more depressing time of my life. I recommend everybody looking for a rewarding and human call center job to keep away from that place."

- DNA product has potential
- Leader in the industry
- Recognizable brand
- Unlimited vacation policy
- Nice office and benefits
- Easy company to be at, especially if you have a family","- Political environment. Need to play the game and kiss up to people to get things done or advance your career.
- Top heavy company. Senior people are in meetings all day. Junior people do 90% of the work and then each layer in the hierarchy makes some edits to add value. Unfortunately, company seems to value people who can't execute above the people doing the actual work. Example: senior people already get equity when they join the company,
and if they try to leave, company throws more cash and equity at them. Junior people don't get equity these days (and if they do, it's not enough to matter), and if they try
to leave, company doesn't do much to try to retain them. 
- Retention issue. Recently a bunch of people in multiple departments left. In teams where there is barely anyone left, company gave promotions to get them to stick around longer. Should have focused on retention in the first place instead of reacting to it.
- Program Management is stuck-up because they prioritize your projects. They should be held accountable for keeping projects on track.
- Work environment isn't always professional. 
- Limited career growth. Company always encourages lateral movement. A lot of promotions happened because those people threatened to leave and their team was already
short staffed, so the company had to give them something to keep them around. 
- Senior leadership only wants honest feedback if it's positive.
- People are generally comfortable but not motivated. Excluding senior management, the smart/ambitious people have left or are planning on leaving. People who are still there are new, have settled or can't find a job elsewhere.
- Unless you're coming in as at least a director, you'll be working hard to make people at the top rich once the company sells itself."

- More friendly than average
- Meaningful work with a positive and well-known public image 
- Mangers generally have good intentions
- Some interesting and inspiring leaders in the mix
- Often trying to make the right product and technical decisions
- Easy to have hobbies and outside interests while working here","- Slightly inbred culture that is passive aggressive towards each other and especially to outsiders
- Inability to solve conflict in ways that are both direct and healthy
- Less of a meritocracy than you'd expect of a company of this size...lots of burned-out people from the good-old-days that appear to have ""tenure""
- The sale of the company (and the corresponding conversion of equity from paper equity to real equity) is the primary focus of management.  It's great if that objective happens to overlap with what customers want, but it's not required from their perspective - sale value rules the day.
- A lot of fat in the company (although getting better).  People put in about 70% of the effort that you'd expect.  Working extra or overtime is almost unheard of and I doubt most people could even do it if asked.
- Many nonconstructive complainers in the company and management that sometimes enables and panders to that type of behavior
- Occasionally inexperienced middle managers who try to reinvent solutions to problems that have been solved long ago...plenty of experimentation with esoteric org structures and processes, for example being treated as ""innovation""
- An important fraction of the technical staff openly opposes leaning new technology - the first time I've ever observed this
- Somewhat boring environment, library-quiet with less collaboration than you might be used to.

482,Ancestry,Been here over a decade and still loving it,2015-02-03,5.0,Software Engineer,"Ancestry.com develops products that actually mean something in peoples' lives.  Benefits have always been great.  Salaries have been at or above competitive rates as far as I have seen.  Time off policy has always been generous.  Most of my coworkers have been talented, smart, and nice to work with.  The technologies we use are interesting and provide ample professional development experience.  Great company mission.  Great work/life balance is possible with flexible hours and occasional remote work possible.  Building Ancestry's products is fun because they are challenging and interesting to build, and contribute something meaningful to the world--not just building widgets at yet another widget factory.  It also helps that Ancestry has experienced healthy growth for as long as I've been here--through the recession and all.  This is a thriving company with a solid business model.  Current top management seems to make great decisions.","From an engineering perspective: Ancestry supports a large suite of products and changes are slow.  We sometimes lag behind in implementing newer technologies because most development involves enhancing existing properties, not building brand new ones.  This type of work involves overcoming some inertia, which makes change slower than at many smaller/startup companies."

The benefits are good: people with a few years at the company get about 4 weeks/year vacation. Most people in the public know the company and have a good feeling towards it. You hear a lot of stories about people finding their ancestors who are excited about the product. When we were public the stock options were good, too.","There are a lot of people working here from management on down who just live off of the work of everyone else and don't have the skills that they should have for their position. They don't spend much time with the product and can't make valuable decisions for the product and so they rely off of everyone else's ideas in numerous brainstorming meetings and they are really just dead weight.

The product team gets most of the credit for creating anything new, even though they just sit in meetings all day brainstorming and aren't really building the product. HR is unsympathetic. Managers don't really care either. They want you to be happy, but they don't want you to succeed more than themselves. They don't want to hear if things aren't going well and would rather fire you than try to resolve any issues. They really just want to be left alone and take any glory from the work that you do to make themselves look good. If other people start to recognize that you're doing a good job, your manager will usually try to swoop in and take the credit for themselves and any kind of perks that come along with it.

People generally look friendly, but everyone is vying for position and stealing one another's work. Your work won't get anywhere unless you're friends with the right people, and you'll have to constantly argue with your coworkers who have poor ideas about how things should get done.

If you're late on a deadline, you may get a good PM that will just push out the date. Otherwise the PM will make everything look like it's your fault and they won't take any responsibility for their inadequacies. (Deadlines are usually just made up dates anyway and aren't tied to any solid event). PMs may give you a shout-out in a meeting, but they're the one who will get the attention from senior management for the project. 

The company outsources a lot of work to overseas contractors who do a poor job and increase the image that engineering is just a cog in the wheel and product really does all the work. Even if engineers are doing fabulous work, they get reprimanded by managers and their peers for something petty (or something that's made up) and don't get the thanks or recognition for the work that they are doing.

Compensation is low, about $20-30k under other company salaries."

Many of my colleagues were also friends so going to work was pretty enjoyable.,"Some employees in leadership roles lack crucial skills in dealing with subordinates and instill a sense of a ship without a rudder. Future success of the company relies too heavily on a few tenuous outside relationships. The departments and the fact that half of the offices are in another state makes things feel a little compartmentalized. The culture clash between the Provo and SF offices, although a great source of humor, can also be problematic at times."

The management of my department was excellent. They did everything they possibly could to make the atmosphere as employee-friendly as possible (well, except for pay more). I would highly recommend this company (or at least this department) to students or anyone looking for part-time work.","There's no sugarcoating the fact that the pay was very low.

528,Ancestry,Okay,2013-11-26,3.0,,"Benefits are great, and the product is rewarding.  It was nice to get the experience in the industry learning new things.  Some autonomy.","Feels like the good ol boy system when trying to advance.  The processes and technology is very proprietary so the experience is very limiting when seeking other professions.  It would be nice if this were taken into account when hiring, so more hiring is done within."
529,Ancestry,This is the best company to work for in Utah.,2013-11-21,5.0,Anonymous Employee,Ancestry has amazing benefits with the future of their employees in mind. Overall employees are very happy and stay with the company.,"The company is growing too fast, so they're having a hard time keeping up with everything going on."
530,Ancestry,Software Engineer,2013-11-13,3.0,Anonymous Employee,Good environment with lot of good engineers,immigration policies are not that friendly.
531,Ancestry,Contract work is terrible,2013-11-11,2.0,Anonymous Employee,"Independent work environment
looks great on a resume",Hired out by a terrible temp agency to work for ancestry.com
532,Ancestry,Treats employees very well...,2013-10-28,4.0,Designer,"• Understand work-life balance
• Great benefits / bonus / 401-k match
• Stablility
• Allows time for exploring solutions, never rushed to make bad decisions","• Too many titles Assoc. Director / Director / Senior Directors, etc.
• A little too many meetings, and project planning apps differ from team to team
• Can get political
• Career planning is not fully supported"
533,Ancestry,"Love, love, love working for Ancestry.com",2013-09-27,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Great people, fun and rewarding work, enjoyable working environment.
I have never worked for a place quite like Ancestry. I enjoy the work I do here, feel appreciated and rewarded for the effort I make day to day.","For me, there are no cons."
534,Ancestry,Interesting Material to work with,2013-09-18,4.0,Scanner,"Flexible hours when requested, interesting documents to work with, reasonable pay, no overbearing supervision or micro management, free worldwide subscription","Work alone, not enough info to solve problems, lack of useful information, no benefits or paid holidays, poor communication at times"
535,Ancestry,It's a job,2013-09-12,2.0,Customer Solutions Associate,It's a very easy job. You do the basics and you are recognized (not promoted or receive a pay increase). You do get experience working in customer support that looks good on a resume. Give you free software and access to all the websites which is a plus if you are interested in doing your own family history. The guys who work over in RMA are awesome.,"Since it is so easy, it gets boring quickly. The clients are often computer/technology illiterate and it can be extremely frustrating to work with them over the phone (you would think clearing the cache and cookies was brain surgery). Very little opportunity for growth and promotion. There were people who had been in the call center for the better part of the decade in the same position or just one level up. Main reasons why I was yelled at on the phone: Products can be buggy at times, terms and conditions are very absolute but easily misunderstood, and Archives.com is just a terrible site. 

Also just look through the other reviews. Notice the only ones who rate the company high is upper management."
536,Ancestry,Wierd Weird Weird Weird Weird,2013-08-26,3.0,,Cafeteria is about the best thing.,Being Mormon is a big plus.
537,Ancestry,Customer Solutions Associate/ Member Services,2013-07-28,2.0,Customer Solutions Associate,"Benefits are pretty good as far as health, dental, life, and educational. Ancestry throws a quality Christmas party and the Summer party was good too.","Member Services (call center) is in a separate building from the rest of the Corporate office. It is very detached, and appears that is intentional. You are not able to transition to the Corporate side, as Ancestry's culture does not value the phone workers. They only hire for Corporate from the outside, or a select group of favorites. Currently, there is an 88% attrition rate in the call center, and after hiring approximately 250 people in the last 6 months, we are already very short. Customers can be very abusive (had no idea before working here that Genealogy was such a big deal).
Member Services has managers sleeping together, family members related by marriage working in the same area, and extreme nepotism in hiring. You should consider other venues before accepting a job at Ancestry."
538,Ancestry,Great place to work,2013-06-24,5.0,Senior Software Engineer,"Great benefits, family oriented culture, challenging work, pretty well managed.  There are plenty of opportunities to try new things.  The two teams I've worked with have had a lot of autonomy.",I really cannot complain.  I haven't worked with anyone I dislike.  There was some politics involved with one team where a VP made a decision about which software we were supposed to use without the input of the team.
539,Ancestry,"Good job, great people, and a product you can believe in.",2013-06-04,4.0,Anonymous Employee,Love the people I work with and for.,None that have to do specifically with the company.
540,Ancestry,Well run organization - would go back,2013-04-18,5.0,Marketing Manager,Impressive leadership team.  Competitive pay and benefits.  Generous PTO.  Talented co-workers.  Some opportunity for growth.  Nice campus.  Cross functional work environment was as smooth as I've encountered .  Data sources were clean (can't be said for many companies).  Catered lunches every other week.,"The split offices between Provo and San Francisco adds a few challenges, but nothing too bad.  Nothing really bad to say about Ancestry.com.  An on-site cafeteria would be nice."

Cool SOMA office space for easy commute w/public transportation, free lunches","Highly political environment, little promotion opportunity unless you're boss quits or you're a favorite.  Lots of lay-offs since they went private in December '12 and there was little information and transparency prior."
544,Ancestry,Fun but can be repetitive,2013-02-01,4.0,Digital Preservation Specialist,Getting to work with old documents and records can be really fun. Company had fun activities. Compensation was decent.,A lot of the managers define doing their job by how much they correct those under them. There were several occasions my immediate supervisor was told he wasn't doing his job because there weren't enough write-ups taking place. He refused to write people up for no reason but the tension was not fun.
545,Ancestry,"Awesome, never want to leave",2013-01-10,5.0,Software Engineer In Test,"This is a highly underrated employer, it's like working for Adobe, Microsoft, Google, Facebook, or Apple - just in a smaller package.",It's pretty boring to tell people you work at a genealogy company.
546,Ancestry,"Great company, worthwhile product, nice work/life balance",2012-08-29,4.0,Anonymous Employee,"Great benefits, smart people, a good place to work if you want a life","Not a clear vision for the future of the company, management and responsibilities a little fragmented, no direct career path"
547,Ancestry,"Started out great, went WAY downhill under new management.",2012-07-18,3.0,Member Services,"Nice hours, good pay, commissions are easy, generally flexible with hours","Micromanaging constantly, little opportunity to move up, in general talking to old people on the phones is not ideal, constant calls, very understaffed, not interesting work at all"
