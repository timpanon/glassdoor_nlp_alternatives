0,Angi,Amazing company to work at,2022-04-09,5.0,Account Executive,"I've met some of the most amazing people working at this company. There are many career growth opportunities. Plus, the compensation is great as long as you are dedicated and work hard","Cold calling can be annoying, but that is the nature of sales."
1,Angi,Terrible Product,2022-04-09,2.0,Sales Consultant,Work from home. Great management.,"Comp plan is bad. Senior reps get special accounts. Product is horrible, and hard to sell when the company has 1000s of bad reviews."
2,Angi,Not a real success management position,2022-04-08,3.0,Customer Success Manager,Work from home and the pay isn’t that bad,All you do is try to flip negative viewing clients into keeping their subscription that they didn’t know about having a annual contract with.
3,Angi,"Good environment, established organization, questionable priorities",2022-04-08,4.0,Software Developer II,"Fantastic place to work, offices across the US, generous paid leave and remote work options, a really great and healthy development process. Engineers have a lot of say in what we do here. Everyone has a great team spirit, and the culture is focused but not boring. Organization seems truly open to change and new ideas. Organization could be a bit more diverse but is clearly making an effort, and I have not seen any cliquish or oppressive behavior. I can see myself staying here long term, especially if the company can adapt to the below stated issues.","I'm a little concerned that even though the business is rhetorically very customer oriented, they seem committed to a business model that is undermining consumer confidence. Additionally, the managers and product people, while passionate, seem very overworked. No dedicated QA or sprint leaders makes the engineering process a bit rough."
4,Angi,Love This Company,2022-04-08,5.0,Collections Specialist,"I work with a great team, everyone is extremely helpful in all departments. I really enjoy working remote and my position has been very flexible and making sure we work hard and get to play harder! They make it known family comes first. I also am making a great income the commissions are amazing.",I have nothing negative to say at this time!
5,Angi,Poor company ethics,2022-04-07,1.0,Bartender,Salary and remote work style,Poor company leads and company ethics
6,Angi,Great Place,2022-04-06,5.0,BI Developer II,"Angi has been my best corporate experience yet. Progressive enough, growing company with modern enough tech stack to progress your career. Like most places I'm sure satisfaction is largely per team and individual, but my management is strong/supportive without micromanaging, my customers are reasonable and appreciative, the CEO is transparent about issues in non recorded company wide meetings and is down to earth enough. Just a straightforward, solid working experience.","There's a lot of movement going on which can be uneasy, but it's to be expected with the merger into ANGI and adoption of so many new tools/responsibilities."
7,Angi,Not your average job,2022-04-06,5.0,Sales Consultant,"This job pushes you outside of your comfort zone. You get to continually improve yourself everyday, and you have such an encouraging environment to do it in! There are so many opportunities to grow and you’re valued not for your position, but for the work ethic you have and the value you add to yourself, your team and the company!","It’s a mental battle. It can get hard with some of the responses you get from the contractors, and there are days you question why you work here, but you learn to overcome that"
8,Angi,Skip it,2022-04-05,1.0,Director,Exposure to senior leadership & opportunity to learn,"Work hours are brutal for below tech pay, feels like a high school popularity contest in the worst way, inexperienced and inept leaders"

11,Angi,My Journey at Angi Leads,2022-04-04,5.0,Customer Service Representative Tier III,Angi Leads gave me the opportunity for career advancement in a short period of time. It's a very rewarding job because you get to help people build their company and guide them into a better utilization of the system for success. I get recognize constantly for my efforts and they really appreciate you as an employee. I am able to work from home which is an Amazing opportunity as well.,As a customer service agent you have to deal with a lot of frustrated customers and you need a lot of patience and empathy to be able to resolve their issue.
12,Angi,HA/Angi Leads,2022-04-04,3.0,Account Executive,"I have a great manager. getting to work remotely.  Good benefits, and you do get a team setting. Potential to make really good money.","Not seeing many opportunities for growth. I feel this market isn't the best place to be.  Clients aren't needing leads as much,  not as many people want to work in this sector. Not seeing  the year-after-year growth you'd hope for.  Feels like a ""what have you done for me lately"" sort of company.  Customers constantly get Angi Leads and Angi List confused."
13,Angi,Save yourself the headache and look elsewhere,2022-04-04,2.0,Senior Software Engineer,"There are still some very talented people at Angi. I have made some connections through working there that will continue throughout my personal and professional life. 

Work/life balance is good.","Imagine trying to operate an entire cruise ship with only 10 people. That is what it feels like to be an engineer at Angi. 

There is an absurd amount of tech debt that other members of the organisation have 0 interest in fixing. There are hardly any designers so resource is scarce. The people left are either so swamped with their work or so done caring that there is very very little collaboration between teams. There are daily issues with infrastructure and not enough resources to properly fix them.

All decisions are made by top execs with everyone below having little or no input. 

If you are a current employee - you are underpaid and new engineers walking in the door are getting much higher salaries and boat loads of stock.

There is also a huge diversity problem. Most women have been driven out the engineering organisation and replaced with men."
14,Angi,Working at ANGI,2022-04-04,5.0,Inside Sales Representative,"Working at Angi has many benefits. My position is both rewarding and challenges me every single day. We have a great group of people who are willing to offer any help to fellow employees for their success with Angi. As my position is a ""grinding"" position daily, our uncapped commission opportunity allows me to set my own goals for yearly income.

Being able to work from home is such a benefit and not to mention Angi has an excellent benefit program.

My greatest accomplishment has been setting my personal goals and I have full control of meeting my goals","With any job, you can't please everyone. However, I have nothing adverse to say about Angi and my position. It's all up to me to succeed or not."

Base pay will not pay your bills
Product sucks and salespeople are deceitful"
31,Angi,Great place to work.,2022-03-24,5.0,Senior Software Engineer,Angi is an excellent place to work as a Software Engineer. I work in a team of smart and talented individuals. Angi is an innovative organization and continues to invest and build on industry best practices. Angi is recruiting the best talent from around the country regardless of location. The option to work as a remote employee is great.,"Angi is going through a transitionary phase as it rebrands it self. There will be some growing pains as the tools and tech stack from different orgs (i.e. Angies List, Homeadvisor) are consolidated."
32,Angi,Working at Angi,2022-03-24,5.0,Senior Sourcer,"Lots of growth opportunities and support from management. Management wants to see you do well and help you grow within the company. The onboarding process was smooth and everyone is very passionate about the work that they do. 
Angi cares about DE&I (something that was very important to me in making my decision in joining a new company).
There’s a good work-life balance and everyone I work with is more than happy to help each other & be collaborative.","I can’t think of any, I’m very happy here!"
33,Angi,Could use some improvement but great,2022-03-23,5.0,Inside Sales Representative,"Consistent raffle, bonuses, contests, cash giveaways, overall supportive environment
Teams form strong bonds,  excellent pay, excellent benefits, room for advancement, competition and growth highly encouraged","Cold-calling, high effort is expected (150+ calls, 3 hrs talk time) but consequences are stressful when you don't achieve certain goals"
34,Angi,Do not work here!!!,2022-03-23,1.0,Inside Sales Representative,"There are no redeeming qualities to this company. If I could give my experience a 0 star rating, I would.","The culture at Angi was one I wish to never be in again. The lengths they would go to ""push you"" rivaled those of a military sergeant. The upper management did not care about you unless you made sales. However it did not even matter if you consistently sold because if you had one or two weeks ""off"" weeks, you were threatened to be put on a PIP (aka steps to being fired). There were countless times that I can recall when some of the top sellers were actually put on a PIP and their jobs were threatened for having an off couple of weeks.

Regardless of this, the sales culture that is encouraged at Angi is laughable. You are taught to ignore the prospective clients you are calling if they object or give any push back. You are taught to talk over them if they are telling you ""No"" over and over again. There is a reason the company had to rebrand yet again from its previous name of HomeAdvisor to how it is now known as Angi and it has everything to do with the reputation they carried with the prospective clientele. Moral of the story, if you consistently treat people like trash, no one will want to work with you."
35,Angi,Awesome place to work!!,2022-03-23,5.0,Project Manager,Not enough space to mention them all,No cons to speak of
36,Angi,Fun Company,2022-03-23,5.0,Retail Sales Associate,Detailed on on one training,Work from home can get boring
37,Angi,I love it!,2022-03-22,5.0,Onboarding Representative,There is definitely space to grow and positions to keep learning different parts about the company. Great benefits fit for every person.,I personally do not have any cons.
38,Angi,"Fast paced, mission-driven, with dedication to their people",2022-03-22,5.0,Talent Acquisition,"- robust review cycle that emphasizes both professional & personal growth
- strong leadership
- huge industry opportunity and a lot of excitement about tackling that
- more of a tech, start-up culture vs. traditional, hierarchical organization
- really smart people (the people rock!)","- very growth-oriented, so you have to be down for the ride & the vision (and the pace)"
39,Angi,Simply the best,2022-03-22,5.0,Senior User Experience Researcher,"- Low ego, high skill team
- Amazing culture 
- Great benefits
- Opportunity to grow",There is really nothing I don't love about working for Angi.
40,Angi,Horrible Environment for Women,2022-03-21,1.0,Inside Sales Representative,"Great money, if you're successful and have team support.","If you're not successful immediately you're written off, not given support, ignored. Awful communication when you have issues. If you have a disability or health issue, don't bother applying. They say they care about employees, but only if you're making money. If you're struggling, they don't give a crap about you. You always have to fake being happy or you're told you're dragging everyone down. You can't say anything the least bit negative even if you're world is falling down around you. Female coworkers are treated differently than male coworkers."
41,Angi,Worst company ever,2022-03-21,1.0,Account Manager,Health insurance and that's it.,"Pay, management, terrible company. How have they not gone under yet?"
42,Angi,Amazing place to work,2022-03-21,5.0,Director,"Great feedback, good nurturing environment. A place where you are noticed for your work and coached in an effective manner that encourages growth and hard work.","Sometimes working from home, can open space for lack of relationship building."
43,Angi,Dont waste your time with this one,2022-03-21,2.0,Sales Consultant,Great Training. Great Brand. Great Commission structure if you get the good leads,You are subject to the luck of the quality of the 2-3 leads they send you each day. the rest of the assigned leads have been called on 30-40 times and will hang up as soon as you mention ANGI. You have to close your sale on the phone right there the first time you talk to them otherwise you will never get them on the phone again. There is much confusion with the Home service contractors of the difference between ANGI leads and ANGI ads.. Each gets the same leads at the same time and talks negatively about each other. The seasoned reps get the best leads and make lots of money while the rest hope for a good lead.. you are not allowed to prospect to find new customers on your own. base pay is very low.
44,Angi,"Whatever you do, DON’T DO IT.",2022-03-20,1.0,Inside Sales Representative,Great for workaholics and people who like to be paid 20k under the standard salary rate,I was a top rep here for years in the Chicago office. It still wasn’t worth it for what I’m going through now. It’s been over a year since I left the company and I am still dealing with extreme burnout. I also found out it takes years to overcome job burnout. Im just a normal person i’m their mid-twenties who is trying to succeed but can’t because they got mentally burnt out by a low-paying entry level job.
45,Angi,You have to put in the work,2022-03-20,4.0,Senior Sales Consultant,Lots of money to be made. Unlimited comission,"Stressful. ""What have you done today?"" Yesterday doesn't matter at all."

47,Angi,"Disorganized, poor communication",2022-03-18,2.0,Sales Consultant,"Incentives to perform, competitions to win prizes/days off","Encouraged to mislead prospects (like when HomeAdvisor changed to Angi, encouraged to dismiss questions from prospects on the name change/if we were the same company), huge push on more dials/talk time rather than making sure employees were informed & honest on the phones, desktop computer/needed to be connected to ethernet cable so you were limited on where you could work, huge culture of pressuring people even if you knew they would not be successful with the service, drastic changes within company would happen with little to no communication to the employees, company has a very poor reputation among contractors, calling recycled leads who constantly get calls from Angi"
48,Angi,Define and refine growing business unit,2022-03-18,5.0,Associate Director,"Growth opportunities, remote work, challenging environment, benefits","Lots of changes following mergers, brand awareness opportunity"

51,Angi,Would look somewhere else.,2022-03-16,2.0,Sales Representative,"Flexible with schedule if you need time off. 
Lunch is full hour
2 15 minute breaks","Constant Zoom meetings
""Fresh Leads"" are actually recycled leads from other reps who have called them nonstop for weeks.
""Warm Leads"" means you get a lead that some called a bunch and couldn't close.
They pump how much you can make by telling you about the 3 people out of tons that make money there.
You can listen to recordings of closes and sales pitches, but NOT from the top producers, which throws up red flags."
52,Angi,"Semi-Shady Practices, but great employees",2022-03-16,2.0,Project Advisor,"Amazing employees, benefits were good, flexible start time","Things changed too frequently, and some of the practices began to be feel more and more unethical"
53,Angi,"If you want a stable, fulfilling, growth oriented CAREER - look no further",2022-03-16,5.0,Talent Acquisition,"Angi is honestly the best company I've ever worked for during my 7+ years professionally recruiting. The culture is truly unmatched...you get the best of both worlds with Angi - on one hand, you have the stability/resources/growth opportunities/stock options/competitive benefits in that of a large, publicly traded company, with the work life balance/small team size/innovation/collaboration that comes with a smaller start up. Leadership here is genuinely invested in their teams' success and regardless of your team/division/tenure everyone has a seat at the table to have their voices heard. On top of that, being remote means no commute, incredible work life balance, and the ability to connect with teammates throughout the entire country easier than ever before to develop strong and meaningful connections on and off the job with your Angi coworkers.",- Brand recognition still growing since rebrand but huge strides have been made thus far - excited to see continued success here as we roll out even more content and business updates to our new markets.

department processing payments to contractors  is a nightmare. Can barely catch a breath speed talking as fast as she possibly can through the payments training so no one will get it. I've never seen anything so obnoxious in a training that I sat through twice. 

In training you’ll hear higher mgmt use phrases like ""we won't crack the whip too hard"" on the training classes yet finds the term ""illegal"" when describing a landscaper in California who doesn't have documentation to get paid... wildly offensive. Typical do as i say not as I do non sense.

86,Angi,Where to begin,2022-03-02,1.0,Inside Sales Representative,I don’t know if there are any,"After finding more out about “Angi Leads” (It’s homeadvisor) i made myself leave. This company sends contractor either fake leads, leads that are 6+ months old and they pay no attention to the service providers budget or range of work. The trainers teach you to belittle and even lie to costumers. There’s a reason the BBB will not accredit Angi and there’s a reason there’s an excess of 1,000 plus class action lawsuits against the company. The pay sucks for what you have to do and upper management doesn’t give a crap if you don’t hit the sales goal they’ll fire you. I was told when I interviewed there was no quota and it was laid back…… There’s several trainers that belong in prison for teaching reps to misrepresent the product. Do your research before joining their team. This is home advisor with a mask."
87,Angi,Good for out of collage. That’s it.,2022-03-02,1.0,Inside Sales Representative,None. Good holiday pto. People always quit after.,Calling farm. Their stock has gone down a ton and this is a entry level job.

Everyone on my team is very friendly, and the company culture promotes teamwork and good communication. I also enjoy the work I do, which goes a long way too!","Right now, the company is mostly remote, and as far as I know, there are no immediate plans to change this. Also, when I've visited the office it's pretty deserted. Personally, I like remote-first and am not bothered by this, but I can understand how someone wanting an office culture might not like this. If you thrive in an all in-person work environment, Angi may not be a good fit for you.

For those who prefer remote-first set ups, however, I have found Angi does a great job keeping people connected. Also, with periodic trips to the main office, I don't feel cut off from my co-workers. My manager is also not micro-manager and respectful of nights/weekends, and I've never gotten the vibe of someone breathing down my neck at all hours of the day. All told, I like Angi's remote work culture a lot and hope they keep it indefinitely."

Since the pandemic, many homeowners have spent more time taking pride in improving their homes, which is fortunate for Angi in that the company can continue to provide assistance to SPs and Consumers to accomplish goals. Resources by which employees can learn and grow from are regularly provided by Angi and encouraged. Diversity is clearly important and I have enjoyed joining new Women's groups to get to know colleagues in other business departments.",I do wish additional help could be hired for vital departments who really need additional team members so work/life balance is improved.

111,Angi,Great Place to Build a Career,2022-02-24,4.0,Anonymous Employee,"I have been with Angi for several years and have seen a lot of change, both as a professional and within the organization. Angi is a place where I have been able to build a solid career and progress in my skills and leadership. I have had mentors throughout the organization who became advocates for me and have taught me so much. Through all the change, I have become a better leader, teammate and professional, although it hasn't always been easy. 

Pros:
- Great colleagues/ people to work with
- Dedicated leadership team
-Professional Development - one of the core values at Angi is ""Be an Owner"" this ownership and empowerment throughout the organization is great for development, building skills and doing incredible things
- Massive opportunity - Angi is about one year out from our rebrand and we have a massive opportunity ahead to really revolutionize home services. 
- Consistent Communication and new engaging events - Internal comms is great for a company our size. We have firesides every other week where we actually get to see and interact with our whole leadership team. Really unique!
- We get to work with some exceptional pros, small businesses and support them and help homeowners realize their dreams. It's a cool mission!","- Compensation is often within ""market rates"" but just barely and often only looking at total compensation, not base
- Work/Life balance is not in a great place, long days, lots of work (but I like to look at this as an opportunity, lots of work - lots of opportunity)
- Inconsistency between departments and teams - some teams are strong, stable, with great leaders who effectively communicate objectives and what success looks like... other teams and departments not so much. Consistency could be improved"
112,Angi,Working at Angi,2022-02-24,4.0,Onboarding Specialist,I have worked at Angi for 8 years now in 5 different departments. Each one has allowed me to experience and learn more about the company. I have a great team of people that are always willing to help. I also enjoy working remotely which has definitely taken a negative (from the pandemic) and created a positive and much more productive environment.,As with most larger corporations; change can be slower to happen that you might like for product improvements.

Everyone has been extremely helpful and despite onboarding in a remote environment I've managed to feel close to my team. Overviews of the business have been helpful and I'm excited to begin to have an impact.

Key items that I've been impressed by: 
After working through numerous interview processes with multiple companies I felt that I had a fairly good sense of market value for my role. My compensation here is in-line with my expectations, however out of all the opportunities that I considered I felt that Angi had the biggest potential upside for the long-term future. There's a ton of opportunity here and I believe that I'll be able to quickly have an impact. 

Benefits are strong. Health insurance is incredibly competitive.","Working remote brings challenges; while in previous roles I had worked remote but everyone had been based in one or two time zones, the folks at Angi span the entire country, so coordinating meetings and working hours has been a work in progress."

121,Angi,protect your mental health & don't work here,2022-02-18,1.0,Sales,"- good medical benefits
- PTO (though the accrual rate was pretty slow)
- coworkers","I grew to care about my supervisor and teammates, but nothing about the job itself was enjoyable. I had to make 200+ dials a day and was expected to achieve 3 hours of talk time daily despite contractors either (a.) hanging up or (b.) not picking up in the first place because they already have the phone number blocked after being called upwards of 4 times in one day. Yes, one day. It was unacceptable to have ""dial gaps"" longer than 30 seconds, and don't even think about being away from your desk for longer than a few minutes to go the restroom or god forbid get some water. The surveillance culture is strong as we were required to sit in zoom all day long and be babysat by management and were shamed if we turned our mics or cameras off.

Then there were the broken promises. The commission structure randomly changed with little notice and my pay for real got cut in half. No one can live off $15 an hour, especially not when you're gonna need to pay for therapy after and during this job. This job is worth it to only probably 1% of top earners who are getting inbound phone call leads (as opposed to the ice cold leads the rest of us get) and other types of leads that are simply better. The leads are not fairly distributed no matter what they tell you. They give the leads to closers aka people okay with lying and scamming working class people. By the end of my tenure, I was fully okay with not getting good leads as I couldn't stomach scamming people any longer. The sales tactics are aggressive and predatory and will really start to mess with your head and affect your mental health.

The retention of employees and contractors alike at this company are terrible for a reason. I'm embarrassed to have worked here and am grateful I got out when I did. I had never been so depressed in my life working here. Nothing is worth your sanity, not even $850 biweekly paychecks for 90 hours of work. There is also no job security. Like, none. Just take your time, talent, and energy elsewhere- anywhere else.

p.s. don't believe a lot of these positive reviews as they incentive and harass you to write one while working for them to desperately try to counterbalance all the terrible ones

p.s.s. notice the gaslighting by higher ups at this company responding to these reviews, it's truly disgusting and predatory, but what else would I expect."

Little growth opportunities and they do not prioritize or encourage professional development opportunities for those looking to move up in their careers. 

There are constant re-orgs and refocuses of priorities with little notice or proper planning. Bandwidths across all teams are pretty slim with little plans for backfilling.

146,Angi,Best job I've had,2022-02-10,5.0,Inside Sales Representative,"Training is thorough and the trainers were always encouraging and positive. They celebrate all wins, even when you're not making sales. Company culture is as great as it can be while working from home with zoom happy hours and active group chats. 
After training, management teams are still awesome. Very hands on and supportive while still providing constructive feedback. 1 manager for every 10-15 sales reps, so you always feel supported. More tenured reps are also always helpful and supportive.
The pay is great with lots of opportunities for growth, raises, and bonuses. Commission is great, but even when you're not making your sales goals, the base pay plus bonuses for effort keep you going. Benefits are also solid with 401k matching, health insurance, lots of PTO, etc. While in training, I had a death in the family and even that early in my tenure they gave me paid time off.
It's been awesome seeing how the contractors I've sold to have grown their businesses and been successful over the last year. Even though the job is WFH, I'm still able to connect and build relationships with both coworkers and contractors.
Angi/HomeAdvisor has gotten kind of a bad rep, but I have seen enough success stories to know that the contractors who aren't successful with us are simply not using the service right. It's a great service and a great company to work for.",Cold calling gets tiring for sure. Slow sales weeks can be discouraging.

174,Angi,The only constant is change,2022-01-31,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Angi is quick to pivot when needed. While this can be challenging, it's also nice to know that we don't ""keep doing things like we always have."" The culture is also fast-paced and employees have a ton of fun celebrating wins and driving results as a team.","Communication could be better. Because thing move quickly, often news travels by word of mouth before formal communication is out or the formal communication will go out but with little understanding of next steps."
175,Angi,Toxic positivity,2022-01-29,1.0,Sales,"They try to provide an environment where you can have fun, like play table games during breaks. Free sodas all day.","Toxic positivity is the theme. Everyone is highly stressed (you see it on people who are losing hair, look like they havenʻt slept, are slamming whatever they can into their system to get through each day) but smiling and faking it because that is the culture. Turn over is high. Trainers will outright tell you to lie to the customer but managers will pretend that is not allowed and make a big deal about it when it comes out that you refuse to lie and were told to by trainers. Managers brag about ripping off customers and they teach you to try to fast talk and get people to buy on impulse rather than making a good business decision. Nothing matters except getting that next sale. You will make more than 300 calls per day to stay on payroll which is not that big of a deal if you can stomach being blasted with excessively loud music by your team lead (their attempt at keeping up the energy) and listening to your manager boast about how much money he lost at the poker tables the night before, which customer he screwed over that one time he made that big sale heʻs so proud of making when he was in your position, smoke incessantly, gluttonize McDonalds all week long and provide it for the team thinking it is an incentive for you to perform better and laugh about how drunk everyone there gets at night to deal with the stress of coming back each day to do it all over again. It is a very unhealthy environment. You will work hard because you need a job and you know you are capable, you will resolve to maintain your honesty and integrity even though they try to twist you up, you will make sales that your manager openly celebrates before they are finalized making it look like everyone is making huge successes every day but almost all of those sales fall through because the few customers willing to buy cannot pass credit or get cold feet. Then you will get aggressively cornered by your manager who is nice in front of everyone but turns nasty behind closed doors because he is not making enough money off of you and does not know how to be a good manager so he tries the bully route, just like he does on the phone with customers. You will be embarrassed to put Angi on your resume after finding out what is really going on there. Be proud of yourself for walking away from something that is below you and that will never be what they sell you on when you go in for the interview. Hint - if someone has to hard sell you on working some where, that is a huge red flag. RUN!"

Solid established company.","Since anyone in Inside Sales works from home now, they are continuously increasing the micromanagement. Tracking all calls dialed and talk time. It doesn't matter how many sales you close in a week. I personally have had my own way of working since I hired on with the company. It was allowed, because I was always successful. Now it doesn't matter and I don't have the respect that I had when I worked in the office. The company has just changed quite a bit and gotten large quickly. The whole world has changed quite a bit, since the pandemic. I don't feel valued like I did in the past when the company kept commissions steady and the sales staff small and exclusive. I miss the freedom to do the job as I liked, felt respected, and valued. Don't get me wrong, this company has been one of the best companies I have ever worked for."

-that is honestly it","I worked here for almost 3 years. In the office it was fun and we had free lunch and dinner but wfh has completely changed the company. Angi is very cheap-nobody can live off of a 30k base salary. While I liked my manager and teammates and did well, the job itself is horrible. Nobody wants to cold call every day. Even if you need to put something on your resume if you are new, I would still avoid it as there are a lot of lawsuits against the co and it has a horrible reputation. The leads are so bad that you end up leaving voicemails all day long for no money. I did well the first 2 years but when we merged with Angie’s list, (formally homeadvisor) everything went downhill. Nobody is happy working here, these positives reviews must be fake.  I’m not one to leave reviews but take another job with a decent base salary-30k is honestly offensive. They will lie and say you will make a lot of money here, do not listen. I was a top rep and made 70k (and I was in the 1%). I don’t even think that number is possible anymore. Go with a co that actually respects and values you and gives you a livable base. Especially during these times people are looking for employees, do not waste your time here."

The job is soul sucking and sad. There’s nothing worse then asking someone who’s struggling to pay bills and working hard for a credit card over the phone 5 times. Also people shouldn’t give credit cards over the phone to an incoming call in 2021.  There’s nothing worse than leaving each day feeling like you are selling a crap product.

Every leader I've worked for has transformed me into a better person both inside and outside of the workplace. The company genuinely cares about your success and they constantly pour into their people. While working in sales is not an easy position, the earning potential is well worth it. Most importantly, Angi does not care about the sale more than their people. They have full belief that their employees are their greatest asset to the company. Great balance compared to other sales roles. No overtime, long nights, weekends etc. Now that we've moved to remote work, as with all things Angi, we have adapted to make WFH as inclusive as it possibly can be to make everyone feel part of the group and to still have as much fun as possible day in day out. Excellent benefits, 401k match, inclusion/diversity & a true open door policy. Angi changed my life and is truly the best leap I ever took. I went from no sales experience to a highl skilled sales professional turned sales leader. The opportunities are endless.","Work from home isn't for everyone. It's difficult if you need to be around people. The company does an excellent job as noted making it feel as if you were in an office environment, but it still provides it's challenges depending on your personality. It's a grind working in sales specifically. You work hard day in and day out for success, but if that doesn't scare you, the earning potential is well worth it. Again relating to sales, it can be a roller coaster for your emotions (any sales job is) so it is important to maintain a mental toughness and a true desire to succeed."

5. Contractors will lie to you on the call and hang up at payment wasting your time. Even if you can get them to sign the whole deal will typically fall through with a failed payment. Once they are off they phone you will NEVER get them back.
6. Call reviews - everything is YOUR fault if they didn't sign up, there are no bad leads, only bad salespeople.
7. You will lose sales for Angi Ads to Angi Leads - formally Home Advisor who will call and lie to get the sale. Management will not do anything about it.
8. Cult like atmosphere.
9. Childlike environment with constant pointless emails and meetings. If a meeting cuts into your call time you are expected to make up for it.
10. Toxic work environment.
11. Terrible company reputation which makes selling harder. I don't understand how this place still exists with the number of people who have been ripped off or had a bad experience. It seems like their days are numbered.

In summary - if you are right out of college with zero experience this may be the place for you. If you have had a few jobs and can see through lies you should not bother. You will not be able to achieve the income they try to sell you on."

From the start of my interview process, Angi made it clear to me that they care deeply about supporting their employees, personally and professionally. I originally applied for a role that ended up not being the right fit professionally, but the Angi team took the time to get to know me and helped me find a role that was a better fit for my experience and professional goals. 

Since joining the Angi team, their emphasis on people has only become more clear to me. Despite onboarding remotely, the team welcomed me on day 1 and made sure I felt connected and supported during my onboarding. Additionally, Angi leadership emphasizes work-life balance and encourages team members to take time off to recharge and relax. I've gotten to dive into some engaging, complicated projects and am excited to continue to partner across the organization to contribute to the success and growth of the company.","Angi is a growing organization.

291,Angi,Hardcore phone sales but great pay structure,2021-12-04,4.0,Sales Associate,Well before COVID the office culture was awesome.. Game room‘s music rooms lunch and dinner paid for through delivery.com $30 credit per day per employee. Good benefits but of course the most important uncapped commission. And working in an office environment you want sales to be competitive but in a friendly way. So calling contractors all day can get hard and monotonous when you have other people doing it next to you it’s not so bad. Since Covid it’s work from home and though we communicate on teams and zoom calls it’s just not the same. They’ve also changed the commission structure so now it’s revenue-based as opposed to retention based. The company is always striving to do better to the contractors are happy in the homeowners happy and the sales people are happy. The circle of work life as it were. I do well there but if you’re not experienced with Sales and able to discipline yourself to stay locked in eight hours a day then you’re fine yourself leaving this job sooner than later.,Not too many downsides when people are losing their jobs because of Covid HomeAdvisor/Angie was hiring people and growing as a business.

The revolving door is real.

- Able to work remotely and the option to go into the office if you choose is nice
- Emphasis on autonomy and initiative","- Organizational structure needs a lot of work. Things are still up in the air right now due to the rebrand and it operates very similarly to a start up even though it's a large company. Can be frustrating when no one knows their role and things are constantly changing.
- A lack of communication from managers and upper management regarding growth and role clarity. I've seen people who have been at the company for several months get promotions and title changes while people who have been here close to a year or over just get swept under the rug with no feedback on why they also aren't getting the chance to move upward."
314,Angi,Scammers!,2021-11-21,1.0,Sales Representative,I am being trained on high-pressure sales.,"We harvest leads from Nextdoor, Craigslist, and other sites.

315,Angi,Please read this review - this company is awful and messed up a lot of people's mental health.,2021-11-21,1.0,Inside Sales Representative,"- Health insurance, really good options, includes dental and vision
- The people you meet on your team and director side","1) Pay: base pay is 30k/yr. After taxes and health deductions you barely make $800... it's absurd.
- No base pay raise - it stays at 30k/yr... it will take you forever to reach ""Senior"" Inside Sales rep and the benefits to reaching are.... imaginary really.

2) Sales are incredibly difficult to come by. Reasons being: 1- we are calling contractors who know and usually HATE HomeAdvisor/Angi (many even tried it and lost tons of money or have heard horror stories from other contractors) 2- we are calling these professionals out of the blue and most times they are on a job -- we are expected to get the sale. no. matter. what. On the roof? No worries, just come down. The cement is drying? It's ok, this call will bring you more money anyway so ditch your current gig! No money on the card you provided us? No problem - let's try ALL of your cards, or go to the bank and put that amount of $300 in, or get your wife or your coworker's card RIGHT NOW (no exaggeration). Some home professionals literally would tell us how poor they were or how they only had enough in their account to pay rent and still we had to tell them to use that money and take the chance because it was a no-brainer. Guess what. It wasn't - they would lost that money and be absolutely distraught.

3) Company reputation, questionable sales tactics, likely fake leads (a contractor literally went to the address of a lead that HomeAdvisor provided and when they got there, it was a public field/not a house needing the repair that they were told). Go on Youtube and you will see all the bad reviews and lawsuits against this company... it will hurt your resume.

4) Micromanaging and insane key performance indicators: some (lots of) managers would message you if you hadn't made a dial in 5 minutes. They would also call everyone out in from of the team. When you didn't close, my manager was so hostile it was insane. Every day, we were told that we were expected to have made a dial within 5 minutes of starting our days - no room to breathe, check our emails, plan for the day. We were expected to have AT LEAST 3 HOURS of talk time. If you made 2 deals but still had only 2 hours of talk time.. guess what? Not good enough. Sometimes they would send you a new ""hot lead"" right before work was done, I even told the manager I was tired from pitching and my throat was hurting and it was 6pm - manager said ""but it's a really hot lead"". When I got sick, the manager didn't even bother answering my message acknowledging it or even saying get better - nothing. They even force you to go on Zoom and pitch in front of lots of people - they pretend its to make things fun and for people to bond, but 99% of people on it are miserable and tired. You have to make 80-200 dials a day, have ideally 4-5 hours of talk time per day. 90% of your day is getting hung up on or leaving voicemails.. the monotony will kill your spirits slowly.

5) No sales continuing education - you don't learn the more you're at the job, it's always the same thing. There is no professional development.

6) COMMISSION CHARGEBACK! Be careful - if your deals cancelled before a month - you were in trouble. Guess what? The product is awful so people always end up cancelling.

7) High turn over - every month (almost every other week) people get fired or quit because they are overworked, underpaid, morale is low, and their expectations are bizarre.

8) Awful computer and CRM system. They use ""Betti"", not Salesforce or any other system that will help you out in your next role. BY THE WAY - it's work from home, so you have to connect their computer to your internet router. This is so backwards. Some poor reps were working by sitting on the floor of their homes because of this (because their routers were not close to their sofa or a place they could sit comfortably). 

9) Morale is so low that people on the team would cry to each other, text each other venting all the time, and be completely depressed. Most of us would barely even respond when the manager was leading the huddles - because our spirits were crushed and the manager didn't know how to manage people. You had to drink the cool aid and pretend you loved the job.

10) If you're a great rep and have one bad month - you can easily be put on a performance improvement plan. There is NO job security. They threaten you to keep you on your toes and they will fire you without thinking TWICE. I have seen them congratulate reps for their success, then that same rep has a bad month and if they don't improve in the next month, they are fired. The way my coworker was fired was absolutely unprofessional. In the PIP they say that the manager and director would meet weekly to help us improve - that does not happen. Nothing changes. No guidance.

11) You have to get people's social security cards and credit cards. Within 15 minutes of being on a call. 

12) You don't learn anything about the industry, you are just expected to read the script, not ask any questions, ask for their money, and sometimes bully people until they sign up.

13) No understanding about mental or physical health. Someone on the director side had surgery and their sales decreased that month because they were still recovering. Their manager had the audacity to say ""Your sales went down last month. What happened?"" fully knowing the situation.

14) Training is rushed and unprofessional. You will also be threatened to lose your job if you are doing something wrong on the second week on the job - instead of ASKING or HELPING - they send warning emails. No follow up from managers, no helping hand.

15) They don't really seem to care about contractors being onboarded successfully. Sometimes I would get contractors that were technologically challenged, so they were taking longer in our welcome/onboarding call. Reps had to show them how to use the app to turn the leads on, off, increase budget etc. My manager would literally message me asking me why I was still on the phone call with the contractor. They could listen in to our calls, and I would explain that they're having a hard time finding something on the app, and still the manager would say ""speed it up you have sales to make"". Guess what- those contractors that had a hard time using the app because we rushed, will 100% cancel, and guess who is at fault? The rep.

I urge to take any other job. Even if you are good in sales, you will be discouraged. 90% of reps leave after a very short time, a tiny percentage of reps actually make a lot of money, and a very small percentage of home professional see success from the product. During my interviews with other companies, they asked about HomeAdvisor - and every time they asked how I felt about the company reputation and the lawsuits against them. No bueno."

I could go on and on about how shady this company is and how poorly they treat employees, impossible metrics, poor leads, low pay, high expectations, lying to customers etc. But the main thing to know is that this company is a total resume killer. Especially if you plan on staying in the building/ construction industry in the future stay far away from this company. Their reputation is horrible and you will certainly be interrogated for working there, having Angi on your resume might as well be the same as having a felony because you will be viewed as crook for working here. Everyone in the industry knows of them and has either been burned by them or pestered for years to sign up. They are the epitome of the evil greedy corporation.

The higher-ups know all about it and separate their ""Top Sales People"" into their own area so that no one hears what they actually say to their customers. They call them on their cell phones so that the calls are not recorded and then they leave their customer service people to clean up after them. That is just the tip of the ice berg. 

The customers are allowed to say anything to you, threaten you, call you filthy names, and you are not even allowed to advise them it is not acceptable. 

They can talk about your mother, your child or threaten your life and you are supposed to say ""I am soooo sorry that you feel that way? Then you just have to sit there and take it, and if you end the call due to the abuse it is an automatic walk you to the door no matter what offense.

When concerns were brought to my manager about needing additional support, resources, etc I was told to get over it and that everyone had too much work. No compassion no empathy and management no help. Then proceeded to complain about THEIR workload. Management does not listen to employees no wonder the decent management has been fleeing the company like rats on a sinking ship. They also continue to wast money opening offices for hundreds of people and having a half dozen show up daily. Your employees clearly dont want to be in these offices or else they would be showing up. Stop forcing your support and facilities teams into offices to support 5 daily users. Stop forcing your outdated beliefs on your employees as they have clearly been speaking with their resignations. Stop creating unnecessary and  dangerous work environments for your teams to support purely for the sake of optics. There are tons of rolls we can not fill because the company can not think of the employee and nothing is being done to retain the few employees who have bothered to stick through over 6 months of upheaval and garbage."

Opportunity for bonuses each pay period and to earn more per hour/be promoted quickly when working hard/achieving metrics consistently; the opportunity to help service professionals grow their businesses and learn more about the trades in the process; to work in a cutting edge technology company and build your skill sets; promotes transparency of home improvement industry; innovative with a startup-y vibe with the stability of a multi billion dollar corp; culture of empowerment

Considering Home Improvement and Advertising have been traditionally male dominated, Angi is promoting a company culture of diversity, equity and inclusion which is very critical for me in a company. I can say in BCCI, we are a good mix of both male and female which is a nice change from sales. I can honestly say I feel at home at Angi.","The health insurance package could be better but if I didn't have my husband's option then I'd be very grateful to have it.
Sometimes, you have to double check your payroll but any errors are addressed within the next 2 payrolls generally.

However due to personal issues my sales declined and I struggled to stay focused balancing work and life and I was at a cross roads to fight to stay in sale or to move on to a position the better fit my skill outside of ANGI. Lucky for me I had a great sales manager who recognized my talents as a good communicator, hard worker with a eye for detail and encouraged he me to stay with ANGI and suggested I apply for a CST role, although I was a bit unsure on exactly what I would be doing as a PR Point when submitting my application . I knew I trusted my manager , loved working for ANGI and possessed the skills to advance with the company. Now 3 months into my new role I feel at HOME, love my team and I am thankful for the opportunity to pursue my career growth with ANGI.

High turnover in sales - Many great people fall through the cracks and leave without exploring other positions within ANGI

Lip service to values such as diversity and inclusion; while management/leadership don't doesn't look like people like me .

Fortunately, Angi truly believes that employees (or Talent) are important. They worked with me to find a better fit and I love my new role.",There was frustration initially. If I had been better matched in the beginning I may have had a different experience. I will say though that the path I took has given me a unique perspective and advantage in my new position.
357,Angi,Great company that makes time for its employees,2021-10-28,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"I chose to work for Angi because of their recent re-branding and expansion. I also believe they are positioned to really capitalize on the changing nature of how we approach working on our homes, and how service providers can reach new customers in a digital age. With their re-branding, they face a lot of challenges, which is a big plus for me because I always search for new jobs that have challenges that I believe I can help solve.

My team's culture is fantastic; they are collaborative, highly intelligent and driven. It includes a range of ages which gives us the ability to have a diverse range of viewpoints on how to approach our work. Everyone on the team is welcoming and, most importantly in a WFH environment, they are inclusive.

While Angi does have quite an extensive onboarding process (like most companies), it went smoothly and I never got the idea that anything was going to get lost in the shuffle. My recruiter, manager and onboarding coordinator were very communicative with me throughout the whole process.

Angi's benefits are a big step up from my previous company too. Their health benefits in particular give you a wide range of options and there should be an option for almost every situation. 401k match is pretty much at the industry standard, nothing crazy but definitely not disappointing. On top of that they have a range of additional benefits; pet insurance, legal insurance, free subscription to Headspace (mental wellness service) and charitable donation matching up to $15,000... among other things.

Obviously it depends on what department/business line you work in, and what team you're on, but so far I love where I'm at.","Not necessarily a con, but working from home is an adjustment for me.

If or when they hangup the managers would change the ip address to make it seem like it was someone else calling or they would transfer the lead to another agent for the harrassment to continue. The sales that some agents are making are not from the general pool of mulled over leads that are repeatedly being called they are shown favoritism and given the warm leads ....the unsuspecting fools that they manage to lure in. Despite the beautiful ads in high rotation they can't keep descent employees. The rebranding from home advisor to angi nothing has or will help this organization unless the culture changes. Who in their right mind would have convicted criminals in managerial roles. I know everyone deserves a second chance however they exhibit that behavior in the corporate environment so no change has occurred once a criminal always a criminal!!!!

376,Angi,Excellent place for growth!,2021-10-15,5.0,Senior Product Designer,"Angi has made the decision to invest in design and put the focus on the consumer more than ever. This user-centric focus is actually why I decided to join the team. Since joining, I have been warmly welcomed by my incredibly talented coworkers (which I was worried about in an all remote setting). 

The design problems we have to chew on are complex, requiring intense collaboration across departments to find the right solutions. This, at times, can slow down the design process, but everyone I have worked with has been so enthusiastic about doing right by the user that it makes it worthwhile.

The design team in particular is kind, empathetic, and incredibly smart. Everyone has their own strengths and specialities and we are encouraged to shine in those capacities. This is by far the best team I have worked with so far in my career.","Obviously during periods of rapid growth, there can sometimes be confusion around process and design systems. There are some days this can be frustrating or feeling like you are walking in the dark. However, the design team in particular has a great support system and everyone is willing to reach out a hand to help you find your way."

394,Angi,Weird job,2021-10-08,3.0,Sales,"Great bennies, education about investment into hsa","Super strange culture. Very divided between legacy sales teams and the people excited about changes—lots of friction and obvious lashing out because of that. Difficult to hit commission, and a really big push to completely depersonalize the sales process. Not a lot of room for innovation, creativity, and not as much of a focus on data based methodologies as you would expect for a technology company. Big time pressure on management and sales teams to perform at any cost, which means teammates frequently resent top performers, sabotage one another, and figure out how to swipe accounts for the limited number of actually qualified and licensed contractors that are able to pass the screening process. People have signed up their friends’ daycare to avoid being fired. Very little control over pipeline—manager controls access to accounts and can divvy them up however he or she sees fit, regardless of whether you’ve been working someone or something for months. This is obviously very easy to abuse, and frequently is. Difficult to try out new methods because results are so disconnected from actual sales processes, team members doing well don’t share tips because your head is next on the chopping block, and new reps unfortunately are frequently taken advantage of (that second voice is someone finding their old account and protecting it since those get first dibs on ownership—kind of sad actually). Eventually depressing enough that most people just accept their fate. 

A lot of potential, but I think the pushed transactional nature of the sale ignores reality. If “anybody could do it,” turnover wouldn’t be astronomical. Sales is not the domination of a person—most reps have the attitude that to punish these SPs for their lies, you must sign them up which shows an absolutely sad view of the product internally. 

—guy in charge was smart to create onboarding and completely separate sales from the outcomes—think this will help with turnover. 
—also smart to finally cross reference inbounds with actual businesses
—let up on managers and maybe even help with their mental health—can literally witness someone’s spiral into depravity and feel genuinely sad. 
—to become the Amazon or Uber, you HAVE TO invest in improving the technology and consumer experience. More transparency is the only way. Have seen consumers recommend not using ANGI because we go to such lengths to hide SP’s info, which makes people suspicious and feel grossed out. People like depersonalization with smaller projects, but bigger stuff, homeowners NEED pictures etc. and depriving them of that info isn’t getting you more business."

I have worked through three fevers now as they would publicly shame me for having to miss days. 
I have been refused training for a week now that I was reprimanded for. 
They are grasping at any which way to fire me after only a short amount of time.
If you do not make sales regardless of metrics the managers will consistently whine that you aren't making money and gaslight you into thinking it's the company pushing them to be ""mean"" when its just the manager being money hungry. 
There is no true care for advancement, they will not help you in training and barely out of it. If you ask for help they will continue to put it off and find something to put you on a plan for. It's disgusting."

It also doesn't hurt that they're so afraid to take a stand or opinion on anything. There's zero commitment to diversity, though they might pretend by slapping some core values on the website and patting themselves on the back. You'll be under paid for your work here and treated with a performative kindness that goes away pretty quickly once you've been in your role for a few months.

This is not unique to Angi as other employers do as well. It is nice that they are at least creating opportunities for groups of people that often have a disadvantage in the workforce - even if the job itself is truly terrible.","As a Sales Rep, you are not in sales - you are a telemarketer. They have reduced this job to reading from a 4 page script, dialing over 150 times and Talk Time of 3+ Hours PER DAY, and you have to take credit card information over the phone. This is telemarketing not sales.

They will micro-manage literally every second of your day because if you go on 5 a minute break to use the bathroom - management's hair will catch on fire. They will even jump on calls and yell in your ear during ""sales"" pitches. One even literally yelled in my ear: ""NO NO NO NO!!!""

The other thing is they act like a cult with extreme shows of fake excitement about a job that is truly terrible. It is the worst job I have ever had, and I created this account to warn people that this is not something you want to do. If I had known what this was - I would have declined the job.

423,Angi,Dream became a nightmare,2021-09-17,1.0,Graphic Designer,Open vacation and time-off policy,"I started working for HomeAdvisor prior to the Angie's List merger and it was an incredible company, staffed with amazing people, clear objectives, fantastic leadership, and the best perks and benefits around. It still definitely had that exciting and supportive start-up feel. I felt ridiculously grateful to be there and had never been happier in a role. Things really took a turn in mid-2020 during the rushed and chaotic HomeAdvisor rebrand and the leader of my team was seemingly let go for no reason. After that it was a slow decline into a dumpster fire as more and more long-time employees, both in and out of leadership positions, were forced out of the company and those who could see the writing on the wall began leaving on their own. Even C-level people, people who had been there for over a decade and helped make that company what it was, were forced out with barely a mention or explanation to employees. And they've all seemingly been replaced by people from Handy a company acquired by HA/IAC in 2018. (It felt quite a bit like a hostile takeover to be honest; all HA people were pushed out and seemingly replaced by Handy execs, including the CEO.) Every week there would be news of someone else who was let go or chose to leave. And then just before the Angi rebrand, which again was totally rushed, chaotic and with so little communication on what was happening to employees it resulted in many many hours of wasted time and work, my second manager (another incredible and long-time leader) was let go without explanation, and replaced with an outsider who had clearly never actually managed people before and was awful at it. And with that, the greatest job I'd ever had turned into the absolute worst one. The new suite of leadership does not care about the employees. It's only about the numbers and you are reminded every day that you are replaceable. When I chose to verbalize my complaints, I was let go. It wasn't until after I left and my mental health began improving that I realized how much of a toll my last year at this company took on me. HomeAdvisor was a wonderful company. Angi destroyed it.

Finally, the pay is embarrassing. I was paid well below market average for my position and considering how much money this corporation rakes in, there was no excuse for it. It was demoralizing hearing leadership claim there were freezes on raises ""due to covid"" and then pointing to record profits all in the same breath. What a joke.

I would steer clear of this place."

You are ""trained"" for a month by a bunch of kids hopped up on coffee and an impossibly high amount of trainees who come and go faster than fruitflies. You are then set free to make hundreds and hundreds of calls to shaky leads provided by a company that prides itself on giving customers good leads. After 12 WEEKS if you don't make the requisite amount of sales you are not allowed to ""graduate"" and are out of a job. Those who ""graduate"" then get to continue selling within a commission structure that gets weirder and harder to accomplish with each passing week. It's hard to focus because the company wants you to participate in endless chatter while you are making the phone calls, sometimes about subjects that have nothing to do with work. It's all a distraction so the workers don't realize they are selling a product few people want. Further, employees are taught to use ""dicey"" sales tactics including telling people to go to the bank and deposit money into their debit accounts so they can pay for the service that day."

When I started, it was a great company with strong leadership and a clear direction. While there were a few issues to work out, it was manageable and seemed to be on the up and up.

My team worked well together and got along fine (before everyone quit or was forced out).","Over time, things seemed to completely crumble. Deadlines were created with no communication to the teams these deadlines had been given to. Expectations were too high, with low pay, for projects to be completed on these insane deadlines. 

The rebrand was truly one of the most insane rollouts I've ever seen, spurred forward so quickly that multiple teams were working late nights and early mornings, expected to produce with little-to-no direction from leadership. Everything about the rebrand was held so close to the vest that multiple teams were hindered by lack of information and unable to complete their jobs -- instead having to go back and redo work they'd just stayed up through the night completing. It was incredibly disrespectful to trusted employees and the whole thing seemed incredibly shortsighted. 

Along with the rebrand came a complete overhaul of executive leadership, with higher-ups leaving the company in droves. That was a red flag to leave, if the disastrous rebrand wasn't enough of a signal. Instead of hiring more help, teams were left to pick up the slack of multiple parties, and operate on even tighter and tighter deadlines."
434,Angi,Sales Representative,2021-09-13,1.0,Anonymous Employee,Work Environment was pleasant and vibrant,If you didn’t hit your goal you didn’t have a job
435,Angi,The truth,2021-09-10,5.0,Sales Representative,You can easily make six figures at this company all you need to do is work hard and prospect. Overall they do so much for you I myself have been so blessed to be part and continue to be part of such a successful and growing company,Overall they do so much for you I myself have been so blessed to be part and continue to be part of such a successful and growing company.
436,Angi,Beware - Just don't miss reading both Pros and Cons,2021-09-09,1.0,Senior Software Engineer,"Joining this company will push you to look outside for other opportunities and smart people take advantage of this and prepare well for their big jump. 
If you stay, you may become part of sinking ship history. All the very best and please make sure you read Cons as well.","Angi got created by merging Angie's List, HomeAdvisor and Handy, three companies were merged together and still there is a lot of positions open. What does that tell you? It means either company is growing with lot of new projects or people are leaving. Anyone smart can easily guess the answer. 
I suggest you to read all the reviews but avoid recently posted positive reviews because there are very few people left in the company who has worked here for long time to add any positive review. Angi has lost majority of its employees either by mass firing or because they left for better pay / better work life balance / better career opportunities / for better leadership. People with no experience are making decisions. People with no skills or experiences are VP's, Directors, leading company in to failure. Merging 3 brands was a good idea but top management should have been from outside so there won't be any bias internally. You can get fired even if your team and manager gives you an excellent review because there is no connection between who is making the decision and the manager you are working with. Basically you can get fired even without your manager knowing, which doesn't happen in any other company."
437,Angi,love my team and the mission,2021-09-09,5.0,Associate Technical Recruiter,"Great people, fast-paced work without being overwhelming, I've learned a ton even in my first few weeks, I really like the office in NYC, the benefits and pay are great, very flexible with time off and health-related needs, very flexible with remote or hybrid-remote work, feels pretty small even though it's a fairly large company",The brand name is newer so it takes a bit of explaining to communicate what the company is for people who haven't heard of us
438,Angi,Met many other severely depressed workers,2021-09-08,1.0,Anonymous Employee,Commission was decent if you made it.,The pressure applied to the sale teams were constant and aggressive.
439,Angi,Lack of tech leadership,2021-09-07,1.0,Software Engineer,Some interesting problems that will definitely be part of the future.,Leadership is devoid of tech savvy. They're all business oriented and under value the technology side of the business. Extremely micromanaging. I've never worked somewhere where everyone I talked to seemed to dislike the work environment.
440,Angi,Life changing company,2021-09-02,4.0,"Senior Recruiter, Talent Acquisition","-- The culture was my initial attraction and has never disappointed. I've never felt so important and celebrated in my entire career. 
-- The ability to hire for several umbrella's within the business has been eye opening and satisfying. I've watched this business change the lives of so many individuals. I've never seen an organization go whatever length it takes to truly support each individual no matter what role you're in. 
-- Our CEO believes he's the smallest person on the ""totem pole"" and truly embodies this in everything he does. His belief that we're nothing without the people who contribute to every part of our business. It's amazing to see him ""walk the walk"" 
-- Work/life balance and WFH has been uber successful with our business. It's been a priority of the org to deliver an immense amount of work/life balance with schedules, time off and the overall encouragement to enjoy your personal life as much as humanly possible. We truly believe in the importance of a healthy lifestyle as an individual. 
-- Our equity and diversity focus has been incredibly refreshing and exciting to watch grow. Seeing an entire org focus on diversity of teams and brining different backgrounds in intentionally has fostered an even more enhanced collaboration than we have ever had.
-- Speaking personally, I've accomplished more professionally in my time here with the support of our leadership as a whole than i have in the entirety of my career. I've grown professionally, but also in my personal life/goals in ways that I would have never imagined.
-- We also promote from within every chance we get, I've never seen so many people be promoted from within the org VS obtaining an external leader. If growth is important to you, you'll find it here!","-- Our company changes very frequently, as we navigate growth. We're a tech company who is very focused on innovation and success -- with those accomplishments and growth, comes change. If consistent change is a struggle for an individual, you may find challenges. However, we'll work with you to understand changes and accompany your success through those transitions. You're never alone."

Most of the time when you're calling, that person has already been called many many times and are very annoyed."
445,Angi,Great company,2021-08-26,5.0,Sales Manager,Compensation and culture are great at all levels within.,Difficult and mundane for sales. Account management and other positions are much more enjoyable.
446,Angi,"Thoughtful, Communicative, Friendly -- 10/10",2021-08-26,5.0,Senior Recruiter,"Recruiting process: 
1. The hiring manager was timely in all communications, flexible with my schedule, and consistently friendly
2. Scheduling was a breeze and the process was quick and easy
3. I had the chance to meet with future peers and even a potential hiring manager that I'd be partnering with. It allowed me to get a full view of what my life at Angi could be like.
4. They were transparent every step of the way, and so was I. Throughout my interviews, I talked about a number of things that I liked (and didnt like) about recruiting. Ultimately, when I received an offer, it was clear that they were listening. I'm now recruiting on roles that I find extremely interesting, and I have direct line of sight to different areas of growth and ways for me to expand my horizon internally. 

Growth/the opportunities: 
1. Growth opportunities (a major reason why I was looking in the first place) was a huge pull. I looked at the LinkedIn profiles of everyone I interviewed with on the Recruiting team, and I saw that many of the managers/senior managers (even the VP of TA) started as IC recruiting professionals at the company and had grown internally. It was truly an indicator that I would also have the chance to grow and be recognized for my efforts/accomplishments. 
2. Angi as a company seemed like an exciting place to be. With the merger of Angie's List, Homeadvisor, and Handy -- it seemed like there was a huge amount of potential growth which is always exciting as a recruiter because it often means new positions to hire for and a greenfield of Hiring Manager relationships to build. 

Culture: 
1. Communicative, collaborative, supporting and trusting. I see this and experience this with my own team but also with the relationships I'm creating with senior management (hiring managers).",nothing really to say here... maybe that the process moved a little too quickly? but not sure if that's a bad thing. was just a bit of a whirlwind.

- I had a chill manager compared to some
- my team group chat was entertaining bc we were all constantly sharing stories about the conversations we have with contractors on the phone, so some comic relief considering we all did not enjoy our job","- antiquated sales tactics (cold calling and one call close)
- 3 hours per day leaving voicemails
- normal sales are about 1-2 sales per week out of about 1000 calls
- leads are soooo bad
- script is misleading to contractors (make promises we can't keep)
- knowledge of exactly what we are selling to the contractor is non existent 
- top reps are given better leads
- sleazy cars salesman sales tactics are encouraged/expected
- insanely high turnover, i had 5 people on my team of 12 quit or get fired in the 7 months I have been here

453,Angi,It's not for everyone,2021-08-24,2.0,Leadership Development Program,You get to meet some amazing people while working there.

454,Angi,Terrible company to work for (unless you’re a good sheep).,2021-08-24,1.0,Sales Representative,You do get to work from home. That was one thing they were honest about.,"Some of the worst sales processes I’ve ever worked with. Incredibly inefficient! A very large part of the job is wasting time calling people that don’t exist or numbers not in service. Since they aren’t smart enough to create a filtration system they use the sales team for it. I will also say that for an online company, some of the most unreliable and inefficient tech/software I have ever used. The product itself isn’t even that great, aside from having people scream at you about it all day. There are very simple things this company could do to drastically improve but that might cost a little bit of money, heaven forbid!"

Highly motivated people, but the job itself is horrendous.","Cold calling over 200 people a day, lying to contractors about the area they are in “being busy with so much work for them”- a straight up lie. Managers expect too much, as soon as the contractors you call hear “angi or homeadvisor”they hang up or yell at you. The leads they give you have been called over and over and over and over and over. Would NOT recommend this job to anyone who does not like being bossed around, tabs kept on, and calling over 200 crabby contractors each day that have been called so repeatedly. The job itself is a scam, and it is scamming the contractors as well. Lying to them that the area they are in is “so busy” with work that you have for them- not ethical to lie like that. Charging contractors $200 for a project they might not even get, even worse you guys take it right out of their bank account. This job is not recommend and you have to push people so hard to the point where they wanna rip their hair out by the end of the call. goodluck to whoever chooses to work here."

3) You'll learn a ton and likely will do lots of new things that will help you grow
4) You'll be able to play an important part in crafting a new company culture, brand, and values
5) The opportunity is huge - this category is still completely analogue and the customer problems are massive. Someone will have a gold mine when they figure this industry out and Angi is currently well positioned to do that
6) If you do great things, you'll be compensated for it
7) Being mostly owned by IAC is a huge asset","1) Angi will push you hard to deliver value for our customers and the business, and that can be challenging
2) This org has gone through more change in the last 9mo than I have ever seen at a company. We're mostly on the other side of that now, and the vast majority is long-term positive, but still change has been hard
3) To go along with that change, there are many legacy systems that need to be rewritten/unwound, which won't be fast or easy (but might have really interesting technical challenges)
4) We need to be better at balancing short term vs long term in certain areas. We're off to a good start in making some change here, but more to do"

- Awesome and talented colleagues","-many teams work in silos, so we find constant duplication of work 
-every new service/product is launched with a half baked process and 50% of the time it needs to be rolled back
- general customer care agents are terrible! They use an outsouced BPO in another country, and honestly, it is the worst I have ever seen
- no help for providers, and they treat their providers terribly. It is not uncommon to see them severely underpaid for services. They lose good providers all the time. It is a constant quantity over quality issue."

If you work hard and put in the time you will be rewarded handsomely. #1 accomplishment at Angi has been me becoming a part of Angi Elite.,I think that Angi has to roll out more competitions and give away more gift cards and incentives. I never worked in the office but I interviewed in there and it was awesome. But Angi went from free lunch and dinner to maybe 1 person on the team each week will win a 25$ gift card.

Lots of visibility with senior leadership if that's your thing. Random minor perks like beer on tap in the office, ping pong tables, but those mask the complete absence of an actual strong work culture.","The business survives by lying to and preying on a large cohort of the Service Professionals in the network. Many employees realize this and make comments suggesting as much. Some are outspoken defenders of pros, but at the end of the day the business can't make big changes to the benefit of the pros since that would hurt the short-term bottom line. The business only survives by selling pros into the network at a break-neck pace while the existing population of pros churns out like no tomorrow once they see the program is not helpful to them. It's not great for consumers either-- consumers either have a hard time finding any pro on the platform, or are bombarded by too many. The pros have to compete extremely hard for each lead since they're so expensive and so rarely turn into actual jobs, and some consumers may feel that's too intrusive. Negative consumer experiences abound, mainly from unqualified people performing some of the newer fixed-price tasks.

Consumers are truly better off Googling for a pro, and pros would be better served by Google ads. Neither of these suggest a bright future for Angi.

Predatory sales practices. Pros are led to believe they'll get home-run leads on the platform and that they'll make tons of money. In reality, strong leads are few and far between. Current employees should look at the ""win-rate"" metric which measures the fraction of leads that a pro wins. Understanding that metric (and understanding that it's an average) explains why the short-term pro retention rates are so abysmal."

4. Very challenging technical problems that will take time, creativity, and talent to overcome","1. The organization is three families all brought under the same roof in a very short span of time. Morale is low in some areas as cultures merge and people depart as the org. rediscovers itself

513,Angi,Engineers:  Please Do NOT Work Here,2021-07-19,1.0,Software Engineer,"Unlimited PTO policy, remote/wfh, talented engineers","1. Angi has added fake reviews on this site to try to outnumber the amount of negative reviews. The lack of integrity from this company is astonishing. For the record, there is no house cleaning perk. That's a lie.

2. There is zero job security. People are being laid off/fired/""managed out"" on a weekly basis for seemingly no reason at all. Software engineers are being fired regularly by the CTO and VPs despite having excellent quarterly reviews. When the remaining employees asked how they can feel that they have job security when they are seeing high-performing peers get fired for no reason, the CEO responded, ""Hey, look. We're all adults here."" I am still not sure how that response addresses a concern as serious as job security, but it speaks to the extremely low EQ of the CEO.

3. Exclusion is real. If you are not a friend of the CTO or VP, prepare to be ""managed out"" or excluded. The CTO and VPs have used company funds to fly a select few out to Denver for networking events, but exclude others with the exact same job title from the opportunity of networking by inviting those to the event, but not providing travel expenses or accommodations. Then, at the events, the VPs make promises to advance the careers of those who attended the event. Discrimination and exclusion? Hmm..

4. The compensation is subpar. 

5. The company is working towards a culture of leading by fear, firing people continuously to let other developers know that if they are not performing by some undocumented expectations, they, too, will be fired. The CPO encourages irresponsible hiring, stating that it's okay to fire people if they do something you don't like.

Once we “graduated”, we were separated to join new teams in different dictatorships. Let me begin by saying that the whole account retention fact was a hard hit due to the fact that during training we were told to just SELL. My role was a Sales consultant, not customer service and for sure not an account manager! We were reminded daily about these ridiculous “plans” we would have to get on for not meeting sales goals, poor attendance, not making call time and for account retention. I witnessed plenty of shady things that perhaps HR should be made aware of. All the better leads were given to the Reps with the highest sales and all the others were given dead or terrible leads. These poor contractors were called literally 2-3 times a week! They hate hearing from this company and most certainly the reps.

561,Angi,"HomeAdvisor was a great company, Angi not so much",2021-06-24,3.0,Software Engineer,"Without a doubt, everyone I worked with day to day was great. There is a ""we're in this together"" attitude, which I’d say is rare. This is exemplified by many engineers and managers, including myself, choosing to leave Angi after a recent round of layoffs heavily impacted our teams.
You will be challenged by your work and expected to write code that is testable and bug free (Angi has no QA team for many of its product teams, not a pro). You will also be expected to do tasks outside of your title which I enjoyed for learning and growth (example: a font end engineer may need to act more full stack occasionally).
Work life balance is pretty good. Stepping away for a doctor's appointment or other personal events is usually not a problem. I was never pressured to work late nights, but you'll definitely have enough on your plate to work late if you want.
""Unlimited"" PTO is definitely a perk and if your manager is good like mine was you'll have no problem taking off. Although, I never felt comfortable taking a full work week off at once.
Meeting schedules are very reasonable. Usually just one 30 minute to an hour long meeting at the beginning of the day to talk with your team about what you've been working on.","HomeAdvisor was a great company until its merge with Angie's List and rebrand into Angi. The leadership was great and you could tell they knew how to run a public company. HomeAdvisor was growing and revenue was up. Things were being done right. 
Once the rebrand to Angi occurred the company had most of its C-Suite execs replaced with people from start up backgrounds. Thats when the layoffs began. Shortly after the rebrand, product directors and managers who played a key role in making sure the rebrand was successful were fired in a first round of layoffs. Believe it or not the home services business model is actually fairly complex and a lot of business specific knowledge is gained the longer you work here. That knowledge cannot be easily replaced. However, the new C-Suite believes that the business model can be simplified. Therefore, this knowledge is disposable. This would be true, but when you have built your entire tech stack around the first business model it is very unwise to layoff the people who are most knowledgable about it. But, that is what happened. 
The second round of layoffs came when our new CTO asked for a list. From this list, the new CTO chose dozens of engineers to be laid off without consulting their managers. This layoff came right after our quarterly reviews where my colleagues who were fired passed with flying colors. It was a huge shock to us all. On top of this, those of us who got to keep our jobs were notified about who was being laid off before the individuals being laid off were. Therefore, when we reached out to our fired colleagues to tell them how sorry we were they had no idea what we were talking about. Then in our next company wide meeting we were told that the layoffs occurred because of a “new company direction” and that most of my laid off colleagues’ positions would be rehired for. Finally, when our new CTO was asked when the next round of layoffs would be he laughed. 
I would expect this kind of behavior from a start up struggling to raise series A funding, but not a public company. I’ll work for HomeAdvisor, not Angi."
562,Angi,Went corporate in the worst way possible,2021-06-24,1.0,Senior Software Developer,"* Nice new building with great facilities in the Denver/RiNo area.
* Good opportunities to work with a variety of cutting-edge technologies.","When I started at HomeAdvisor in 2015, it still very much felt like a startup. I was part of a wonderful team of developers who genuinely enjoyed each other's company and gelled well together. Needless to say, we were a highly effective and productive team.

Fast forward a couple of years to when HomeAdvisor merged with Angie's List, taking the company public, and things started to change. First off, they didn't offer shares to the employees (despite vague promises to do so). Instead, they gave RSUs that vested in 3 years, and even then, only after a lot of pressure from the employees. Then they started dropping company events because ""we had grown too much"" and restricting team expenditure (goodbye team building activities). Slowly, they stopped promoting people internally and started hiring managers who were results-driven and not relationship-driven. Everything became about the money, and good product ideas that served the network of professionals were dismissed because they could impact profits. Good, smart people began to feel like they didn't belong anymore and started to leave. Eventually, HomeAdvisor became a company that would turn to mass layoffs as a part of its business strategy and long-term (20+ year) employees would be pushed out because they ""couldn't keep up"". (I also think there might have been a push to get rid of people instead of paying out those RSUs, but that is unfounded speculation). 

Basically, HomeAdvisor became a ""me-first"" kind of company and not a place that rewards loyalty, hard work, or compassion. I do not recommend working at HomeAdvisor/Angi."

Layoffs without any input from the affected people's managers. Lies about why they are laying people off. If you are not from Handy and in New York, you are not included in any decisions.

- you're selling to a demographic that routinely lacks both education and professionalism. 
- the leads are recycled frequently so chances are you will be about the 30th individual to try to pitch them this questionable service. 
- although the work culture is fun frankly it reminded me of a middle school playground but for recent college graduates, lacks real leadership and structure with no HR accountability (if someone says something to you, about you, or others that should not be said in the workplace they don't care and wont acknowledge it, i saw this happen to a co worker of mine who was pretty much bullied out of her job cause her team was very clicky and almost tribal)."

Great earning potential.,It seemed like half of the contractors who sign up either fail the background check or don't actually have enough money in their accounts. Retention an be difficult because a lot of contractors don't listen very carefully when you explain how to use the service effectively Contractors are often difficult to talk to. The initial training (the first 2 weeks) is lacking (but the ongoing coaching of the managers more than makes up for this).

Great leadership is gone.
Lots of great development teams gone.
Lots of great and knowledgeable people are gone.
The current CEO couldn't get his previous company Handy working correctly but still decided to bring all his Handy minions over and incorporate the failed Handy model.
In addition, Engineering leadership has no idea what they are doing in trying to ""merge"" 3 companies into 1.
I also have no idea why leadership thinks phasing out all of QA is a good idea and is definitely scary for a ""technology"" company to be successful.

Lots of good people are now leaving on their own as well so Angi is a sinking ship!

First of all there is almost no career growth and no promotion opportunities, your average day is spent on never ending tech dept. 

Weird deadlines and no clear product map.

Angi ( Angie's List, Home Advisor, Service Town etc) been around over 20 years they still talking about tapping into $500 Billion market, which is a big bs, if a company like this with army of employees and resources hasn't tapped into that market in 20 years that means something is really really wrong with the company.

IAC recently appointed Oisin as the CEO who then fired all the product leadership made Angie's List and HomeAdvisor actually a revenue generating company, so a CEO who never made profit in his life and created his company with VC money comes and fires all the people who turned the company around, you get the idea... 

Guess what? Did Oisin fired anyone from Handy (from the company he created) ? Probably not... But then recently he fired another 40-50 people from engineering team, again probably nobody in Handy got fired.

That definitely is not the case. And when you do get one that’s high value, the response you get when you call the person is usually, “I can’t afford that” “or I never registered”. Most of the time, your leads you get have been called so many times that your the Angi number is blocked by the person of contact. 

You get blasted by your manager if you haven’t made a dial in 2 minutes, so don’t even bother getting up and going to the bathroom cause you’ll come back to 5 messages asking why you didn’t make a dial. You’ll get belittled during your morning and after lunch zoom meetings. 

The last thing is integrity. They don’t care about it one single bit. “Just don’t tell them that” is the response you get if you ask your manager a legit question. Or its “don’t give them a chance to ask anymore questions, just get them to sign”.

Working at this company for two years, I know how this company operates and they live in the grey area of what is legal. Morality has no place in this workplace. If you are flip flopping between singing up a cleaning lady who you know will fail for that 6th sale on the week to make an extra $800, you better believe you're going to do that. If you want to be ethical and sign up people the right way, you will make far less than those who sell their sole for this company. HA has the best legal team in the USA because they've been in a class action law suit since I began working there and they are still operating while contining to screw over half of the contractors they sign up.

 talented colleagues were let go with a two minutes long explanation). Even the 
 Dev managers did not know that their group members were laid off by the higher 
 up. First set of lay offs went on Product people and without explanation and the second set of lay offs went on developers and no prior notice. 
- Poor severance. One week salary for the every six months of work. People who got 
 laid off before two years, lost the employer contribution of 401k. 
- When the Higher ups were asked why this big lay offs, they said it was due to the path those devs were taking. All on a sudden all the devs were required a full-stack knowledge to succeed in the company. But their managers were giving them thumbs up on their path on the Role Success Docs. So, not only people who got laid off but also their managers had zero idea about the lay offs. 
- Random deadlines without any specific product direction which leads to 
 burnout on employees.
- cliche but worth mentioning that the salary is below market standard.

They are heavy-handed and just want us to do things the way Handy has been doing instead of trying to create a culture where good parts are taken from all three brands instead of forcing their culture onto all of us.

As a female, it took me constantly asking for a raise and a law in CO requiring females be paid equal to their male counterparts to finally earn what I was worth. The company has surveys that talk about employee satisfaction but they never really take any action on it and always wonder why people are leaving of their own accord but never ask unhappy employees what the company can do to make them stay.

What made the company great when I started has been taken (aka no more ""fun Fridays"" with food and drinks, no more Fedex Fridays where people got to work on something that interested them).

Leadership lies at an all hands meeting, and ignores tough questions at this same meeting. The CEO was AWOL at this

Deadlines are chosen like a game of darts on a calendar and no one is rewarded for actually meeting the outrageous deadline that was decided.

There are surprise layoffs that seem to strategically happen before financial events like company earnings, employee stock vestings, the annual bonus review, etc. To which leadership will say those who were let go were ""low performers"", they were not. Often times managers are also left out of these discussions and are just as surprised as the employees are.

638,Angi,Honestly A Disaster,2021-05-21,2.0,Sales Representative,Work from home I guess.,"Everything. It’s like going to preschool all over again. You call people who have been called over and over for the last 15 years. Hot leads go to favorites while newbies never get a fighting chance. All I can say is get in and get out. Keep your sanity and don’t let them under your skin. Ive been here for half a year and its a dark place where they hang your job over your head. It’s all about a fake positive mental attitude. They want you smile when you get cursed out by people who have been with us and lost a lot of money. The training is 2 days of teaching you how to call and then they expect you to call 300 people a day. Then when you are on your team, they they expect you to know all this new info that would take you months of training. It works the same way for the contractors. Some get hot leads and most get fake burnt leads. Everyone knows this should not go on. But watch now they change the name to Angi and its like it never happened. SHAME!"

I was late one day, she took me in a room, was completely unprofessional. Then she took my file to her director, I was fired for making inflammatory remarks, told I was ineligible for rehire. 

Unbeknownst to me, she was fired for EXACTLY what I stated in our 1 on 1 AND I'm still ineligible for rehire.

A year or so later, I received about 150 in settlement checks. I had no idea what they were for at first so I cashed them. Wish I wouldn't have and I would have called the lawyer.

You’re not allowed to use your own knowledge to sell. The leads are extremely bad, they all have been called numerous times which some people even called it harassment. My advice is to AVOID working here, they are sketchy, misleading and don’t care about their employees. If you have questions at all they never answer them, they just dance around it.

707,Angi,"The most unethical, immoral company I’ve ever worked for",2021-04-05,1.0,Sales Representative,"The only “pro” about this unethical company is the flexibility to work from home. Other than that, there’s nothing worth raving about.","You’re trained to lie to the contractors you’re calling; and taught to “keep going” until they hang up the phone. I’ve never seen a script as long as HA provides, with expectations to make 3-sales per week. You can’t guarantee the lead quality that these innocent contractors would receive if they sign up. You are taught to be aggressive, even making upwards of 18 attempts to gather someone’s credit card information. When they say no, you STILL have to push through. By the time they budge to give you their card information, you’ve already gotten to a voice-log, agreeing to run their card. You run it right away and so long as they pass the background check, they don’t have a chance to process what just happened. They can’t get their $280 back, so now they’re out the money, whether they decide to stay or go. The lead quality is HORRIBLE. They provided “leads” with no company name, no location, no “PWC (Primary Work Category), so when you call, you look like you’re trying to scam them from the beginning, because you have no legitimate information to provide as to why you’re calling. They had us calling companies up north that did pool work, yet there was 3 feet of snow. And, the leads they have you input for training, do not end up in a test lead pile, they actually get called! I got a call from HA, after I resigned, which was a test lead that we created for training. It’s a joke and scam. They’ve change their name multiple times and still operate under their former name, “Service Magic” which is on all of their platforms, but now they’re known as Home Advisor. Do your research before you join a company that mandates you lie to these people, to make a sale. Management will tell you they made upwards of $200k/year, but only stayed in the Sales role for a short time...seems like they just weren’t successful in their role. Why would someone who was successful, leave such a high-paying position? Makes no sense. Sales is one thing, but scamming someone is another. I didn’t believe in working for a company that was misleading, knowing I was signing someone up for bogus lead quality. There’s no culture, no values, and no morals. This is only for those that believe making a paycheck puts them to sleep at night."

There was very little engagement among my team, and the company as a whole greatly lacks communication. There needs to be accountability for members of the sales team and what they are saying to pros just to close a sale. Metrics are strict and tough, especially with such low company morale and little motivation. The sales team will mislead pros on the pricing and billing of HomeAdvisor and use high pressure rhetoric to get these guys to spend their last dollar.

How they don't have a litany of class action lawsuits following them is beyond me. I overlooked the negative reviews when accepting my offer, knowing that normally, negative reviews are written by disgruntled ex-employees. In hindsight, they were spot on. And I can safely say that the positive reviews are from employees that will say anything to potential contractors to get their business. If you can wake up and look in the mirror with confidence while working at HomeAdvisor, you must be morally destitute."

In a job where your only task is to dial the phone as many times as possible and sell as many annual subscriptions as possible, the people there were what lifted my spirits and made the day worthwhile.","When COVID took its toll and HA had to go remote, it became a very tedious job. While still possible to make good money remotely, it is tough for most to buckle down and make hundreds of cold calls in a day while alone at home.

751,Angi,Fun but bad,2021-03-10,3.0,Sales Associate,The people who work there are amazing,Literally all it is is cold calling. Purely based on luck/ good timing and you lose or miss out on commission for things outside of your control.

They also give many opportunities to win random prizes like extra PTO, gift cards, etc.",The job itself can almost be unbearable most of the time. You make 150-200 calls daily and only actually have a conversation with maybe 5-10 people if you’re lucky. Out of those 5-10 people 1-2 may stay on the phone for longer than 5 minutes and be a close when cold calling. The people you are calling are nearly all cold calls and after hearing where you’re calling from 9/10 hangup immediately or talk very poorly towards you. Absolutely do not take this job unless you are an unbearably positive person because the position will definitely humble you if not.
757,Angi,Excellent,2021-03-08,3.0,Sales Consultant,You can earn good money if you work like a crazy person,"The job is difficult, and the product you sell will probably end up hurting more people than helping. WFH makes the job a lot lonelier, and tougher"
758,Angi,Just dont...,2021-03-08,1.0,Inside Sales Representative,If you're willing to do anything to make money there is a small chance you will make good money,Your job is to cold-call hundreds of contractors a day to talk over them about how they need HomeAdvisor to make money. You don't learn anything about who they are or their business. Your managers tell you everyone needs HomeAdvisor these days to make money as a contractor. They don't. I have talked with many contractors personally and they don't need the help. Morally I wasn't able to stay more than a few months at this place.

760,Angi,Home Advisor scammed me to scam me some more.,2021-03-08,1.0,Independent Contractor,One good thing I can say is most of their representatives are nice. Not all. Some are argumentative.,"An agent from home advisor called me and promised me I would get lots of work right away. I fell for it. I signed up. I received one paying customer and later a bill that was 2 times the amount of what I made from one customer so I canceled. They offered me a so called better deal so I fell for it again. The second time around I got no customers at all and received a bill for over 600.0 dollars. I called to remind them once again that im doing this to make money not lose money. The associate argued perfucely that I owed the 600.0 plus amount because they gave me a second chance and lots of leads. The leads are according to the records the associate could see in his computer screen. I told him that he may see that they sent me allot of leads but when I signed up they promised me I would only get charged if I make money from the customer after meeting them. This is how sales convinced me to sign up with home advisor. Now they're telling me I owe them for all the leads they sent me when I have only met one customer for one 30.0 lead. Now I owe over 600.0 for the ""leads"" after they lied to me and I really only met one customer. I've lost 500.0 with Home Advisor so far."

This is a sales job anytime starting a role in sales its an investment in ones self. these individuals who make reviews being at the company for a few months are just like the contractors who say its a scam. Honestly that's just illogical, by writing something like that I have to question the intelligence of an Individual who can submit a review that says something like that, essentially what they're implying is that the SEC is allowing a US based company that is publicly traded to run a scam! What I think is more likely is that sales probably isn't for that certain individual they had contractors tell them its a scam or that our reviews our terrible, they looked them up and believed everything the saw and were unable to hold a conversation with a business because they do not think the product works, that would make it pretty hard to sell no?"
794,Angi,"Good experience overall, hard to sell when people genuinely don't want it",2021-02-24,2.0,Sales Consultant,There are a lot of cool people that help you out. Very team oriented,You are trying to sell something that nobody wants to people that have been called a thousand times.
795,Angi,Run away,2021-02-24,1.0,Sales Consultant,"- Came in with a training class of a lot of people my age that I connected well with 
- I was very lucky in having a very supportive manager, director and teammates who genuinely wanted to see me succeed
- Cold-Calling will teach you how to deal with all different types of people, and when you are interviewing for a new job many recruiters (within the tech realm) understand 1000% why you want to leave HomeAdvisor
- Variety of contests and incentives if you are making sales
- Once 5:30 hits you are able to shut your computer down and not have to worry about checking anything work related","- You are a glorified telemarketer calling the same recycled leads that have been in the system for years in hopes that the day you call them will be the day they magically decide to sign up
- In training they literally try to explain to you why you're ""not"" a telemarketer even though you are
- The base salary is a literal joke
- HomeAdvisor is one of the only sales organizations I can think of where you are responsible for every single step of the sales practice
- Making sales became harder and harder as the company is way too focused on hiring new reps, thus spreading genuine good leads thinner, versus retaining top talent
- As a result, only way to be truly successful is if you put in tons of time off the clock to prospect your own accounts
- Deceptive management
- The sales practices entail you essentially lying to and avoiding telling the contractors you speak with the full details
- The job is mentally draining beyond belief and I legitimately dreaded waking up for work every single day
- The only way to truly be successful is by A: Sipping the HomeAdvisor Kool-Aid or B: Being okay with committing unethical sales practices
- Even if it is a contractor’s last $100 they have you are still supposed to push them to make a sale
- Totally mislead in the interview process that making large amounts of $$$ was easily obtainable
- Little to no resources in place to ensure that employees are doing okay mentally, as this is a job that takes a huge tole on you
- Little to no opportunity for professional development, which is also another thing they mislead you on in the interview process
- Calling close to 300 contractors on a daily basis in hopes 4-5 of them will actually want to have a conversation with you"

Very unprofessional work environment (cool at first being out of college but gets old real fast)

PRESSURE is applied from the director to the manager to the reps. Sales are more important than anything and the morality of the company really is up for questioning at this point.

832,Angi,Tough,2021-02-04,2.0,Sales Consultant,Fun people on sales team to work with and playful environment.,Long hours of cold calling and rejection. Classic telemarketing sales.
833,Angi,Worst job I've taken,2021-02-04,1.0,Former Sales Representative,Work from home and that's about it honestly,I can't even begin to describe what this job is like. This whole company feels like a major scam as we bombard our clients with phone calls nonstop. Extremely unethical selling techniques that I have not seen in any sales job I've worked.  You are making 150-300 calls a day and every time a client picks up they hate you and the company. This job is soul sucking and it's clear that all the managers watched wolf of wall street once and decided that's what they want to be.
834,Angi,Horrible talent acquisition Culture,2021-02-03,1.0,Recruiter,A lot of good people in the organization that are hard working good people.,"The Corporate TA leadership is extremely toxic and has favorites that are pretty obvious. They have successfully created a culture where the team is constantly in fear of their jobs if the recruiter doesn't source the way they are told to source.

This isn't a recruiting job where you build relationships, it's all about the numbers.  The Corporate TA leadership doesn't take the time to know anything about you except how many candidates are you sourcing per day. The leadership implemented a tool that records all of your recruiter phone screens. With the level of  micromanagement going on there, you can only guess why they want every call recorded.

Besides the leadership, the team is full of great people that work their tails off day and night trying to deliver for their customers!"
835,Angi,"Disappointing, toxic environment and culture. Pick literally any other tech company.",2021-02-03,2.0,Director,"Profitable, stable org. So much potential, if leadership could operationally deliver on the organization's stated vision.","Toxic leadership group that actively participates in closed-door gossip sessions about employees, peers, and C suite.

Poor working relationships between leaders in the major tiers of the organization is a constant issue. Product leadership conflicts constantly with development leadership. Enterprise IT, and infrastructure teams conflict with development at fundamental levels, with the bare minimum of cooperation.

Improper/unprofessional ethical practices when terminating employees.

Vision changes constantly. Blame culture consistently perpetuated from the top down constantly counters the stated vision.

Lack of operational capabilities within the leadership team has made progress on the organization's stated vision completely stagnant.

Stagnant technology due to fear-based, blame culture.

Pay across all non-leadership positions does not meet the existing market.
 
Self-described as a technology company, the existing org is no more than an e-commerce company that values profit and existing revenue generation over innovation. 

Those that value technical direction and support of that direction from leadership will struggle here."

850,Angi,Know What You’re Getting Into,2021-01-27,2.0,Inside Sales Representative,100% remote. Rare base salary in a sales/commission job. Fun and uplifting culture and trainers. Growth potential if you stick around long enough. PTO during the holiday was pretty incredible. Great job for you only if you are naturally aggressive and thick-skinned.,"Okay, tea time. This is where it got weird for me. I gave this job a shot just to gain some sales experience, to stay busy, get off unemployment, and make a few dollars during COVID. I got to about week 4 of “Training” before I found a much better job and career path for myself having just graduated and started my career. After 4 weeks of spending 10 hours a day with these trainers who pretended to be your best friends, gave constant motivational speeches, encouragement, getting to know you as an individual, all turned out to be smoke and mirrors. Their bulletproof positivity was borderline cult-like and was so obviously forced by upper management to keep us dialing. When you leave this position, they treat you just how they have us treat the contractors we harass all day. “Oh he’s not making money for us anymore? Forget he ever existed.” As soon as I emailed my trainers notifying them of my new job and GENUINELY thanking them for their time, energy, training, and experience I was immediately removed from the system and never heard from anybody at HomeAdvisor ever again. No “Goodbye!” No “Good Luck!” No “We’ll miss you!” The only people I heard from were my coworkers who found me on Linkedin asking if everything was okay. Other than that, the only people I heard from were a third party company scheduling a visit to pick up the tech equipment I was supplied with. Other comments I can make about HA is that the demographic they recruit for a cold-calling sales role is so blatantly people down on their luck and desperate. College students who cant find a job, middle aged adults who lost their job, gullible individuals who genuinely were convinced that they would make 6 figures from a remote cold calling position. You can also easily question the ethics of the subscription we are trying to force small business contractors to sign up for. A contractor will literally say “COVID put me out of business this is my last $300 I need to feed my family with it”and the trainer in your ear will lie and tell you to say “We just need a card to put on file.” And after hearing trainers CONSTANTLY say to us reps “At the end of the day YOUR wallet is more important than their’s.” I truly believe the endless testimonies and bad reviews from contractors saying how HomeAdvisor took thousands of dollars of their’s without adding any value to their business. HomeAdvisor will charge 15 different contractors for the same lead when only 1 contractor gets that job. There are also many leads that are either fake or old, so all HA has to do is simply press a button and basically print their own money not caring that they are destroying small businesses of contractors who don’t know what they signed up for. It was just a total rollercoaster of an experience and I’m just glad I got out when I did. I could go on all day about it but my advice if you are thinking about trying it out is to not be afraid to stop if it starts to feel wrong or not for you. SOME people do really well there, I have seen it myself and you DO learn a lot. Just keep in mind that you are not as special as they try to make you feel and you are replaceable."

An absolute nightmare of a job. It's not sales at all! Your tile will be a ""Sales Consultant"". In reality, it should be called a ""Telemarketer Scammer"". Anyways, let's start with their so-called ""training""- when the brainwashing begins. Your trainers will talk about how they all made six figures and how they are the best when in reality they made six figures by using deceptive/scam sales tactics. Furthermore, you need 4 sales to ""graduate"" from training. I was put in the most uncomfortable/unethical situation during my career where a trainer was pretty much telling me to yell at a lady to get to sign up. The trainer kept telling me to call her and be rude to get her to sign up. The service provider couldn't believe how she was being treated. I had no choice but to listen to my trainer. Then you get put on a team once you graduate and then you really learn what the company/product is about. You're pretty much lying to contractors about the product and how you have ""tons"" of work for them in their area that you immediately to find a contractor for. Even if there is no work in their area you're still supposed to push through with the call. Your taught to just rush through a deceptive script and do anything to get these contractors' credit cards on file. That is where this job crossed the line with me ethically. And then they expect you to retain these contractors which is impossible because you rushed through a deceptive script and the contractor didn't know what they signed up for. Then the contractor calls the sales rep that signed them up and they yell at you because once again you're taught to lie during the sales call and not actually explain the product. Once you stop selling is when management is on your a** about why your numbers down. They don't actually care about the employee they just care about you making your manager money. It seriously felt like a cult and they make it seem like your helping small businesses make money in reality your just straight up screwing them over. It makes you feel like a scammer but once again management makes it seems like it's okay and everything is all good and it's the contractor's fault for not using the product correctly. In addition, you're calling washed up leads that have been called numerous times by different reps. You get cussed out by contractors but you're still taught to keep pushing through the sale. I overheard numerous reps just straight up yelling at contractors and belittling them because they didn't want to sign up. The money I made felt like dirty money."

You’re surrounded by smart people who inspire you to be better. There’s often an unspoken competition, but in way that usually benefits everyone. As a whole, leadership shows care and respect for their employees, and tries to create a welcoming and fun work atmosphere.","The Product Managers are generally stretched too thin to be too effective in their role. The life of a PM is notoriously hectic, but it seems compounded at Angie’s List. A more robust Prod-Tech department with a better distribution of duties would allow PMs to focus on creating better user experiences - rather than juggling everything at once."

- Simple product to learn and coach to.
- Flexible schedule and used to be a fun environment.
- Unlimited earning potential","- What was once the Golden office has now been shuffled into the Kansas City office. Not much opportunity for Colorado employees under the new regime, as naturally management has better relationships with those who they’ve worked with for years.
- Your long-term success is a dice roll as to which team you end up on, as many managers are disinterested in their job/team or ill-equipped to develop talent.
- This is a very entry-level, inexpensive, point-of-sale transaction. Your accomplishments here hold little weight in the real sales world. Get your 1-1.5 years in, learn what you can and get out. This is a solid “first job”, not an actual “career opportunity”, so don’t get trapped in the decent comp plan and relaxed work environment and end up making cold calls  to contractors for the next 10 years if you truly wish to have a reputable career."

955,Angi,Toxic is an understatement,2020-12-03,1.0,Sales Associate,I met cool people that I hope will one day SOON get out ASAP,"This place is toxic. There is a HUGE drug and alcohol problem in the office there both in management and in reps. The managers simply do not care at all about you unless you’re making them money. Will yell at you over zoom calls and make you feel like absolute garbage as a way to “pump you up” and if you have a problem with something that was said to you they will be so quick to call you emotional or not tough enough for the job and manipulate you. The managers will tell you that you’re like family and that everyone is like family and then talk about you behind your backs to the other reps on your team. Unprofessional business practices is an understatement. They will cover up fraud that happens with the reps if it’s making them money. The program isn’t even profitable for the consumer. 
They tell you they believe in you and then the SECOND you’re struggling will not care about you because you’ve stopped making them money. 
I beg anyone and everyone do NOT work in the Chicago office. It is the most toxic work environment I’ve ever been in and I’ve seen so many people turn into complete monsters because of that office. There is no culture like they promote. It’s a favorites game until you’re pushed out and ostracized to the point of wanting to quit. Because they won’t fire you, they’ll make you quit or not give you a good review if anyone tries to call them for a recommendation. 
I cannot stress this enough. DO. NOT. WORK. THERE. Worst job I’ve ever had and I’ve told my new manager some of the things that went down there and they were shocked. No job is better than working for HomeAdvisor. Don’t waste your time. They need to go out of business."

958,Angi,THE MOST UNETHICAL COMPANY TO WORK FOR,2020-11-30,1.0,Sales Consultant,The teams are supportive and offer moral boost when you go weeks without a sale.,"First off they hire there reps without outlining there is a class action lawsuit against the sales department of HomeAdvisor and they do this because of the following: 
The practices the company teaches their reps are borderline illegal and very unethical. 
Constantly are calling people on the National Do Not Call registry which is very illegal. 
The advise passed down from the management is to close the sale even when there is no benefit for the customer.
Selling to people that cannot afford the product and are uneducated about how the service works.
Constantly preached to do one call closes otherwise the customer will realize the product is a SCAM.
The sales force targets service professionals that are borderline bankrupt or NOT service professionals at all.
The company is growing their salesforce at an extreme level which is bringing every reps sales down across the board, which with the ridiculously low commision structure you will be lucky to add $400 on to your paycheck ever! 
Constantly calling leads that go nowhere, ex. leads pulled from facebook, yelp, and other sources that do not offer concrete information or even active #'s.
When calling leads, more often than not they will scream at you for being the 15th person to call them in a 2 week time frame from HomeAdvisor. (clearly harassment)
The management team when asked about what the repercussions are for calling people over and over about the service they clearly stated they ""DO NOT WANT"" is they would laugh and say ""HomeAdvisor is to large of a company to have repercussions, because our legal team would take care of it"" 

The list of unethical behavior within this company is sickening and it felt like a major weight lifted off my shoulders when I left. So if you feel like HomeAdvisor is your next career path ask yourself do I want to make NO money and be taught unethical sales techniques or should I pass? Always pass!"

Fun sales incentives, eg travel vouchers.","Employee turnover is off the charts — only 15% of team has been at AL >1 year.

Managers can spend nearly an entire day interviewing your potential replacements (this happens approx. 1 day/week). Thus, they are unavailable to assist their current team at least 20% of the time. 

Performance enhancement plans are unforgiving, asking you to deliver the same (or more) in sales without receiving high value leads (which account for ~80% of the deals closed at AL). 

Expectations are not adjusted to reflect weeks shortened by major holidays - eg Thanksgiving, Christmas, etc - making the end of the year an especially stressful time.

Base pay is uncompetitive at $14/hr.

966,Angi,Abusive Relationship,2020-11-23,1.0,Sales Associate,Paid training is the only Pro,"This is one of the most low-key abusive environments I've ever been in. The training course can be incredibly abusive to people who don't meet the ""popularity"" standard.

I worked incredibly hard. I even continued working incredibly hard when I heard managers speaking negatively of me within earshot and in front of others.

I met the standard quota to be hired but the manager decided to disqualify one of my sales because he simply didn't like me.

I think I didn't make the hotness standard for a single mom.

During the training process I witnessed people so stressed out that they almost didn't make it and some of them turned to anti-anxiety medications to alleviate the stress.

This place comes off like your best friend but quickly turns, again if you don't meet some sort of social acceptance standard. It really isn't about your skills or how hard you work.

I think their product is an excellent product, but a lot of their managers don't have any respect for contractors. One of my trainers actually told me that he thought contractors were stupid and that I needed to treat them like they're stupid in order to sell to them.

They need to cater more to the contractors who really are their customers, than they need to cater to the people who are the customers of contractors. 

I was really pushed to sell sell sell at any cost to the customer."

- They provide a computer for work from home","- Not diverse at all. I worked in the office for a few months before WFH and the opportunities for people of color in sales and management were non-existent. I worked at a similar Fortune 500 company (in the same building and floor) that strived to be inclusive and it was clear that HomeAdvisor does not aim to be a diverse work environment.
- There are no monthly quotas but you are expected to make 3 sales each week. If you don't meet the weekly expectation over 2 weeks you are put on a performance plan.
- Health benefits aren't active until you are 90 days in the job
- Can't take paid time off (that you earn) until you are 6 months into the job, so if you are sick or need time off it has to be unpaid time off. 
- You are expected to manage accounts after the sale, without any training on what to do post-sale. Managers don't provide the knowledge to improve in this aspect. 
- Customer care team is useless
- Product overall does not benefit the client at all and many small business owners go into debt
- Managers will push you to make a sale with prospects that will not even reap a benefit from the program. After the sale is done with these types of prospects, we are told to ignore the account until they cancel."
986,Angi,Not for everyone (an honest review),2020-10-26,3.0,Sales Representative,"Great team culture, your team will hype you up if you're in a slump and you're probably going to be placed on a team that has people similar to your personality. It's a young company and you have the opportunity to make lasting friendships with your coworkers. That said, it sometimes feels like greek life 2.0 and just a general party atmosphere on the floor. A lot of people still seem to be in the college mindset and it can be exhausting to deal with at times if you're more of a professional person. Commission is worth it when you make it. Your direct manager will usually help you out with 1 on 1 time if you show them that you're willing to perform. Not a bad job to have out of college, and if you make it to your year mark you're probably making at least 50k+. People who succeed are consistently recognized and lauded for their achievements, sales contests every week typically based on raffle so low/mid performing reps can win too. Benefits are great. The company IS rapidly expanding and if you're good at what you do you'll be fast tracked for management, usually within 1-1.5 years.","High pressure and stressful work requirements. As other people have said, you're expected to call at least 150 contractors a day. More likely than not you're doing even more than that due to the nature of the clients you're selling to. If you aren't steamrolling over objections you probably aren't going to be successful. Frequently receive supposedly hot leads, only to be hung up on as soon as you say the name of the company or chewed out for calling them. There's nothing quite like working for a degree only to be told by someone who barely graduated high school that you suck because of the company you chose to work for. Product does not work for everyone, only about half are actually competent enough to be truly successful, but due to pressure to make numbers you have to put your morals on hold and still sell to these clients. Really hard to believe in the product you're selling when you know that it won't be a good fit for someone. Everything just seems a little sketchy, there's a ""not technically illegal"" type of feeling that you get from what you're doing. They will tell you that top reps make 100k+ which is definitely true, but the staggeringly high turnover rate should tell you enough about that. Most people I started with quit within the first 6 months due to the nature of the work and product. Extremely political for advancement and even if you have the numbers it won't mean anything unless you know the right people."

Have you ever watched a MLM ""team call?"" If not, I encourage you to before joining HomeAdvisor. The structures are very very very similar. They have ""team calls"" to help ""pump"" you up by throwing all these top sales rep's numbers in your face. It's a MLM. They stress how you will make six figures as long as you come in every day with a ""positive mental attitude"" and ""only get one sale a day."" Mind you, you are calling hardworking small business contractors who have put everything into their business to try to sell them ""leads."" Sure, some people do well on the site but the majority don't. I was encouraged to lie, stretch the truth and was constantly ignored by my manager when I was trying to help out the contractors that trusted me. I would feel so GUILTY at night and even after getting a sale. I would ask myself ""Did they know what they even just signed up for? I ran through the script...I should be ok, right?"" That should NEVER be how a sales process is. I'm a sales professional, and if that's what you want to be, do NOT join this company. You are a telemarketer pushing for ""one call closes"" and also have to make 200+ dials a day and required to have 3+ hours of talk time otherwise you are ridiculed by your manager saying you didn't try. These contractors/businesses have been in the HA CRM and have been called OVER and OVER. If you're lucky, you might find someone who hasn't heard the pitch yet who is easily swayed. 9 times out of 10, people are going to cuss you out or hang up before you even saying where you're calling from. It's a joke. There is a HORRIBLE work life balance. They'd say ""we TECHNICALLY can't ask you to work off the clock, but we won't say no because you want to make six figures right???"" 

I was laid off due to COVID prior to working at HomeAdvisor and HA came to me saying how successful I'd be and how much they believed in me (they tell that to everyone). I was excited and quite frankly, was told this fake story of how I'll be able to get back on track and make all of this money. They blast their ""friendly culture"" in your face when in reality, you are just a number. They genuinely don't care about you unless you're bringing in a lot of money. I was exhausted mentally and emotionally every single day. When I finally was able to find another job, I sent a formal letter of resignation to my manager. Guess what.....I NEVER got an email back from him. I never got even a ""Sorry to see you go, I wish you luck"" NOTHING. They do not care about you once you're gone. You are easily replaceable. Please PLEASE find a company that values you and wants to help you build your sales skills. This is not the place, unless you don't mind just reading off a script and if you like lying to small business owners."

My coworkers were nice and there are a good amount of managers that do care about you as a person.","This company is disorganized, fraudulent and dishonest from the top down. The culture at home advisor is grind, lie, talk to your co-workers about how you have to lie to yourself about the product you are selling so that you don't go home every day feeling guilty about deceiving your customers. Regular drug use by sales people even on zoom calls. Empty promises and threats unless you don't sell you are gone (it's a sales job so that is normal). Before covid people would be caught having sex in the basement of the office and HR would have to have regular meetings with people about rampant sexual herrasment. They target people straight out of college because they don't know any better and single moms who they know if they survive it will be hard for them to leave. I say these things because they are true patterns that everyone talks about if you work there for more than 6 months. The product is flawed to the point of a class action lawsuits but their excuse is ""no product is perfect"". So if you are ok with living through this every day, this might be the place for you. If you would rather not waste your time I would recommend looking somewhere else. If you don't believe me check out their BBB page."

Not only responsible for hitting sales metrics daily, but also being customer care for the members you sign up for their first month. They encourage you to create a text now number so leads can contact you whenever. Often times calls can go long into lunch, and you don't get that time back. The leads are all beat to death dead. Not unusual to receive threats from the leads you call. There is also a 50/50 chance that any sale you make will not go through, you could potentially submit 3 accounts they can be denied and you will end up with 0 sales on the week. You're then treated as if you've done no work on the week. Ridiculously high stress job, especially if you're placed on a failing team.

You will be hearing a dial tone or talking to someone the entire day. Many more dial tones than actual conversations.
- You will be calling people who have already been asked to be put on the ""do not call list"" several times before you. You will encounter many contractors who have a lot of negative things to say about HomeAdvisor. 
- There is a lawsuit currently pending where a conglomeration of contractors have bonded together to sue HomeAdvisor for selling fake leads. 
- Training managers are more like ""whip crackers"" than trainers. They are there to keep you motivated and to keep you in the mindset of ""DIAL DIAL DIAL!!!""
- You will have ""games"" to play to try to take your mind off of the monotony of intense cold calling. These games are designed to keep your ""activity"" levels up. You will hear metrics like ""pitch counts"" and other things to keep you dialing and believing that you doing the right thing.
- The leads are recycled. Which means you will be calling people who have already talked to 7 or 8 HomeAdvisor sales people before you and said they were not interested.
- You will be encouraged to sell leads to contractors that may or may not exist. 
- The contractors often do not need to pay for leads because their businesses are doing great on their own, and yet you will be encouraged to sell to them regardless of whether they truly need HomeAdvisor or not.
- The leads are awful. I was given 100 fax numbers ""by accident"" or so they said.
- ""Early graduation"" is actually graduation. If you don't make early graduation, you essentially are given another two weeks to make a couple more sales off the bottom of the barrel leads they give you. Otherwise you are fired there on the spot after 6 weeks.
- They hire 30 plus people a month with idea that not all will ""graduate"". So if you think they care about your growth as a salesperson, think again.
- You will be asking for vital information like SSN and CC info during your first conversation with the contractor. They inherently will have distrust in this and it will be a very difficult close to make seeing as there is little proof that we are who we say we are on the phone.
- The pay is basically minimum wage and then if you are lucky, SOME commission on top. The commission structure is largely a pipe dream."

You’ll be told to lie to customers. It’s a “hang up or sign up policy” and if you let them off the phone, no matter how many times they say they’re busy or not interested, you’ll be punished. For example, if they say multiple times “I have to let you go, I’m walking into an appointment” you’re supposed to ignore them and keep talking. So basically, every time you’re ending a call, they’re angrily yelling and then hanging up on you.

They trick people into signing a verbal contract that the prospect never gets a copy of.  A lot of these contractors that they’re calling speak English as a second language.

Never got any one on one role play with my trainers before being thrown on the phones. 

Co-workers made jokes about contractors who had deaths in their families. 

FYI, pretty sure it’s not legal to avoid saying what company you’re with when you call! 

When I tried to quit I got ghosted by my trainers and never was connected to HR like I requested. When I emailed HR, they never contacted me back.  

They call people who have asked to be put on the “do not call” list.

They drastically lie about the commission you’re able to make. 

It’s the most negative and toxic work environment I’ve ever been apart of. I quit very soon after being hired. Nobody mentioned the law suit when I got hired or after, even though part of the reason they’re getting sued is due to the actions of the sales teams. 

Was basically told to bully people into going with home advisor. I’ve done phone sales before, so I know how it’s supposed to be, this ain’t it."

2. You will probably find your next hook up
3. You might make $100K if you're at the very top, but top performers at other companies make $500K+....","If I could give this company zero stars, I would. The first word that comes to mind is TOXIC. I was shocked to even find that a company like this could exist and/or function. I know people always say “take Glassdoor reviews with a grain of salt”, but 99% of the reviews on here hold truth and I have seen it time and time again. Yes, there are lots of drugs and drinking on the job. Yes, the sales role is impossibly hard and you don’t even get rewarded enough for your grind (probably why turnover is so high during the first few months of employment). Yes, you are micromanaged. I have seen emails sent out to the team reprimanding people for leaving to get lunch at 11:59 instead of 12 and you will be put on a performance plan if you are even a few minutes late more than once. Yes, they lie about earning potential. Yes, you get bad leads that have been called 100+ times. Yes, sales employees spend their breaks searching for other jobs. Yes, HomeAdvisor is terrible to its “clients”. Yes, they force people into collections from selling them something the client doesn’t fully understand and can't truly afford. Yes, sales consultants are coached to lie. In fact, females are coached to flirt with contractors to close a sale. The only reason people stay is to make friends and party together. It’s also very incestuous; a lot of employees sleep with each other. I did not graduate college and start building my career to work in a fraternity house (where, by the way, you don’t even have access to the “cool slide” they advertise). HR is also incompetent and aware of illegal things going on within the office and on teams yet chooses to turn a blind eye because that's the ""culture"". I was horrified on a daily basis. I worked on a close team and still cried regularly at the lack of respect and lack of ethics within those four walls. Leadership also made it VERY clear that every employee there is disposable and they would be happy to replace you any day (which is business, I know, but they don't have to make you feel like dirt). 

Everyone at HomeAdvisor is cookie cutter – there is no diversity and discrimination is rampant. No, it's not unconscious either. They only hire people that fit into their mold of young, fun, and naive. There is no room for opinions or questions when it does not align with top leadership (who are barely 30yo) and their “vision”, so you must silence yourself and be miserable OR you can speak up when you believe changes are not for the benefit of your team/department/the company and risk being dragged through the mud and made to feel incompetent. The best leaders I have worked with welcome divergent experiences and opinions, yet this is viewed extremely negatively at HomeAdvisor. Leadership wants soldiers they can command, boss around, micromanage, and demean because it drives revenue to fill their pockets. They need to stop promoting young, insecure leaders who only want a ""yes man"". While top performers and hard workers have been given job promotions and fancy titles, they are not equipped with the tools nor do they have the experience to run a large department in business; instead, they run it like a factory. Employees are treated like they’re objects on an assembly line with a barcode; there is no empathy for others. I have never been so disrespected or invalidated by a group of people in my whole life, all while giving the role my all. The company is in a very good place financially during COVID yet they are firing top performers and top management professionals to create an army of robots who can barely voice or utilize their own thoughts, ideas, and opinions. 

Sales employees don’t even have badge access to enter other departments in their own company’s HQ. They are not treated equally and never given opportunities to network cross-functionally. The ""earning potential"" for sales is non-existent - that was back in the day where a lot of illegal things were going on, but the company got sued and now there are no tricks that help people make $200K+. You have to grind to make their average of $60K, which you could easily get in a base salary somewhere else. If you actually like sales and are confident in your performance, you can make 3-4x what you’ll ever be able to make at HomeAdvisor. The skills you learn at HomeAdvisor are also not transferrable anywhere else – you are cold calling blue collar workers in a call center, not developing skills that will help your sales career. It will definitely give you tough skin, as contractors are notorious for being cruel and crude to sales consultants.

The day I quit was the best day I've had for years. The grass is MUCH greener on the other side. I wouldn’t want my worst enemy to work at HomeAdvisor and I would take anyone reading this as the red flag that you need to RUN. If I could share my experience to prevent anyone from ever accepting a job there again, I would. You will drive yourself insane and miserable with zero benefits other than maybe a new friend."

Co-workers and managers are cool.,They make it seem like you will make a ton of money in sales. You are calling leads from over a decade ago and spend most of your day listening to a dial tone and leaving voicemails for people that you will never reach. The product is terrible for contractors. They put in place multiple metrics to make it harder for you to get paid out on your weekly sales.

1090,Angi,Unpleasant job,2020-06-30,2.0,Sales Representative,"Pleasant coworkers. Offers free lunch, though they do not cater to people with dietary restrictions. Occasionally run incentive programs with rewards (gift cards, happy hours, etc.) for hitting weekly sales targets. Aetna medical coverage is pretty good.","Sales targets do not change to accommodate global economic issues (COVID-19). Opportunity to advance in the company is only based on overall sales effectiveness, not any soft-skills or past experience. Unprofessional behavior occurs often, and exceptions are made for individuals who perform at a high rate. ""Uncapped commission"" guidelines have multiple loopholes to get paid appropriately. Actions and decision making implemented by upper management is swift and often without considering the lasting consequences on employees' mental health or ability to do their job effectively. Inconsistent management across the sales center leads to bad practices on the sales floor."

1097,Angi,joke,2020-06-18,1.0,Sales Representative,you stand to make alot of money.,Youu are lied to in an effort to on-board. Leads being called have been called on every two months since 2017 and older in many cases. The training team is nothing more than glorified coaches who don't listen to you. Everyone on staff will talk to you like they are on the phone with you and they are trying to sell you. There is a huge problem with staff play favorites cause their wages are tied to your efforts.

We heard that we have a new logo and design. Why doesn’t the company send some new updated gear/swag to all employees? If you want a brand to be successful, employees are free advertisers of it"
1103,Angi,Solid Interview Process / Strong Engineering Org / Great Place to Work,2020-06-02,5.0,Engineering Team Lead,"Simple & Interview Process: 
1) Initial Call
2) Technical Phone Screen
3) On-site (Coding, Algorithms, Culture, Design, Behavioral)
4) Offer Letter
The company was ready and able to accommodate each step within 2-3 days of the previous one, but allowed me to take more time to prepare as needed. I had the onsite on a Friday afternoon and the offer was sent in writing by the following Wednesday.

Concise Onboarding / Ramp:
Unlike some of my previous roles, the onboarding was clear and organized. The DevOps team has built infrastructure that has made this entire process seamless. I was able to become productive and begin contributing to larger feature development within the first two sprints. 

Culture:
The people at Handy are some of the most dedicated and brilliant people I've met in my career, but beyond that -- they are simply great people to be around. Through our various events ranging from happy hours to game nights, I've come to know that Handy tends to hire interesting and fun people -- that also just happen to be at the top of their field.

Growth:
Product Engineering process is very data-driven and robust, which has allowed the company to scale and in turn providing many opportunities for new technology solutions and career growth. Many roles are to be filled from internal promotions rather than outside hires, which ensures that our engineers have room to grow not only their skills, but also their careers.","Learning Curve:
With many experienced engineers building complex features and an expansive ecosystem of microservices, there can be a tough learning curve at first when you join Handy -- but with the great support provided by the Engineering Org, this usually is not a problem.

Pace:
Since we are very data-driven and methodical with our Product Engineering approach, Handy is able to be very proactive about targeting & handling issues that will deter our continued growth. With the techniques and design approaches we employ, we strive to get outsized results with our limited time, which results in a slightly faster pace -- meaning that we tend to have a faster workflow around understanding the success of our experiments and can quickly pivot without spending too much, in case of any gaps. This might take some getting used to for engineers who have not experienced a similar process."

But I’m probably the 10,000th person to say that.","Unprofessional.  Everything here is done with 20% effort. Your job lacks responsibility. You don’t learn here. This essentially parallels Waitering, bartending, EMT, chef, fast food worker, cvs, 7/11, work without the pay and structured hours. Don’t be fooled, It’s an elementary school here. Walking in your thoughts are wow a great start to a hybrid Account Executive/Account management role. WRONG. No one will take responsibility nor accountability . They’ll pressure you because you don’t know any better. They use your job stability as a motivational tool. Doesn’t work. They use fear to get you to puppeteer for them. This isn’t a job for college graduates. Lack of depth in the industry. No learning. No professional development. A fake leadership program that doesn’t work. Don’t truly understand the needs and a wants in their industry. Open hiring shows there willing to take anyone. Bottom feeding until you stay there long enough. Churn and Burn. Pigeonholed is an understatement. This isn’t a job with limitless potential. This a time to be a part of making no difference and being part of corporate America. Lack of HR involvement. Always watch these companies, they harp on culture. What they do is mature you into thinking that it’s you. The whole time this company will tell you, “it’s a numbers game.” At which then what is your expectation? The faster you dial the faster you sell? Wrong. Your pigeonholed. You’re attached to your tenure. The rest of the reviews provide no honesty. The company doesn’t have core values. No HR presence. And a lackadaisical effort from upper management. At the end of the day, you make no difference. The short commission structure is to lure everyone in. Just like the service, they both don’t work. ANGI Homeservices is an umbrella of unregulated internet scams that provide no value to the world. These inventoryless companies have no overhead. For the money they pay you versus the amount that is made off of these people is disgusting. In the end this is basically an Multi Level Marketing scam (MLM scheme).  You’re selling an idea with no tangibility. They pay and what do they get."

- Very positive work life/team/culture, working with people who really care about the mission, who push each other to be better and do better
- Catered in meals and dinners daily to HQ office is incredible
- CEO self directs and leads the frequent All Hands meetings, I am always given opportunities to hear everything going on with the greater business
- Recruiting and Hiring process was faster than any other company I have worked with - they def hire the best people - but the bar is set high and the runway is short in the recruiting process (which is great but very challenging)

- We are better than all of our competitors. Makes it easier to sell and I'm proud to represent a leader in an industry.
- In the New York City branch, they pay for your lunch and dinner. Yup
-They do tons of raffles and giveaways. Many incentives for people to work harder.
- One of the best sales training programs around. They really know how to do it and have formed an excellent system.","- Retention amongst your ""sales class"" is garbage. Slowly... one by one.... you will see people from your training class leave. Some willingly some fired for poor performance.
- They straight up lie to you about the average amount a first year sales rep can make. Don't believe it. It is NOT $50-100k its more around 35K maybe 40k.
- Be prepared to dial numbers of people who told the last rep to stop calling them a week or two ago. But hey its a cold calling job, if you can't handle it then be a toll booth operator. 
- The service can really screw over a contractor. They can lose out on thousands since they won't win every project. Some contractors end up having success, but majority fall short and leave a bad review. This is why majority of our pitch is combating our sh*ty reviews. 
- They don't tell you how to prospect. They keep it a secret and it ultimately screws everyone over. If people knew how to prospect on their own, retention amongst employees would be higher, less people would be called repetitively and people would work harder.
-Their payment structure for multiple sales mixed with retention amongst existing clients is just a mess, it's inaccurate and majority of the time.. is out of your control. People will cancel on you and 99% of the time - it is HomeAdvisor's fault not yours."

It is so incredibly hard to change the minds of the 250+ contractors you’re calling. Contractors usually only stay with the company for 4-6 months and leave because it will drain their money. You are told to lie and ignore contractors feelings just to get their credit cards. If you want to succeed at this job you have to work overtime, study the company at home, and it’s ridiculous how much of your life they ask you to put in. Not worth it, it takes such a long time to make decent money. The turnover rate is so high and they sexism is real. Honestly, do not take this job right out from college or even if you’re desperate.

1156,Angi,Working at Angie's List/Home Advisor.,2020-02-23,2.0,Solutions Consultant,I was able to make decent money.,"It was definitely an experience working there. They expect very difficult sales goals to be attained. I actually made pretty good money while I was there.I never had a problem exceeding the sales quotas, but management is very young and inexperienced. The entire company was ran very poorly. Your job is constantly threatened. That seems to be the only strategy they believe in to motivate people. Being a recently retired Army Platoon Sergeant, and have had extensive leadership training and experience in motivating people to get positive results. I would try and suggest other ways of positively motivating the employees that were struggling, though they were stuck on doing things one way. My team worked well with each other, and we would depend on helping each other if someone was struggling, because management never seemed to be able or willing to help. Through my experience as a leader, I know that you don't get results by just threatening those who may be having a rough sales month etc. It does no good to kick people when they're down, rather than look for solutions to help them improve. But, hey, what do I know? Another thing is, I am 43 years old, and they never really liked my honesty and straightforwardness. It was always strange to me that they would put such intense pressure on employees, yet they would then want to sugarcoat things and found honesty to be offensive. They were bought out by Home Advisor while I was there. Although my job did not get cut, I eventually decided that it just wasn't the type of company I wanted to make a career at. I stayed for two and a half years before I moved on to better things for myself. I don't want to sound bitter about my experience, because I am not, I'm only giving my honest opinion for this review, based on my own experience. I chose to leave because it just wasn't for me. I could have stayed on under Home Advisor, but it was the exact same thing. I would like to say that I met and worked worked with some really great people there. I would just rate Angie's List, now Home Advisor, as being very poorly managed, with a lot of people in leadership positions with zero training or knowledge of acutual leadership, which results in poor results."

1167,Angi,100 percent cold call sales,2020-02-16,2.0,Sales Consultant,Almost everyone in the office is in their 20s with a handful of people in their 30s. They have free lunch everyday once you graduate from the training program and free beer 1 or 2 times a week. Most of the people who work there are nice. Occasional happy hours.,"All you do is make 200+ cold calls per day where you read off a script so although, your title will be ""Sales Consultant,"" you're more like a telemarketer. Out of those calls, only a few answer because these contractors get bombarded with calls by HA, Yelp, Houzz, Thumbtack and every other service that has a similar product.
The only way to sell it is to hard sell it which is why I wouldn't recommend taking this even as a first job out of school because in most sales jobs, hard selling would be seen as unprofessional, so you're not learning any applicable skills that you could use later. There's also a ton of horrible reviews about the product online including a class action law suit against the company for sending fake leads which makes it even harder to sell and a lot harder for reps to feel like they're not screwing people over by pressuring them into a product that doesn't work.
Management is varied with some good managers and some not so good managers so you just have to hope you get put on a good team. Base is only 30k and you won't make nearly as much as they say you will in the interview. PTO package is terrible because you don't start accruing PTO until month 3 and you can't start using it until month 6. 401k is only matched at 50 percent. Hours are 8:30-5:30. Most people, quit before a year but if you're not making at least 4 sales every 2 weeks, you go on a performance improvement plan (probably half of the employees have been on one) and you have a month to turn it around before they fire you."
1168,Angi,*Prospective Employee Beware*,2020-02-16,1.0,Client Success Manager,Benefits and that’s about it.,"Extremely high turnover in a department, up until 6 months ago, rarely lost anyone! Over 20 people since the president announced a $15K pay cut to base salaries bringing Senior reps to $40K and CS II reps to $30K. There is little to no chance in bonusing, the people who DO bonus do so because they work the system by withholding cancels and kicking the can down the  road. The company steals from its employees. Every time CS reps found ways to make something, senior leadership came back with yet another change to the comp and saying they wanted to pay only the top performers. The president even told a group of them that he wants to get to a head count and eluded to only the bottom performers are the ones leaving (this is completely false! There has been a LOT of tenured people who have left). It’s the antithesis of Disney Land - this place is the most miserable place on earth. I don’t believe the department will be around much longer. The majority of managers do not have the skill set to be managers and in most cases they rely on tenured reps to do their jobs for them which further means for those reps, even more work and no additional pay.  Angie should take a long hard look at this company.... IAC, HomeAdvisor and Jeremy Stewart are destroying her and Bill Oesterle’s legacy in Indianapolis."

First, after witnessing a company continuously steal and lie to its customers we are finally feeling the that same pain as employees.  We are given a two week heads up about having our pay cut by $15,000 and basically told that we have to deal with it.  

Our job duties have been lowered to collection reps and fighting off customer cancellations.  We are not paid on our skills or hard work or ethic we are paid on talking people off of the ledge of cancelling.  

The product itself is so broken that we have nothing to give our service providers to help them achieve a goal or any type of ROI on the investment that they make with us.  

The company has NO care for its customers or its employees.  If this seems like an attractive spot for you, then please apply.  My advice would be run as far from this place as possible.

1. So many situations where they are lied to by our sales department and nothing will be done. 

2. Other instances where they sold by a Spanish speaking sales rep, then get to a CSM that only speaks English and cannot be transferred to anyone else and we are told to tell them ""our website is English speaking"" and we have ""English speaking members"" so basically, figure it out.  

3. Our books went from being around 200 customers to almost 500 overnight and we cannot keep up.  Service Pros are getting terrible customer service because of that. 

4. All of our leads are going to Home Advisor companies because than can make 4x as much over there than on Angie's list.  Which leaves our customers with no leads and/or the scraps and they are a paying a monthly rate for them. Genius business plan because they are locked into a 12 month contract. That makes for terrible conversations and past due accounts. 

5. Our job went from truly helping clients on a day to day basis which was rewarding to making collections calls 90% of our day. And if you don't make your 40+ collections calls everyday, you are WRITTEN UP. Hows that for hanging over your head. A potential write up EVERY SINGLE DAY. Many instances where I had an inbox full of customers to get back to but instead had to waste my time calling the same clients daily to let them know they are past due. So instead of trying to help happy clients, you are focusing all your time on clients that are pissed off and not paying. Its a legit catch 22. 

6. We have had 20 people quit since Jan 1. We keep asking how many people need to quit for something to be done. The answer is ""they are not concerned"". 

7. They lowered our base pay from 45k to 30k a couple weeks ago. Thats $1250 less per month overnight. The same week they lowered our pay they had a meeting telling us how Angie's list is HIGHLY profitable for the first time and that WE were responsible for that! The nerve.... 

8. I truly hope something gets done. I have put so much time and effort into Angie's list over the years and have loved coming to work. The employees here are top notch and truly care about their career here.  The last 6 months to a year have been the worst experience of my life. My mental health has suffered because of it.

You’re opinion and feedback has no value, which is made very clear. Failing product that comes with unrealistic goals and managing clients that were misinformed.  Double the amount of accounts per rep in the past four months, greatly contributed to high turnover and horrible sr level management decisions. Last month not one person on our 13 person team hit goal, on top of this only 1 person was over 90% to goal. Prior to four months ago, there has not been one team in department history to achieve this great level of failure that is now the norm. If you are ok with failure and no control over your success, along with a $30k per year salary, this is a great role for you. Anyone else, run and hide but never look back. If you are someone that has failed at many other sales roles, I’m talking six months and fired multiple times, this would be a great role to you as complacency and luck seem to be the best attributes to define a top performer in this role.  But wait, there’s more!  Now that we are being compensated 33% less, we are wearing more hats. Collections rep, we are required to make these calls everyday which is about 30 per rep on average. Remember above I referenced account size doubling, obviously that’s twice the workload than before. This eliminates any rapport you used to build, instead condense all calls to the minimum and only be reactive with your accounts. No proactive work to assist clients. No kpi’s to even try to improve yourself to make yourself and the company more money. The environment is just negative, I’ve never experienced anything like it i my life.

The department average is below 50% to goal. It’s worth mentioning what you’re compensated on is 80% - 90% out of your control. Your bonus is now on a three month rolling average, meaning one bad month creates a situation of not achieving a bonus for three months minimum.

- Not only is this causing (and after our salary cut will accelerate) turnover in our department, the accounts we manage has doubled since they refuse to backfill the positions of those who have left the company. This has led to an astronomical increase in workload. At our most recent meeting, leadership made us aware that they intend to increase the accounts we manage even further.

Honestly I’d only recommend this job if you are completely out of work and need something quick to get you a little above minimum wage. They also lack diversity severely, and don’t know how to (or don’t care to) deal with racism or any sort of workplace abuse.

So if you’re applying to Homeadvisor, know this going into the interview. They’ll hire basically anyone bc the turnover rate is ridiculous, your day will consist of just calling 100s of contractors who’ve been called multiple times before. And worse than that, the product is a scam! So it’s hard to convince them otherwise. The product literally doesn’t work and is designed to exploit the contractors. 

There’s currently a class action lawsuit from contractors against Homeadvisor, and when they unceremoniously closed down their original office in Golden, CO late 2019, those former employees JOINED those contractors in the lawsuit.

1217,Angi,Lots of recent positive reviews to cover up the truth.,2019-12-06,1.0,Sales,"Some pros of working here have been that the culture is fun and lax. You can wear what you want, pretty much say whatever you want with little to no repercussion.  There are fun happy hours where we're served beer and wine, and lots of different games to play to relax after hounding contractors that really do not want to sign up with us. The people are really fun to work with on your teams and everyone is super young and enjoys having a good time. The loud music is fun, too.","There are a lot of cons I could list here. The managers are fun, but they're not that great at leading teams, there are 1/2 that are very good managers and they lead with goals. I have not experienced much coaching or must of any direction in the time I have been here. A lot of my e-mails go unanswered, 1-on-1's are cancelled a lot of the time because certain managers are too lazy to lead my peers and I. There is a lot of dysfunction and disorganization. 

Another one of my complaints are the ridiculous standards of performance that have to be followed. They expect loads of hours of talk time, dials, and sales when 90% of the leads you get are so old they're from the earlier 2000's and are sick of us calling them. Most of our days consist of leaving voicemails and being yelled at by poor contractors who are tired of us calling. The thing that mostly upsets me is that this program is a scam. They have tried to make it ""easier"" to make sales by promising a free membership if they purchase pre-paid bundles of leads, but they will still receive the same horrible leads. We hear good stories about some contractors but it is VERY rare. The way that they expect us and BCCI (customer service side) to perform is ridiculous and sad. I have walked in the bathrooms multiple times and heard people crying from stress at this job. 

To prove that this program is a scam and doesn't work...it continues charging our (and most of them are NEW businesses who had to scrape pennies to sign up with us) contractors credit cards regardless if they take the homeowner coming to their cell phone or not. I have had several clients who are now in debt because of this company, and our managers do little to nothing to compensate for their lost wages. I have heard so many horror stories from my peers of their clients borrowing money from their family members to come on board with us just to be charged $87 for a bad lead that goes to a disconnected number; they can't get that money back, they only get a credit for a free lead/free call.

These are just a few things that really upset me about the company. Maybe it's just my location, maybe it's the fact that they let us all know they're laying us off and will not be compensated for time off to go to interviews or job hunt and they make us clock out to discuss job positions with ""job fairs"" that come to our company. I see a lot of new reviews coming on to the page, and while I understand that the other branches may be having a good time, please be sensitive to the fact that we were all dropped a ball on, with our director not even knowing about our location closing until the day of. Most of the people at this location have just bought houses, cars, have had children, and now they are going to possibly be in trouble. We also live in Colorado, so living here is not cheap nor is it easy, and $13 an hour is not sustainable wages for people. Sure, if you make sales, you make money, but lest not forget the amount of things you have to do to have a ""premium sale"" (a sale that you get paid on). There are many semantics that go into getting paid for just doing your job. I have also heard coworkers who got paid late on sales for whatever reason, which is scary and trifling. Imagine making 4 sales in a week to just not get paid on them because ""payroll messed up"" and your managers claim they cannot do anything to help you out.

Overall...this is a job for someone fresh out of highschool who needs to get their feet wet in a sales job, who plans on going after sales. However; please remember that this is not a great environment. This company is imploding and will only get worse, I can see it now, especially with the stocks dropping insanely and nobody taking any responsibility except pointing fingers at each other in the higher ups."
1218,Angi,Layoffs after Making the company  $Millilions$,2019-12-06,1.0,Project Advisor,"The people are great, very nice, kind and willing to give helpful advice.","- They will tell you that tier 1 has no minimums but they put you on PPE for not hitting a minimum and you can eventually lose your job for it. 

- They will tell you that it is not sales, it is customer service, but they will expect you to make sales. 

- When your numbers are not good, you are told in a group email, so that everyone on the team know your weaknesses.

- They will tell you that you will get paid more and more each tier you are in, however they make it impossible to ever reach anything other than tier 1 by having your customer rating be a factor in it. 

- Ratings are anonymous and even if you get a bad review through no fault of your own, it still counts against you.

- After hitting goal after goal, month after month and then getting $Millilions$ in sales reaching record numbers, we are all thanked by being told that we are closing down the Colorado Springs office, and our last day is December 23rd.

- No Work Life Balance, sure they offer PTO but you have to wait 6 months and they have a STRICT attendance policy.

- Seemed like I was having to call leads that were bought and had nothing to do with HomeAdvisor at all."

It’s their job to ‘farm’ the accounts, sales hunts them down. It’s unfair for me to waste my time farming my accounts to retain them when we have a whole department dedicated to managing the accounts(client success), when I need to use my time to hit my lofty sales goals.

Very little flexibility- constantly having to say where you are. ""rewarded"" work from home days in competitions but often have to report what you are doing at home because of a lack of trust. Management in my department was toxic- overshared about other members of the team and would tell you exactly what people were saying about you- overall ,i didn't feel I could trust in my manager. Manager would say ""I have no problem giving feedback"" but then when there was an issue with someone on the team she would ask that you developed and corrected them rather than dealing with it herself, as a manager. Unprofessional leadership style. Plays major favorites with other managers in the company and their groups because of personal relationships and it is highly felt among the team.  The job is sold as having a great company culture but the recruiting team never really got to participate- sales teams would constantly get incentives to leave early or have extra time off but the recruiters were constantly pressured to do more and pressured to work extra hours. No professional development- the manager just says the team should be able to do what she was able to do in the position but doesn't offer any additional coaching/development/training. Immature manager who is clearly not ready for leadership. Highly underpaid."

Everyone talked poorly about sales people, yet no one had any real solutions to fix the problems. They changed comp plans every other week to try and ""move the needle"", when in reality paying them a living wage probably would have done the trick. 

I also witnessed numerous talented employees leaving less than 6 months into their job, probably due to the fact that the company had so much technical debt they couldn't get out of. Systems were so out dated and barely functioning and no one seemed to care - people would laugh at the fact that a project would be 3-4 months over its due date.

Extreme lack of transparency in everything from career advancement to company goals and progress.

They encourage to use the term telesales, as if we didn't realize this is just a telemarketing company.

On top of that, 30% of our leads don’t even come from our website. If someone googles “remodelers in Denver”, that’s a request. The home owner didn’t ask to be relentlessly harassed by contractors, and the contractors didn’t ask for a fake lead. On top of that, we only offer them 2 refunds a month. Doesn’t matter if the homeowner never answers their calls, blocks them, etc. They’re getting charged no matter what. That’s only problems with the service itself, the job has just as many, if not MORE problems. They claim the new Denver office is a, “leadership development office, with ample opportunity for horizontal and vertical movement.” Thats a boldface lie. I accepted this position because I was told it was REQUIRED to work 6 months in sales, and then I would be eligible to move to the position I actually came here for. I talked to the department manager, he was never told about me, and he informed me that they had, in fact, never hired anyone from the sales floor. The turnover rate is extremely high because people feel lied to. 400+ phone calls a day, getting screamed at on the phone, harassing businesses (if someone even clicked on “create an account” on our website, we’re instructed to call the 5x a day until they answer), and sleazy sales techniques. You can tell the company is going down, at this point they’re hiring people to collect as much data as possible. Then, when people realize that the product is garbage, they’ll fire everyone, sell the data and ride off into the sunset"

I say that because it’s such an aggravating sales position that the only people willing to put up with it are exceptionally good at immoral persuading or have no idea what else is out there and stick around for the team. The job is AWFUL. The company and product, mediocre. The management teams, awesome. 

You are made to sell a flawed product to contractors, some who were previous members and had a terrible time with. It’s not made for everyone and yet they force you to communicate with everyone about it. Yes, you need thick skin, but you also might need an idea of how to sell someone something they really don’t need. 

I will say, the team they put you on strives for your success almost always. They encourage and celebrate your victories and are willing to lend a hand if you struggle.

The worst part of the job: The pay. DO NOT BUY IN TO THE SCAM YOU CAN MAKE LOADS. Unless you have been in a straight cold calling role selling a crappy product before, THIS WILL NOT HAPPEN. It’s the worst paying entry level position I have ever been in and if you are in it for commission there are tons of jobs that pay the same level of commission with a higher base pay and a better product. 

They try to make it a fun atmosphere, but it’s FAR from the real world. If they don’t make it fun, you can guarantee you will stay absolutely miserable calling on folks who cannot run a business or are too aggravated that people like us keep calling them after they’ve said every kind of no in the book.

If you are looking to grow and have a decent wage to have a nice work-life balance, do yourself a favor and look somewhere else. The pay and cold calling is NOT worth the aggravation. If you love cold calling and don’t mind lying/ overselling to get a dollar, this is the place for you."

The culture is extremely lax, understandable, willing to coach, and willing to hear feedback. Lunch and dinner were also provided everyday and it was delicious. Fridge is stocked with stacks and drinks all day. Hard work but they really want you to to feel comfortable and succeed. Great place to grow and grow quickly. Title is irrelevant as many sales reps ends up making even more money than their managers.","Need to be working there for 2 full years before you can unlock 401k.

Unlimited carbonated water
Nice facility
All of the above are present at nearly every tech company in existence","Pay/Position: I would guess pay is 20% lower than other companies in Denver, there are also large pay gaps between people at the same position, eg. there are mid level devs making 110k and there are some making 80k.  They don't promote from within, don't believe any of that, seriously wash that from your brain.  Wherever you are hired you will stay, they also don't have titles above senior dev (though they do now on paper, but I don't think anyone is in them). I got a 50k pay raise leaving here, without increasing my skills (see last con). 

Organization:  Each team is wildly different and its obvious which ones people want to be on.  HA also has a re-org every 6 months, so don't get used to literally any part of your job.

Blindness to performance:  The most glaring con is that they don't promote people or give them raises based on their abilities and performance.  I won't use my own experience here, but the 4 best devs I have worked with all have left over issues with money/title.  Most tech companies can see real talent and try to keep it around. If you neglect that, you are left with people who aren't talented and have no drive. This is where HA is headed and probably is there at this point in a lot of areas (looking at you pro and enterprise solutions).

Culture:  When I was hired here there was an ok culture, people enjoyed themselves.  By the time I left you weren't allowed to do anything, eg. games, talk, whatever.  This differs by team and manager, but HA is closer to GE at this point than whatever they are billing their current culture to be.

Codebase:  The codebase is horrific and outdated.  They will lie to you and tell you that you will be building new products in spring/vue.  That isn't the reality, you will spend 70% of your time looking at old jsps, facades, and just generally terrifying code in monoliths that are of legal age.  They are a ways off from CI/CD and don't use any cloud deployment. Everything is internal tooling.  You will not advance your career in any way.  Companies don't care if you know Komodo or whatever. They are about modern tools, frameworks, open source knowledge, etc.  I gained none of that from my role, but I already had it all coming in so I could leave anytime I wanted.  I lose sleep for the people who have been there 5-6 years who have to walk into an interview somewhere and basically explain why they know nothing new and haven't used anything relevant in the last 5 years and try to pretend the tribal knowledge they hoard isn't the reason they have a job."

If you're looking for a job with endless financial opportunities as well as growth, you'll find most of it here. First year did 50k while learning...grossed over 135k my second.  They aren't lying when they say that a six figures is an obtainable goal, but you have to work for it. If you're expecting to take a seat in any sales position and results to happen overnight, you're doing it wrong. The people that complain in this job expect to be paid by coming to work, doing the bare minimum, and being paid for it. If you want results you have to be ambitious and be willing to work for it. This job requires good time management, persistence, and drive. If you don't have that in the first place, SALES isn't for you. Location is amazing and easily accesible by multiple transportaion methods. Snow days in the winter (having Friday off by hitting weekly sales quota) is amazing so that you can hit the mountains or have a  lazy day to yourself, whatever you choose. Flex scheduling (when earned) is wonderful and gives you the time you need to handle things outside the office if needed. The help is incredible, but you need to ask for it, nobody is going to hold your hand.","The only cons I would have with HomeAdvisor would be the direction in which your career can go and how those doors can be more readily accessed.  Some people may find that the external activities (happy hours, beers on Fridays at the end of the day, etc) may not be for them, but you aren't required to participate in any of these things. You are a grown adult in a full time position and if you're having an issue with what you feel is peer pressure that might be something to reflect on internally, you can make your own decisions here."

The training process is way better than the actual inferno and real sales floor.

The company just sucks all passion and life from you. You’re stuck calling angry and unsophisticated jerks all day trying to get their SSNs or cards in one phone call. They want you to vomit positive energy like a factory machine. Like a hamster on wheels.

You can surely make a lot of money if you can fake ur but if you have any sliver of personal internal purpose, this rudimentary role will never work for you. It turns your brain to chaff. They literally tell you to turn your brain off. No potential for actually gaining marketing and sales skills that can hone you into a sophisticated industry heavy weight.

Even if you are good at this, consider your future as a marketing professional . There are ton of other places to gain valuable industry experience with better negotiable salaries. But don’t take my word for it. Try it for yourself"
1297,Angi,Don’t bother spending money on an amusement park: the roller coaster is here in Indianapolis.,2019-08-19,2.0,Senior Solutions Consultant,The people you meet here; you’re all in this ‘show’ together. Misery loves company! Oh yes it does.,"Ironically, when asked to leave a review for Angie’s List, they want it under their umbrella company ‘IAC’ so you won’t find many current reviews for Angie’s List.

If you are a recent graduate (or if you’re in dire need of a job) and want to get some experience - then have at it. You are just what they are looking for! If you are an actual seasoned sales professional - do not bother. Could write a book about my experience here; just do research. This is not a consistent job or career path. It was years ago, when Angie’s List had an exceptional sales force, and individuals were proud to be here. The smart people saw the writing on the wall.

Angie’s List before the acquisition was never profitable - and thus, the billion dollar IAC giant acquired them (ie, HomeAdvisor parent company). But that is neither here nor there. Here’s what you need to know:

The compensation plan is NOT in favor of you. Here’s what to expect: constant change of any and every initiative you could think of; each month. If you do not play the game here, you won’t make it. The business model is to have you be in a a ‘sweet spot’ where you earn very little commission, while the company absorbs the rest of the sales you bring in for that period. You’ll have a good period here and there - if your manager wants you to. See, that’s the thing... the leads and account distribution. It is all controlled by management. Your manager will directly assign your leads to you. It is not a ‘random’ distribution of high value leads as they would like you to believe. 

Your rotating territory every period, good luck making any money off of that. It does not matter how talented you are - if they decide to give you a portfolio of old accounts and no new ‘business center’ leads which are basically the only accounts anyone sells anymore, then you will be phased out quickly. 

If you’re a newbie; guess what - if they like you, they may give you some ‘lay up’ accounts that a chimpanzee could sell because the leads are mostly sold already on the BRAND, as long as you don’t screw up royally you’ll likely get the sale - this gets you feeling good - then you’ll see that go away, quickly. 

There is no need for me to continue to bash this place, or go in to further detail. That is for you to figure out. At the end of the day, it *is* a job.

Buyer beware. 

Good luck out there!

They do try to make it fun and the people there are great.,"After your initial 9 weeks, the pay structure makes it difficult to earn more than $15 an hour.  Its a unique experience but definitely a solid job for someone out of college.  Even if you only work there a month or two, lots of people are gone by the three month mark, you will get a lot of good experience.  If you are very smart and talk to a million people you may be able to put all the pieces together you need to solve the puzzle of how to make really good money and for the job to be much much easier and less strenuous.  Its only good for an entry level sales job for most people.  If you are just going to be a regular person and just dial what they give you, you have to put in 5 hours of talk time every single day, and probably 1000 dials a day which is INSANE to make a decent 75k a year.    

The CRM is proprietary.  They don't let you connect to work from home in any fashion.  Don't expect to prospect during the day unless you actually know what you're doing and you probably won't.  Very competitive and nobody will tell you the actual good stuff unless you pry it out of them somehow."
1308,Angi,Frat Party,2019-08-02,2.0,Sales Representative,"There's a lot of camaraderie in the misery and hatred for the company and the stress behind trying to make goal to actually make money that month. So, it's a fun culture when you are on break with everyone chatting. There's a keg in the office where they incentivize any wins with earlier drinking time. It's like a frat house with the games and ping pong and young people fresh out college.","First off, I asked my Director how my commission would be effected based on my retention of sales. (The way commission is structured). He responded with, ""You aren't even close to 'being in the money' so I wouldn't be worried about it."" And walked away... I had not made enough sales that week to be eligible to receive what I was asking about so he didn't think it was worth his time to respond.

The place is absolutely awful. The interviewers will say it's so amazing and the sales reps make an average of $90k a year... Well, they take the 5 top sales reps of the office who might make 6 figures and then average the whole office at that, when no one is even close. Plus, the recruiters are just a bunch of girls that sit on LinkedIn all day and have never actually been on a sales call to know what the job is.

Turnover is extremely high. They will hire anyone because people usually phase out or get kicked out for not meeting goal within a few months. They don't offer any benefits such as insurance, PTO or sick time for the first 6 months because it's rare people even stay that long. Managers have you put up hundreds of dials and hours of talk time daily and have super aggressive 1 on 1 ""trainings"" with you to motivate you, but instead tell you to either make it work, or leave. My entire floor was miserable and would use each break to either job hunt, or complain to coworkers about how awful it was.

You call beat to death leads that have been called every day for the last 3-4 years or have been put on the ""do not call list"" but get made into a ""new lead"" off a new number pulled from google. You sit at a desk listen to the same 10 songs over and over and call 200-300 people a day. Last you get treated like a high school kid.

1311,Angi,New York Office - Dishonest Organization and Cliquey Bias Management Team (Honest Review),2019-07-29,1.0,Sales Representative,Lunch and Dinner included ($13 Stipend per meal),"Where to begin. I like to consider myself rational and to have an open mind so understand that this review is meant to be heard by anyone who values their career and wants a legitimate insight on the HomeAdvisor New York sales office. This company (specifically the New York office) will hire anyone with a pulse. I am not exaggerating this, which actually was the reason I left. College or relevant work experience is not even considered when they hire. They currently need to put people in their seats since it's a public company so headcount is important to the bottom line at the moment. If you value your degree, work anywhere but here as you will be subjected to work with individuals who aren't qualified to do anything but make minimum wage due to the choices they made up until this point. 

Upper Management is a popularity contest. The Vice President seems like a nice enough man, but it's obvious he chooses directors relatable to him. Basically the directors are who he was 20 years ago. Hard to build a diverse culture when you only choose people that look and dress like you. Every director literally wears the same shirt, pants, and shoes as if they contacted each other the night prior to make sure they didn't accidentally wear the same outfit. From what I've heard, they have common tendencies to be untrustworthy and keep their cult protected unless you act and look like them. It's sad but that's how this company operates. These same individuals also allow the sales floor to run like a zoo. They generate revenue, but it's literally through the massive amounts of adderall the sales reps take to survive. There is massive drug use, popularity cliques, and horrible leadership to go around. If you went to college for anything like that, this is the place to work. You also need to wake up at 3am and get your manager to prospect for you as there are crazed managers on the sales team that wake up in the middle of the night (2-4 AM) to beat everyone to the punch. I definitely think that they earn those leads by sacrificing sleep, but shouldn't there be rules to regulate something like that. Upper management will pretend that this isn't happening as i've mentioned this before, but the directors and VP will ignore it because they want the commission. They lose reps everyday and now managers have started to leave due to the conditions in the workplace here.

The sales reps are degenerates who couldn't land jobs anywhere but HomeAdvisor and they choose to celebrate every Thursday, Friday, and Saturday with any drug they can get their hands on. Primarily to forget about what they need to do to make money in this place. The contractors are harassed and lied to daily. The product will only work if the Service Professional understands that it's a rat race to a lead which no one wants to say because no one would buy. Retention as a sales rep and as a contractor is a problem. HomeAdvisor is a force that needs to be stopped. There are class action lawsuits on this company so do a little research before you accept the offer on this place. You will find them all over scam boards with a simple google search.

If you want a company to work at for 8-11 months where you will sell your soul to make rent, this is the place for you. The pro's are the free lunch and dinner which get repetitive as the menu never changes. If you have relevant experience or an associates or bachelors degree, you could make more money at McDonald's while you hold out for something better. Don't work here if you have any self respect for yourself. The sales floor is built on drug use, deceit, and shady business."

This job requires zero responsibility, if you can smile and dial for 8 hours a day you’re the person they want around.","There is no integrity on the sales force.  The percentage of top performing reps to under performing reps is so far apart that the only explanation is cheating.  Sales reps continually steal accounts from their co-workers, but the company doesn’t care because they get their money either way.   Contractors who only speak Spanish are particularly screwed over because there is no Q&A department to specifically monitor those calls.  The commission plan changed regularly and a majority of people are not making anything but their hourly.  They tell contractors who don’t have social security numbers they cannot be a member because they are unable to do a proper background check, when in reality they only want to be able to send you to collections if you don’t pay your bill.  The term, “dipping your pen in company ink” may as well be the company slogan.  The amount of employee relationships is absolutely unreal and completely unprofessional.  I’d guess nearly every training class (which is about every month) loses people in the first week because they realize it’s a joke.  Most people stick around because they know how to work the system or couldn’t get a job anywhere else.   If the customer is not successful they teach the rep to put it back on the contractor and continue to take their money.  “Customer Care” reps are paid massive commissions for getting people to raise spend targets not realizing what is going to happen when they do it, yet the person who signs them up receives no residual for the amount of money the customer spends."

The managers here are great and really do look out for you.",Listen this is a sales job like you’ve never had. The metrics you have to meet can be daunting and the turn over is high.

OK job for someone right out of college. Other than that nothing","Training- So training consists of 3 days of daycare where the “trainers” teach you how to read a script and basic objection handling. That’s it. You do not learn about the product or account management. It was the worst training I have ever been through and I have had several sales jobs in the past. The trainers do not want to help you and will not go the extra mile to help you out. You are placed on the phones after 3 days and expected to know the garbage product we sell inside and out. You are begging contractors to give you their social, credit card, and agree to spend hundreds of dollars on our product all in a “one call close”. You cannot let them do research because one google search of HomeAdvisor and 20,000 complaints show up as well as the multiple lawsuits pending against us. This brings me to my next point. 

The product- HomeAdvisor is a scam in every sense of the word. The product is designed to swipe contractors credit cards without their knowledge. In the script it says we have “16 unanswered leads” in their area, which is a lie if you’re calling some guy in the middle of bumble Alabama. Managers and training managers encourage you to lie and it goes unnoticed by upper management. I am ashamed to say I have lied to hundreds of people to get the sale, but I have to make money too and it’s impossible to sell this product without lying. We tell them (the contractors) we will personally supervise their accounts and they can have 1 / 2 leads a month if they want, or none at all, and that they have full control over their account. They do not. Homeadvisor will bombard them with FAKE leads and swipe their credit card. They will call the dispute these charges but will never, ever get their money back. If they quit, we don’t care because homeadvisor’s philosophy is “there is a sucker born every minute”, thus we will mass cold call and get another man that day to sign up. They know their product is horrible and destroying lives but they do not care, they just want the quick dollar. 

The salary/commission - The base is roughly 30,000 a year when you start, a joke if you live in a big city. They give you free lunch and dinner everyday but I rather cook myself and take the extra 4/5 thousand a year. It’s a cop out to pay us less. Now onto the commission. Once upon a time the commission structure was designed to make us as much money as possible but now they designed it to make us as little money as possible. The commission is based on a weekly ramp up, so you have to BEG a minimum of 3 people to sign up in a week just to hit the bare minimum (500$). Most people I know have a hard time getting two or three sales a week let alone four or five. You used to be able to make 80k+ a year here easily but now they designed it so you are making roughly 40-60k MAX. 

The culture - If you love coming to work to see people literally wear sweatpants, crop tops, dyed hair, piercings all over their faces, and a load of degenerate drug using losers, come to HomeAdvisor. I’ve personally witnessed multiple managers and directors participate in drug use and get belligerent drunk 3 to 4 days a week. Not to mention how everybody openly has sex with eachother (even in the office). Managers will literally sleep with employees and then not fire them for that reason. Love drugs? Great, outside during breaks you will witness several people crowding around joint on the sidewalk right outside our building. During breaks you constantly see people running to the bars however I can’t blame them because the stress of selling this garbage is too much to bare. LOUD MUSIC blasts from 9-6, which is really nice when the customer can hear it over the phone and butchers the sale for you. The office itself has a 1980s Wall Street sales floor layout that looks like a circus. It’s a nightmare, trust me. You can never get a moment to think to yourself and it lacks any sort of professionalism. They will hire ANYONE with a heartbeat, I literally saw someone come in with sweatpants and a hoodie in an interview and the next week I saw him in the training class. 
Everybody that has been here over 1/2 years is smart enough to start moving on to better jobs. They treat their employees like crap and do not care about you as an individual. I like to say they treat us how they treat their customers, terrible. There is no leadership and from top to bottom this place is a scam. If I can save one or two people from taking this job I know I have done better in the world"

-Occasional working latte/espresso machine","Where to start? 
1) The base pay of $29,000/annual is a complete joke; this barely covers cost of living in Denver  or New York. The comp plan is pretty awful too- they love to dangle the carrot. It is near impossible to get sales because the company has beat the heck out of any contractor with a pulse in the US. If you don’t get “in the money” during the pay period, you also do not get any sort of retention payout for previous sales- all while the company rakes in money (and pays you $14.50/hourly). Only folks that make any semblance of decent money are maybe top 1% of reps, and sales managers and above. 
2) The online leads were complete trash and half the time the prospects had no idea they had actually “registered“, which is likely why they switched to a new model where they want you to prospect on your own- which is also awful considering there are 1400+ reps for the company with no territories, some using web scrapers AND there are positions that are entirely dedicated to prospecting.
Also rampant internal politics & favoritism.
3) The product is not very good to say the least. They sell low quality leads to these contractors and partake in shady practices involving lead allocation and account management- which they then always blame on the contractor if something goes wrong. 
4) No self-respecting salesman worth their snuff works here anymore, they will literally hire anyone. Knew of multiple people on my sales floor that were literally on H- there was a story floating around of some guy getting the boot for shooting up in the office, and I actually saw people nod off at work. Other than the drugs complete revolving door. 

Ultimately there are great people that work there (which doesn’t help pay your bills) and I hope they move on to better things. Worst sales job I’ve ever had in my 5+ years of sales experience.  Run and never look back.

I truly enjoyed the atmosphere, coworkers, outside work activities, lots of opportunities for growth if you work hard for it! You get what you put into it just like any sales position. Lots of dials/ talk time = more sales. That’s the strategy and it works if you are constantly on phone and putting in the effort/ understanding what you’re selling.","Exhausting at times, cold calling allll day long can take its toll. Very cut throat off the bat.. if you are not doing well they will let you go. Have to consistently make 3 sales/ wk to keep your job. Bad leads at times on call list and for the unhappy clients calling to complain and cancel right off the bat!"

If you're ok with making 150 calls a day to bring home that $14hr pay check with maybe an extra 2k/month commissions ... we're talking <50K a year working a call center, this might be the place for you.

1382,Angi,Multiple class action lawsuits pending. Everything there is SHADY SHADY SHADY!!,2019-04-02,1.0,Online Sales Consultant,"vsp, once in awhile you will get a manager that will actually help you.","HA is a joke. They are only out for themselves. DO NOT BELIEVE what they tell you in the interview about what you will make. Sales have dropped drastically and that is why they are outsourcing departments like elite 360 to the Philipines. HomeAdvisor has about 4 pending class action lawsuits hanging over them right now. I will be astounded if this place still exists once the lawsuits are done. HomeAdvisor is only out for themselves. Do not ever and I mean ever fill out a request and use your phone number or email. They sell your info and next thing you know you are getting calls talking about you owe taxes or they are going to shut down your ssn number LOL! Do not work here as a customer service rep because it is not cs. It is basically sales with a customer service name. and whatever you do do not work here  in sales. Even with all of the complaints online from contractors saying their sales reps lied to get them signed up they continue to let the sales reps say whhhhhhateverrrrr they want. It is such a joke. Sales are few and far between because homeadvisor lets the sales reps lie. ALL and I mean ALL of the top sales reps lie. Then homeadvisor says they are all about integrity. I have also seen in these reviews that they are sending the same leads to angies list and ha contractors. Funny how they forgot to mention that to sales. LOL How underhanded can one company be. There is even a whistle blower on youtube talking about all of the shennanigans at that place. Oh and then lets talk about their credit policy. SCAM SCAM SCAM. They dont even replace the leads that fall within the guidelines anymore. HA loses thousands of accounts daily or weekly because they are so greedy and not upfront. Do not work here. they wont even be around in a couple more years. plus they changed the payouts so they do not care one ounce if you make money! Sadly a lot of the more tenured reps have moved on to better jobs. It is funny how they brag about all of the tens of millions of dollars of profit they make every quarter yet they are taking away overtime and a bunch of other perks we once had. Before i left the morale was so low about half of the co was looking for future employment so they could get out of there. That is why they have started other locations such as Chicago, because they have ran through all of the good reps in there main locations! Also a lot of these 5 star reviews are fake. You can tell by how generic they sound. They approached me to do a 5 star review so I know they do that!"

Encourages frat-like environment and rewards un-professionalism and racism."
1385,Angi,The fake smiles and fake compassion,2019-03-30,1.0,Project Advisor,BBQs food flex schedule,"Most of the “This place is awesome!” Vibe is fake. 
Within mins after really talking to longtime employees you will find, are very upset with the way things have been handled. 

They just closed an entire department here in Golden and shipped the jobs to the Philippines. Now that department is falling apart. They transferd several people to HCCI but they are still taking 360 calls, WHY? Because the people in the Philippines can’t handle it and they had several people quick because they couldn’t understand the job. So they are taking away a department that was completely handled to save some money? How about let the professionals who started the team in the US handle those calls. Oh wait they are but not getting paid for it. 

It’s also a lot like high school make sure your with the in crowd because you won’t move up if not."

The company also provides us with events and happy hours to encourage all of us to network and have a presence in downtown Denver. There’s not a ton of pressure to stay late or work weekends and the general vibe is you must be good if you’re here.",Rejections and the no’s. Potentially the redundancy but mostly the growth phase.

1388,Angi,"Revenue continues to grow; culture, management, and leadership trend the other direction",2019-03-28,2.0,Engineer,"-Genuinely lots of good people in Tech and Business depts, but are let down by management and leadership
-Decent benefits outside of mediocre base salary
-Good place to break into tech in the Denver area
-New office in RiNo is much nicer than Golden office and a perk to those living in downtown Denver","-There is a fear of change anything around the core product since it is a current source of revenue. Unfortunately that prevents the improvement of known customer complaints and things discovered by employees dog-fooding the product. These changes might impact revenue over the short term,  but would result in a stronger product and brand if there was the courage to change. This can be rather demoralizing to those to are customer satisfaction oriented.
-Some people shouldn't be in management positions.
-Management is good at talking, but not at listening or implementation.
-Lack of opportunities to grow career or learn new skills. One Crucial conversations training over the last 3 years, while useful,  doesn't count.
-Salary is not as competitive for similar roles at other technology companies. There was no annual raise discussion and the unofficial saying was that the best way to get a raise was to get a new job offer.
-Often times gestures of appreciation to employees don't feel genuine and ring hollow; this can feel especially stingy after repeatedly hearing how much profit we've made year over year.  This is most true when relating to things that IAC has a hand in deciding. As a majority stakeholder of ANGI/HomeAdvisor IAC frequently puts the needs of its shareholders and execs above that of the hardworking employees  who create the value. When going public with the ANGI acquisition it took an outspoken employee during a town hall with IAC to force their hand in giving out shares to everyone. Unfortunately these ultimately wound up having an absurd vesting structure that I've never seen used at any other technology company.
-Company wants to project a culture of a 'Cool' technology company, but the actual execution has a long way to go. Needs to act like a top-tier tech company and not just pretend."
1389,Angi,You won't make what they say you will. A lot of the good reviews on here are FAKE!,2019-03-28,1.0,Sales,was good commissions and some managers actually helped,"Gosh where do I begin. This was an alright company once upon a time but totally different story now. As you will see in alot of these reviews there is a lot to be desired at this place now. HomeAdvisor is not the opportunity that you would think it is in alot of these fake reviews. See, every time someone goes on here to say the truth either HR or managers will beg for people to go make up good reviews to try and outweigh the true negative ones. It is an uphill battle to make a decent commission now. They recently changed the  structure so they are really screwing the sales reps now. HA preys on 20 somethings that will say anything, make up lies to get a sale. They let the top sales reps lie and that is why they are the top sales reps. Every day sales loses tons of accounts because of this and all of the horrible reviews online. Every week I would lose at least 3 sales because the contractor would go and google us. Upper management is a joke. They expect a lot but do not provide the leads or the training for you to make the money they will tell you that you will make in your interview. They are losing a ton and I mean a ton of sales reps because of the commission change and all of the  dealings ha does. I would say like a lot of these other reviews, do your research on ha before even applying. Youtube will give you a great idea on alot of the stuff going on there. If you kiss up and know a director or are a favorite you might have a chance. HA makes up fake leads to force feed the contractors. They will make up any reason as they go to not pay you what you are worth. There are class action lawsuits that hopefully will change a lot of the things they are doing. Can't believe what they get away with here. When HA bought Angies List they started selling the lead from Angies List to HA contractors to which I am assuming is probably not legit. But people are networking more and more these days. Sales are hard to come by at this place. I was also getting a lot of calls from my cancelled accounts asking why they were back in approved status receiving leads months later after they cancelled. Needless to say they were livid. Come to find out HA is in fact literally changing cancelled accounts back to approved without the contractors knowledge. Doesn't get much lower then that. I know that they will give sales reps a few good leads to go make up a bs good review on here without it even being true. I know this because they have asked me before. There are so many things going on here i would be surprised if they were around in a couple years."

The majority, however, were all talk and no action.","-It seemed some departments and leaders were more interested in maintaining the status quo than working to solving actual issues that affected consumers, pros and employees. 

-Too much red tape to get anything productive done

-I found my boss to be disinterested in my role and apathetic about helping to remove challenges that stood in front of projects 

-Poor communication from leadership on goals, expectations and direction"
1392,Angi,Slowly but surely sinking ship. Take it from me dont apply here!,2019-03-25,1.0,Sales,they used to have good commissions and the people are pretty cool.,"HomeAdvisor has the WORST and I mean worst rep in the industry. Anybody looking to get hired there i would tell you to go do your research before you apply. There is a trend of online reviews that will really give you the idea of what HA is all about and I can tell you they are doing A LOT and I mean A LOT of very underhanded things. First of all this was a great job once upon a time. Payouts were good. They had some if very little integrity. Now it is all washed down the drain. There are around 15000 negative reviews online about homeadvisor. They lets the top sales reps lie (you will see this in employee reviews as a trend because it is true)  this makes the contractors go online and give us bad reviews. No integrity whatsoever. A lot of the top reps are spanish speaking and they dont get listened to so they say and do say whatever to get the sale. They are also started to outsource sales more and more to Jamaica etc so you are getting less sales to make money. They also just purchased Angies list so they are selling one lead to not only ha contractors but AL too. But they dont tell the sales reps that. LOL They purposely withhold information to sales so the contractor is not set up properly. Half your accounts will cancel because they either go and google ha after they signed up or they receive made up false leads of dead people or people that dont exist or already have had project done for months. Everything within this company is more then unscrupulous. I would suggest googling and youtubing ha before you even bother applying. There are multiple class action lawsuits that are just waiting to come to fruition. Too bad HA can't just do the right thing. The managers are in on it too, letting there sales reps lie, adding tasks, coverage areas to make it a payable sales. With all of the great jobs out there and HA being a slowly but surely sinking ship I would say dont say yourself short and find another job. Also there are reps here that have their own crawlers to get prospects, meanwhile the reps that don't lie and dont have crawlers and just blowing in the wind, and looking for a better job."

1397,Angi,I've enjoyed my time here,2019-03-17,4.0,Senior Sales Consultant,"Angie's List is a really fun place to work. The culture is great, and they value people that work hard. If you're willing to come in every day and work hard, you can make endless amounts of money. The compensation plan is great. The hours are great. They have celebrations and activities to reward hard work.","If you're not good at sales, there's not many resources to help you succeed. They will have another employee in your seat at the snap of a finger. If you don't make it in sales, it's hard to transfer to somewhere else in the company."
1398,Angi,Great Place to work,2019-03-17,5.0,Data Specialist,"Angie's List was a great place to work. Regular employee appreciation days, PTO, benefits,  and co-workers were all appreciated.","Constantly changing policy.  Policy that it not written down, and not always easy to interpret."
1399,Angi,Decent place to get a start post-grad,2019-03-14,2.0,Sales Consultant,"I started out loving the positive, uplifting atmosphere. I love my teammates - they are really the only reason I don't mind going to work. Also, probably the best health insurance I've had so far. Also, our office met our sales goal so we got two weeks off of the end of the year for the holidays - I truly appreciated that.
-As long as the contractors don't say ""F you"" at the mention of HomeAdvisor, you do get to talk to a diverse and fun group of contractors.","Extremely hard product to sell because at first, you buy into it with all of the 'success stories' (which they send out so you can tell 'personal stories' to these guys) and yeah there might be some contractors that do have success but few and far between. 
-You can try to Google HomeAdvisor Good Reviews but good luck finding a good one - even though all day we preach on the phone how important reviews are for a business. 
-You're expected to make 3 approved sales a pay period (2 weeks) but any accounts that get denied legal, not properly licensed, or not registered correctly with the Secretary of State don't count towards keeping your job - it's just considered ""positive momentum"" towards more sales. 
-If these guys are too busy you still have to sell them but get reprimanded if they turn their leads off or switch to busy coverage, which you're told to sell them on the ability to control the account, so then you're pressured to make them take on work or their leads magically get turned on without yours or their knowledge which is super fun to explain.
-If there isn't enough work generating in their area you must decide whether you care about keeping your job with your numbers, so some people adjust tasks and coverage to make it look like there is enough work for him. Like the poor guys in WY or MT. 

At the end of the day, I just feel like I'm scamming people. I get more anxiety post-sale than I do making the sale. I have friends and family that are contractors so it makes it really hard to overlook certain things. You can't say that winning one out of ten jobs is a good ROI when HA's ROI is ten thousand times that from them buying those ten leads."

Free coffee and soda in the break room. 

Simple 8 hour shift and Monday thru Friday.","The pay starting off is a bit underwhelming for the position at hand. I mean yes this is a lead phone center position. It’s not sales but with a hint of customer service but the learning curve of how to earn money is always confusing and underpaid. 

This position would be great if the base pay was around 40k. I’m being paid hourly 1 dollar more than minimum wage. That’s pretty sad. Also no over time. Cause with this being a service being offered to the entire USA. I can’t make connections to west coast customers if I’m done with work by 5pm. 

So the pay sucks, But for entry level does it really? Yeah it does. The drive from other employees would be greater if the initial base pay was hire. Hell even Amazon gets 15 an hour and full benefits day one. 

On to that benefits and perks. 
You get the perks first on day one but not benefits. Ya know like health insurance. I have to wait 90 full days and have to be putting in full time hours. So don’t miss work if your sick.

1. The management. Each manager was on a different page at all times. You couldn’t get a straight answer from any of them as they didn’t even know how to do our job. It was just better to ask those around you. Having managers that have experience in your department and tasks would be helpful instead of those who don’t communicate.
In addition to this, managers didn’t seem to have an attendance policy. If we had a family emergency, medical emergency, or any other unexpected absence, it would count as an “occurance”, or a point towards our total attendance. Even if we had PTO to utilize, it would still count as an unapproved absence. If managers had an unexpected absence, there seemed to be no repercussions for their attendance. This was noticed throughout the entire floor and really hurt the morale. We all agreed that this attendance policy wasn’t fair.
2. Lead quality. As Elite 360 advisors, we had to call out on at least 350 leads individually each day. Beginning in November 2018, we all noticed that the lead quality was declining and quickly. Air conditioning requests in the winter was a large category we saw. This was due to an increase of third-party affiliate websites that would sell customer’s contact information to HomeAdvisor and they’d be angry when we’d call as they all never submitted an actual request. We were specifically told that the quantity of calls/transfers was far more important than quality of each lead. Therefore, we had to deal with the repercussions of these calls without complaint. This leads me into my next point.
3. Quantity over quality. As a company that promotes its core values as integrity, ownership, innovation and attitude, they surely did not exhibit these at all in the last few months I personally worked there. As someone who genuinely cares about people and their experience, it was hard to help those who truly needed it because we were pushed to get a certain transfer percentage each day. Even when the customers didn’t submit a request (third-party affiliate leads as mentioned above) we were pushed to get them over to the pros anyway. In most cases, the pros couldn’t even help the customers with their project. We were judged by our transfer percentage when there was no way we could personally control the lead quality. 
4. Loss of large professional accounts due to poor leads. In late 2017, Elite 360 was busy and profitable for not only HomeAdvisor, but for the representatives too. Transfers were easy to get as people were serious about doing projects and everybody took home a great paycheck every two weeks. Sadly, we all knew something this wonderful couldn’t last forever. Unfortunately, we were right. In the slower season (November-March of the following year) third-party affiliates were hired to create more leads for us to keep us busy. The professionals noticed the rapid decline in legitimate  projects and would drop out of Elite 360. In between trying to make transfers, we were asked to help with other departments’ tasks to keep us busy and give us some sort of opportunity to make commission. These factors created a downward spiral and leads me into my last topic.
5. Elite 360 was outsourced to the Phillipines. We all found out that our department would be outsourced in an unexpected Monday meeting. They gave us a week and a half to decide whether to go to inbound (which was previously outsourced to Guatemala, but due to poor feedback from customers and a severe language barrier, was going to be brought back to the US), go to Business Customer Care, or basically take a demotion and go to the Project Advisor department. If none of these were an option, we could leave HomeAdvisor. 
Due to this abrupt news, there was a mass exodus from HomeAdvisor itself to find other jobs. We all had conformed to the changes that were thrown at us for the past two years. This was the biggest breach of trust and disappointment to all of us who had worked so hard to make a living and make the Elite 360 department successful."

The only reason the company is still solvent is that the legal team and their lobbyists have succeeded in getting the courts to effectively pay cleaners below min wage as quasi-legal independent contractors.

1445,Angi,A Great Place to Advance Yourself,2019-01-15,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"I interviewed with a number of companies on my way to accepting my role here, and Handy stood out immediately with the efficiency, honesty, and thoroughness of their recruiting process. After a first email with them, I got on the phone with the recruiter the next day, and scheduled a follow-up call with the department head the following day, where we discussed the role in detail. They gave me a case study to give a presentation on the following week. The project was highly relevant to my role, which gave me confidence that they knew exactly what kind of person they were looking to hire. Handy flew me out to New York for a final round of interviews with the exec team the week after that. I accepted an offer shortly thereafter. The whole process took about 3 weeks altogether. 

	Since I've joined, I've noticed that the efficiency and honesty I enjoyed during my recruiting process are seen throughout this company. Everyone is incredibly bright, projects get off the ground fast, and there really aren't a lot of politics with my work. The open communication here makes all of this possible. Every company should strive for more of this.","As far as startups go, people tend to work longer hours here than other places. I'd say this is more of a result of the very high bar of expectations rather than a culture of ""last person in the office is the most impressive"" though.

So, not necessarily a bad thing -- for me this was actually a refreshing change of pace, and necessary for my personal career development. But if you aren't willing to have some longer days than you're used to every now and then, it could be a con for you."

The company itself experienced an enormous amount of growth which felt exciting to be a part of. The meals and snacks  are appreciated--even if it is just a way to keep you in the office working. Depending on which team you work with and who your supervisor is, you may find yourself working with someone who would provide you many opportunities to learn. There are several really great middle managers and the ceo is friendly while serious and brilliant.","I'm sure the company and management has advanced and changed some of their policies since I ended my employment there, but a few of the things I disliked that ultimately led me to seek other employment centered around the internal culture. 
I had fun getting to know coworkers at happy hour events, but there was a heavy drinking culture.
There were expectations to be available near round the clock.
There were evident office politics and a hierarchy based on favoritism. I did not work within customer experience, but the hierarchy consistently put customer service associates down when they were some of the hardest working and highest contributing members to the company, which was at times hard to witness. I'll never forget having a conversation where I learned how little they made but yet how much was expected of them. While most of the company can enjoy and afford to take time off for vacationing, that was not a reality for CX.
Finally, the lack of clear advancement and learning opportunities outside of favoritism was an issue I knew I did not want to attempt to ride out."

I really tried so hard, I did everything in my power to succeed but it wasn't enough. My coworkers tried to help me, my supervisor tried to help me, I dug for my own leads, I called and called but still couldn't make it happen. It literally broke my heart to fail and I still don't understand what I did wrong. I don't understand why I failed. I always try so hard, without fail, my expectations of myself are always higher than the expectations that are set for me. So failure is not an option and it never happens. However this time it happened. I was informed by more than one person that my supervisor could have kept me if he felt that I could succeed moving forward. He chose to not to which made me feel as if there was something more seriously wrong with me outside of my initial failure to meet the quota. Hence my current state of disarray.

 They really draw you in, ""Oh you can make so much money! It's such a fun environment! We really care about our employees and our customers!"" It's all a huge facade. 

The turnover rate is insane, they have new training classes every three weeks for sales positions because so many people quit. 

Management uses scare tactics that make you feel like you're constantly on the brink of getting fired no matter how much effort you put in. 

The top salespeople are manipulative liars. The people they sign up to join Home Advisor usually cancel because they've been misled. 

You only get commission after you've put up 5 sales in a pay period, which is much more complicated than you'd think. You can submit 11 accounts and only get 2 approved because they didn't pass the background check or don't have enough money. 

You're on the phone all day calling people who've been called a thousand times already and want nothing to do with you. In order to get sales, you have to be really manipulative. 

They promote the ""one call close"" which is basically overwhelming a person into signing up without really understanding what Home Advisor is and what they would get out of the membership. 

It's a lot of false promises made to employees, people who sign up, and people who use the HA for home projects.

 The owner of a business is supposed to pass a background check but there are a LOT of times the company looks the other way. 

There's a review on here that says everyone there is on drugs and the company shrugs it off, but seriously, everyone there is on drugs. Adderall, Xanax, Vicodin, other prescription drugs plus booze, weed, coke, and god knows what else. The environment there is so toxic that the only way to get through the day is to be on something. This INCLUDES members of management. 

Anyway, I hated it, most people there hate it, and there's a lot of sketchy things going down there."

I have had a contractor that was a 1 man company and 2 years later he has 2 locations and 23 employees so, it is true when people say Home Advisor changes lives.. It change my life and my contractors. I was promoted to an Account Manager for 1yr during the ""test"" run at the KS location. I was the person that spoke to the contractor AFTER the sale... There are sales consultants that dont explain the entire process but, that is NOT the company or managers or the directors fault.. That is the consultant. This company rewards its employees with give aways.. Jeeps.. Super bowl tickets.. Money & Beer Friday. I couldn't say enough great things about this company. I received the CORE value award in my time there.. I nominated them for Best Job In KC.. and FYI they have WON multiple times. I was sad when I couldn't return to H.A. after medical reasons.. But, for 6months they continued to pay my medical and do what they could to know I was welcomed back as soon as I was released. I look forward to the day I can go back to work & if you have the GRIND mentality & you like making money, friends, and have a career then HOME ADVISOR is the Best Place In KC to Work!! #ChangingLives","I let you know when I experienced a ""Con"" to working at Home Advisor.."

I started at the company when there were around 300 people.  Everyone around me were hardworking, smart, intelligent people, and then as we started to grow they started promoting the brown nosers in the company to management.  To be a manager at Angie's List you had to have no soul, no opinion, and be a complete yes man/woman.  Almost everyone they made managers were people that were just good enough at their job to not get fired, and they were the only ones that wanted to be managers because it usually meant taking a pay cut, but better than no job.  The managers could literally be replaced by robots, because all they did was push refresh on the dashboards to see if their team was any closer to goal so they could get their bonus that they did not earn a penny of.  When you asked them to help you on a deal, they would sometimes help and hop on a call but immediately just undercut your pricing and do whatever it took to get a deal signed and closed, because at the end of the day all they cared about was their needle moving toward goal, not your personal success as an individual.  Slowly over the years the company started to go down hill.  The comp plan had been changed more times than we could count, and they were always just over correcting previous mistakes that some idiot in upper management made.  As the years went on they pretty much hired any one with a pulse, which made being proud of where you work very difficult.  I went from working with some of the best in Indy, to working along side people equivalent to used car salesmen that used cheap tricks to hit goal and screw over the customers on a regular basis.  Company functions were embarrassing to be at since people were often over served and were all hooking up with each other.  It was honestly as bad or worse than high school.  All in all this company could have been great, but poor management, led by even worse management, then somehow even worse management led this company straight into the toilet which led to it being bought out by it's biggest competitor, which now everyone seems to think is a ""good thing"" even though everyone knows that Home Advisor is ten times shadier than Angie's List ever was."

Office leaders/management really does care about making this a fun place to be. There are constantly fun incentives and rewards which keeps things exciting and enjoyable. Tonight I am going to a Rockies game with my team members for getting a sale yesterday. Thanks, HA! A pair of my co-workers won a trip to HAWAII which they are taking a the end of this month. 
The environment is casual, but every person here is hardworking and serious about doing well. 
Benefits are great (health/vision/pto/401k) and opportunities to bonus outside of commission occur weekly. 
We have weekly meetings with our director to discuss management development topics - the company cares about investing in their people and promoting from within. 
I actually LIKE talking to the contractors we call. DAILY we are emailed stories of recently signed-up pros who call or write in to tell us about how much their business has changed for the better. I can honestly say that if I were a contractor, I'd use the service, which makes it easy to sell. 
There is excellent opportunity for advancement in this office. I have worked here for eight months and have interviewed twice for other positions within Sales. I am working with my manager on a weekly basis to ready myself for the next opportunity. 
My team members have become some of my best friends. The office IS diverse in that we all come from different backgrounds and have very different personalities, but the recruitment team does an amazing job of hiring honest, NICE and happy people who I want to sit next to every day. Everyone is willing to help each other when we need it. I would feel comfortable asking anyone in this office for help if I needed it. 
The company cares about the community. We have paid time off to volunteer at not-for-profit organizations. We run floor contests that raise money or supplies for communities in need both here in Denver and around the world.","I will say that sometimes spending the day on a telephone can be tiring.. but that's why we call it WORK!

The company really does work for large contractor's companies if  they put in the effort.","No parking at headquarters, it's a company growing rapidly so no parkjing spots after 8am. Begins to feel like you're lying to the service pros that call in after awhile. Not made for little companies and different departments are told different things about how the service works,  leading to setting the wrong expectation for the consumer and usually screw them out of their money. Had to leave because it didn't feel morally right. Management sometimes doesn't assist with personal issues, just comes in, works, and leaves. The workplace feels less like supported growth sometimes and more like a competition. For-profit isn't for everyone. You can set the expectation like you're told to tell the service pro they won't get their money back for something that is our policy, and you transfer them to a supervisor and instead of telling them no they just give them the money back. This leads to customers only wanting to speak with a supervisor and not even letting the rep help them which is literally our job and we most likely could do.  Can lead to people who most likely are not escalated becoming ""escalated"" just to get free handouts."

After training you get put on a team. They’ll tell you it’s by personality fit, but sometimes seems to just be random. Teams have imbalances in production based on their manager’s strategy/prospecting ability so some get lucky on a “good team”. Others can get screwed over. 
Only care about 1 month’s retention for a yearly service. Really just a numbers game - no one cares if someone cancels after that. Not a relationship business, one and done.

Unfortunately, despite knowing the risk I took a job here and while people were nice, the environment was fun, and all the other cool stuff HA prides itself in were all pretty much true, these were not enough to gloss over the serious problems that were present. First and foremost, HA has a script that is universal for their hundreds of sales reps. Lies and manipulation are built into this script. While the product you are selling is legitimate and the need and service are above board, the way you are selling it is not honest. For me, I had to choose my integrity over a paycheck-and I wasn't the only one who felt this way. Additionally, all of their leads are people HA has called many times. They pride themselves on having so many in their pipeline, but only after you get in the door do they tell you that these are people who hear from HA all the time which makes your job that much more difficult. Sure, you can make money, but you're just manipulating people who have already said ""no"" into saying ""yes.""

Unfortunately, now account management is being asked to continue to sell a product, renew product and increased pricings of 30 percent on average, for a product they won’t put money into. The product is broken and doesn’t provide the type of quality traffic for its clients the way it once did. Management meetings have been held, multiple employers have voiced all of this at town halls with the new CEO, all of which they brush under the rug. Angie’s List was once an amazing company and something I took pride in when asked what company i worked for. It’s truly sad that even with the merger and the money available to be put back into the product to begin to take care of their clients again that they don’t see what they are asking people to continue to sell is morally wrong.

The strong arm sales tactics were over the top.  

There seemed to be little consultation in the sales process making it difficult to build value.   It did not seem that they had the best interest of the client in mind.

Overall it was a toxic environment.  I have never worked any place quite like it.  I have never worked any place where spoofing your phone number to trick people into answering the phone was needed.  I am perplexed at how they claimed to be ranked a number one employer.  I have noticed that negative reviews seem to disappear from many of the reporting sites.  I also find it interesting that the turnover rate is so high.  It was a terrible experience working at HomeAdvisor. I spent decades in sales and was very successful.  In my professional opinion, Home Advisor lacked all of the essentials of a healthy work environment.  I would recommend steering clear of the place.  They will tell you of the few that are having success and believe me it is few.  They are having success because they receive the better leads.  If you are not one of them you are making hundreds of calls each day to be cursed at or hung up on.  Although most of the leads are bogus with bad data.  It is hard to be successful under those conditions."

Full Disclosure:  I was on an incredible team and came to HomeAdvisor just as they hired a new GM and Vice President of Sales so my view is likely biased towards the positive as they have simply done a great job.  My manager, Drew Coryer, is incredible (as are many of the managers) and was very ""people-first"" in his approach to sales.  That being said, his team had the most sales this past year and constantly strives to improve while retaining reps at all skill levels.  

The only thing I ever sold before HomeAdvisor was a dozen eggs and they taught me how to pitch, have an effective tone, and to make ethical sales while pushing the prospect to come to a decision ""sooner rather than later.""

1618,Angi,"What used to be a special company, is now a terribly company.",2018-03-01,1.0,HCCO Project Advisor,"Accepting, non-judgmental environment, good benefits, and  flexible hours.","They truly neglect this department and it is very unfair. I work  hard every day to carry integrity with me, so this review will be an honest one! During my interview I was literally ""guaranteed"" a certain amount of money when professionally bringing up finances. I thought that was a little weird right off the bat. You should never guarantee someone what their pay will be when working a commissions job. In my interview as well as training, they made it sound like it would be so easy to make commissions. ""So if you are not at work and someone places a request through your link BOOM that's a cross sale for you!""..... never happened. They neglected to tell you A LOT. So basically, I had some of the highest numbers on my team, and never saw a paycheck even close to being enough to pay my rent. Why have they not considered the cost of living increase in Colorado for pay? This is literally labeled as a CUSTOMER SERVICE job. So why is it that when I did my customer service job very well, and went the extra mile to have great customer service and please a customer, I was not rewarded? It's common sense that in order to keep your employees happy, you need to provide positive incentives or at least give them what you say you will. About 90% of the time I would get a cross sale, there would be no contractors available and it would go bronze. I don't need to explain what that means, if you work at this company you know. Then, the other part of the time your cross sales get ""auto credited back"". It could be 20 more bucks or so in your pocket, but nope. You do the work, you don't get the reward apparently is their motto. I just think it's so unfair not to mention any of those obstacles beforehand so you have an idea of what you're getting into. Instead, it's ""MAKING MONEY IS SO EASY HERE."" Except NOT. By the end of my time here, my paychecks were half as much, if not worse than what they started at, even though my numbers were better than ever. Weird how that worked, huh? 

Moving on... there are certain managers here that work very hard and it's really obvious, but it's also clear they were never trained on how to handle situations. So many inappropriate comments, as well as managers huddling together gossiping about employees. While I was there some girl on another team got fired and then rehired for something she didn't even do because the manager made up a story. A common theme there. A few weeks later I also heard that SAME manager before firing someone that day saying ""thank you so much for finding that in her phone calls I have been looking for a reason to get rid of her she's the worst."" I ALSO overheard her talking about partaking in the same thing that she got a previous employee fired for! I do not understand how someone like that is working as a superior! Not all the managers are bad though and the good ones were good, just clearly not trained well. 

I think their thinking process is ""we have four people on the floor making amazing money, so why can't everyone else do that?"" WELL those people have been there for years and years, so they have a lot of corporate accounts, and others had years of sales experience. We didn't even listen to one call in training or learn sales techniques that would help us! 

The final straw for me was when they got us all together for a huge floor meeting to tell us that they are raising all of our requirements (and I mean everything). Expected production went up by a lot, expected numbers, QA expectations, attendance, etc. BUT SURPRISE SURPRISE, there was going to be no pay raise. Not even a dollar, not even a quarter for every bronze list, not even a dollar if you get a bathroom remodel XS that gets ""auto credited"".  At first, it was a fun job where you could be yourself, unscripted, and make the job what you wanted it to be. By the end, I was a blob in a desk wasting my days away miserable, just like everyone else there.

The atmosphere went from light and fun, to everyone constantly angry, always stating how much they hate their job, etc. It was a very hard environment to spend your life in every day. And don't even bother asking for a letter of recommendation, they refuse to do it. One of the hiring managers is extremely rude and aggressive towards employees and I'm not sure how she got the position she did honestly. 

Home advisor is a multi billion dollar company. I know for a fact I brought them a lot of money. At any company, the CEOs always make a lot more, but it is just so greedy and ridiculous that they would bring in millions and millions a year and my department only saw the pennies.

Lastly, I will say that I just cannot work for such an unethical company. It truly is important to me to work for a company that has integrity, I need to go to bed at night feeling confident about the job that I did all day. Well, I didn't. I was constantly talking to people who were just as unhappy with the company as me. I would see other employees wrongly charging contractors, and I truly feel bad that all the contractors are so unhappy. Yeah there are those random success stories, but if you google home advisor the majority of reviews are contractors feeling like they were taken advantage of, and I understand why. 

I am bummed that I had to leave this company only because it has potential. However, I feel like I was worth more as a human and an employee. They spend hundreds of thousands of dollars on cool activities, free soda, end of the quarter pizza and beer parties, but can't pay their employees more than minimum wage. They say they value integrity, but the owner and CEO are clearly ROLLING in money and don't care about anyone else in the company. 

I feel like I could have had a great career here and there was so much potential before everything did a 180 after the Angie's List merge. Pretty much all of the good employees that were there for years quit, and they are being replaced by people with no common sense or people skills. Part of a special company is special people, but they could care whether or not you stay or go even if you're a hard worker and truly bring something special to the company. I'm sure I could think of a million other terrible things about working there but this review is already way too long and I'll stop there"

Upper management really tries to make this job appealing through commission structure and a fun environment.  They treat producers like royalty.,"I’ve done sales for a long time but this is a different animal.  %100 cold calling blue collar unorganized contractors sums this job up to the T.  It’s like taking a steel rake and scraping it over scorched earth in hopes to find new signs of life.  All the leads have been called hundreds of times and everyone you calls knows who Home Advisor is, they’ve all heard the same pitch and value that Home Advisor can bring to their company. 

Don’t get me wrong.  People kill it at Home Advisor and make incredible money.  I just couldn’t stick around long enough."
1621,Angi,Online Sales Consultant,2018-02-20,1.0,Online Sales Consultant,Nothing other than a nice health benefit package and 401k match.,"Churn and burn environment. Required to make 150-200 calls a day to contractors and pressured to have around 3 hours of talk time. Most calls are to disconnected numbers, or they hang up on you as soon as up say you are with Home Advisor. Loud music plays all day. Required to get 8 approved sales within 12 week training period, if you do not make it you will be let go. Constant fear of getting in trouble and no work life balance. Everyone gets two breaks (10:15-10:30 and 3:15-3:30) and lunch is the same time (12-1). Little flexibility to even go to the bathroom outside of a scheduled break. Must provide a doctors note of taking a sick day. Training consists of a few days of classroom training and learning on the sales floor. When you talk with a contractor and think you can get them to close, a manager stands beside you and feeds lines into your ear while listening to your call to help wrangle in the sale. It is very difficult to do this and concentrate because of the loud music in the background and listening to both the contractor and manager at the same time. Unprofessional, managers and trainers will coach employees to lie in order to land a sale. Ultimately not a conducive environment for someone with a family and needing a consistent solid paycheck."
1622,Angi,Worst Management Staff I Have Ever Worked For,2018-02-20,2.0,Sales Representative,The only pro to this job is the ability to make a ton of money if you are good at sales,"Poor management, double standards company, they don't care about the employees, high stress, too much like a call center instead of a sales floor.  The HR department doesn't take anything a rep says seriously.  Had a sexual harassment issue with a manager and even had witnesses who heard all of it and the HR Department called me a liar.  Was targeted because I was the top rep in the center.  This company pretends to care and tells you all the things you want to hear but does not follow through with any of those promises.  They allow people to cheat and get away with commission gaming.  Biggest issue is that they reprimand you for small insignificant things but if you are committing fraud or signing up a contractor with no SSN or skirting the system to get in a Denial legal they will just slap you on the wrist.  This is one of the dirtiest companies I have ever worked for in my entire life.  Do no consider working for this company if you have even a shred of integrity."

-you do not matter to upper management at all. There is a story about how someone quit over a trash can and they tell it like “we’ll take care of you!” Except the fact you aren’t making a livable wage.

1637,Angi,Horrible,2018-01-31,1.0,Inbound Business Customer Care Advisor,You can basically wear whatever you want. That’s it.,"Management sits around and talks about personal situations, while there are customers on hold for management for 10-30 minutes at least. Be prepared to be cussed out from customers and have to deal with it. Customers are threatening, as I would be too if I did business with this company. Sales agents are basically bombarding businesses to join homeadvisor. I saw family for Christmas and Thanksgiving and told them where I worked and they instantly told me they block calls from homeadvisor agents all the time, so embarrassing. Company is a multimillion dollar company but cannot afford parking/parking lot, be prepared to walk and risk the safety of your car. Feel free to mention your safety concerns and they will do nothing about it but tell you “working on it”. You could do 100% everything right and more, and they will calculate your production to be average or below average, some how. Interview will make it sound like an impeccable place to work, but really it is nothing more than below average. Management plays favorites, as there are a lot of family members working basically under or with each other. Do not trust management with personal information, since they sit and socialize and are possibly family members, colleagues will find out your information even if you disclosed it as a private matter to management. People go around giving “high fives” while everyone else is working, and these people are typically “favorites”, and while they are high fiving and spreading germs, your production will somehow still be lower than theirs. PTO is non existent until 6 months of showing up, if you somehow are not human and can be perfect and not get sick or have a family member pass (being sick or family passing before 6 months will count against you). After 6 months of “earning” PTO, you get maybe a weeks worth, which is nothing compared to companies that are actually worth working for. Benefits are from AIC company so they are good, if you make it that far. They say you are a Customer Service Adviser Position but really, you are in a call center position. Very misleading, don’t be fooled like me. Turnover rate is high, for given reasons. People who work there will recommend their company is hiring to just about anyone who ask “who is hiring”. I won’t even put this company on my resume, due to the horrible experience, and how many customer threats I got on the phone. If you accept a job here, be prepared to sit on the phone besides break and lunch (only 30 minutes, while your car is parked 10 minutes away, thats 20 minutes right there just traveling), if you go to the bathroom outside of break and lunch, it will count against you. Other departments make more money, but their production metrics are 60% while other departments are required 85%. You may have a customer that requires extensive conversation with management outside of the phone call-this time will go against your production. Many colleagues there will put customers on hold, while they are just sitting there on their phone or socializing with management or others. I highly suggest not even considering this company."

1668,Angi,"Unless you’re a telemarketer by trade, don’t bother",2017-12-05,2.0,Sales,"Nice office/location, beer, seemingly unlimited funding, awesome people. It supposedly can be very lucrative with the commission structure, but the majority of people quit before they see this and many more don’t make nearly as much commission as advertised as the job is a lot more difficult than advertised.","All of the pros are superficial. The job itself is awful and they know this so they try to make it fun and actually do a decent job. But if you are not cool with being a robot telemarketer in a call center making a crazy amount of cold calls to rude contractors for 8 hours straight, the pros aren’t worth it. Also if you are just making base, there are much easier things to do for that salary and it’s very difficult to consistently make sales. My personal experience is negative because I don’t think I had a great understanding of the job before I started and honestly have had much better jobs before but I don’t think the position or the company is bad at all for the right person. Except for the intentional churn and burn of employees. That is the only thing that I personally find inherently wrong"

They will also gather right behind you to have loud casual conversations. No cubicals make it difficult to hear you call, as well as no noise cancelling head phones. The company has gone cheap on resources for employees such as no actual computer programs, bad head phones, a phone system that constantly fails, no office supplies, mouse pads, or wrist pads for computers. Horrible pay, very low commissions. Bogus incentives for working extra hard. Many shady practices when it comes to how they treat employees.

The ability to move around the company if something else interested you.,The company as a whole never really felt like it had it's act together. Departments had constant change and turn over. The platform didn't work effectively which caused a lot of tension with clients because they didn't have confidence in the product we were giving them. It seemed as if leadership was never truly informed on what was going on with the company and we were constantly just told to stay flexible.

Handy has been bleeding talent as people find more interesting and positive work where the stock options are more likely to matter. 

The hours are just about always long/late, and if you actually take a normal 10 minute break, you're seen as uncommitted, addressed by your manager, and it's a black mark. 

It doesn't matter how much you've actually contributed, just how good you looked doing 'something' and how much credit you've taken. 

No matter how many times people bring up the fact that both providers and customers are getting screwed and are unhappy and we ought to think about how we could better serve them, the only conversation the uppers have is how to better control them, pay the providers less money, collect more fees, and squeeze more out of customers."

Management gave me a hard time for a PTO request for a dentist appointment when I still had plenty to use for such things.  Now they’re close to the acquisition by IAC taking place, and of issuing (yet another round of) layoffs with a severance, now they’re offering those employees a much lower position with lower compensation and forcing them to quit so they don’t have to pay out severances.  Their technology is antiquated and fails often, service providers hate Angie’s List because we bombard them with phone calls that they don’t want to receive, constant changes in business practices, teams have to move around all the time (literally about every 2-3 months)...

I came for the opportunities to help the company move into the stage.,What I found was good intentioned people who had been there WAY too long and were just moved from department to department without the necessary skills to actually do the job. There is no career advancement opportunities just lateral moves and unjustified titles. My favorite part was the people - they are good people and most work hard and want to better the company.

LOTS of favoritism here, and some directors only promote men. Lots of bros tossing the football around during the day, and very little is done to actually work with their employees. Most of their day to day is putting out fires in our system, and when they're not doing that, they walk around and just talk. They get paid a lot, and many managers here are clueless on how to actually manage.

They are constantly investing in different ways to improve the working environment, the culture, and the ""team"" mentality. They have an A+ commission structure- you make a lot of money if you do it well, and constant incentives for sales- vacations, cash, 5-star dinners, etc. On the same topic, they have crazy good benefits and a matching 401(k.) They really are a fantastic group of people to work with, and I have yet to be disappointed.","You have to work hard. This is not a ""sit down and collect your pay"" kind of job. Yes, you may get a salary, but if you are looking for 6 figures you have to put in the effort.  It is not telemarketing. There is also no micro-managing- you have to dial the phone, you're in control of who you talk to, you ultimately are in charge of your paycheck- no one else. Managers help, coach, and guide as much as possible, but it's such an independent job. I like this aspect- it keeps me coming back every day- but i could see how some personalities wouldn't mesh well."

I have witnessed so many positive changes to this company in my time here and it is great to be apart of it.  Our location has grown tremendously in the year we have been at this office and its great to witness all the growth and opportunities that come with it. I have worked at many call centers in my time and I would have to say this is by far the best job I have ever had. The management team all the way from the top of the chain to the bottom are always there. This company makes you feel like you actually have a home and that you aren't just another seat filler.

They are in survival mode.  The benefits are average.  High deductible and their ""free clinics"" are challenging to get in to.  I agree with the comment that we are either ""hitting the brakes"" or ""accelerating quickly"".   Good, strong leadership with a clear vision, and transparency, is needed.   50% of the managers should not be managers.   We still have some work to do, or Home Advisor will be doing it for us.   My service providers are somewhat optimistic about the merger with Home Advisor, but they believe that Angie's List has better customer service, and they like having an assigned Client Success Manager.  (that has changed recently on certain levels) . They do not like the ""wait times"" constant badgering , or Home Advisor's customer service.  They DO like the product and the leads they receive.  It should be an interesting marriage, and executed properly, Angie Home Services will be a strong contender in the Home Services Industry."
1794,Angi,Inside Senior Consultant Representative,2017-07-07,5.0,Senior Consultant,"My experience with Home Advisor has been one of the best experiences I'll ever have when it comes to working with great people in an amazing environment.  The training is a staple point to the success that brews from within and the close one on one meetings with management is always there for you.  You get what you put in and it isn't much to ask for especially with the amount of serious money you can make, you will never be able to go to work wearing shorts and make over 5K with the amazing benefits they offer.  This job makes you want to excel and continue to grow and the opportunity to advance to management is something that can be achieved if you are willing to put the work in.  I appreciate that the door is always open no matter if it's a personal or professional matter from the management to directors, they treat you like family which is something that I'm grateful for. Anyone out there wondering if sales is something you want to pursue I strongly advice that you give Home Advisor a chance you won't believe how much you will get out of a place like this!","None, you get what you put in simple as that."

Decent pay IF bonuses are earned.  Otherwise ... it's just 11.00 per hour to take calls from angry customers.

Sales agents are fired if they do not make at least three sales per week.  This is causes them to send incomplete information to other departments.  Enrollment had to work Saturdays because of management greed.

You have the opportunity to make real good money here. Great atmosphere. Free lunch and dinner.  Also free booze.,It is sales so it has it's ups and down.

1804,Angi,"Online Marketing Consultant ""Sales""  Review",2017-06-19,5.0,Senior Sales Representative,"I have been at HomeAdvisor for almost a year and a half and have been in the same role as Online Marketing Consultant (Sales). I have had many positions in my life but this is the first one in the corporate world. I never had any experience with sales before this job and it has taught me so much. Not just about work but life in general. The training program is unreal. You learn so much in training and you continue to learn more and more every day from different people. A pro at HomeAdvisor is that everyone is there to help you. You can ask a fellow salesperson a question or a manger or even a director a question and they are there to help. I also feel comfortable walking into to the VP of Sales office. 
This job is sales and your job is to sell so if you are a person that always wants to get better then you will do very well here and you can make a lot of money. I view this job similar to running your own business. You are very much part of a team but the bottom line is that if you don’t make sales you are not going to be making your money. You need to have that drive and desire to succeed because you are doing the same thing day in and day out. 
Incentives are amazing. You get free lunch and dinner which saves so much money and you can still eat healthy. There are great contests with Sporting events, concerts and paid days off. I have friends that work in sales at other companies and the top Sales Reps are always the ones winning the prizes but here at HomeAdvisor everyone has a chance to win. For example if you make a certain number of sales in a time period you get a raffle ticket and it is chosen at random. It gives you incentive to just get into the raffle and its anyone’s chance to win.
The Company is growing at an insane rate and there is plenty of room to grow. In my year and a half at HomeAdvisor I have seen at least 6 people be promoted to a Manager position.","This job is a Grind. If you are looking for a job that you can just show up to and breeze by this is not for you. You are cold calling Contractors every day. Your putting up over 3 hours of talk time and making 150 dials a day. You will have weeks where you make zero sales and think the world is over and you will have weeks where you make 5 sales and your on top of the world. Its mentally draining sometimes but when you get your check at the end of the pay period it makes you want more. 
The office is young. A lot of people right out of college which keeps it fun but sometimes it gets very loud and obnoxious. That being said you will meet some amazing people who love to have fun."

A support team that is unbelievable. The best part of working here is that the company not only understands that you are human, but that life happens.",The positive influence is so infectious that it is too easy to take on more than you are capable of handling; you might have to realize your limitations faster than expected.

1808,Angi,Honest Review,2017-06-17,5.0,Senior Sales Associate,Great atmosphere and culture. Upper management is very supportive and enthusiastic about keeping all employees happy with perks and money incentives,"It's a grind day in and day out. If you don't put in the work, you will not succeed.  Get ready to call a ton of contractors."
1809,Angi,"What it feels like to look forward going into work everyday, and feel genuinely happy",2017-06-16,5.0,Project Advisor,"Home Advisor is a wonderful organization that prides itself most in taking care of it's employees and customers. I have never before worked for a company that takes such incredible care of those who work there! The benefits are amazing,  but even more than that, Home Advisor recognizes each employee as an individual with differing lifestyles, needs, etc. Home Advisor goes above and beyond in providing a culture that incomparable to anywhere else I have been employed. Walking in the doors you immediately recognize this culture and its often times what hooks people in. They want to be a part of the family here. I feel truly appreciated at Home Advisor. I feel appreciated through many avenues such as my compensation, the benefits, and the opportunities I am given to grow within this booming company. I love what I do. I leave every day feeling good about myself and good about the work I did that day. I feel included in company decisions, and they're always looking for feedback and suggestions to continue to improve our business. My co workers are more than co workers or friends; we truly are a family here. We care for one another both professionally and personally, and management is exactly the same. The work/personal life balance is excellent. Home Advisor understands life happens and works very hard for it's employees. It's a very special place to work, and because we are growing so rapidly, I hope to see more new faces coming through our doors!","Due to our rapidly growing business there are two separate areas to park. Tenured employees have parking passes for the parking lot; unfortunately the property managers only allotted us a certain number of parking spots in the lot. So when you first start, you do park in the second parking area, and a shuttle brings you over to the building. It's an easy enough system, and flawless in what it does. Just a heads up! I thought it would be more of a 'turn off'; but every single person that has been hired since we implemented this system has said it's not a big deal, especially when compared with all that they receive here; it's hardly a thought at all."
1810,Angi,Best Decision I've Made for my Career,2017-06-16,5.0,Senior Sales Representative,"So a little bit about me. I've had 8 different jobs before I started working at HomeAdvisor, however this is my first job in sales. Before this job I worked doing fundraising for a non-profit company and received very little training/support to be successful. I didn't see a lot of success financially (non-profits don't really take care of you) so I applied to a few different sales jobs because I studied entrepreneurship in college, and I was looking for an environment that would challenge me and make me more effective as an employee while allowing me to finally make more money the better I was at my job. From the moment I started, I received training, had an amazing group of friends, and started slowing seeing success while here. My first year working here I made over $85k and even then I knew that I was selling myself short. I went through a few ups and downs and it was mostly because to be honest, I had bad work habits (waking up late, and not putting the effort that I knew I needed to.) After my first year working here, I realized that a lot of my issues with the workplace came from my own inability to put my head down and just focus while i'm here. I saw a huge jump in my work ethic, my positivity not just on the phone, but also with my teammates, and I quickly became a standout leader for my group. This year, I've already made 70k by June and am on pace to make over 140k if I continue working the way I am now. Even now I know I can work more efficiently from 9-6pm, so I'm not worried about that compensation going down. I am blessed to have gotten the opportunity to not just try, but also to fail, receive feedback from my managers and peers, and ultimately, turn the ship around for myself. I went through a burnout phase similar to what many first time sales reps go through. But if you are committed to working hard, and not blaming others for your failures, you'll see a breakthrough here. No matter who you are, what you look like, and how ""cool"" you are. Our best sales rep is extremely quiet and sticks to himself. So in other words, if you're a negative person, you'll dwell on the reasons why you can't succeed here. But if you're committed to becoming a good sales person, you'll push through the setbacks (denied sales, fast paced environment, young crowd of sales reps and managers getting better together) and hit whatever goals you set for yourself.","- Young Sales Floor: While this isn't a Con per se, there are a lot of people where this is their first job out of college, so they don't know how to hold themselves accountable. It's VERY easy to get distracted here, make friends, and not take the job seriously. 
- Busy office: Our company is growing very fast, sometimes too fast in my opinion. It's an open office environment, with 4 foot tall plush banana toys, soccer balls, funny posters, baseball bats,  free beer, cool people, and people pitching hard all day. It's great for energy, but sometimes I wish I had my own office like Ken (he's the cool boss guy with the glass office.) Then again, I probably would watch Youtube videos all day if left to my own devices... (just being honest).
- Dim lighting: We're getting a new office in August across the street from MSG that's gonna be twice as big and everything will be brand new, but for now, I'm not a fan of the lighting in here. It's really just an aesthetic thing, also our carpet needs some updating.
- Fast Changing Environment: There's so much happening right now with our company (going public, people being hired/promoted, us moving to a new office) that it's hard to not get distracted by it all. While they're all positive changes for the company, it takes faith to know that things are only going to change for the better for us as individual employees of the company."
1811,Angi,Inside Sales Rep,2017-06-16,4.0,Inside Sales Representative,"If you have a lot, a little, or no sales experience HomeAdvisor is the place to be employed. From the day you are hired until the day you leave you will constantly be learning. The corporate training managers (Chuck & Corey) are one of the best in the business. Once you leave their training program and head into the inferno selling HomeAdvisor's product and interacting with potential clients is like second nature. However, the teaching and learning doesn't stop there the head of the training inferno,Dan, is one of the best sales coach around. The V.P. (Ken), directors (Kevin, Kyle, & Josh), and managers (Joey, Mike, Erik, Brian, Erica, just to name a few) are professional, resourceful, and also know how to have fun being that sales can be a stressful environment. I would definitely recommend working at HomeAdvisor, if you have the opportunity to do so.","The only Con is the connection between managers and their reps. There should be more hands on interaction between management and their reps. Managers do deal with 10-12 reps per team, however the managers should be capable of prioritizing his or her team for every individual rep."

Free beer and wine on tap (although I don't drink) and the ""ability"" to make uncapped commission.","Absolutely horrible. Drug problem rampant all over the office, everyone is smoking pot and getting high selling and distributing drugs and pills. They push you to make sales and call the same contractors over and over again. They are crued and unprofessional towards employees, management seems to be a little racist as well (in my opinion). They don't really have a ""do not call list"" because as an employee I ended up calling contractors, essentially harassing them because they had been asked to be put on the do not call list 10-20 times and I was still being told to pitch these people. Management has no idea what they're doing, they're so busy hiring ex convics and junkies that they don't notice all of their employees are miserable. The company is a scam. They push these sales by having managers scream into the ear of trainees, and then adjusting the accounts of the contractors just to make sure the sale gets approved (without the contractors permission of course). Management is never available to talk or help and the HR office is a joke. I can't even begin to explain how I lasted as long as I did. This company needs to be shut down because they're legit running a scam. One of the worst companies I've ever worked for. They expect you to be eerily robotic every single day with this thing they call ""PMA"" or positive mental attitude. It's actually kind of creepy. Avoid this place at all costs, go to a different internet start up. They all have free food. 


PS. They say they have an A+ rating on the BBB but i know for a fact they paid for it because last I checked it was a B-. 

PPS: I was fired because I have multiple mental illnesses and although I was one of the best sales people that had ever walked through those doors they discriminated against me and my illnesses and fired me because of them. Never ever had such a bad experience with an employee"

Training is thorough and as long as you're able to look passed the downsides of the cold calling target market for this service (I.e. Grown men cursing you out over the phone and via email) then you can make more here than at any other entry level position.  The company offers a lot of incentives and great contests that help to keep reps motivated for success.  I really enjoyed my time here for the year that I stayed.  I was able to take some of the skills I learned here and land a role I probably could not have earned without this experience under my belt.,You really have to get lucky when they place you on a team.

1828,Angi,Client Success Manager,2017-06-01,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"Decent pay, good work hours (if you're in the right market)","Where to begin....I worked on the service provider side with advertising, so this is all related to that side....the monthly goals are set up for someone to fail from the start, when certain things that are out of your control and have nothing to do with you, affect your paycheck, but the company just won't do anything about it. The company has their own agenda....all about the money. They are trying to sell based on a dream, since the product itself for service pros, just doesn't work, selling thousands and thousands of dollars in advertising, that has zero return on their investment, but again, the negative impact is thrown onto the individual, and the company takes all liability off themselves. It's no secret that Angie's List has been in trouble, but yet the company continues to act like everything is gold, and just does not admit that they there are problems. For companies that spend thousands a year, and they still provide a product that yields no return for most. They train with the idea of actually selling on belief vs selling on results. Almost every conversation with the pros is negative in tone, no results, no return...this is a daily constant, so if you enjoy getting yelled and cursed at for 8 hours a day, and not being able to do anything about it, then this is a perfect job for you. Their selling process has certain points where you just have to lie to sell it, the company knows it, and they're ok with it, in fact, they push it. The managers put very high stress, and threatening career behaviors into driving results, and when that doesn't work, they lean on the belief that it's all the individuals fault, and take no blame on their own. The upper management within this department is awful; doesn't listen to feedback, doesn't show care or concern for the individuals, and doesn't seem to understand what we actually do, day to day. Leaders placed processes into place, that actually hindered our department from being successful (many is proprietary so I can't explain them), and continues to lay off great people because of it.

It seems he only signed on to AL to make it fail and take a payout. Meanwhile, he devastated tons of employees' livelihoods. Sizable layoffs are a common thing now (or laying people off in chunks over several weeks), people live in fear of being called into an unplanned meeting only to be met with a layoff. Morale is very poor and most people are looking for other opportunities. They are a fan of laying off the more senior & experienced staff in favor of cheaper, inexperienced workers. The product itself is already shoddy, so enlisting inexperienced employees is a very poor decision.  This makes it difficult to advance in the company.   They don't respect any of their values to lower level employees, and it's obvious that this one-time fun, growing company has turned into nothing but a corporate greed machine -- doing whatever it takes to feed dollars into executives' pockets. I don't expect the company to be around in 2018 since it's been sold to HA and layoffs have been accelerated."

You basically see every college educated person being walked out because they don't want intelligent people in the office. They are looking for people who eat up the BS they feed the sales department. Once you realize that the company robs contractors blind, it is a very difficult product to sell. I worked at Home Advisor for over three years and worried that they were going to fire me every single week. You get prospects to call, however these prospects have been called every day for the last fifteen years. There were times that I was calling Red Roof Inns just because they scrub the internet to find anything with a word relating to home improvement.

As far as the goals you need to hit.... Sure, three sales per week sounds easy. But keep in mind, you are calling people in the home improvement industry. If they have a criminal record or a financial issue in their past and you spend hours, days, or sometimes weeks trying to sell them, the sale won't go through and you are back to clawing for another one to keep your job. This is why so many of the successful sales reps flat out lie. Upper management knows this and will look the other way if you are consistently successful at selling, but if you are a low level rep and get caught lying during a sale you will be terminated (as well you should be). My point is, if you want to not worry about your job you have to be comfortable with robbing people. I see all of this stuff about Wells Fargo in the news and think of Home Advisor every time. It is such an aggressive sales culture that you need to use any means necessary to get your weekly quota, which in turn, hurts the people you that buy the product.

Management has no experience at all. For the most part, they are not college educated. They do ""coaching"" with you because they are required to by their supervisors, but it is useless. Usually you just listen to a call recording of yours and they tell you what you did wrong. Again, they would be better off in a daycare supervising children.

Lastly, don't believe the good reviews you see.  About six months ago they started encouraging employees to go on Glassdoor and leave a good review. Lol. What a joke.

I could go on for days about why you should avoid this company, but I think I've provided enough information for potential employees. RUN AWAY. Drive for Uber or something until you find a better, more secure sales position."

You get ""gifts"" from the company but are taxed on them. They also distract the employees all time to make up for the lack pay raises that should be recieved. Not a lot of room to move up, you can mover lateral but it's hard to make real money. Not even the managers make that much so there is not incentive to try and get promoted."
1864,Angi,Client Success Manager / Account Manager,2017-04-20,1.0,Client Success Manager,Lots of good people at the rep level. On site gym. Good benefits. Pays well for those without technical skills or a college degree.,"It's a mass exodus. Most people in the department are looking for employment elsewhere, despite the good pay. You are treated with zero (maybe less than zero) respect by senior management and even your direct manager if you aren't lucky enough to get one of the 20% that are good managers. Most managers are just ""Yes Men"" who do what stupid idea upper management has instead of providing feedback or actual thoughtful insight. You have weekly ""talk time"" expectations. They aren't unreasonable, but no adjustments are made to the requirement should you have meetings, PTO less than 4 hours, time off the phone to complete required HR training, etc. If you don't meet your ""talk time"", you get written up for that week. 4 write ups and you're fired. To get out of the a single warning, you need 4 consecutive weeks of meeting the requirement. This is a requirement for everyone, regardless of if you have 300 accounts or 100 accounts. The ""talk time"" also factors into your ""Scorecard"" score which is a spreadsheet that tries to calculate how good you are at your job and ranks you against your peers. It is a document available to everyone in the department. If you produce better sales numbers than someone else but they were on the phone longer, they could be ranked ahead of you. The ""Scorecard"" was arbitrarily created without any correlation or relevance to actual sales performance. This ""Scorecard"" also determines if you are written up. Even the top rep in the department is stressed out because he/she has to meet ""talk time"" even if they've talked to every account within a month. You are required to clock in/out when you arrive, leave, and go to lunch even though this is a salaried position. There is literally zero ongoing skill and professional development. They laid off most of their training staff in November 2016, stopped using Lushin Sales Consulting for sales development in 2015, etc. They force you to use a Salesforce app called Gainsight that is supposed to be used as a ""call to action"" tool, but they've turned into another way to control your every move. You have hundreds of these ""call to actions"" for your month that make your job completely inefficient. If you're still following along, everything in this department is based on fear of losing your job, and they control every aspect of your day. Think about this - in May 2016 the department reorganized from Account Management to Client Success. They hired 24 senior-level client success managers to handle the best accounts. This was supposed to be a big promotion to retain top talent. In less than a year 19 Senior Client Success Managers are gone. That's turnover over 80% for their best reps! And NO ONE CARES. Not a single senior-level, director-level, or VP has been fired. Think you can do your job better with some actual individualism and skill? Sorry for you!
This is all just the human part of your job. Now let's talk about the product. As other reviewers mention, the advertising doesn't work. the web site is a joke. Most clients you talked to are pissed off. Management tells you to tell the client that it's going to get better and sign up for some extra programs. Isn't it just insane that a client that could be spending $10,000 a year has to sign up for more programs to even have a glimpse of hope that their investment will work? You'll hear a lot about how many members Angie's List has now since it's free. But no ones makes mention of how the number of active users and searches continues to decline. They also deceive shareholders and business with how many ""members"" they actually have because they count two members for every person that signs up since there are typically two people per household. 5 million members? Actually it's 2.5 million users since why on Earth would a husband and wife both search for the same project. 

TL;DR The only way you should work here is if you are unemployed or have never made over $60,000 a year. Everyday you will ask yourself why you do this to yourself. There's been 3 lay offs within 6 months. There might not be an Angie's List by the end of summer."

-antiquated technology. It's like rubbing two sticks together. 
-Not competitive in their own sector which they basically created! Exec leadership missed the boat several years ago and now it's too late to fix it. Even if it wasn't too late, they don't put the money where it needs to be to fix the biggest problems. They can't seem to drive more people to the site, which is ok because the site is very buggy because they rushed it to market. 
-Amoral leaders who only care about money, no matter whom they have to lie to or deceive. 
-Incredibly poor decision making on behalf of executives. 
-Ad sales people's main responsibility is to say as little as possible about the truth of the product. There is a lot of deception of the advertiser base.
-Client Success' main responsibility is to beg the advertisers to stay with the advertising once they find out they've been fleeced. The system is stacked hard against new advertisers, so it is stacked hard against Client Success. 
-Management is more concerned with people being on the phone for 90 minutes per day than they are with them hitting renewal goals. You can get fired in four weeks for not hitting talk time, but you can last almost forever there without hitting goal.
-The number of people in the Client Success department who have had to go on antidepressants is shocking. The free clinic that Angie's List provides had to start staffing someone to deal with all the depression cases. 
-The management is very adversarial, constantly trying to find new ways to retaliate against employees who speak their mind.

The sales organization and everyone else on campus. Sales organization has a constant battle with other departments for no reason other than policy have not kept up with the times and change in technology. WAY TOO MUCH CHANGE in all aspects of the business. Lack of money to drive marketing and drive traffic to benefit advertisers. Company has a hard time retaining top talent because of the decisions made by management causing them to quit or because they were let go to cut costs. Management at all levels makes bad decision rather than asking the employees for feedback before making the decision. Company initiatives constantly change. Management knows communication is a problem yet doesn't understand how to solve it. Its sad when employees have to hear about company events from the media or their own clients before the company comes out and tells the employees. Angie's list only thinks in terms of green lights and red lights but never seems prepared for the yellow light. Company either floors it and gets hit in the intersection or slams on the brakes and gets hit from behind. Angie's List is a technology company that can't seem to get it right. Read the reviews for the member and business owner app and keep in mind most traffic these days comes from mobile so if you cant get that right then obviously you will have problems. Or doe a search for a roofer in Indianapolis and notice how there are 20+ paid advertisers on the first page showing saturation among advertisers (google might have 5 aid advertisers on the first page). Company will likely be bought out in 2017 early 2018 for cheap after declining the sale of the company to Home Advisors parent company. Company turn around is not happening as expected (you will see more and more articles written about this) so expect alot of change the next few quarters leading up to a sale as they further cut costs and likely more employees. That being said I enjoy working at Angie's list now only because of the compensation. Employee loyalty has significantly declined over the years because of the issues I mentioned above.

Sold vision from Senior management","Front End Developers all kind of do their own thing which is good and bad. The UX is really poor so as a developer you are free to design a lot of core things that the UX team ignores. But with that means a lot of refactoring after Product or UX decide they don’t like what you did.  A lot of tech debt and since everyone kind of does their own thing, its constant refactoring. The FE Leadership lacks personnel management skills so it’s kind of a weird dynamic. Definitely not a team feel, more of everyone out for themselves.
 
The UX department is kind of a mess which has a big impact on development. Hire turnover, mass walkouts, lack of focus on basic UX practices all of which shows in the poor user experience. Too much drama over petty things like where people sit and who is using who’s chairs vs focusing on the actual user design. One designer wants a user experience one way, and then another designer tries to out do the other so you’re constantly refactoring code to keep up with their inconsistency. Until they get stronger UX leadership, and better designs your life as a developer will be pretty miserable.
 
Management has a good vision, it’s the middle managers where this company struggles.  The company is going from medium size to the big time and so there are a lot of managers that aren’t able to make that transition and grow people.  But there are a lot of smart people so I think they will figure it out in time."

1916,Angi,Be Adaptable to Change in Discovery,2017-01-29,3.0,Discovery Representative,"Great work environment with a lot of people who really do care about you despite the bad approach at times 
Casual atmosphere and dress code
Management is always accessible and welcoming, open to offering advice and assistance
On-site gym, cafeteria, convenience stores in the Landmark building
PTO allowance is liberal, but this is the third large company I've worked for and that fact isn't unusual
Manage your own accounts and create your own focus plan day-to-day when making calls
Angie's List has become more equally focused on helping businesses as they have been for Members and that helps sell the advertising products
Website and technology improvements are better for service providers than previously and hopefully that trend continues","Micro management daily from above brings down morale and creates more stress in an already stressful sales environment - each day is it's own day
Goals are somewhat attainable, but not consistently across the board for the majority of employees in the department over the course of multiple months - more follow-up training is definitely welcomed
Large fluctuations in compensation from month-to-month in the Discovery role when the conversion/close rate is largely out of our hands and dependent upon the SSC's motivation and skills. Since the previous team aspect is now gone, they seem to care less because that accountability isn't there. I don't know many of the SSCs in fact and that's an important factor
Account management reps have said many times that Discovery reps are getting screwed compensation-wise with a several thousand dollar difference between the two roles each month (think $300 vs $6000 conservatively) - show some respect for the top performing reps who do what is often described by management as the most difficult role in sales at Angie's List 
Consistently cold-calling companies that have said many times they aren't interested or they don't perform residential work - high self-interest is bad for customer service and the face of the company"

My accounts would refuse to call customer service either because their issue was not addressed/resolved or a rep was disrespectful.

You're given the opportunity to get a six figures a year, which isn't usually an option without a degree in most fields. They offer a base salary which is comforting for those weeks where the sales just don't come. There's also free coffee and the occasional happy hour which is a huge bonus. They were gracious enough to give us an 11 day vacation over the holiday season.","After the six week training period, this place has fallen short for me. If you can manage to get yourself on the hot leads list for the week, you can be very successful. If you're close with a manager, you'll probably do well here. For the rest of us there isn't much of a chance to succeed. For their top performers, managers will work accounts and call service professionals to close sales.

The leads I've received have often been called 20+ times or are disconnected numbers. I feel like they're running out of businesses to call, but reserve accounts with any sort of potential for those that have already proven themselves. I can understand the reasoning for that, but it severely limits the opportunities for your newer sales reps.

There isn't much job security. If you fail to meet your biweekly goals, there is always the chance for termination. It's a stressful and frustrating environment if your sales are not up to budget.

Favoritism among managment runs rampant. It's difficult to get with the ""in"" crowd. If you're lucky enough to be accepted, you'll definitely make good money here."

They manage with fear, always leaving you questioning if you have a future there.  They promote from the favorites and have some questionable management in place.  A churn and burn customer business model.  Most customers are unhappy with the product and leads and Homeadvisor milks small business and families from what little profit they make off the leads.  Sales is horrible, they knowingly lie to customers, voice log them into contractual agreements and when the contractor is unhappy or unclear, tries to dispute the bad leads or the horrible sales rep that scammed them they send them to collections.  The most common sales pitch is they don't pay for the leads unless they win the job.  Companies sign up to find out they pay for EVERY lead and rack up hundreds if not thousands of dollars in stale, rehashed leads they purchase from 3rd parties."

I was a kid from NY who moved to CO on a whim, I had nothing. No direction, no plan, no goal in mind, I was just hungry. Simply working here has transformed me from a boy to a man.

Kevin was extremely helpful to our team.  He had enough energy for 4 managers!  He was always willing to go that extra mile and spend time with us to tune in our own talents, compiled with suggestions of his own. He had a heart for teaching and was always pushing us to be better.","It is cold-calling and that in itself is a challenge. Maintaining the urgency was key,  and sometimes it was a challenge getting the contractor to understand the importance of doing it now,  getting your company out there to be seen.  You run into the typical objections,  it just boiled down to showing them the value."
1970,Angi,Buyer Beware,2016-11-11,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"Scheduling can be flexible
Benefits are above average
Dress code is casual","Rotating leads pulled from competitor websites and not cultivated in house (Facebook, YP, Google, Angie's List, Yelp, BBB, etc.) providing little opportunity to sell via relationship building. Reps are assigned new leads daily if they choose but since many numbers listed on other sites are bad or tracking numbers it is not unusual to make 150 calls in a day and only dial 50-75 working numbers. 

There are no territories assigned and standard business ethics are often ignored in terms of deal protection both of which lead to sales constantly being stolen from reps.

Close rates on sold deals are roughly 60% meaning that roughly 1/3 of sales are not paid on. There are many, many reasons a rep may not be paid for selling an account. Reps work up front, do their job by enrolling a new service provider, and because it is discovered after the work is done and the account is sold that any one of dozens of issues exist (many of which cannot be fixed and are not in rep control) leading to hours of work being done with zero commission compensation. 

If scorched earth selling is your thing, you have little conscience in terms of ensuring post-sale success, are uber aggressive with an insanely short sales cycle (stems from a two week pay period), and have no qualms bulldozing over SMB owners using deceit and half truths when enrolling them without their realization only to ask for a SSN or CC before they are aware of what you're doing and being rewarded for doing so then you may consider this a pro. 

SMB owners must change their business practices if they want Home Advisor to be a success for them. They must drop what they are doing no matter to call leads back immediately regardless of time of day or night. Lead credit systems are terribly flawed and bad leads are sent to and paid for by service providers all the time. The logic is simple: sell a ton of leads to business owners knowing that a large percentage of them will actually lead nowhere while banking on the hope that these already busy people won't go through the hassle of requesting or fighting for a $20 credit."

As long as the quarterly goals were being met or exceeded, the most generous amount of freedom was extended for the advertising sales employees to work flexible hours.

Great people!","Call center; large, bureaucratic -- they have inertia and are too established to be receptive to innovation, change, etc (as much as they try)

Not a lot of integrity across the org -- reps are incentivized to find loopholes and do whatever they can to make sales

Commission structure is non-competitive and unfair; they cannot attract top-talent if they don't fairly compensate those who drive revenue

Outdated business model - no specialized sales roles, no territories, no divisions (SMB, mid-market, enterprise, etc)

Back-end ops cannot keep up with sales growth - product does take advantage of many of the clients they purport to serve. Need a lot of modernization and growth here."

There are many talented employees who want to make an impact.,"The engineering department is set in it's ways in many respects. They recently did a fairly significant reorg that is a step in the right direction, but there is still a decent amount of bureaucracy. Upper management has a desire to iterate quickly, as do many employees at the individual contributor level, but middle management has a desire to cover their behind with a preference towards being perfectionist and with an insistence that every bit of work be analyzed to death.

What used to be a laid back company that gave the feel of working for a poor mans Facebook now has a Wal Mart of the tech-world atmosphere.  The new CEO only cares about photo ops and ridiculous sunglasses.  Management here has largely nothing to do, so they focus on the most tedious and trivial things possible.  Morale here is at an all time low. Everything is disappearing rapidly.  We went from the most loose culture I've experienced to having CCTV placed over things like paper plates and spoons.

Tons of felons who can't pass the background check or they don't have a social security number. This job is for people with very thick skin who speak fluent Hee Haw and Spanish. 

 Not enough words to express how unprofessional this adult day care center is. The absolute most vulgar rap music so loud you can't hear yourself talking to customers banging constantly.

If you can sell, you can make great money here.  That's it for the pros, seriously.","Yikes, where do I start?  Oh yeah, the People.  Upper Managment in sales is the worst.  I have no idea how the VP or some of the directors have not only jobs there, but the titles they have.  Most of the sales managers don't care one bit, the good ones have left because they weren't part of the crew, the ones that remain are drunk or high or both.  I've seen a manager drooling at his desk, and nothing happened but I've seen reps who work their tails off get fired for the smallest of things.  There's always a sense of ""high schoolness"" there.  Again, they've either fired the best managers, they left, or they've been demoted.  Everyone, even managers, walk around with a literal number on their head because most of the managers and above couldn't care less about the employees.

I thought it was a great company for the first year or year and a half, until late 2015. But most of the reasons to like it are superficial and wear thin after a while, like the ""culture"" of forced fun or the thrill of wearing jeans every day. You can find that stuff elsewhere, guys. The insurance benefits package is pretty good, still. I'll give them that. It's a high-deductible plan but the premiums are low. And a lot of the employees are genuinely great people. The pay is really good in SOME positions.","I won't repeat all of the same things other people are saying here. Just know that most of the criticisms other people have posted, I agree with. One that stand out for me was the total lack of focus. Every month it was a new initiative. Everything was disorganized. There was insufficient managerial spine when handling misbehaving supervisors. Our department didn't trust HR.

The CEO is not friendly, unlike the prior one, and does not care about cultivating inclusion or health. He even rolled back anti-smoking initiatives by adding smoking stations inside the campus. Who does that in 2016? I'm not looking for the CEO to be my buddy, but to go from an incredibly inclusive person who seemed to know everyone's name, to this guy... yeah.

It is a lot harder to move up than it used to be, so don't apply to the call center thinking you'll just be there 6 months and then you'll move into the role you really want. Also, just don't apply to the call center. Those poor people get worked to the bone.

Attempts to transfer to another department were met with harsh admonishment."

Matt is the best manager there by far. Omar is pretty cool too. The pros even out the cons.","For expecting to give ""proper expectations"" to service professionals, they certainly did NOT give proper expectations upon hire or during training. I was in training for a couple weeks, then on the sales floor. For almost 3 months, the only expectation was to get as many sales as possible. You should have  about 3 hours of talk time or better and have a minimum of 150 dials per day. It seemed during training that sales were easy to get. However, once on the floor, I quickly found that it was not that simple. We didn't find out until month 3 that sales quota was actually a requirement to maintain employment. Knowing this and wanting a good paycheck every two weeks, I obviously strived to do so however, it wasn't as simple as originally made out to be.
Work/life balance is NOT promoted as much as expected. I had great attendance in comparison to MANY employees. I only missed 4 or 5 days due to a car accident and a day of being sick. But was given grief for arriving to work late by 5 to 10 minutes on only a couple occasions due to unforeseen and uncontrollable circumstances at home. Notification was given to management and they still gave me warnings about attendance."

Working with HomeAdvisor has been some of the best years in my sales career. You have a training program that establishes a great foundation for you. Management is some of the best I've ever worked with. They never hesitate to jump on the phones and show you how it's done. Your Directors are up and down the rows high fiving and talking with everyone, even coaching you if needed. I've never felt so excited about the direction of the company, the culture is awesome, and can't say enough about the leadership always going above and beyond to find ways to reengage us with uplifting meetings, words of encouragement, contests, cash spiffs, awards, trophies... the list goes on.

Don't try to go to the bathroom if it's not during your 10am break, 12pm lunch, or 3pm break, you will be questioned as to why you were away from your desk (unless you're a smoker). Smile and Dial is not the way to keep happy and good employees. Also, if you call in sick and don't have a Dr's note it will be unexcused and you will get written up! Same goes for a snow day...god forbid you don't feel safe driving in. A VP will actually announce that you live in CO and better be there or they can find someone else who wants to be there. You can work your butt off to make a submit but you will not get paid if there are reasons, out of your control, that it does not go through.

When you walk into the front doors of Home Advisor, you instantly feel happy, and if you don't, then trust me when I say, THAT IT IS YOU . . . AND ""NOT"" THE COMPANY!!   
So, a little bit about myself.  I started working for HA as a Sales Consultant.  Coming into the company, I was POSITIVE, that I was going to be the next #1 sales consultant.  As time went on, it became pretty apparent that I wassss nottttt going to be the #1 sales consultant, or a sales consultant at all within the company.  I was drowning, and fast.  And please let me start by saying, that this was NO ONES FAULT, BUT MY OWN!!  I had an AMAZING MANAGER that cared about nothing but the success of his employees.  I had a manager that invested his time to listening to me, regardless of what I was talking about.  I had a manager that sincerely cared about me and my professional growth, and my personal growth for that matter.  I had a manager that spent a lot of his personal time, learning how to empower his employees in a different way, every single day!!  So, you get the point, me failing, was me, and ONLY ME!!  All employees go through up and downs.  But sometimes those ""downs"" are so severe that they start to cripple the rest of their teammates.   Not intentionally, but out of fear.  I became full of uncertainty and doubt.  But my manager still didn't give up on me, he threw himself into coaching me on a daily/hourly basis.  He gave me a senior level mentor that worked with me and WAS ALWAYS THERE TO LISTEN!!  But, I just couldn't seem to get out of my own head at this point. I was not pulling my weight on my team and I left every night so disappointed in myself, wanting nothing but to make my manager proud, but failing him instead.  I knew that my job was on the line, and I knew that I deserved to be walked out.  BUT, THROUGH ALL OF THIS... MY MANAGER STILL BELIEVED IN ME!!  I have no idea why,  but he did.  He, yet again, WENT OUT OF HIS WAY, to make phone calls, to get me an interview with a customer service manager.  I interviewed and was offered a position helping our home owners.  AND I ABSOLUTELY LOVE IT!!  This is such a better fit for me and my personality. I guess my point is this ..  ..  ..  I have never worked for a company that believes in you, pushes you, encourages you, DID I SAY ""BELIEVES IN YOU"" ...  like Home Advisor does.  There are no words that could ever explain, what this meant to me, DID FOR ME!!!  And if you think that just because I am no longer in his department, that he doesn't check on me, YOUR WRONG.

Promotions are not merit based when they say that's the way it is - not saying me personally but I saw many many people who deserved promotions and never got them because they weren't friends with the right people or didn't play the game.

Change is good, but constant change means you never get comfortable in one position and there are no ways to measure the success of each change.

2096,Angi,"Work hard, Play hard",2016-06-01,5.0,,"I feel lucky to have been a part of this company for the last 3.5 years. To say the entire job is an adrenaline rush would be an understatement - I came to this office fresh out of college with zero sales experience, and can say today that I have developed some of the most valuable sales skills that will carry me through all facets of life. The key to success here is hard work - the most successful salespeople have the drive and will to keep pushing no matter how tough it can get - and boy does it pay off. Many sales reps here make well over 100k, because the commission is uncapped. The more sales you make, the more money you make, period.

As far as the environment, it is the best NYC has to offer, hands down. You will meet some of your best friends working here - you will be encompassed into an environment of fun-loving, energetic & super motivated individuals, because that's what HomeAdvisor looks for in their hiring process. We have an incredible recruitment team - the head of HR has experience as a match maker and hired me 3.5 years ago. All directors, managers, and trainers alike bleed the HomeAdvisor spirit and are endlessly loyal to the company, preaching the same practices to their sales reps and all new hires.

To put it in perspective, HomeAdvisor is a platform that will propel you in whatever direction you wish to go, or at the very least will help you figure it out. Work hard play hard is our motto, and fits us perfectly. You will get in what you put out, and hard work will pay off while working at this company. I have seen people grow tremendously into new positions both in and out of the office, and can honestly say that I am a better person from my time working at HomeAdvisor.","Technical issues cause delays in the work day

2101,Angi,GLORIFIED SWEAT SHOP!!!,2016-05-25,2.0,Discovery Representative,"casual dress code, nice amenities for health and recreation, free valet parking, compensation $40K salary","favoritism in better markets to call, little training, turn over super high, management, lunch and breaks are managed same time every day, verbiage between training and sales floor is different depends on how your manager wants to get the job done

When I first got here the place seemed glorified, wonderful, and just a dream place anyone would want to work. People were around the same age group mid 20s-early 30s.

There's potential for growth; you're eligible for promotion after six months of working there, but don’t get too excited there’s always a catch so sit tight. There are 3 levels before becoming a manager: discovery rep, eligibility rep, and the senior solution consultant (ad sales closers). The pay is great as the salary more than doubles through each of these promotions. The way it's set up is the discovery reps cold call service providers to advertise, same for eligibility reps except they have an extra step to call potential service providers to get better graded reviews (A-B range) so they can be eligible to advertise, then once someone is interested in making a campaign with us we send the transfer over to a SSC-closer who their only job is to close an advertising campaign deal.

It didn't take long for me to realize the people that were on higher levels barely worked and were paid six figures! Literally if there was a slow day in making sales the Closers would be on their phones, computers, listening to music, or their head down, while us Discovery reps busted our butts making 80-130 phone calls a day to get a potential lead only to get yelled at by management when there weren't enough transfers coming over in a day. Obviously it takes time to build a relationship with these people.

Turnover is super high. Angie's List spends a lot of money on other things besides what matters like the Training Department duhhh! Training was only a week long and 75% of the time was spent on drawing pictures and creating skits on what you think Angie's List is about like we’re in kindergarten. Like that was a waste of time and money and didn't do us justice when we got put on the floor. Everyone for themselves good luck. They say they won't throw you to the wolves or don't worry we got your back not going to let you down.....they did the total opposite! Left you hanging. They told us in training don’t worry we have a grace period of 90days to do the job get the hang of it. Uh no they meant 90day probation period got that cleared up by HR personally. Grace and probation are two different meanings so you will be fired if you don’t catch on quickly. That’s why I felt training was a joke for how “serious” they are about the position.

The team I happened to be on was fake. Some coworkers are nice and really want to help see you succeed but those are the ones that have been treated badly and know what not to do. Hardest part of the job is keeping the motivation to make phone calls even when you get cussed out for calling so much by service providers or when you finally get a potential lead and a closer hangs up on it just so they can accept another call from another teammate for a bigger deal. Like what the heck?! That's not teamwork.

You already don't have control over how much the ad sells for. So basically your job security is in the Closers hands to hit goal; that's if they're in a mood to do a good job today! You have to make a sales goal each month on average $15K. That can definitely be reached but only if you're manager likes you enough to give you some better and bigger markets to call. Definitely about who you know and kissing butt to get ahead. Even your own teammate will shark your list of prospects to get ahead smile in your face and then the manager congratulates them on the sale (on this particular team anyway). Definitely money vs morality here so watch out!
The only good thing about working here is basically all the fun stuff outside of the job itself. But you have to work there and keep your job to be able to do those fun things right? It's not worth my sanity. Also PTO is good except in this position you need every day you can get. Every day in the month is valuable because it will go by really fast and boom you didn't hit goal. By the way just because you make a sale it’s never in stone until the end of the month. A service provider can fail a background check or cancel the campaign so you lose that money for goal. It’s a roller coaster. I wouldn't take off unless you really needed to or if you're the ""manager's favorite"" and don't have to worry about having smaller, longer, painstaking markets to call.

PS: HR is a joke too it's about who you know there as well. Trust me I've tried to let them know about what goes down but since my manager is one of the top sales teams in the company and is close friends with the people in HR they don't seem to care that much. Of course Angie's List needs all the money they can get no matter what it takes. Motivation through fear seems to be how they operate. That's not me; the job itself is already stressful don't need any extra drama. You WILL get walked over here if you don't have an alpha personality or be willing to step outside of your comfort zone and challenge your morals. Good Luck!"

2105,Angi,Great culture for those who are willing to work for it.,2016-05-20,5.0,Online Marketing Consultant,"As my first job within sales, I am more than pleased with my experience as an Online Marketing Rep at the Golden office of HomeAdvisor. For those who are  willing to absorb, learn and grow within the trade of sales, the tools are readily accessible for you. From team mates, to managers, to even high up directors, everyone is there to lend a hand if you find yourself struggling. 

The culture itself is upbeat and positive, which is needed to contrast the daily grind of contacting the contractors. Free lunches are the norm for when teams hit goals, giveaways are also common place with everything from vacations to Super Bowl tickets being given away. If you want those, you have to earn it and it's simply not a job that you can just sit back and expect results to roll in. 

Many of these reviews state that the product doesn't truly work but evidence backs it otherwise. If a contractor works the system correctly and has the right expectations (which should be properly set if a sales rep is indeed good at their job), then they will see success in some form. Believe in the product or there is absolutely no reason for you to even bother coming in every day. 

I have referred others to the company and they are pleased with their decision to get on board as well.","It can get tedious reaching out to contractors who have already been contacted many times before by our company and frustration is bound to pop up from time to time for not hitting numbers, as it would in any sales environment. Some contractors will get angry for yet another call, but if you can't handle any sort of rejection perhaps you're in the wrong industry."

The company was good but options to further my pay scale was not. It was in a room full of top performers and not just in Denver, but the entire country. A Dream team if you are in a managers position. But all of us felt the same way. One by one we all started to drop looking for that perfect sales job. Then one from our circle landed a position at HomeAdvisor and got the ball rolling. I came in for an interview and could not believe the energy that the entire work place had. I remember thinking to my self I hope I get this Job. I did and now I am back at the top and on pace to a six figure income!! I had all the tools to be a successful sales rep right out the gate. Training was fun and very informative. You really have to sale, its not order taking but a true sales job. Its a day to day challenge but for a real sales rep what good sales job is not? What really stands out for me is that I am not the only one who has seen success from the start. ALL my friends from my last position are now hear and doing as well as me if not better. HomeAdvisor was Quick to nab out the leaders of the group and place them into management and strategically placed the rest of us into a position to see and feel success. So if you are a true sales rep and you would like to better you life and work environment come on down and put in that app and tell them the SALES PIG sent you!!!

This review is for the New York office.  The culture is something you probably would never expect coming into the work force. especially if you just graduated college.  From the music that plays constantly (aside from when they play that EDM crap) to the kegs on tap and people that work here - what more could you ask for?  I find my days flying by because the energy is amplified all day and people here generally look like they enjoy their jobs.  This is a great place to start if you are looking to get your feet in New York City and make something of yourself.  The training you will receive here is hands down the best in New York and if you can sell here you can  sell anything.  Management does a great job of coaching you up and making sure you are able to do the job day to day.

The people who DO NOT succeed here are the people who have no work ethic, don't listen to the coaching their manager is giving them or are just not confident in themselves period.  The money they throw at you is insane

2113,Angi,The HomeAdvisor,2016-05-16,5.0,Senior Sales Consultant,"Been working here for close to 2 years now. To put it mildly, it's been one of the better experiences of my life. Free food, high pay, awesome people. I came into HomeAdvisor right out of college with no idea what I was doing and an accidental degree in environmental science. Saturday nights would consist of asking my mom for 20 dollars to buy bud light and drink it in the basement with my friends in New Jersey. Sundays through Fridays were also spent drinking bud lights in my friend's basements in New Jersey.

I joined HomeAdvisor is the summer of 2014 and within a month I graduated training and already making nice checks right out of the gate. Within 3 or 4 months you really begin to perfect the craft and start making what most would consider substantial amounts of cashe.  Within 10 months, I was signing a lease in central Manhattan with a couple close friends I met working at HomeAdvisor. Now I drink Bud Lights in New York. Honestly I can't say it enough, great place to work. Awesome people, awesome culture, awesome pay.

This was just my experience. HomeAdvisor catches talent from all over the place. A lot are out of college but a good amount also have been in sales for a while as well. Money is going to range as well depending on how you do. Some people finish the year in the 50k's while some are hitting well above 100k. It really depends on how you perform. 

The company is also doing really well lately and I believe hiring is getting more competitive these days. With Angie's list going down the toilet and no one else to really compete, HA has really seen some crazy growth the past few years. No one really knew what homeadvisor was when I came in but now grandma is calling me once a week to let me know she saw us on TV. 

Culture is great. Very nice people from all walks of life. Despite management's best efforts, basically the entire company goes out on Thursdays. Don't be late on Fridays. New people are welcomed out after they graduate training. On top of that, the company organizes frequent parties and events that tend to be a lot of fun. We had field day last week and it was a great time.

The office is awesome. There's a terrace with hammocks and whatnot that I often would sleep on. Large space. Ping pong tables and dart boards found throughout the office. Kegerator with beer and rosé on tap. Free drinks, free seamless, free coffee, free tums. The new water coolers scattered throughout the office were a fantastic idea and the person responsible should be rewarded substantially.

It really is a great place to work and the only reason I'm leaving is because I was offered a great position at another company. I would have never gotten my new job if it wasn't for my experience over at HomeAdvisor. Every month you spend there makes you more valuable in this city. Not just in sales. People go on to marketing, advertising, finance, etc. Sales is valuable everywhere and HomeAdvisor is a great place to get that experience.

- Can't sign up home inspectors anymore. 

- There seems to be a strong bias in the office towards green tea. I personally enjoy some fresh Earl Grey but it is often left out of the tea box collection and replaced with something less deserving like constant comment."
2114,Angi,Inside Sales,2016-05-15,2.0,Marketing Consultant,"-on site cafeteria
-the product is better than the competitions
-very easy interview process","-Unethical and unprofessional work environment. Sales reps are encouraged to stretch the truth to get one call closes. i.e in weekly training meetings they will have you listen to a call from a top rep. you hear people stretching the truth all the time, and managers running the meeting just say ""stay away from using that term, try this instead."" Yet that top rep still gets the sale after it has gone through quality assurance somehow. Most reps say they had ""x amount of requests come in unanswered over the last 30 days."" In reality, reps don't have access to that information they can only see what the 30 day ahead sales forecast is. Nobody says anything about it.
-Work environment is unprofessional. Hard to consider yourself a high tech company when half of the reps wear sweatpants and hats to work. 
-Drug test would wipe out half of the current sales staff. 
-Turnover rate for reps is terrible. wouldn't give me an exact answer when I interviewed, but I could say from experience it is easily over 70% after the first year. 
-Make sure you know if you are market or online before interviewing. Much easier to be in the money when you are on the online side, and much easier to make that fast start bonus as an online rep. Also make sure you know which team you are going to, and try to talk to an employee that is on the team before coming on. You can't switch to online if you are a market rep, and I am sure no online rep has ever asked to switch to the market side. Difference is, online team gets online leads, meaning contractors are on the website asking to be contacted by a rep. Market just cold-calls new prospects all day. 
-Don't get paid for your sales unless you hit a certain amount in that pay period. This forces employees to sandbag the company by holding off on closing sales until the following week, because getting 3 sales in a pay period means nothing to the rep and your essentially getting sandbagged by the company yourself."

You will be repeatedly calling people who 9/10 times won’t even answer.  This makes time go by very slowly, and as you can imagine, it is extremely boring.  So even if you make the goal of about 6 sales a month, that is still 300 something odd calls that were made a day, 5 days a week for 4 weeks that resulted in nothing.  You do the math.

-The people you are calling are contractors - they are hard to understand, and frankly, they are usually pretty uneducated, and by no means am I trying to be disrespectful to them by saying that.  However, this concerns you, as they don't understand concepts like return on investment or advertising on the internet.  A lot of these people advertise by word of mouth and refuse to catch up to modern times because they are stubborn in their ways. Good luck trying to convince them otherwise.  HomeAdvisor is difficult to sell.

-The script that mgmt will give you (that you are pretty much required to repeat word for word)  includes common objections that contractors will give to buying a membership.  These are VERY legitimate objections, like why we charge 3 contractors for the same job if only one of them gets it.  You are taught to counter these objections with vague and borderline dishonest responses.  Selling someone a HomeAdvisor membership is a very long process, in which the contractor must give you his personal information (SSN, DOB) and his credit card info, which any smart person wouldn't give out to some stranger over the phone.  You are also expected to make the sale in one call, mgmt does not care about building a rapport or any sort of relationship with the contractor.  The whole sales process just feels very shady and dishonest.

-Your managers will encourage you not to take breaks, stay in the office late and also to come in on the weekends.  This is such an unhealthy way to work, as its been proven that people work better when they actually get breaks.  They will bribe you to work overtime with time and a half, which is obviously really nice.  But sometimes I feel like you are looked down on when you decide to take your full lunch break.

I also felt as if the company boosted the sales numbers for stockholders in shady ways. After the first year of working here, I began to not believe in the product which made it hard to sell to good family owned businesses across the country that I cared about."

While still in training, my entire training class was still invited to the company christmas party ( even if none of us had earned the right to attend yet ). I was placed with a manager starting a brand new team and i was one of the first 5 people to help start that team up. I can honestly say that my manager is the hardest working manager in the company, in at 7 every morning and working till midnight if he had to, just to help his team succeed. I was recently let go due to lack of performance, however what i thought was very unique, was not only did my manager not want to have to let me go, the best director in the company herself clearly did not want to let me go, especially because it came down to my final call on whether or not i would be let go. I have nothing but positive things to say about this company and the people that make it run. Honestly if there was any way to come back to Home Advisor in the future for a position maybe not in sales, i would jump at the opportunity in a heart beat.

The current head of sales has evidently done a lot of work because according to the old-timers, reps are being paid the most compensation they ever have.","You're a cog in the wheel. They give you 13 weeks before you must hit their budget goals - look closely at the comp plan because depending on whether you are market or online, you must make a certain number of sales before you even make commission. They lure you in by saying most sales reps make between 60-100k, and I'm sure that's true, but I certainly didn't see it on my team.

When you're doing well, it's great. When you have a rough couple of weeks, you're put on probation and I simply don't think that's a great motivational tool.

Managers play favorites and give prime leads to people they like. 

Sales is tough enough at this company w/o other reps trying to steal your work. I'm sure this is common in sales but in my time there I had numerous sales yanked by business development or another rep taking credit for my work."

We have a clear plan for continued growth and profitability with the right leaders in place to drive it.  The Sales teams have the right leaders in place now too and we have found a structure that works.  The call center, aka Member Care, is continuing to make strides to be a great call center with true career growth opportunities.

You will be accepted at Angie's List with open arms if you are talented at what you do!",It may be too fast paced for some people but that is what you get with Technology companies and I don't think our entry level sales and customer care teams realize that.  It is not utopia at AL but I don't think that exists anywhere.  We have changed our comp plans in sales too often and may have done a bit too much trial and error on new services.  Most of the negative posts on here are from call center people and early in career sales people that have some valid and some non-valid issues.  These roles are notorious for producing pessimistic attitudes but they have some real valid issues.  Comp plans did change entirely too much along with constant change that didn't always make sense but that is all behind us.

Most managers have no idea what they are doing.  Most have never been managers before and don't know how to lead or coach.  In this particular department it is a bit of an old boys club.  The majority of the managers got their positions because they knew someone who was also a manager.  Since they have no idea how to properly manage a team they are vindictive and force out good reps just because they don't like them.  Manager's have too much control over your ability to make money.  Argue with your manager one time and they can just change your sales territory, just like that! They don't have to have a valid reason, just because and your pay is cut in half!"

The people you work with are generally great people. Great work experience.","Lack of integrity. It feels as if management wants us to do right by our advertisers because it makes us look better and prevents us from losing money - not just because it's the right thing to do. That being said they constantly look the other way when ad sales sells a terrible contract or lies to an advertiser. They say they like for anybody in sales to push the envelope. There's little accountability. Little opportunity for upward movement. While bonuses and commissions can be great, base pay is far below the national average for an account manager so if you don't hit bonus it can be hard to get by.

2193,Angi,Strange Experience...about all I can say.,2016-02-02,1.0,Media Sales Associate,"There is a lot of good here, free beer, free Seamless (huge), fun and lively environment. There are a lot of good people if you look for them. Sales incentives can be very cool and there is the opportunity to make a LOT of money if you can figure it out!","I am thankful for what I have learned at HomeAdvisor, but there are a lot of serious issues that need to be worked out. First off let me note that I am writing about the NYC location and can not attest to the others.

Let's begin with the fact that they hire 99% of applicants so congratulations: you just found your new job where you will be surrounded by frat bros who never moved on, and other confused youth. This is a sales farm: if you hit the numbers you can stay, if you have a really bad month, good luck.

Nobody ever seems to know what is going on and you are constantly treated like a child. It is not uncommon to ask 3 different superiors a question about the product and get 3 completely different answers. The majority of the management is in their early 20s, severely under qualified, and on power trips for the most part. 

There are constant threats to job security (people are fired or quit almost daily) and are replaced almost instantly. 

I have been told on multiple occasions by management to lie to clients in order to get the sale and that ""they will figure it out for themselves once they get through"".

In 2015 alone, the compensation plan changed twice for the worse. Furthermore, the price of membership was changed 4 times with no increase in commission. It began at $80, then $120, $287, and finally $348 (with mHelpDesk, which may be a complete scam). Basically my job got more and more difficult and my pay got worse and worse. 

Don't plan on getting promoted, there are 150 others gunning for a spot that may or may not open every 6 months at the most. The only ones who are hired are ""in"" with the directors and other managers, its pretty insane. Certain top preforming reps in the office are largely ignored for promotions, for inexplicable reasons.

The amount of interoffice relationships is astonishing and seemingly encouraged. Not really a con per se depending on what you are looking for but just very interesting."

My job was not at all stressful. I never took work home with me. 
I did not work long hours.
Catered lunches.","Where to begin! I think the main takeaway is that this company is painfully cheap. They don't give raises or promotions as often as one might expect, and when they do, the increase is so pitiful it has no impact on net pay. I personally know an employee who has been with the company for 1.6 years without a single pay increase. The company also presents itself as a marketplace, with equal attention and respect given to its contractors and customers, however that is entirely untrue. Customers come first, and every contractor on the platform can feel it. 
They put together an achingly out-out-touch and awkward culture deck, ""modeled after Netflix"" but if you pull up each deck side-by-side, you'll see that they are lost. Every executive at this company is a rich kid who doesn't understand and will never seek to understand the needs of the less privileged. 
They've outsourced most of their Customer Experience down south, and it's clear they won't do anything to foster or develop any of the remaining employees in New York-they are forcing them to quit."

They gave everyone in sales a folder with two pieces of paper: one was a new comp plan worth a FRACTION of what of what we used to make, the other was a letter of resignation. You had to sign one. Overnight we went from respected sales professionals to being treated like entry level unskilled workers."
2202,Angi,Laughing Stock of the Professional Community. Career minded professional level talent need not apply.,2016-01-26,2.0,Anonymous Employee,Adequate short term earning potential for otherwise unqualified entry level talent.  Individuals lacking experience can get it here although many potential employers in the Indianapolis market minimize the value of experience with angie's list because of the poor reputation they have built for themselves as an employer.  Read some of the other reviews here for more details. They all can't be exaggerating. If you aren't qualified enough to get a job with a respected organization you can get by with Angie until you can find something else.   Just know going in to it that future employers will not see much value in your experience here.  This isn't a career move.,"Senior leadership not qualified for their positions. As with many .com startups the individuals that were in the door first are now Sr. Leaders. They have no experience outside of angies list.  They fell in to leadership roles by necessity during rampant growth years because they were the most qualified of the individuals there at the time.  This wasn't a problem until the company scaled to its present day size.  Now these inexperienced Sr leaders are faced with executive decision making and leadership challenges that they are unfamiliar with because they have never faced these challenges in a professional setting.  They approach nearly every situation with confusion.  With no genuine leadership or plan of action from the top down every day is an organizational nightmare.  Due to this employee morale is very poor and Angies List can only attract entry level talent.  Month after month sales numbers decline as competent competition enters the Marketplace.  The company is in rampant decline.  This is a volatile career option as the organization is fizzling out quickly and seems to have no coherent direction. Their original CEO even stepped down.  He started the company and stayed for 20 yrs. He must have seen this coming.

Angies List struggles to retain talent or attract experienced individuals because the only individuals willing to endure the environment are those fresh out of college that have never experienced a professional environment. Angie's List offers a dramatically poor environment marked by poor workforce morale. Everyone you will meet behind her doors hates being there, fears for the loss of their position, and   is working on an exit strategy. The company is in serious decline because they have no regard for their employees, even their top producers. (Once again, check out some of the other reviews to verify.) Just earlier this month they fired an individual that was one of their top salespeople in 2013, their top manager in 2014, and their #2 manager in 2015 all because a disgruntled employee made up something about him on her last day of employment.  If they will get rid of this guy they will get rid of anyone.  The lack of support that was granted to him by management after his contributions, and the better safe than sorry approach that was taken in his dismissal are another indicator of the spineless fear driven decision making that comes with inexperienced leadership.

Pay scale changes periodically.  Their retention sales are in rampant decline. Compensation structures for management and individual contributor roles will have to change in order to keep their account management department profitable.  They just overhauled their ad sales department, forcing many out of a job, and reducing pay for the vast majority of the department.(verify in other reviews)  They have been working towards doing the same thing with their account management teams and the department wide transition can't be too far off. Your pay will likely be reduced mere months after signing up if you are looking to start in Q1 of 2016.

My experience with Angies List was good.  However, it was only good because I had experience going in to the role. I made it longer than most but I just couldn't take it any more. Ultimately the fact that I did have experience hurt me personally in the end because I have experienced the way organizations should be run and this just isn't it. Every day is truly miserable and everyone around you feels the same.  It is just a bad place to be."

After three pleasant years, a six-figure income, and many sales contracts later, the company restructured the much needed department.

Typically little in the way of micro-management.  You gain a lot of skills, and it's a pretty good resume booster.  Great trips for top performers.  There is (or at least was) great income potential.  When I began my time at Angie's List, the bonuses came quickly.  Morale was high.","Interdepartmental communication is terrible.  It frequently felt like the left hand didn't know what the right was doing, cliche as it sounds.  Turnover is pretty high.  Lowering eligibility requirements made the job far more difficult, just as things were starting to improve.  Long hours are often required--obviously, this is sales.  But some months, you do everything possible to exceed your goal, and end up making ~$12/hour or less.  That's pretty demoralizing."

Those are really the only pros left.,"Used to be a great place to work. Flexibility, uncapped commissions, and a great culture made it awesome. Now, no commissions, no flexibility, and not a good place to work. Pay for most people in this position has been cut in half at least. Several of the programs they had for employees have been cut. There is no flexibility. Everything is scheduled out, one minute late, you will be written up. They will still expect you to stay hours late. The bait and switch is something they love to do. When they switch everything on you and demand things you didn't sign up for, you have to figure it out and they simply don't care.

Overlook people that are qualified for advancement.  Pay changes whenever they feel like changing it.   Lie to contractors about the leads being quality leads.  The company does not advertise that the contractor has to pay for the leads so some people have no interest in getting an estimate, they just fill out information and the contractor has to pay for it."

I really think this is a terrible company for what they do to their clients they lie to you to tell contractors they are giving the leads they are selling to up to 3 other contractors in their area and really is is much more and they charge up wards of 
60 dollars for each lead. So your commission is quit low for what they are making off of your clients. If you want to be a trained monkey and do whatever you are told regardless of what it is then go for it!! Over all this is a boring and motivating job and you will gain a ton of weight working there due to lack of movement and constant snacking lol!!"

Used to have extremely flexible scheduling and that's a thing of the past - now even lunch breaks are mandatorily scheduled and highly monitored

More classroom training and little to know shadowing/hands on. Managers are very young and at times are not good at training, nor are they good with answering questions. Maybe this is because they weren't properly trained either. Managers are not hands on as far as sottin with reps and listening to calls.

Most of the people are really dedicated.,"High turnover even in salary positions.  A lot of change in job responsibilities, where you sit, etc. (I don't mind it, but some might).  Some managers, mine in particular, need a LOT of help when it comes to people skills, social skills, and management skills.  We are definitely micromanaged to the point of frustration.  We are kept out of the loop on many relevant and crucial decisions, events, and information.  I have felt personally insulted by our manager several times which I have usually explained by their lack of experience, but I shouldn't have to put up with that.  Also know that this person insults a junior member of our team for lack of experience.  No where to turn to resolve issues with manager.  Also feeling the squeeze that I have nowhere to go.  No way to move up.  Didn't get a raise or explanation of no raise with this year's work anniversary despite incredible performing year.  I am looking for another position at the moment.

The people I worked with were very funny and pleasant to be around.,"lack of structure. Company was amazing pre-IPO then as most companies do when they go public- they chance drastically.

Revolving door of employees. You feel like a cog in the machine. I know this feeling well because I was told specifically that I was. As I climbed the ranks, I saw people, great employees, be motivated by being told they will be squeezed out if they don't hit their numbers. Thus.....

Multiple sales verticals are contacting same business owner 2-3 times a day. Every day. Even when asked to be put on DNC list. Sales reps are encouraged to say ANYTHING to a plumber or electrician to get them to sign on dotted line. It's dishonest at best. Criminal at worst. 

HR knows their rep has been tattered locally and struggle to get good employees. Most have their resume up and a foot out the door.  Even with stupid money, flexible schedules, foosball tables, and all of the ""hip"", loose structure they like to sell you on- it's not enough. Thus, I left. Best decision of my life.

There's alot of science behind it. I know with dedication, and practice I will get it. It's absolutely the hardest mental job I have ever had. I have only ever had customer service experience before hand. I really want to strive for success with this company because I believe in Home Advisor. There's absolutely nothing to lie about. It's a great system for both home owners and contractors. It's just convincing the contractors that who have been stuck in their way of buisness for 20 years etc. To get with the new age of doing buisness through smartphones and internet. Even the top managers and ceos are involved with training. I personally loved seeing that due to the fact that it rarely happens in other companies. All of the managers have started from the bottom up so it's awesome that they do know what your going through. Everyone has been helpful. Now my only job is to kick some butt at selling :)"

These managers don't have proper training and switch Rep Markets on a monthly basis so it's hard to get traction in the markets to make good sales. Angie's list started hiring warm bodies to say they had 1000 employees at any given time but these employees would be fired for sales performances just as quickly as they were hired in meaning those employees would burn markets and burn possible relationships with accounts to advertise. There are way to many departments from Angie's list calling in on these accounts to sell front page advertising or coupon advertising. Once you hit 100% on a regular basis you finally get good markets which are just as burned through. Also Angie's list slashes their prices in half at the end of the month to hit goal which just devalues the product."

2329,Angi,Customer Experience,2015-06-28,1.0,Customer Experience Associate,"You will gain a lot of experience in a very short time. Your coworkers will be solid, and you will need them because management is a unique mix of arrogance and incompetence, from the founders down to the supervisors.","First off, don't trust a single glowing review of Handy posted here - they are transparent attempt by management to cover the very high turnover rate of both employees and cleaning contractors. You will see the earliest reviews here from cleaners had a direct response from the CEO that their opinions were null because they were not considered full-time employees, but now they are flooding this board and driving the score up. So which is it?

If you work here, you are not working for a tech startup - you are working for a cleaning/janitorial company. Most jobs are in operations and support since Handy is a service business, which means you will spend hours each day emphasizing to poor English as a second language speakers that they need to clean underneath shampoo bottles, or getting yelled at by a customer because their shampoo bottles were not cleaned.

Your salary will never increase. They hire mostly new college grads that are easily replaceable or outsourced. Allow me to repeat: this is not a place with opportunities to grow, this is a place to spend a year building experience and then getting out before you just can't take the entitled customers or cleaners who just don't care. 

Lastly, you will find out through your own experience that Handy offers a mediocre product at best. The contractor-without-a-supervisor model does not work for cleaning the same way it works for Uber, and the endless stream of unhappy customers and unfairly rated cleaners proves this."

As an employee, you know the company thinks highly of you. There is an on-campus daycare, gym, and cafe. The cafe has healthy options, the gym has good equipment, a personal trainer, and classes. The staff is diverse, with many different age groups and cultures represented. The company has a value system of keeping employee morale high, so that the employees will keep client morale high. Employees stay a long time. All usual benefits are offered, along with free coffee. The office has many paid outings and lunch opportunities. Employees are encouraged to move upwards in the company, switch departments, and to find their exact niche within the company. You can move departments 6 months after employment","The health plan is high deductible, but has an HSA and low premiums. No benefits until 30 days of employment and is not retroactive. No 401k matching until 6 months of employment, but you are immediately vested. Moving from a small company to a large company is difficult, and many changes are typical--you will need to be a quick learner and adaptable. The company offers a lot of support to help you through these changes, though. They don't hire outsiders for most management positions, unless you are in sales."
2336,Angi,"Great people, cool work environment, bad business management",2015-06-19,2.0,Anonymous Employee,"Angie's List has great, caring, smart and intelligent people.  The company culture (at least from a co-worker camaraderie standpoint) is great.  People work hard, are dedicated, have a sense of humor and really foster a team spirit.  That is vital to the success of any company to get the best employee engagement.

The campus is in a really neat, somewhat historic area of Indianapolis.  There is an onsite fitness center, an old fashioned diner and a cafe (albeit a little pricey).

The compensation is very competitive.  The benefits are average with the exception of an additional 5 days of PTO starting than the traditional 15.","Angie's List is almost the ideal place to work but they have one flaw that is pretty much killing all of the good points of the company.  The business management side of the company (probably unbeknownst to them) is doing anything and everything to destroy employee morale.  They will just keep sending in an infinite amount of requests to be working, put arbitrary deadlines on them and the requests will usually only have about one sentence from which the engineers are required to glean what they're supposed to do from that using clairvoyance that apparently is an employee requirement.

This has created an adervsarial relationship between the business management and the engineering team.  There is very low trust, respect and consideration going both ways and that's a BIG problem.  In order for companies to be successful that incessantly bickering, complaining and arguing all the time needs to be turned into collaboration.  We need to all remember that we are ALL supposed to work together not just in our little cliques to serve the customers and the shareholders as ONE team."

-Management: Of the 3 training managers, only 1 seems to care about the success of new hires (Brian).

I followed the feedback given to me by my manager each week, but I still didn't pass training like many others who get this 6-week extended interview, if you will.

2358,Angi,"Nice fake reviews, social media team! Here",2015-05-15,1.0,Customer Experience Associate,"It pays the bills. There's medical and dental. There's a free meal every shift, and snacks and soda. Although the soda is rationed because the staff was 'drinking too many.' You get a free Handy cleaning each month. And that's about it.","Seriously, where to begin. Handy Customer Experience team members are managed by sheer intimidation. The company provides free meals because there isn't time to go get food and come back and eat - and if you're a minute late, you'll be written up. Late to work? So are the managers, constantly. However, you do it and it's a write up. Which also usually comes with a healthy dose of being belittled by the management team, and goes as far as literally being screamed at in front of your teammates. They even log the time you spend going to the bathroom or getting a drink of water. Take too many? Drink less water and you won't have to get up as much...

And if you don't? Layoffs. At least in the NYC HQ. Several rounds of public layoffs have occurred - and by public, I mean all the conference rooms are glass, so you literally get to watch the manager lay off your friends before your very eyes, then be escorted to the elevator. Because now that they figured out it costs half the price, all the jobs are being outsourced to call centers in Tampa and Arkansas. The workers there receive virtually no training, and constantly screw up customer accounts. But that bottom line, am I right?

But then they go too far too fast -- fired too many people at once -- the hold times are often up to an hour on the phone, and 2-3 days via email. So then they beg you to stay for overtime, which is supposedly optional, but you are scolded if you wont stay extra time. There's also little to no coaching or scripts on how to handle situations -- the one manager who was attempting to build the training program left the second he got another job. (And good for him.)

Everything is ruled by metrics - setting an unreasonable goal of interactions per hour which affect the level of customer service you can provide. Your goal is to get the person off the phone ASAP, with or without a resolution. Give the customer as little as you can get away with. Give the professionals as little as you can - purposely underpaying them in some circumstances for things to see if they notice. Handy is on no one's side but their own.

When they switched the CX team from salary to hourly, they literally withheld half of every person's paycheck without any notice. Once it had already been done, an unapologetic email was sent by the lead manager, explaining why we weren't receiving our money. Many people struggled to afford their rents that month, as it was done on the Thanksgiving holiday weekend.

Meanwhile, the managers are sleeping with employees, drugs are rampant at company parties/keggers, which are often held in-office while the CX staff tried to work. One time, the two of those elements combined very publicly, if you know what I mean! That manager had to resign. And I had to repeatedly Lysol the couch. Great for the programmers and management to get their thrills, awful for the customers who literally are hearing a rave going on in the background of their phone calls. Because if the party happens during your shift? The work doesn't stop just because there's a DJ and multiple bartenders in the room! If you don't assimilate and party hard, you become a quick target, no matter your metrics. Bro culture at its epitome.

The NYC CX crew is small at this point. Dozens were fired in the layoffs, but many more have quit and run, often without another job to go to, or by accepting a job with less pay. Because the thought of returning to that sinking hellhole and being yelled at by miserable customers, yelled at by professionals who you know fully well we're screwing over, and being yelled at by the managers who should be supporting you... just becomes unbearable.

So take the previous reviews with a grain of salt about the sunshine and unicorns... like most of the reviews on the apps, they are either current management, social media team, or friends of employees they gave free cleanings to in exchange for a review. (I coordinated a few of these myself.) Stay far away from Handy CX if you value your personal integrity."

Overall, not how they sell themselves at ALL.

All employees started at 35k/year then were dropped down to hourly wages.
Soon after they began letting people go under mysterious circumstances and opened up cs centers in Tampa and Arkansas where they pay them much less.

Recently, money is mysteriously missing from direct deposits. Management doesn't help anyone in general so there's just finger-pointing and shrugging with you bring this or any other issue to their attention.

Your happiness here will be decided pretty much once you get placed out of training.  Get placed in a good market? Then you can easily make some great money. Get placed in a crappy market? Your life will be miserable.  Service Providers are CONSTANTLY called by ad sales, storefront and big deal reps so if you are able to get them on the phone, they are already frustrated with Angie's List about 80% of the time. Goals are always increasing and changes in other areas that directly affect your job in booking deals get rolled out and THEN you are notified rather than working together and being proactive They preach that it is all about the team yet each division rarely works together or communicates. You will be moved within your market about every 3 to 4 months and given the ""needs of the business"" line. This will keep you from growing relationships with your service providers and despite requesting to change markets and having good numbers, it won't happen. There are some really good managers and leaders there that will having you drink the kool aide, but at the end of the day you have to believe in the product and once you lose faith in it, start looking for a new job because that day will happen. Your job is to call companies and get them to run ""deals"" at 40-60% off their regular rates and then give you 40-50% of the revenue. They make their money off of the add on sales at the members home, or the bait and switch.  A red flag should have been when the CEO owns a separate company who then leases properties to Angie's List and then turns around and sells those properties for millions more than the assed value.

Another cx employee puked all over the couch in one of the conference rooms, and someone else shattered a glass door. Now that's what I call a company Rager! there is no employee handbook per say for something that was called handbook, and it IS a running joke to everyone but the CEO that handy is a sexual term to most people. so the limitless amount of jokes that go on all the time is pretty funny. the company truly lives up to the new name, jerking around their employees and professionals."

- Work schedule is 9-5 M-F which is nice
- Semi / Casual work attire
- Benefits are pretty standard, nothing outrageous. It is a Savings Account based.","- Calling companies that have been called hundreds of times
- Calling the same company to either be told ""No, stop calling. "" Or just a voicemail.
- No policy enforcement. Policies are made up on the spot from management. There is no guideline as managers make their rules for their team.
- Favoritism and political. If you aren't in good with your manager, the territory you are given will get you fired. What I mean is that the territory that somebody had a very good month in the month prior and closed lots of deal, will then be assigned to you. If you can sell your goal after somebody already mutilated the market, kudos to you!
- Turn over. Be prepared to be fired, bottom line. 
- The company recently upped their employees to stay late twice a month, the 15th and the last day of the month. This means a 9AM - MIDNIGHT. This clearly shows a company that is DESPERATE to do whatever they can to stop their downfall. For people with families, not a good scenario. If you don't abide by these two late shifts per month, you will be pushed out the door. 
- 40 calls per day. This may not seem like a lot, but when you only have 300 accounts that are assigned to you, take 40 divided by 300. That means you will call these same companies 2 or 3 times per month. That list gets smaller throughout the month as well when people tell you no, or you leave the 10th voicemail.
- Personal growth does not exist anymore. The company laid off 100 employees summer 2014. The company stock has fallen off the face of the earth and the downsizing will continue until Angie's List can post a profit. 
- Leadership does not truly exist. Angie's List went through a huge growth period while going public ( and got sued for insider trading ). The management that was promoted we're people who we're good at sales. No managers besides maybe a select few have any prior management experience, making communicating with management difficult."

You're also helping some people get jobs and get their lives together, so that can be really nice for them.","I think HQ in NYC has no clue what working at Handy is like outside New York. They're very East Coast in that they don't understand or want to understand the challenges their satellite cities (i.e., Seattle, Austin, San Jose, D.C., Denver, Boston, Phoenix, Philly, LA, Baltimore) have, especially with regards to transportation and parking. Handy in NYC hosts orientations for new professionals right by a subway station, so no one working at Handy has to drive anywhere. Because I was a city manager in a satellite city, I had to drive all over to host orientations, paying for the gas myself and not getting reimbursed for a month. People in SF have to drive to Sacramento and San Jose to hold orientations. I am sorry, NYC, but those cities aren't close to each other. This guzzles a lot of gas and takes lots of travel time, time we could be using to do phone screens and be productive. Be better to the environment and your employees by hiring people for each city. We were forced to launch a neighboring city that was hundreds of miles roundtrip, and that's nothing compared to the folks managing cities in completely different states. Launching multiple cities was not at all what we signed up for. 

I was once told it was a ""luxury"" that I had one co-worker in my satellite city since so many people in satellite cities work alone with zero support. No, it is not a LUXURY to have a single co-worker. That is a basic part of working somewhere and it's really unfortunate that they expected me to feel privileged to have one person supporting me. Meanwhile at Handy HQ in NYC, everyone gets free lunches and dinners daily. I know it's because CX is there 24/7, but still, try to share with the rest of us for a change rather than simply yell at us when we don't make our numbers.

NYC makes us do so many unnecessary calls every week: one on Monday, a pointless All Hands call on Tuesday morning, and a cluster call. Just seems like a big waste of everyone's time. I'm not even going to begin to talk about how hard it must be for the actual cleaners. That's another post entirely and you can read all about it in multiple Glassdoor reviews. These folks have it the worst. The platform is confusing and they get the wrong idea that they're employees. 

Believe it or not, I do like cofounder Umang. He has always been kind and it's clear he cares about the company and its people. I just wish he, Oisin, and some of the other higher ups in NYC would at least try to recognize how hard it is to work at Handy outside of their Manhattan bubbles and provide us the full support we need. Actually visit those of us in satellite cities to understand why we have the challenges we do."

No control over schedule whatsoever, even if you are a top performer with tenure. The time off is great but expect to be denied your PTO request by the clueless scheduler. If you have young children and need child care look elsewhere because your schedule changes day to day and week to week. In member sales it seems like there are 5 or 6 people who are truly professional and strive to do well, the rest of the team seems more interested in collecting their base salary and skating by on the performance metrics each month. One of the most frustrating things for sales reps is that virtually every call counts as a sales opportunity and will count against your close rate if you don't sell it. Wrong number dials, people who thought they were contacting a local business, people who have needs which AL doesn't cover--they all count against you. Management is incompetent at most levels. Too much turmoil is what caused me to leave. In August the company laid off 100 employees. In September, a story ""leaked"" that they were shopping the company. In October, they announced they were hiring 500 new employees. What is going on there!?!? I truly believe that not one individual in the entire organization knows where Angie's List is going to be in two years, let alone five.

This is a large company of over 1000 employees with the business mentality of  a small business. This company does not take care of their salesmen.

They like to change the commission plan a lot so it will probably vary.","This is very high pressure sales.  You are expected to push and annoy the people you are calling to the point that they either purchase or tell you to stop calling them.  Then they expect you to start again the next month.  Your territory is at the discretion of your manager which also means your goals are at his or her discretion.  This can be great if you have a good manager, but it also allows them to push people out if they don't get along.  

They don't develop their people.  You will be locked into your position for a year if you're in sales (only 6 months in non-sales jobs).  They routinely lay off people if their performance is mediocre instead of working to develop them or find positions that fit them.  The company culture is changing right now from the more relaxed atmosphere that was trying to be in-line with the top software companies like Google to a more traditional corporate culture. 

Almost all ad sales managers are promoted from within.  They typically promote top performers.  The problem is that many of these people have no idea how to lead a team.  This has and will continue to hurt the company because these managers don't know what they are doing."

What started out as a noble idea has been corrupted as the focus has shifted from making members happy to making investors happy. The securities lawsuit filed at the end of 2013 also made me lose what little respect I had for the executives. As far as the job itself, the arbitrary system of assigning point values to transactions as a way to measure productivity was by far the most annoying aspect of the experience. They did improve the PTO and attendance policies while I was there, but overall the job felt very much like high school, and there was no respect for employees as people.

Company events outside the office (happy hours, parties, retreats, etc.) are generally very fun, informal, and open
There are definitely awesome, smart, fun, and caring people who work here. Unfortunately it doesn't extend to the broader company culture.","Higher ups in the company have a very cocky, entitled, and arrogant attitude, and tend play favorites amongst specific individuals within the company. This is a trend that has  gotten increasingly worse as the company has grown. 

Expect to be micromanaged. Don't think that working hard will result in you getting acknowledged or rewarded. Initiative and taking ownership of a problem is more likely to increase your liability or get you reprimanded rather than get you any recognition (priorities are always on growth and doing things quickly rather than correctly). This is a company where if you put in 150%, you'll get 50% in return. As a result, employees (admittedly myself included) are motivated to care more about their individual numbers and and apparent performance rather than doing what's best for the company, customers, or contracted professionals. This issue is made much worse by the fact that people lower within the company are treated much more critically than those on top.

Handybook has been very poor, bordering on unethical, in upholding their terms of the hiring contract. This is particularly true with respect to policies regarding vacation, overtime. Don't think that there's actually an open policy around vacation (although again, this depends on who you are and who you report to).

The company has grown quickly, but unfortunately it hasn't grown well. As a result things are constantly broken and your ability to work effectively will be inhibited by factors completely outside of your control (software bugs, operational or communication backlogs, etc). Also, the office is EXTREMELY crowded, although to be fair management is working hard to sign a new lease so hopefully this will change in the near future.

Finally, it's highly, highly likely that some of the five star reviews here are planted. Beware."

-There is a ""dude-bro,"" fraternity flavored, elitist culture that permeates the office. They play favorites here. Be warned.

-The heads of the company want to give the impression that they run a forward thinking, progressive company that works to improve the lives of their employees and the world at large, when it actually seems like it's run on old fashioned, corporate/Ivy League greed and apathy. And no, they do not care about employee burnout or turnover as the mindset is to treat employees as disposable commodity. You come, you go. Easy as that. Same attitude goes for their customers and their contract laborers who perform the actual jobs for them.

-You think with this being a cleaning company that they would not have issues with keeping the office clean but yet they do! The garbage cans in the food/pantry area overflow with garbage at all times of the day which draws flies and other vermin. Food is often left out, uncovered, and/or left strewn all over the tables after the lunch rush. Oh, and the amount of food that goes to waste there; it's extremely shameful and sad given how many hungry people reside in this city.

-They will lie to you during the interview process and tout the company as a great place to work with a ton of benefits and opportunity for mobility. No. They will bait and switch on you claiming that the nonsense taking place is all a part of the ""growth"" of the company. If you are silly enough to take a job there, expect little to no support or resources to successfully do your job. The only time management cares to acknowledge you is when sending intimidating emails about following/not following ambiguous company policies.

1) The company is growing very, VERY rapidly, so our office is pretty full during the day. It's clear we need more space, and we are moving this summer! 
2) That being said, the office also can seem a bit cluttered, but not really disgusting/filthy. We have our own cleaning professionals come in 3 times a day to clean. The back pantry room has lots of boxes of snacks, beverages, and other pantry supplies stacked up, but that is because the ordering has to be done for so many people now, there just isn't room to put everything on the shelves. The only other solution would be for them to stop ordering the snacks for now, and I need my granola bars, so I don't want to see this happening! Also, the place is not ""roach infested"" as I saw mentioned in another review--the building does occasionally have a few cockroaches, and sometimes there will be one in the very back hallway by the trash room & freight elevator, which are not part of the main Handybook office. Even when there is the report of someone seeing just one, the managers are sure to not only let the building owner know, but they even call in and pay for exterminators on their OWN, on the company's dime, so that we don't have to wait for the sometimes unresponsive building managers and property owners to solve the issue. 
3) Communication--this is nowhere near a hostile environment, and even reading that in a review startled me & made me hope that the person writing it has solved the personal issues they may have had with one or two other people, because that is just so crazy to hear. Right now since the team is so huge, there are days where you can feel like you are out of the loop on what is going on as far as where the company is heading, but they actively try to combat this by sending out update emails on what every team has and is doing, posting the quarterly initiatives on our team site, sharing links to what's being said about the company in the news, and having quarterly all-hands meetings, meaning everyone in the entire company. I know that communication is one of the most important things that will be focused on improving in the next few weeks, I think it was just rough for them to keep up with everything while we grew so fast, but you can tell they really want to make sure things are smoother going forward.
4) Again, goes with the fact that this company is experiencing tremendous growth--the founders clearly want to be approachable--they sit right in the middle of the office! Even though it is the noisiest & busiest area of the office and they would like to work in a more secluded & quiet area, I'm sure! But there haven't been as many opportunities to meet with them and talk about things and ask questions as there were before, because they are busier than ever right now too."

Free parking in downtown is rare, maximizing Salesforce to increase sales/productivity and what impresses me the most is the commission structure! For example, at 104% an Account Manager earned a commission check in excess of $5000! While there is a call goal of 35 calls/2 hours of talk time, your commission check is not contingent upon or held hostage if you do not meet that goal- allowing you to strategically pursue sales opportunities and focus on quality calls (and not quantity GANNETT!).","I am not a big fan of the open cubicle but, in comparison, it beats working in a dilapidated dirty office with black soot on the ceiling."

You can tell from just the interviews that the company isn't looking for space fillers, but for people that are going to make long-term impact. Handybook truly embodies the entrepreneurial culture of a start-up, but also encourages individuality and transparency- making it clear that the future lies with in the hands of the current employees. I can honestly say that this is a change of a lifetime, a chance for growth and opportunity, both for yourself and for the company.","The hours can be long, but that being said, Handybook makes a sincere effort to hire unique and engaging people which certainly makes the day fly by."

2492,Angi,Fun place to work.,2014-06-23,3.0,Member Service,"This company is a great company to work for. They don't discriminate against anything; the more tattoos you have, the more extreme your hair color is helps you obtain a job with Angie's List. They want everyone to be themselves and make coming to work fun.","You are expected to make a $500 monthly bonus every month or you go into a series of warning cycles that are impossible to claw your way out of. You can transfer to any part of the company one you have been in the position for at least 6 months. They have so many rules and regulations that they will search for a reason to fire you. You must be open to change. They will reward you if you can make it, but if you start slipping in the rams of your fellow colleagues they will just overlook you."
2493,Angi,Strategic Account manager,2014-06-19,2.0,Advertising Account Manager,"You have the ability to make your own your schedule, if you hit your numbers. The pay and compensation are pretty good.","Communication among the company is terrible. Senior management is weak, and director management is even weaker. The facilities are in poor condition.... Hot in the summers, and cold in the winter.  There is nothing in the future pipeline... maybe international expansion if they can get their act together."
2494,Angi,NOT the company it once was...you are merely an expendible number,2014-06-18,1.0,Advertising Account Manager,"Flexible schedule, on-site sales training, you can wear gym clothes or pajamas to work if you choose, free access to gym and personal trainer, a lot of great people to work with in various departments. Benefits are average (except the 401k plan which is generous once you're eligible).","Where to begin...when I started in account management, the company truly valued the hard work it's employees put in. Your effort was recognized and merit-based performance often led to promotions if you consistently exceeded your monthly goals. Yes - you USED to be able to make good money here, but now...it has become a matter of who your manager is and where your markets are that determine your financial success and longevity at this company. 
The office conditions in many buildings on campus are very bad...some bordering on dangerous. There are two buildings on campus that I worked in were many co-workers all complained of sinus and breathing issues. You're sitting in dilapidated, stained chairs (usually broken) and your desk might be a door on it's side. The ""cubicle"" walls aren't even attached. 
Turnover is extremely high so be prepared for that. Unfortunately, I've seen so many quality employees get fired or leave the company altogether because they had a bad month or two or they were just miserable from the stress and working conditions.
For someone straight out of college, it is possible to do well here, but it definitely can be an uphill battle. Some managers definitely play favorites and promotions are often more based on who you know versus merit. Many accounts will tell you how frustrated they are by constantly getting a new account manager or rep every couple of months. Therefore this can tend to lead to a lack of confidence from the customers' perspective in both the product (advertising) and the company. Overall - this is a place to get a job - a stepping stone if you can hack it...but I wouldn't recommend a career here - at least not in sales."
2495,Angi,Good Place to work if you are  not very ambitious,2014-06-09,3.0,,"Very relaxed, informal, friendly atmosphere. Flexible hours of work.","Not at all professional. Very disorganized and work can get very chaotic, challenging and frustrating. Too much change and experimentation."
2496,Angi,OK job for recent grad with no outside work responsibilities,2014-06-05,2.0,Advertising Sales Consultant,"Casual dress code, onsite gym, health and fitness programs and onsite personal trainer, laid back and fun office environment, most employees are nice","Your health benefits are terrible, and the premiums are high. Couple this with an extremely low base pay, and if you have anyone other than yourself on your plan, you will be taking home peanuts after this and taxes. This job is good for young people who have little to no outside work responsibilities. If you have a child in school/daycare, a spouse, family, etc, that require you to work ""normal"" hours, you will not succeed. Managers want you in your chair 12+ hours a day, but you'll only get paid for 8. You do get 20 days of PTO, but you if you take them, for any reason, it will be held against you. You will be expected to work late nights and Saturdays if you want to ""succeed"". The compensation plan is a joke, as is the warning cycle. The warning cycle exists to scare people, and at the end they will fire who they want to fire, and keep who they want to keep.

There is zero communication within upper management and less, if possible, from management to reps. No one ever has any idea what was going on. The motto seems to be, ""That's Angie's List"", meaning the company would rather embrace poor communication and no structure instead of implementing changes that would help its employees and its growth. 

One of Angie's List core values is ""Be frugal"" which they exercise in choosing the worst buildings in the city. In every office I worked in there were mice and other rodents, insects, and no climate control. If it was cold outside it was cold inside, and vice versa. 

Unfortunately, the company has a very ""fraternity"" feel to it, meaning it promotes based on camaraderie and sales merit instead of management experience and potential. As a result, most managers have no clue how to lead and manage a team. Suffice to say, being a good sales rep DOES NOT mean you will be a good manager. Most managers spent their days shooting the breeze, taking tons of smoke breaks, and playing on the Internet. When they do decide to manage, prepare to be micromanaged to the extreme, with hour long ""call blitzes"" in which you are yelled at if you get out of your chair.

The cold calling itself is tedious and exhausting, with most companies having been called for years. They either do not answer or hang up on you immediately. Management then wants you to use Google voice or purchase a ""spoof"" card to get the service provider to answer. These tactics are shady at best. The territory is extremely over-saturated, and you are expected to call repeatedly, in spite of the service provider showing no interest.

If you are a recent college grad looking for a fun work environment and a starter job, and you have little to no responsibilities outside of work, you can do decently well here if you are willing to work for it, but it won't be easy. Otherwise, I recommend choosing another company to work for."

They say service providers don't have to pay to be on the list - well now they have to pay $25/year for a background check.

No sense of job security and their ""management""  talks consists of little reviews of a few  calls out of thousands completed weekly.  Always negative.   And yes, they sandbag their criticism to be used as a reason for termination as soon as the company is loosing $.  They churn through good,smart employees, and keep zombies and boot lickers on.   Worse yet, one employee makes 24K and the guys next to them in cube city,  are spoon fed thousands of dollars of commissions. They renamed the company HomeAdvisor to distance themselves from the name ServiceMagic, which is pending hundreds of lawsuits.  Favoritism is rampant,  and you are segregated into groups, like high school.   The worst:  their profits are dependent upon lying to the contractors and homeowners about costs and prescreening.  AND employees are encouraged to leave their ethics at the door.   The average contractor leaves before 90 days are up and a two year employee is an ""old-timer""."

Walking on gravel parking lots and driveways and all through the campus will soon convince you the best choice of footwear is sneakers!  not to mention the heat in the summer and cold in the winter. getting from one building to another for a meeting while it's 90 or 9 degrees outside?  you don't want to make that trip four times a day. 



the buildings themselves are not sound proof, water proof, or heat proof. yes, we have leaks in the office, and you can hear the sirens all the time. if you can't concentrate and work effectively in a noisy, loud and tight physical space, good luck getting anything done. 


but really all these are facilities, just things, physical stuff that we can overcome."

I just couldn't sit all day on a chair answering 10-30 phone calls, I rather do something that I can move around and deal with people face to face.

So if you don't mind sitting all day long and dealing with random phone calls then I say go for it because it's a good company to work for and there is always opportunities to change positions after 6 months of working.",95% of the consumers has no idea there is a membership fee! when some people calls you they think they are calling the actual contractor or roofer then you have to explain how Angie's list works but as soon as you mention the membership fees they literally slam the phone in your face! even though the fees are reasonable and (I personally find the service very useful) but some people are just CHEAP!

2608,Angi,Ad Sales Rep,2013-05-23,1.0,Ad Sales Representative,flexible schedule to interview at other companies while working for Angie's List.,"They hire 22 new ad sales reps at a time.  They hype in sales training that it is a six figure job constantly and that the average rep made 91k last year.  What they don't tell you about those stats is what you will find out very quickly once you are on the sales floor and the veterian ad sales reps will let you know that those stats are on another commission plan and everything has changed since then.  The real numbers are it's about a 40-50k job, preferrably a first stop for a recent grad and turnover is extremely high.  Management tells you that you can build up a residual check, but on a 16% commission plan spread out over 12 months it equals out to about $20-$30 a deal it is not realistic to say.  Your residual check will be a couple hundred bucks if you are lucky.  I would say 40% of the veteran sales reps are looking for work elsewhere and new employees are so pissed off once they figure out they were straight lied to, if they are smart will look for jobs elsewhere too. In fact, with the flexible schedule, I am interviewing at a different company this morning.  You are just killing time if you choose to work for Angie's List.

I didn't think that was possible. It is all politics and all a big party at Angie's List. The service providers are not valued, the members are not valued, and the employees are definitely not valued. My family and friends were absolutely horrified at the stories I would tell. I never saw anyone in upper management actually manage. Sales is lucrative but the stress is no way to live. The stress doesn't come from the actual sale..it comes from having no leadership and the leadership you do have, will turn on you when it suits them. Any other position outside of sales is low paying and very boring work."

No real experience in leading a team and they are put in charge of 40-50 people right away.  Not a good situation.  Felt I had to be dishonest when trying to sell memberships.  Monthly review process is kind of a joke since they keep changing the goals you are supposed to hit each month and they change what they are looking for all the time.  Sales numbers can be hard to hit due to what they consider to be a sales call (wrong number counts as sales call) and their marketing practices work against the call center reps.  Since they pay to come up first on a Google search, a lot of people think they are calling the actual service provider, so they are upset when they find out they are speaking to someone not with the provider and then even more upset when they find out they have to pay for service.  I would think twice before accepting a position here if it is in the Sales or Service Call Center."

Therefore management is often either under qualified, or not at all. I've seen so many occasions where an employee that was well liked, intelligent, skilled in sales, and a consumate professional was turned down for a team management position. The person who was hired was did not work well with others, was unskilled in sales and coaching, younger, unprofessional, and making rookie mistakes, purely because this person knew people in the management structure and had tenure. Not because they were better qualified For the position. As a result I watched several good team members struggle or quit due to their poor management. 

Certain decisions made on the director levels of this company have been extremely short-sighted and I've seen a consistant decline in the integrity of the structure of this organization. in the last 3 years I've witnessed a general decline in the quality of everything from leads, customer care, and employee care.

Most of the leads they are providing are completely non-applicable businesses, wrong numbers, or business owners' home phone numbers - not cell phones that people might answer.   If someone does pick up the phone a different sales person has usually called them already within the last three months.  They don't really share with you how to prospect on your own when that is the only way you are going to make the number of sales they want you to.  Sales people who have been there for over a year or more can barely meet their sales quotas themselves - so how do they expect someone brand new to accomplish this?  They are hiring about ten new people every week even though there are no fresh leads to call.  Obviously they don't care one bit about your future.

ServiceMagic is OK until you start struggling and then they want to put you on an action plan right away.,Reps are responsible for customers who get bad leads and quit the service.  This results in a charge back on commission.

They are hiring all the time, and if you need a job, chances are you will be hired.","This is a call center that sells internet advertising.  The company says you are a sales consultant, which is not true if it is a numbers game and you have no authority to offer any incentives to the contractor.  You are expected to make over 100 calls/day with at least 3 hours of ""talk time"" everyday.  The work atmosphere is set up so no privacy is available to the employee, with rows and rows of 4 ft cubicles.  You are expected to hit the company goals, regardless of the market and/or time of year and those goals change on the company's need for cash.  The company is only interested in making a quick buck, and once a contractor is brought on board, very little help is available to them.  Management will let you work weekends, but will not pay overtime.  I have heard in meetings suggestions from management that we not take any breaks or eat lunch at your desk so you can make more calls.  

The company is always stating to do the ""right thing"" however they do not follow through with what they preach.  The compensation package changes every 4 to 6 months, along with your sitting arangements.  You may get promoted if you are a great ""yes"" person and do not question management or stick up for anyone.  The sales contests they have are  juvenile.  I have seen everything from musical chairs to a piece of paper saying you did a great job or getting a piece of candy.  Bottom line is the company is cheap.  They do not care about the health of their employees.  They do offer free soda, which does not help the obese people that work there (I would say they have over a 20% diabetes rate).  The company is proud that they will give poor employees something from the food bank that they ask other employees to bring in over the holidays.  If they paid a decent wage, they wouldn't have to do this.

If you happen to get on the bad side of management, they will fabricate reasons to write you up.  It is strictly do as I say, don't question it, and don't talk about it environment.  Management has no respect for their employees.  

The work itself is boring and stressful.  You are told to do things a certain way and given no control as to close the sale."
