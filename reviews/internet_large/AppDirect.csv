There are a few good people there and they put a lot of effort into building a virtual employee experience. Often we had local and global all hands.","- Leadership often changes GTM strategies, which feels like 3-4 times a year.
- Not truly a B2B enterprise software company, more of a software reseller trying to focus on the gross merchandise value (GMV)
- Equity interest is low in the secondary market as the company is no longer hyper-growth and is now in debt financing rounds.
- Top Talent and leadership have been leaving. Recruiting top talent is hard.
- Shifted hiring to less talented regions (not SF) and the quality of new hires is subpar.
- leaders that are left lack top tier tech experience and leadership
- No WFM or adjusted Covid benefits ( no more in-office snacks or meals)
- Still no 401K match- this is a 10 year + old company..."
1,AppDirect,Talk to Former Employees First,2021-11-09,2.0,Anonymous Employee,There are some good people throughout the company. There is also great diversity and inclusion throughout the company. The all hands meetings are informative and fun. Dan Saks is a great charismatic leader and leads a very informative podcast.,"The strategy changes often, causing very high turnover. There are also lots of leadership changes at AppDirect and AppSmart as the strategy changes almost monthly. The company tells a compelling story to hire employees in. So I highly suggest you do the research and talk to others on LinkedIn who recently left AppSmart or AppDirect to learn more about the culture and reasons for turnover before accepting a job here. AppSmart and AppDirect have very different cultures, even though they are both under the umbrella of AppDirect."

7,AppDirect,Why I chose AppDirect over Venture Capital,2019-07-30,5.0,SDR Team Lead,"//   Mentorship - I went from minimal sales experience to setting up deals with some of the largest enterprise companies in the world. AppDirect has also given me a deep understanding of industries like ISV, Manufacturing, MSP/VAR, FinServ, Telco, etc. 

//   View - 360 unobstructed view of San Francisco from the 25th floor (I’m writing this while looking at the Golden Gate Bridge and Alcatraz) 

 //   Friends - I couldn’t wish for a more supportive and friendly work environment, even senior leadership has taken the time to get to know me personally 

 //   Flexibility - I’m given the freedom to take daily gym breaks and work from home when needed 

//   Career Development - I get ~$,1500/yr to go to events, take classes, buy books, etc. as well as unlimited free access to Udemy courses 

//    Salary - they pay is above market average (with an uncapped quota + accelerators) with significant career growth opportunities, 401K, fully covered health/dental

//  Enablement - I’d like to think we are the most enabled SDR team out there...AppDirect has invested in giving us world-class sales tools and marketing collateral, and hands-on training (making my job easier)

//   Andddd yes there’s free lunch every day and all the snacks/drinks you could want","We've had some turnover, but that's the nature of the industry.  The reality is that we're getting invaluable experience."

17,AppDirect,What does it feel like?,2017-05-25,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"What does it feel like to work for a company you believe in? 

AppDirect has an incredible product and an even more incredible vision for the future; striving to build the platform the world needs to find, buy and use software in the modern age. AppDirect is tackling the largest distribution problems the world faces. Problems that the largest fortune 500 companies struggle with and avoid. And we are succeeding!

I work with some of the most talented, passionate, kind and intense people I've ever met. I am excited every day I come to work. The company is growing rapidly but has so many things going on that there is plenty of room to grow and evolve in your role and responsibilities. 

What does it feel like to work at a company you believe in? It feels amazing!","We still have a lean management layer. You need to be a doer! There are no 9-5 jobs at AppDirect and plenty of second jobs to pick up if you're hungry for responsibility. Those who thrive here are those who choose to get involved. 

I won't say we don't have problems. We have a lot of spaghetti code, our builds take a long time, there are serious technical redesigns needed. But our CEOs recognize the issues and have a lot of people dedicated to fixing it. They care a lot about the happiness of engineers. It took a while to get the product to a place where we could focus on the platform as much as we are now. We lost some great and talented people along the way but I am excited and hopeful for the journey ahead."
18,AppDirect,"Growing pains, but bright future",2017-05-01,4.0,Anonymous Employee,"People and transparency! The people are the reason AppDirect is a great place to work. Being surrounded by the best and brightest every day make the job fun and rewarding (and the views from the San Francisco office don't hurt), but transparency has been critical too. Like every company with rapid growth there are ups and downs but I always feel in the loop and know how to contribute.","Growing pains – in some ways AppDirect has suffered from it's own success. Adding headcount, global offices and new technology is a challenge and everyone feels the stain of that on occasion, but if you're looking for a company where you get to define the gray areas it's a good problem to have."

20,AppDirect,"Challenging, engaging, and rewarding",2017-04-27,5.0,Staff Product Designer,"AppDirect is flying at a million miles per hour on a mission with a huge scope. They need all the help they can get, and there is no shortage of challenging and exciting projects to work on. The amount of growth opportunities for you here is only limited by the amount you're willing to take on. If you're motivated and engaged, it's very easy to find strong opportunities for yourself here.","Not a lot of supporting structure, you'll have to carry your own weight.

21,AppDirect,"Burnt out, frustrated and saddened",2017-03-30,2.0,Anonymous Employee,"The relationships I built with my peers were very meaningful and significant. Good people DO exist at AppDirect, but they're also powerless, get burnt out, fed up, or disgusted, and inevitably leave. There are people there who SHOULD be cultural role models, but aren't treated like that.","Negative, stubborn, spiteful, grudge-holding executive leadership. Rampant cronyism. Broken promises. Lack of autonomy. Consistent turnover—people so thoroughly frustrated that many left without securing a new position elsewhere. You can feel the dissatisfaction looming throughout the office."

AppDirect has all the same problems and worse, because they don't yet have the profits or reach to justify it. They've hemorrhaged entire teams of talented people over the past few years, to say nothing of all the minorities and women they've mistreated and driven away. Nepotism begets nepotism. Leadership has made no effort to change. There is no soul-searching, empathy, or critical judgment when you've had everything handed to you your whole life. They've squandered talent — everyone who doesn't look or act like the leadership eventually leaves. If you have no ambition or independent thought, then this is the company for you. In terms of strategy, they've spread themselves thin with a lack of product focus and a string of vanity acquisitions. Eventually the multi-year contracts procured with inflated promises will run out so it's only a matter of time before the lack of results speaks for itself."

- Inexperienced, arrogant leadership and managers running the show, i.e. cronyism at its best!
- Humility is apparently a value but nowhere to be seen
- CEO runs the show and changes focus/goals constantly for projects

- Free snacks and beverages, catered lunch on Fridays
- Friendly atmosphere and decent amount of social events
- Smart, yet underutilized, team members","- The lack of incentives to be a long-term or loyal employee is comical. There isn't even the semblance of a dangling carrot. CEOs literally think we should all be eternally grateful for getting to work at AppDirect.  
- If you have a problem with anything related to the company, you are led to believe it's a problem with you, not them. 
- Constructive criticism that makes the company look even slightly bad is NOT encouraged. Don't even think about complaining or you will be pegged as a rabble-rouser by HR. 
- Almost zero potential for promotions, raises or bonuses. Raises capped at 4% no matter what. 
- Much like high school, there are severe distinctions between the inner circle and everyone else. Engineers are more or less ignored while the sales team gets expensive offsites, dinners, and recognition. CEOs have their 'favorites' that get fast-tracked to managerial positions that they are 100% not qualified for. 
- Monthly town hall is basically an opportunity for leadership to toot their own horns and repeat the same propaganda over and over. 
- Huge focus on company values that are not exemplified by leadership.
- Zero mentorship possibility here. There is no one to learn from given that there is a serious lack of director/VP level staff."
26,AppDirect,Rapid Growth and Very Unique Company,2016-08-05,4.0,,AppDirect has a very broad product offering and has grown rapidly with some very big customer wins as well as acquisitions. Very interesting and unique platform. Very positive culture. Amazing HQ office in downtown SF.,Rapid growth (also a pro) has resulted in some gaps in processes especially around training and communications. Still very much a startup in many ways despite having over 500 employees.

28,AppDirect,Great Team,2016-04-06,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"AppDirect has put together a great team of people, in all departments.  They have been able to do this by hiring people that fit with their values - Intensity, Ownership, Humility, Positive Mental Attitude (PMA) and True North.  Interviewing at AD is as much about the values as it is your skill set.","The commute into downtown SF can be a problem.  They do have a small office in Sunnyvale, and of course they have a big team in Montreal as well."
29,AppDirect,Amazing company,2016-03-21,5.0,Manager,AppDirect is an amazing organization. The culture is great and people focused. The work environment is high energy and there are lots of interesting work.,"Similar to any fast growing company, sometimes there is a lack of structure. As our company has gotten larger, it gets more difficult to maintain the culture, but overall still very good."
30,AppDirect,"Brilliant team, Challenging environment",2016-02-17,5.0,Business Development,"AppDirect is a software distribution company. Others might give you different definitions, but very simply, we exist to distribute SaaS, through channel partners, to businesses worldwide. What's great about this business model is that there isn't a single company that has done this before. Similar models were in place for legacy software, but never strictly for SaaS.

This means that you are working on something that has never been solved by anyone else. Not sure what motivates others, but for me, this is incredibly inspiring. There is a huge market opportunity for SaaS channel sales and it is largely untapped.

It is this potential that has driven some of the best and brightest in the Bay Area to come work here. The level of talent that walks around this place can be intimidating. I've always believed that no matter what you do, if you don't have a strong team, you will fail. AppDirect has done a fantastic job to ensure they have the right people in place to succeed.","The work can be quite challenging. As stated above, we are trying to do something that has never been done before. Inherently this means that there are constantly changing processes and priorities. This is not for everyone. 

For those coming from the tech startup world, this isn't surprising. But for people used to process-oriented machines, this might not be the best place.

Additionally, this highly dynamic environment can place an unfair burden on the managerial staff. Individual contributors within the company have more flexibility to adapt quickly, but those with teams underneath them can struggle with communicating pertinent updates and new initiatives to their direct reports."

Employees get a lot of ownership and drive new initiatives from start to finish. Lot of support at the executive level for employee-led, employee-run projects that extend from engineering to recruiting functions.",Nothing different from what you would expect from a growing tech startup.
39,AppDirect,3 years I won't get back..,2015-07-21,2.0,ISO,"Novel concept and leaders in the market, so the company is doing well. Their SF office is amazing, and they dropped a ton of cash to make it impressive. The views are great, free healthy snacks and drinks and free Friday lunches. You get new modern equipment and you'll have all the tools you need to do your job. 

If you're just out of college or this is your second job, you'll learn a lot and it'll be a good place to earn your stripes.

Overall ill value the friends I made there and the new tech I learned. And I think Co-CEO Daniel Saks could develop into a great leader.","I joined because the VP of Ops, who I worked for, was an amazing leader. I should have seen the red flags when they cut him lose for no reason. I was then moved under the CTO. In 2 years under him, he refused to ever give me a 1 on 1 or a performance review (which are mandatory). Even after sitting down with him the HR to try and resolve those problems, he still refused. Then the Dir of HR quit. Meanwhile I wasn't allow to attend any training, allowed to go to any conventions, renew any of my certs or even have a budget. And this is on top of my doing my job and being on call 24/7 for almost 3 years. 


Part if the culture is ""no ego"", but it's really more a ""do as I say, not as I do"".  I gave my employees reviews and even dealt with hiring and firing a few, but my boss couldn't be bothered to do the same. 

I also felt that I, and other older employees, were treated differently. Several people and I raised this issue with HR, and they told us to stop talking about it. 

Seriously. 

Overall the company doesn't just value experience or mentors, they want rock stars and bro's. You'll probably see this as a theme in the other reviews.

There is also serious brain drain going on, as the more experienced people bail within a year or two. The kids and Millennials stay - yes it's that kind of company.

So if you're career minded, keep moving. If you're just starting out, give it a try.

PS. The company ""pays"" employees to leave gold reviews. Want a free breakfast? Leave a good review. Take from that what you will."
40,AppDirect,"Best Decision I've Made Yet, Here To Stay",2014-11-11,5.0,Business Development,"I've been with the company for less than a year, but here is what I can share of my experience so far:
- Incredible culture focused on fostering growth and success
- Opportunity to own more than your defined role and shine within the company
- Flat org and access to executives at any time
- Market leading platform that continues to improve and evolve into an industry disrupting technology
- Working with the largest companies in the world and impacting millions of businesses
- Great office atmosphere and amazing views (24th/25th Floor, 360-deg view of city and bay)
- Competitive benefits (Equity, 401K w/ matching, Free Bay Club Membership, Free Healthcare/Dental/Vision, Catered Lunches, and others)
- Monthly town halls to highlight successes, improvements, spotlight new hires, and share new initiatives

There are plenty of other reasons, but the simplest way I can put it is: this is the best place I've worked yet and I feel like I'm a part of something that's making a difference.","- The company is still getting to the point of building training tailored to specific roles, meaning expect to be ready to own your role and find the answers - especially if on the business side
- We operate pretty lean all things considered so the hours can be hectic and unpredictable at times
- The product and capabilities continue to grow so it can be daunting at first"
41,AppDirect,"Your average startup, no rocket ship",2014-10-03,3.0,Senior Software Engineer,"Many good people still work here though quite a few have moved on recently.
Brand new 24th floor office.
Catered lunch on Fridays. Lots of snacks lying around in general.
Lots of changes/hiring although in engineering most new hires were for the Montreal office.
Clear core values that are emphasized often.","Not engineering driven or product driven. Revenue mainly comes from a few large multi-year deals. Custom work with tight deadlines driven by large clients divert a significant amount of engineering resources. Custom work don't scale. Often have to deal with outdated technology. That said, the company is moving down market and trying out lower-tier versions to appeal to more customers. The jury is still out but currently seems unlikely to become a big public company.

Work-life balance depends on your team - TPM teams tend to have tight deadlines. All of engineering is on a weekly release schedule and weekly development cycle => it can be high intensity, which is actually a core value.

Not transparent - There're people in the management layer/in the know and then there are the rest. Monthly town halls are good but not enough."
42,AppDirect,"Amazing culture, great team!",2014-07-01,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"These are just major reasons I like working here, since there are many more:
- CEOs are focused on building culture. Core values here are very specific, not just feel-good buzz words, geared toward guiding the individual. This is one way the company shows it values the individual and realize that an organization is only as good as its people. 
- One of our core values is Humility, and thanks to which, people have very low ego here. From where I am, haven’t seen much office politics.
- Everyone I’ve worked with is very good at what they do, friendly and open to discussing new ideas. 
- Upper management are very transparent about what’s happening with business. CEOs host all-hand meeting for the entire company every month and share company results. One all-hand was to go over the result of employee survey, open address raised issues, even if only one person mentioned it.
- Just started peer mentorship program, a great opportunity for senior team members to help new hires get onboard faster, while improving their leadership skills. We do things based on feedback and need, not because it’s what’s “always done”.
- Quarterly team rotation gives members some opportunities to work on different kinds of projects
- Weekly release cycle eases some pressure for deadlines, since it’s not too bad to miss a release for most projects, so haven't experienced too much crunch time. 
- Events group dedicated to hosting fun events every month, e.g. game nights, hikes, happy hour","- We work with some big partner companies, so there is consistent pressure on some teams to deliver partner projects
- Team allocation is generally based on project needs, so an individual may not change teams as often as they’d like
- Some processes still need to be hammered out as team grows, but I'm optimistic it'll improved over time"
43,AppDirect,"Work hard, play hard.",2014-06-05,4.0,Anonymous Employee,AppDirect has done a great job of hiring over the past couple years and has put together an incredibly strong and talented team. I'm always learning new things from my co-workers and feel like I can approach anyone with a question. The company has a great sense of culture and everyone is united in working toward a common goal.,Major product decisions are made by a relatively small and tight knit group at the company. It's often times difficult to feel like you've made a significant dent when things are run in this way.
44,AppDirect,One the best places I've ever worked,2014-06-05,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"AppDirect is the first place I’ve worked where I feel treated like an adult. You are expected to deliver on your goals and objectives, but you are given wide latitude to meet them. Compensation and benefits are very, very good.","As others have said, fast growth leads to some confusion. The ""go go go” approach means some initiatives are started without clear goals, work is duplicated across teams, or it ends up being obsolete as soon as it’s finished. 

Also, the office is very nice, but the open office style layout is a productivity killer."
45,AppDirect,Ownership and Awesome Career Growth,2014-06-05,5.0,Creative Director,"When I started at AppDirect, I could count my surrounding colleagues on just my hands. Now, 4 years in and with over 100 new people on the team, I'm more proud than ever for the opportunity I've had at AppDirect.

In the early days, our co-founders emphasized that with a shared vision and hard work, everyone  would have the opportunity to take ownership over their careers and form the trajectory of AppDirect's business and culture. During my tenure at AppDirect, I've gone from being a sole individual contributor to leading an incredibly talented Design team. Along the way, no one explicitly told me to create a department or lead a team. I approached the endeavor with AppDirect's core vision in mind and was met with support as the Design team not only defined itself as an autonomous group within the company, but also established design as a core responsibility to our success.","As a fast growing and youthful startup, it sometimes can feel like there is a lack of experienced managers to mentor people such as myself who had teams that are growing to 10+ people. I really want to be successful in my leadership abilities, and having more available and invested people to help do so would be great."

Incredible office space in downtown San Francisco where collaboration and open communication is highly encouraged across all teams. The company also has a very well defined set of cultural values that set it apart from any other organization I've ever been a part of.","The company is growing rapidly and experiencing some growing pains, so at times it can be difficult to know who manages specific responsibilities and who to go to with certain questions."
