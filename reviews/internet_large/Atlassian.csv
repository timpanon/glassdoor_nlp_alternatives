2. Great benefits 
3. Good work life balance","Definitely changing culture, they’ve scaled so fast in the bast 3 yrs that they are losing their incredible culture they have always been known for. Lots more red tape, tons of duplicative work across the org, and honestly, a big big favoritism towards any product team in Australia. If you’re outside of Australia, good luck in getting any sort of recognition for your work or acknowledgement for the potential of new products….in fact key product teams in Australia have been to repackage ideas as they’re own them ironically get very territorial about anyone else speaking up regarding the problem/solution space"
1,Atlassian,Great Culture,2022-04-09,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Super great culture, managers and leadership and really supportive and encourage career growth

5,Atlassian,Easy but boring. No career growth opps,2022-04-06,3.0,Data Analyst,Coworkers are nice. Company treats us well. WLB is insanely good.,Work is incredibly boring. No career growth opportunities
6,Atlassian,A Company That 100% Follows Its Values,2022-04-05,5.0,Senior Support Engineer,"The culture at Atlassian is definitely different than any company I have worked at. It eats, sleeps and breathes its company values in a way I never would have expected.

The benefits are amazing. Just a few include:
- Remote first company. Working in an office is available, but never required.
- Untracked PTO and they want you to use it. They even schedule refresh days where they want everyone to take the day off to refresh and recharge.
- Generous parental leave. 26 weeks for the birthing parent, 20 weeks for the non birthing parent.

The company is also big on providing clear career paths and performance feedback which is refreshing to see.

Atlassian really seems to be headed in a good direction as it has been historically. It keeps acquiring startups that align with its values and using their technology to improve its own and expand their customer base. These seem to be smart moves and for the most part, seem to go well.","This is the company that invented Jira, so it's Jira EVERYWHERE. If you are one of those people that can't stand using Jira, you might have a hard time.

Open Company, No BS (Glassdoor made me sensor 😅 ) is one of the company values. This means they welcome feedback from employees and sometimes people really run with that. You may come across some spicy comments on announcements. Not necessarily a con since it's nice to see that management wants to hear the feedback, but sometimes it can drag on you if you are affected by negative comments. Or you can just not read the comments."

8,Atlassian,Phenomenal Culture,2022-04-04,5.0,Sales Analytics Manager,So far there hasn't been a ton of exec fire drills that you typically see at a lot of tech companies. It's a much more relaxed environment to work in. Fully flexible work situation where I can WFH full time or go into the office as I choose. Comp and benefits are fantastic.,"The distributed workforce can leave out a sense of camaraderie found in the trenches of the office, but it's a small price to pay for the benefit of WFH and not having to commute everyday."

- Thoughtful work/life balance measures like ""Refresh"" days for my whole team so we can take time off without getting lots of messages while we're out. 
- Flexibility - work from anywhere, unlimited PTO, lots of different ways of working across teams and individuals
- Interesting projects and challenges - the company is large but many orgs are exploring exciting new things and have exciting start-up energy
- Regular growth check-ins and opportunities to try new things
- Lots of chances to give back through paid time off for volunteering and company donation matching","- Can be long hours, especially if you're on a global team (meeting times across Australia, Europe, India, USA can lead to 12 hour days at times) 
- Pretty high workload, often with some degree of ambiguity - the company is growing quickly and supports lots of new ideas meaning you're often across multiple projects at once"
12,Atlassian,Big org  = big opportunities,2022-03-31,4.0,Anonymous Employee,"Emphasis on culture, remote-friendly workplace, diverse employee base, opportunities to go above and beyond and really make an impact","Scaling at an incredible rate, so will be interesting to see how the org maintains their unique culture over the coming years"
13,Atlassian,Best company ever?,2022-03-30,5.0,Senior Data Scientist,"I love working at Atlassian. I primarily joined for a better Work-Life balance, and it delivers on that--though I will say it might vary based on what team you are on (though generally good). The Atlassian values are embraced by everyone. You'll find support for your new ideas, and you'll be less impeded by office politics. I hope to never leave. 

- Really collaborative culture
- Strong adherence to values
- Great support for innovation
- Solid benefits
- They are still newish to data science, so a lot of opportunities to contribute in a meaningful way to the business
- You don't need a PhD to work on machine learning models here
- Remote work is well-supported
- Large company but still feels startup-y in many ways. You thus get the stability of a company that's not about to go under","- Funding decisions are often driven by initiatives; infrastructure work or long-term projects are often underfunded and understaffed
- Wish they offered a stipend for remote employees to join coworking spaces
- Less data maturity than some tech peers, so tooling or data quality may be work-in-progress
- A lot of ""data science"" work is actually analytics--know what you're applying for
- Still very Australia or Pacific-coast staff heavy, so east coast workers may find it annoying
- Promotions are less quick than I'm used to"

33,Atlassian,It's as good as they say it is!,2022-03-14,5.0,Senior Business Analyst,"Amazing supportive culture that prioritises psychological safety, transparency and constructive feedback. Senior staff are approachable and everyone truly lives by the company values. Company values come up in conversations all the time and truly lead the way with decision making. Pay is excellent and they don't glamorise overworking but encourage balance and rest.","Sometimes the openness of the company means random people will give you feedback which can seem a little scary at first, but there is good intent and all communication is encouraged to be delivered in the most productive way and not as something to tear others down. They truly do prioritise diversity and inclusion but it is definitely a male dominated company in the engineering / development teams which can be a little intimidating when you join as a woman. Everyone is really lovely though and I have not experienced or witnessed any sexist remarks. My manager has not been super hands on with setting career milestones and plans for my future development yet, so I am a little concerned of lack of trajectory in my career but it is still very early days for me so that could change in future."

Company values each employee, considers your opinion, comp'd very fair, great benefits, and the list goes on. Always room for career growth, and is encouraged by Atlassian.","None really IMO. Company moves incredibly fast at times which can be overwhelming, but a good thing as well.

Top Management always focuses on employees' health, benefits and work-life.","Lower management trying hard to spoil this companies culture and work-life balance in India.
Undeserved people managers hired and made the engineer's life and progress a hell.
Internal mobility has very less opportunities for Indian employees, as they can't move to another domain within India as most of the roles are opened for only Managers and Developers.
Most of the DevOps, SRE and Cloud opportunities are based out in Sydney and internal mobility doesn't allow us to move easily even if we are fully qualified technically, however they hire people from other countries."

Everyone I've encountered is super motivated to do well and help out their fellow team members. Most customers have been using Atlassian products for years and the organization has only recently deployed a full-time sales team, which I think is a testament to the product's awesomeness.

Many nice delighters like company holidays or gift packages that are unexpected. A structured system for levels.,Sometimes there can be a strong disconnect between PM's and management and the developers. People want to know that things are being done rather than what is being done. Tooling is surprisingly under developed and the developer experience is lacking. There can be a lot of politics that come with working with so many people.
58,Atlassian,Not the best if you are serious about your career,2022-02-22,2.0,Sales Representative,"Lots of perks that you would expect from a large org, work was easy.","Where to start, management in the Boston office is very bad. They do not fire ANYONE. Because of this the management team is a group that was in the right place right time and not true leaders more glorified babysitters. Talking with people that worked in the Texas office this was not the case there just in Boston. Lots of bullying happening on slack due to the bro culture that they just let happen. I would really recommend if you are someone who is serious about sales and wants to make lots of money and enjoy where you work to look elsewhere."

It also means that I can work wherever I want in Australia so I transferred back to my home state and be closer to my family especially during the pandemic.

I also like the psychological safety in the company. I'm able to say what is on my mind without having to think whether management would like to hear it or is it stepping on someone toes and offending them. It does feel that you are getting listened to. 

I also like the fact that they really care about their people and would rather postpone releases than work their people to exhaustion.","I do find that things work slower in Atlassian. If there's an initiative, I find that there's a lot more hierarchy that you need to go through first before things get decided. 

I am also finding that following OKRs all the way to the little product teams feel more like it's hindering working faster and doing the right thing for the product. The teams are structured based on those OKRs which means that these teams will step on each other's toes more often than not. I also find that product has a much louder voice than the engineering health of the product which means that after a few years of not dealing with engineering health, the product suffers that everything gets halted.

Things are changing though and I hope it does continue to change for the better."
84,Atlassian,A workplace like home,2022-01-31,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"It's the most employee centric workplace to be at. In every decision big or small the employees are the most prioritised.
Its very values oriented and that's not something that's ever compromised.
Employees get lots of opportunities to innovate and learn at the company's expense.
CSR being one of the primary objectives, each and everyone starting from the founders participate and contribute to the society and environment.
A diverse employee strength from all social groups and work backgrounds gives way to fresh thought processes to implement in decision making.","Atlassian being very value centric, many of the things which are very normal outside may not be encouraged here. This may put you off hook in the initial period.
As everyone's opinions and feedbacks are encouraged, finding a process written on the stone is tough here. So one has to adapt to resetting expectations again and again."

Here my daily routine does involve solving interesting problems and creating state of the art software.
I found at Atlassian an autonomy that I never thought it would be possible. I feel empowered and provided with the tools to improve any aspect of our products.","One of the company's values (Open company) has been weaponised and people feel empowered to shout their opinions about absolutely anything; but rarely showing empathy. I don't think this is something exclusive to Atlassian and it won't take it down from my ranking, but I avoid talking about non work stuff as people will get offended for pretty much anything."

- very team dependent, if you are unlucky and being allocated to a team where the manager does not really support you well or the team culture is not so good, it would be very had for you to progress
- not very inclusive, for example some people with loud personality are more welcomed and becomes popular but not the case for some other people
- too much depends on the presentation, meaning just doing things is not enough , you have to SHOW and ""Brad about it"" in order to gain recognition and reputation, visibility is understand able but this is a bit over."

The analysts are great teammates, I worked with many talented ICs in analytics.",Management encourages ICs to compromise data quality standards for speed. Stakeholders do not demonstrate basic competency with interpreting statistics. Too many ICs per manager means low manager support for you. Stakeholders are controlling and want to manage down to the order in which you do your project work. Team culture and cohesion is nonexistent.

- i feel valued & heard despite having only started 3 months. 
- quite a few company benefits!","- the interview process was quite long and stressful (8 interviews!). It was worth it but they might consider reducing the number of interviews as one can easily give up halfway through the recruitment process.

132,Atlassian,"Very good place to work, but....",2021-12-19,4.0,Senior Software Engineer,"Atlassian takes care of its employees. This was made very clear during the pandemic, with Atlassian providing extra perks, mental health days, re-organising the office to reduce risk of spreading (extra cleaners, special equipment, can work from home 100%). In general there are a lot of events organised, gifts, etc. The workplace experience team works hard and has the backing of management.

Salaries are good (now). They were lagging for a long time but they've somewhat caught up. They're not ridiculously high, but between stocks/bonuses/salaries you are well compensated.

Work/life balance is in general good, depending on your role/department. Mobility between management and engineering streams is there and is relatively easy to accomplish.","The big con: Career progression. It is very, very difficult to get promoted at Atlassian. Going from a mid level role to a senior role takes years of proving yourself, and even then isn't guaranteed.

And if you hit the ""senior"" (P5) role, you're just stuck there. There are many skilled engineers at that level who have been trying for years to progress but the bar keeps getting raised. P6 is nearly impossible to achieve and this is well known by engineers who accept that the only way forward is to leave, get promoted elsewhere, then perhaps come back.

Theoretically, there are levels about P6 (P7, P8, P9) but those levels are really just on paper to say they exist - virtually no-one actually gets there in the entire company. You can work for years at Atlassian and never meet a P7."

The product marketing team owns the GTM, and by that I mean truly owns it and drives it. At other companies PMM tends to be just another marketing team but here if you are a product marketer you will have broader scope and responsibilities than in other companies. 

Pay is competitive, good amount of RSUs and very good flexibility to work from anywhere makes this a great place to be.","As with any big company, sometimes there's lots of red tape and different teams involved until decisions can be made. The procurement process (related to new vendor onboarding and contractors) is driven by sloths (if you have seen Zootopia, the DMV scene sums it up).

Because the company is so hot, there's been a good number of middle management leaving to get executive positions at other places, but it also opens up career opportunities for other team members.

Increasingly competitive market makes your work always interesting and in some cases too competitor-focused."

- Confusing org chart and hierarchies. These things are often changing too, which can be hard to follow.

Goodies that get sent to you
Food is amazing and free(ofcourse hr mentions this part of CTC)","CSS in Bangalore is run like a BPO. The managers have never been technical in their life and think anyone can learn core technologies in very short time. 
The managers in Bangalore are mere puppets of their counterparts in Amsterdam and lack the spine to speak anything against what they say. 
The KL team from Malaysia was removed and Bangalore was added, so a few of the KL employees who were retained and moved to Amsterdam do not like the team in Bangalore. So there is a lot cold feud brewing from the top management (few KL guys got up there as well) and the engineers. 
Lets not even talk about the HRs, they are just a puppet in managers hands and totally lack any common sense.
The Atlassian values which is so widely talked about in social media is just limited to that. It's a totally hire and fire policy. 
The stress is silent and the torture is mental. 
The base pay is very low. If not for the initial stock options no one will stay here. 
Don't go by the gimmicks on LinkedIn, CSS in Bangalore is not the place to be if you have self respect and looking for organic growth."

242,Atlassian,The Best Professional Experience I've Ever Had,2021-10-01,5.0,Program Manager,"The company is truly progressive, not just in what they said, but in their actions. Employees are encouraged to express their opinions freely, whether they are positive or critical, and regardless of whether they're in direct opposition to leadership. One of the first things I noticed about Atlassian when I was interviewing was how many people have been there for 5+ years; Ive spent the last 5 years in software and I've never seen this anywhere else. In working at Atlassian, I understand why this is - there are a lot of opportunities for growth and incredible benefits. My manager has been really supportive of me doing more of everything I enjoy and less of everything I don't enjoy. I plan on staying with Atlassian for as long as I can (10+ years). I have incredible work/life balance and this is something the company supports wholeheartedly.","Working for a company this large can be pretty confusing, especially if you're coming from a smaller compan. The size of the company is both a blessing and a burden - because of its size, there are a ton of resources; however, with so many employees across so many teams and so many locales, figuring out exactly who to speak to about specific issues can be challenging. Also, the company currently determines salaries based on the going rate for the market each employee is based in. A lot of employees have expressed criticism about this and I'm hopeful that this will change in the near future."

I'm being supported in taking care of my whole self; I'm being stretched in ways that are making me a better professional; I'm surrounded by top talent at every level - the company focus on the right additions vs. the right fit has made this the place to be.

+The company - which is truly the people who work here - finds new and meaningful ways to ""refill my cup"" each day. 

Simply - the best!","I'm struggling to think of many - if any - cons. I'm sure they are there, but any that have come up have been easily worked through and turned into positive experiences through teamwork, collaboration, and support."

It does feel like the company cares about their people and even the global community, i.e. the company is run on 100% renewable energy, we get paid time off for volunteer work, charity donation matching up to (I think) $2500 per year. Something else that I'm impressed by is the progressive, open culture where people feel open to speak about issues other than the typical mind-numbing water cooler talk at a company-wide level (issues like loss, suicide, infertility, taking a break for mental illness, etc.). Paid therapy sessions. A budget of $500 per year for wellness.

* Healthy work culture.
* Management actually looks into the work you are doing and gives deserving recognition.
* Best company to grow proffessionally.
* Atlassian justifies its values all the time by being open about everything.
And so on....
Lets talk a bit about perks and benefits:
* Medical insurance
* Term insurance
* RSUs(this one is best because Atlassian stocks are really reaching heights everyday)
* Fitness and wellness budget
* You will get lots of hoodies and tshirts(I have more than 10 tbh)
* You will get some good laptop and travel bags(I have 3)
* Transportation(when in office)
* All possible food items in cafeteria(when in office - a gym person can take his full day diet in office, all protein rich items are available always😉)
* Work from home budget(to setup your wfh setup - and the amount is enough to get you monitors, keyboard, mouse etc -- you can get anything that is needed for you to be effective at work)
And there are lots of other benefits...every now and then you will get gifts delivered to your home..I recently got a movie projector)
...there are many things to talk about positives of Atlassian. I will need to think and write but I think above is enough for someone to know who is looking for a switch.","Not really but I think at some stage your salary saturates and wont increase with market.
I am getting double of what Atlassian is paying me, if I switch today. But I believe it is same for all companies, salary hikes internally are lesser than external switch. You can get 100% or even more when you do a switch but you cant get the same in getting promoted in same company.
Well lets not take this as a negative point because it is common for all techs."

Teams I've encountered are driven and hard-working, while knowing how to respect each other's (and their own) work-life balance. I was always given the trust and respect to do my work on my own time. Outcomes over outputs.

Flat structure means things are leaner and there's less bureaucracy.

The remote-first policy has been great during the pandemic, and means you can live almost anywhere and still work for the company.

The benefits are incredible, and the stock options are pretty good. Generous bonus targets and yearly market adjustment (though they froze it last year)","- The flat structure is a double-edged sword. It can make it really, really hard to get things done sometimes because no one is really accountable.

- You'll take a pay cut if you choose to live away from most major cities

- Getting a promotion is really difficult. Get ready to write an essay, make an internal portfolio, and do countless growth meetings about why you worked above your current level for the past year, then still maybe get looked over.

The higher the position, the more the people are full of themselves, there is no trace of humility- the one that they put forward in their values, it is crazy hard to move within the org, once you are in a role they label you at that level and they won't let you move forward, they will rather hire from outside then let you grow, which I think is a big NONO."

Only team players need apply.,There's A LOT of content to digest here. Some historical and tons of fresh content coming in at a very fast pace.

- This company is known for its values and being an employee I have experienced it myself that how much importance is given to every value Atlassian talk about.

- Atlassian provides some of the best perks which I don't think any other company provides, from reimbursements of all the necessary things to delivering frequent goodies and a lot of paid leaves.","- Some teams can have more amount of work which affect their work life balance while some teams can have less amount of work which affect the overall growth and learning.

They purchased the company I worked for and it was clear that my managers did not want me on their team. My manager actually said ""that's great!"" when I found a new position. They offered me relocation within Europe, and then AFTER the period to sign the contract had expired they decided to change that to the USA. After we had done renos on our condo and put thousands of dollars into preparing for the move. Forced enthusiasm is rampant, and entirely fallacious. The organization is absolute garbage, and they do not listen to anyone who is not a senior exec. Give this gong show a pass."

All the key decisions are taken in the US and APAC is looked like a service center, managers in India have no role in those decisions. They are just the executors of the decision. Here comes the worst part those who sit in US outlook towards APAC is they push the work as if APAC can work day and night to get the job done and they chill out and portray it was done and dusted by them. 
Here comes the heart of the topic, those who were migrated from APAC and settled in the US show more ""HATE"" than the residing Americans, I don't know whether to cry or laugh on this. Ohh god."

I've been here 4 years and have worked at a multitude of other companies, but this one takes the cake. From the way they treated us in pre-covid times (food, fitness, excessive off-sites, and other perks) to the way they've handled the transition during covid (extra funding for a WFH budget, mindfulness training, mental health resources for us and dependents, virtual fitness classes, extra covid PTO) - they make me feel like my person comes before my work.

In my experience, every employee is heard, validated, and supported by their leadership and their team.

The perks are out of this world. Wellness reimbursements, great insurance options, 401K matching, company swag...the list goes on. I feel very valued and appreciated here at Atlassian and it motivates me to give back to the company in constructive ways.",Change is a constant and we are always iterating.

368,Atlassian,"Best Job I've had, not all sunshine and rainbows though!",2021-06-23,4.0,Software Engineer,"Psychological safety is very important and people feel free to speak their minds even if it goes against project goals, you're encouraged to not save anything for yourself and you don't have anything to be afraid of, people will hear your arguments!

People really hold to heart the companies values and I think they are one of the great culture-defining things the company has.

Employee wellness feels like a top priority, work-life balance for me at least has been great and I feel free to regulate it as long as work is getting done.

for me I have never seen a blame game take place, if there is a problem, people only try to understand to prevent it, not to find someone to blame.

Through these challenging times (cliche much) the thought Atlassian has been putting towards employees is truly heartwarming, I'm proud to work here.

Work is technically engaging, you work with smart people and you're exposed to excellence quite often, you will learn stuff here.","Promotions are a HUGE con for me, as someone not interested in bureaucracy, I'm fortunate to be in a place in my life where I'm not in need of the extra responsibility & money attached to the promotion to the next level, even though I fully believe I'd be qualified for the next position, the process to prove it is so gruelling and cumbersome that I feel I'll never even want to partake in it, it will be definitely easier to look for a new job than to get promoted here.

This gets brought up in every engineering all hands and the answer is always the same with different words. to paraphrase answer is always something like: "" yeah I hear you but we need to keep quality and we believe it's fine like this so nothing's gonna change"" at least they are transparent about it? 

To get promoted you have to build a paper trail (evidence, links, dates, testimonies, slack conversations, zoom recordings, pull request links, etc) of performing at the next level for a whole year and it's always a fight, but if you ace the interview you can still get hired into that level for one witty afternoon. I honestly feel that the paperwork for visas is way easier than this and I think although the need to keep the bar high is 100% true, there must be a better way. 
The company would be a 5 star from me if this was not an issue, if there was a 3.5 stars I'd give it that (hence 4 stars)cause when I learnt this was the process, it broke my spirit and my drive to move up the ladder here.

On the other hand, if you are someone that navigates office politics well, you'll not suffer this much I reckon."

Management is a real concern, your experience at Atlassian depends entirely on the manager you get.

Most toxic workplace I have ever worked in. The onboarding experience is down right awful, workplace bullying and toxicity starts on week one. You'll get yelled at, spoken down to, undermined, told 'that won't work here' and meet resistance at every turn until you give up like the rest of the employees.

Few people at the company truly have experience at scale, as a result decisions take longer than working in public service and the quality of work is laughable.

Success seems to be bound to how much you can talk about the work and self promotion, not enough people actually care to follow up and see if any work is actually being done.

This is career suicide, there is no progression, no one really cares, it's a company full of people who 'rest and vest'. 

Performance is in the hands of management that simply can't be bothered to do their job.

If you go to HR or speak up about any concerns, expect immediate retaliation from your manager."
373,Atlassian,"Good company culture, questionable growth direction",2021-06-20,3.0,Software Engineer,"- humane employee policies (sick/maternity/COVID leave)
- company culture promoting work-life-balance
- engineers are generally nice people (not a toxic nor overly-competitive environment)","- increasing trend of inexperienced managers
- lack of competitive compensation means lower-skilled senior talent
- workforce disproportionally skewed towards newly joined employees
- lack of new successful in-house products. Still relying on popularity and growth of Jira. Increasing number of competitive companies shadowing Confluence, Bitbucket, Jira."
374,Atlassian,Stay away from Atlassian!,2021-06-18,1.0,Software Engineer,"- was good before covid
- above average salary","- When Covid hit, they put all the load on the employees. While most other companies were trying to care for their employees, Atlassian locked us out of the office for the rest of the year. 
- When Covid was over, they basically turned into a full-remote company. The office is finally open now, but only with maximum harassment (hot desking, constant temperature checks, even if people are in the office they have to zoom into meetings individually), so nobody from my team comes to the office and it's essentially a remote company now.
- Endless discrimination at this company. Remote people get favoured. On the other hand if you can't work remotely, management harasses you about your ""performance"". They literally put people into a position where they can't do their jobs anymore and then try to blame the employees for their failing TeamAnywhere policy. It's ridiculous.
- Toxic atmosphere. Many people hate working there, I've literally had graduates ask me, if all companies are as bad as Atlassian (No, they are not! Please don't let a few bad apples discourage you from a career in a great industry) Yet, Confluence and slack are full of people who ""love"" Atlassian. You quickly find out why that is. Any criticism gets shut down immediately. You literally get asked into a 1:1 with your manager when you say anything that is even mildly critical of Atlassian or TeamAnywhere.
- Very political. They constantly blast political propaganda your way (blog posts, e-mails, speeches, non-stop political workshops in your calendar). I don't even always disagree with their views, but it would just be nice to keep politics out of the workplace."

376,Atlassian,"One of the best engineering cultures I've worked with, but there's still some corporate BS",2021-06-15,5.0,Software Engineering Manager,"I love the engineering culture here. As an very senior IC who moved into management after nearly 2 decades of saying ""I would never want to be a manager,"" it's very hard to seen having done this everywhere else, and I hope to stick around here for a good long while.

We have a great team, great products, and I have a high degree of trust in senior engineering management. Our quality bar is good, and improving, and we have a really high respect for work-life balance and a really high bar for collegiality (""play as a team"" as the company values put it.) We do a lot to empower teams and individuals.","Engineering-wise, this place has done the best job of transitioning from a small company to a big one. Really the only big headache is having to deal with the geographical split, and this is going to be true at any company with our multinational footprint - it's just a little different since the main office is Sydney, not one of the US ones.

I wish I could say that was the biggest issue for the rest of the company, but really every time I have a contact with a non-technical team I am reminded that it's not.

Overall, we do OK at everything. Our HR, G&A, IT, etc folks are all well-meaning individuals trying to live out the company values. The company did really, really well in transitioning to remote for COVID and I know people did a tremendous amount of work to make that happen.

Even so, there seems to be a big gap between the policy-making and the empowerment of people on the front lines of those departments. The policies are not ... bad... but they seem to be built around the sort of ""efficiency"" that is only _necessary_ for a company much larger than ours. They also change too often. 

On their own, none of these are all that bad, but on the net I think these are hurting us in our ability to hire and retain talent, and I've seen a number of very good people leave for dumb, avoidable reasons."

400,Atlassian,"Update: New year, same old excuses",2021-05-27,3.0,Content Designer,"* Decent work-life balance
* You mostly have the tools and resources to do your job properly
* The company transitioned to remote well
* People are generally polite and respectful to work with","It's been almost 3 months since my last review. During that time, Atlassian brought in 2 new content designers. They also hired or promoted 3 new content design leads. All 5 are white. The content design team is now more homogenously white than when I first joined it. Even though Atlassian transitioned to remote and new labor markets opened up, leadership is still cherry picking white people.

Actions speak louder than words. It's ironic that a group of content experts don't comprehend that. You can't call yourselves woke if you deliberately sleep on POC talent. If you don't live and lead according to your values, then you never adopted those values to begin with.

Original:

The makeup of content design leadership is 100% white. The makeup of FTE content design team members is almost 100% white. Marketing content, Playbook content, and DevOps content teams are also almost 100% white.

I've been surrounded by white content experts who understand the risk and consequences of inconsistent and deceptive messaging when it comes to their products. But they lack credibility and empathy with their diversity and inclusion messaging. For a full year, they've aggressively marketed themselves as inclusive while continuing a long pattern where only white people are hired, promoted, and meaningfully included. It's a disturbing and dangerous pattern, and I'm saddened that Glassdoor is the only outlet where it's possible for leaders to pay attention and hold themselves accountable for their gatekeeping."

NO one hardly talks to anyone in the meetings. Just management telling us what more needs to be done. Not a friendly feeling with high stress and our internal surveys show it."
480,Atlassian,"Amazing work culture, good perks and benefits",2021-03-14,5.0,Cloud Migration Engineer,"- One of the best companies out there in the world when it comes to pampering their employees. You won't like working in a lot of places after you've worked at Atlassian.
- Good remuneration along with stock options.

Sure, there's free lunches, and a great parental leave policy, but there's also manager training, and checks and balances to make fair decisions.",It's a large company (for Sydney); it can be hard to feel you have significant impact.
483,Atlassian,Just great,2021-03-14,5.0,Software Engineer,"The best thing in Atlassian is that pretty much everyone around you is close to being a genius. The hiring standards are very high so only 'the best' get in. The environment is very inspiring, and you find yourself in a pool of people that know so much and are so good that only makes you want to better yourself. The culture is also amazing, they really care about the employees well-being.","As any big company, there is a lot of process and sometimes developing is quite slow ( 'cause the impact of an error could be catastrophic)."

Rapidly growing.

Lots of Jackets, Hoodies, TShirts, Gifts (Calendar, Pots, Diaries etc etc) 
Great Culture. People actually take the Atlassian values seriously here. Lot of friendly people and a good atmosphere to work in. Great CEOs (Cool CEOs).","There are definitely companies that give more salaries than Atlassian. However, the salary that you get here along with the work life balance is worth it anyways. 
Cross Geo collaboration is difficult sometimes. But I guess this is a general problem in every company."

495,Atlassian,"Great Culture, Amazing Benefits, Humble Leadership",2021-03-07,5.0,Senior Enterprise Advocate,"The benefits are incredible. With a family of four, all healthcare benefits are paid. Atlassian works hard to make sure the employees are taken care of and it shows. They invest in programs to support the mental health of everyone and provide ways to connect with others virtually (through the Pandemic). The leaders are open to feedback and are transparent, answering the tough questions in company-wide meetings, even when it's hard. The culture has been painstakingly cultivated to include all kinds of people. As a parent of a trans child, this in particular has been inspiring to see. There is an emphasis on promotion from within, and there are opportunities to grow your skills to serve the company in new ways.","As an organization that has grown through acquisition, not all systems are integrated, which can make for a difficult experience in learning how to do your day-to-day job. Atlassian is a largely self-organized, self-driven set of software nerds (I count myself among them and don't say that as an insult), as such, it can be difficult to find a human to help you to find answers. It's written down somewhere on a Confluence page, but everything is in Confluence, and if you lack the history and navigational expertise in that platform, it can be very hard to find what you need. Support is always a ticket, but I'm never sure what kind of ticket, what help desk, etc. Be prepared to have lots of systems to learn."
496,Atlassian,Don't believe the hype,2021-03-07,3.0,Premier Support Engineer,"Salary, comp, and benefits can be competitive although that seems to be getting eroded now.
Great place to work if you are a younger Millenial or Gen-Z and like to complain/cry/be offended about everything but not actually do anything about it","Career progression is an overly complex set of hoops that ultimately stops at a single approval from someone you never see or hear from high up the chain.
You have no value if you want to do something more than what you are already doing.
It has become an increasingly US-centric (specifically Austin, TX) company leading to other locations being ignored.
Too many people looking for any reason to be offended.
A lot of recent management hires have been external and from big tech i.e. MS, AWS, Dell/EMC, Oracle etc. rather than promoted from within leading to a dilution of a once strong culture.
Don't expect to get anywhere unless you are a minority or have a hard/sad life story to share for likes internally"

The company values are real and a ginormous part of who we are as a company. No company is perfect but this company realizes it and strives every day to do better and to be better. Collaboration, understanding, compromise, teamwork, employee support, encouragement, personal and professional growth... these are all parts of our everyday lives at Atlassian, and I'm proud to be part of this family.

The Founders/CEOs actually listen and engage. You can provide constructive yet critical feedback and they engage, ask questions, lean in, and try to understand. They truly and genuinely care about their employees and it is a literal breath of fresh air.","The rate of change is whiplash fast and it can take your breath away on a regular basis. There is no such thing as ""downtime"", which can be hard if you're uncomfortable with change and/or unable to keep up with a breakneck speed of operations."

That kind of growth is going to mean some growing pains along the way, and even more so with the pandemic happening in this time period. Despite this, I'd still say that the core things that made me excited to join Atlassian are still very much part of the environment.
- Opportunity to make a big impact right away
- The company still values you as a person first and foremost (has shown this during the pandemic)
- Personal initiative is rewarded and encouraged","-Atlassian still wants to move fast and break stuff/learn as we go, this can be complicated as a larger company compared to 3 years ago
-lots of ambiguity in the environment (prioritization can be a challenge)"

Salary and Allowance are good.","Micro-management. 

They will discuss your throughput as if you are in sales or marketing team. 
You have take these much cases so that you can in their good books 

Teach assessments with over whelming work , there is no work life balance .

Every month a new process triggered , they can rely on what as well. 

They will ask you to clear Tech assessments on cases you will work , its better you give interviews, because they the employee who taking these assessments from you , take and treat themselves as god and ask stupid questions as if you are in interview rather an employee. 

You have to praise you peers otherwise they will try bad mouth your performance. 

You are hired as labors, you have to take 5 to 10 issues everyday beside maintaining your backlogs. 

This company value is not self sustainable saying it self an open company, when you provide a feedback they are not ready to accept it.

I get to work on an amazing product that I can relate to and impact so many users. The knowledge sharing atmosphere is on point, career growth is structured and there are a ton of cool events organised by the workplace experience team and a whole lot of other individuals. We are of course very agile, and the shared mindset of wanting to constantly iterate and improve is great.

I'm fully remote - a couple of years ago I never thought I would be happy with a remote job. However, I don't mind it now and I think Atlassian does a really good job of catering to remote workers (WFH budget, online events, sending out small packages every now and then etc.)",Information overload at first.

* no career progression prospect in software dev.
* sweat shop
* no innovation and heaps of red tape
* TCO outside of Sydney is uncompetitive

Here's a truthful review of how Atlassian looks like in 2020/2021. 

1. Toxicity

After the IPO in 2015, the company underwent restructuring. The founders seems to have been put on the side-lines, and new management structures put in place. The top priority for the shareholders, and top management, became growth at all costs. By growth the company means revenues and number of employees.

This means the number of employees in offices like Sydney ballooned from a few hundred to thousands. With that, new layers of management have been hastily added to control growing number of teams and contributor. In my opinion, the hiring bar for developer, and especially management, dropped through the floor, with hordes of new middle managers and line managers joining the company. Those managers were on the scale from underqualified, inexperienced, uninterested to borderline sociopathic. 

If you join Atlassian, depending on your luck, you might have a slim chance of landing in a team with a qualified, passionate, likable and caring manager that will help you grown, while making sure your team succeed.
Unfortunately in most cases nowadays, you'll land with direct manager that will only care about his own performance review and looking good in his structure. You will also likely have multiple middle managers above you who only care about the growth numbers in their spreadsheets, are quick to associate team's successes with their name, and vary from unapproachable, to toxic, to hostile and dangerous.

The management structure is completely separate from the contributors - there's no review process, or complain path about managers. If you attempt going through HR, your complain or feedback lands on the manager's desk the next day. You will never win.

I personally went through months of directed pressure, culminating in direct harassment and more procedural pressure until I burned out so much, that it has horribly affected me and my family. As in many big corporations, HR was anything but helpful in my requests for help. Long story short, I've been pushed out, broken and needing therapy, and the perpetrators have not seen any consequences.

2. There is no career progression,

If you join straight from uni or as entry-level contributor, and you work hard and know whom to please, in 3-5 years you can reach ""senior developer"" level. This is 90% of the workforce and it's close to impossible to get promoted further, or get any raise from there on. Over several years the salaries have been ""adjusted"" to be same or similar level, there's no negotiation, virtually no performance bonuses or raises. The only salary adjusting event is ""market adjustment"" that happens every 1-3 years and is irrelevant of one's performance. Getting new manager every 6-12 months, or getting teams restructured every year doesn't help either, but is a common occurrence (I've had more than a dozen managers in 4 years).

If you really, really want to attain higher levels above ""senior"", there is a broken promotion system that can be summarised as: stay close to your middle manager, laugh at her/his jokes, complement, volunteer to projects, go to lunches together, and you will get promoted in a few years. Few have attempted the ""work harder than anyone"" method, most have burned out, have not been able to get anywhere because it's a biased, social-status and favouritism based system.

3. Sweatshop

Due to aforementioned hiring spree and unsustainable growth, there's too many teams, too many decision makers, owners and interdependencies to be effective. Most of my time was spent in meetings, RFCs, finding stakeholders and trying to convince individuals or teams to change a line of code or two. It's not unusual for changes to never ship, or become depreciated before you finish. It's become almost a ritual that teams get restructured every 6-12 months (disbanded, merged, split, managers rotated, etc.)

There's so much noise and mismanagement that it's become a sweatshop with little recognition or sense of purpose.

4. Lack of innovation

The few major product lines are what the company maintains and where most of the effort is. There's no innovation outside or inside the company, there's no risk taking, no plans for new products, and even acquisitions are awkwardly merged into existing money-making products and original products killed, teams dissolved. Most likely you'll be working in the engine room, refactoring the same thing for years, or working on small adjustments or maybe if you're lucky, working on a minor feature that might never ship."

The company contains a wealth of knowledge and a high-density of intelligent people","High autonomy can mean some teams step on each others feet and reinvent the wheel 7 times, it takes personal effort to coordinate with other teams. This is getting better (and I'm getting better at it)

* Good support for Support Engineers, you're not an after-thought but an important part of the organisation and continued success.
* Onboarding is daunting but well managed - I joined through Virtual Onboarding and you'll get all the support you need. No need to go to an office!
* Team - Team is everything. There are team events for the company, team events for the region, team events for your product group, team events for your local team. You're not going to be forgotten in one spot, there's so much team involvement.
* You'll spend time talking real-time in Slack, rather than in emails. We don't use email as a primary form of communication.
* Comms from Senior Management is actually useful, and relevant.","So many products & teams, it seems no-one does things the same way. Intra-team communication can be daunting because you just don't know where to start asking your questions.
There's a lot of things to read and learn - you'll feel overwhelmed while you're starting and still won't know 1/2 the things you feel you need.

556,Atlassian,Better than most with a few hiccups,2021-02-01,4.0,Software Engineer,"The culture with colleagues is fantastic, you're able to be yourself and a bit more casual while still working together and getting stuff done. 
The perks are really nice and management are quite reactive to what people need (e.g during covid we were given extra leave for covid or stress related time off). 
There's a hierarchy but its culturally accepted to challenge the ideas of those above you. It can still be uncomfortable sometimes but it really helps prevent too much herd-following to bad choices.","The HR department is really slow on dealing with major issues. Pay has consistently been an issue during covid, especially for recent hires as there was what amounted to a pay freeze, and HR dished out empty comms for about 6 months before anything was done. 
The switch to remote-first is also showing some friction post covid as the company isn't sharing much about where we can and can't live or what that'd entail for pay while working remotely beyond ""at your own risk""
It feels like you really need to change the way you work for promotion, rather than just excelling at your job and this is the main reason I see people leave"

- Employees really take company values to heart. Go read them!
- The above really counts as 5 pros :).","- HR becoming less transparent over time.

Founders too busy growing than actually caring for things they preach. HR is the worst team and only politics are saving them, they don’t care much about people anyway. People are scared to talk to approach HR (specially India) as these are bunch of political jokers highly dangerous to deal with. India team (senior management) is terribly weak. They are busy saving their chairs rather than solving any such dark politics that is emerging. The invisible gorilla right there no one sees. Good people are suffering and people who are managing up well growing (HR busy testing politics). If you are in tech still ok but avoid joining recruitment."

565,Atlassian,NA,2021-01-26,4.0,Human Resources Business Partner HRBP,great company to work for,There are not many cons
566,Atlassian,The best place to work,2021-01-26,5.0,Data Scientist,"The company culture is the real thing. The values are important, and it's hard to find a person here who doesn't try to work according to those values. In three years, I can count on one hand the number of people I've met who I was not happy about working with. 

Not only are the people nice, they are smart. They will make you better at your job. They will tell you when you are wrong, usually in the most respectful way possible. I would not love my job if I didn't work with people I like and highly respect.

The business is extremely strong. Atlassian sells inexpensive, good products to millions of people on a subscription model. Even if some disaster hit, it would take a long, long time for the business to actually fail. It is one of the best positioned businesses in tech. The founders are rock solid. They seem to be very sharp but still open to others' ideas, as they should be.

People are paid well. I don't believe it's the best pay, but it's certainly competitive. It would always be nice to have a number that no one else could match, but I have yet to find the company that would be as good to work for and pay the same.

People are treated well. The leadership and HR teams bend over backwards to make sure people are happy. It's probably a smart business decision, but not one that you see many companies take. I don't think the perks are over the top, but I'd rather have the people running things truly care about creating a good place to work than have the best catered lunches. The perks are excellent, especially if you think outside of the Silicon Valley bubble.

That's a good note to end on. Atlassian was created to be a good place to work, for Mike and Scott. As they grew, it was centered on being a good place for new people to work. To this day, employee well being is consistently prioritized, and it's a guiding principle in business decisions. That employee focus has paid off for Atlassian, in terms of finding and retaining people you want to work with.","It's a big company. At this scale, there are communication issues and some of the work is not as exciting as it might have been 10 years ago. So far, the company has done a surprising job of sticking to the original values, but it is going to continue to be a herculean task to stay on course with 5,000, then 10,000 people.

The offices are giant open concepts, which look beautiful but they are difficult to work in for a lot of people. Fortunately, everyone has been able to work remotely throughout the pandemic, and many people will never be required to work full time from an office."

591,Atlassian,Not all quite what it seems - so go in with a very clear plan and set your expectations accordingly,2021-01-09,2.0,Senior Product Manager,"- Undoubtedly the best thing that you will get from working at Atlassian is excellent brand recognition from across Tech and also domestically within Australia. When you leave this will put you in a good position to negotiate with a new employer. The Atlassian PR is second to none, I cannot express enough how well this will work in your favour for your career. 

- If you want to focus and prioritise other things in life and not work too hard - Atlassian has ""great"" work life balance (great if you are lazy) and things are super flexible.

- If you want endless beer, chips, magnums and other junk food and drink, you will love this place - but now that it's COVID, that has ended. 

- The founders seem like a decent bunch of guys. They are prob my favourite thing about Atlassian.","- Firstly if it is so great, why are so many people constantly leaving? The Atlassian's PR machine is exceptional, the company seems amazing and in the beginning it all seems too good to be true, that's because it is. Prepare for a reality shock if you join, that will be come apparent after about 2 years. 

- Oversharing - People overshare here in the guise of bringing their authentic self to work. It makes it a weird place to work and I think this contributes to all the weirdness that I will mention below. Sure I have met some close friends at work - but come on, it's work people, chill out!

- Any company that has a value ""Open Company No BS"" and that constantly repeats how honest they are, well you can guess - aren't actually that open and honest. People at Atlassian don't really like honesty nor do they like to give it. Like all other large corporations people manipulate figures to look good, everyone pretends to care more about customers than everyone else and it be comes this endless orgy of fakeness. 

- Hello Political Correctness! You have never met a more sensitive bunch of people and you really need to be careful with what you say. Someone is often offended somewhere from something someone else said, no joke it could even be an emoji, rarely is anyone direct about it, instead it trickles down through other channels like HR and bosses. It makes a weird hard-to-address friction between teams which is really challenging when products are so decomposed and teams need to collaborate. 

- All the positive reviews here are from people that are new, I too drank the Kool-Aid in the beginning and reposted awesome things about Atlassian on my social media feed as well. All seemed amazing. But a few years in you start to see toxic and undesirable patterns that have always been there but you just didn't notice.

- Atlassian's HR and bosses are not honest about compensation. For all this ""Open Company No BS"" BS, after years they still don't disclose compensation, they consistently say that are ""looking into it"" and ""want to do it in the future"" but the day never comes. New employees with less experience will come in at a higher base salary longer term employees, everyone talks negatively about salary even though it is frowned upon and when you contest your pay, you get told that your ""total package is higher"". Atlassian is well-known internally for underpaying and giving you beer and chips to compensation. It specifically does over loyal employees that stay with the company for a very long time, as over time the discrepancies between base pay widens and they give you BS about your ""total package"", that makes no sense as you don't get all the unvested stock if you leave and you don't get paid super on equity that has vested. Yet they continue to use this in discussions, and yes this happens even is if you are a star performer. 

- If you like to hustle and move fast - don't work here for long! I cannot express that strongly enough. The ""work-life balance"" expressed above is great if you want to do the bare minimum and get paid a better than average salary. The work ethic is non-existent and results in not much getting done. There is a pattern of endless excuses, deadlines move and move again and things move at a glacial place. Many long term employees have the ""golden handcuffs"" and just ""rest and vest"". That's hard to deal with when you really want to make change and are very passionate about your work. So the pattern is that ambitious smart people that you actually want to work with end up leaving and over time there is a consolidation of blog writing moochers. 

- Everyone likes to still thinks Atlassian is still a startup but in reality it is as nimble as the titanic. If you want to be innovative don't come here! Atlassian is the place where innovative minds come to wither. If you are a dev you will be working on a monolith, doing work on archaic products with archaic code bases.

- Strategy ADHD - get ready for lots of changes, and then reversal of those changes, then reversal of those changes, starting and stopping and restarting of projects. It gets really tiring and everyone makes jokes and rolls their eyes over it. 

- Whilst the founders seem like a decent bunch of guys there are endless layers of manipulative, blog writing, figure-doctoring people in between which and this has only consolidated and worsened with time. 

- Someone that I worked with once expressed it well by saying ""Atlassian is a second chance high school for losers"". Everyone desperately wants to get along, often dysfunctionally so. This is a great opportunity for people that are good manipulators and want to accrue social capital with people who desperately need to be liked. I have seem some really incompetent people go far in this company, which in all honesty if that's you thing, hats off to you. But if you want to actually do good work, instead of writing fraudulent blogs about doing good work, go somewhere else. 

It seems like I am slamming Atlassian, but I am not saying don't work at Atlassian at all, what I am saying is be VERY strategic about it and approach it this way:

1. Go in with a plan and don't take anything on face value.
2. Plan to do frequent and periodical blogging and make sure you are constantly seen and heard across the company.
3. Repeat all the Atlassian jargon and values, but don't be too open or honest.
4. Get as much as you can whilst you are there and use that as a spring board to get out and go somewhere where people are actually genuine and not so desperate to be liked, so you can working on something with meaning and make some actual change. 
5. Use how ""happy you are at Atlassian"" and all that ""unvested equity"" in discussions to negotiate the best salary as you go into a new company, to work on something with meaning."

595,Atlassian,A genuinely excellent company to work for,2021-01-05,5.0,Principal Software Engineer,"I've worked remotely for Atlassian for over 4 years and enjoyed (almost!) every day of it. The company's leadership genuinely cares for their employees and customers. 

The company is full of very talented folk across job functions; it's a joy to work alongside them.

’Open company’ is not just a value on paper, it's lived out. Everyone—right up to the founders—is very approachable and friendly. Information is shared well.

There are loads of opportunities to grow and extend your influence. It's up to you to take them!

Every line manager I've had been kind, sensible and caring. Trust is a big deal — there's no micro-management here — but the flipside is that you need to ensure you live up to that trust.

There are lots of opportunities to innovate and improve things. Quartly ShipIts (hackathons) are a great example of this — time to work on whatever you think would be valuable. And plenty of ShipIt projects become actual features and products.","As with any software that's been around for a while, there is legacy to deal with. But there is always an openness to improve things, and invest in paying down tech debt, etc. You just might need to push for it a bit, against the tide of new product development.

As a company that's distributed across the world, you'll need to be willing to be flexible with times of day you work. That's not a problem if you're willing, but could be a blocker for some. There's no expectation that you're always available, but the occasional late or early call might be needed for effective collaboration."

2) Huge gulf in terms of culture and work between Sydney and Bangalore.

3) Work at Bangalore centre is mostly mundane and ordinary. One example is 10+ years engineers doing ONLY Crud operations.

4) Bangalore centre has grown too big too fast. End result is mundane work and culture deterioration."
608,Atlassian,Wonderful company to work for,2020-12-18,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"This is the best company I've worked for yet in my 15 years of working. Nothing ever gets boring and things fly along at a breakneck pace. People are high performers, management are mostly technical themselves and everyone's intentions genuinely seem to come from a place of caring about greater outcomes than their own career advancement. It does foster innovation from anyone, no matter what level. Great place for those who have ideas and can forge their own path. Management is fairly lean, accessible and do care.

It's a great office, though I've only been there a handful of times due to being remote and then covid. I've had a few ""surprise"" gifts sent during the year which have been lovely.","This is also the most disorganised company I've ever worked for, but there is a order to the madness that just takes time to understand. It can be overwhelming for newbies for at least 6 months. Onboarding will vary from team to team. Not a great place if you like to be told exactly what to do and how to do it (at least not in my team)."

-Great culture and people. Very open and engaging and friendly. This makes a lot of difference
-Managers are enablers. They can vouch for you but they can't promote you, they don't have that power. This reduces politics and favouritism
-Ownership is expected and followed
-Amazing documentation
-Decent salary
-Good benefits","-Differences in perks across geographies. For example for US on call allowance per day in $50 on weekdays and $100 on the weekends and all other countries have the same pattern except India where on call allowance per weekday us ₹900 and for weekend it's ₹1200(not ₹1800). We equally love to enjoy our weekends just as any other country, why is there pay parity here?
-Other places either have fully equipped gyms or fitness reimbursement. In Bangalore office, fitness room is a joke and there is no fitness reimbursement
-Insurance amount limited till 1000000 INR even with voluntary top-up. It should be increased
-Base pay salary increments not upto the market standard. Hope they change this"
620,Atlassian,Best Ever,2020-11-30,5.0,Principal Technical Product Marketing Manager,"Atlassian is easily the most 'employee first' company I've worked at or for.

621,Atlassian,Undoubtably Best Place to Work,2020-11-29,5.0,Automation Engineer,"This is my first ever Glassdoor review. I was compelled to write this review as my experience was really great.

- Leaders and managers are empathetic and understands if there is any adverse situation.
- High appreciation culture, appreciate even on smallest things
- They encourage to take leave, refresh and come back",Nothing as of now! Keep up the Great work
622,Atlassian,Grateful to Work at Atlassian,2020-11-26,5.0,Finance Director,"+ This is hands down the best company I have ever worked at. Prior to joining, I heard from everyone that Atlassian is a phenomenal place to work; in my year and a half working here, I've learned that this is undoubtedly true. 
+ Every day, I get to work with super smart, ambitious and humble people trying to shape how teams collaborate together. 
+ The company is deeply invested in living it's values and these values are used the basis for decision-making. 
+ The company is long-term focused and isn't afraid to take massive risks that may lead to near-term volatility.
+ Really thoughtful and inspiring executive team, including our co-founders, CFO and product heads.","+ The company still functions, in many ways like a startup. I personally love this about the company but for many folks, used to working in larger, more structured environments, this can be a little off-putting.
+ Tend to look externally to hire for senior positions versus look internally - would encourage executives to coach high potential talent rather than look externally."
623,Atlassian,Great culture and amazing people to work with,2020-11-26,5.0,Senior Software Developer,"- Great culture, very open and honest. Managers do really care about you!

649,Atlassian,Honest about values,2020-10-24,4.0,Software Developer,People are the best part of the company. Very smart and dedicated employees in pretty much every team.,Organisation can be dysfunctional.

660,Atlassian,Great work life balance,2020-10-12,5.0,Customer Facing Role,"Most if not all Atlassian employees truly live the company values. Everyone works hard to make this a great place to work, with lots of places to find ""your people"" and for individuals to add to the company culture. Product and marketing teams genuinely seek to be the change you seek while still balancing periodic waves of feedback and navigating several sources of feedback from customer-facing teams.","While Atlassian is truly a wonderful place to work, I've seen people become too comfortable and stop pushing themselves to do ""the best work of their lives"". Experiences with recruiters have been hit or miss internally and externally with seemingly little incentive to progressing employees with internal mobility outside of stats by functional group. Career success and growth seems to be mostly based on the initiative and drive of the individual and their connections rather than something that is front of mind for some managers."

672,Atlassian,"A Tech Company Doing it the ""Right"" Way!!!",2020-09-29,5.0,Senior Program Manager,Great leadership from the Co-founders on down. Strong culture and company values that are more than just lip service. Great products and true desire to deliver value to customers. Leaders listen to feedback from external and internal sources.,Can be a bit siloed depending on your team so you need to be proactive to move outside of your world. Lots of documentation internally which is good and bad.

676,Atlassian,Nice change from the status quo in tech especially in Austin.,2020-09-18,4.0,Program Manager,"There are really so many it will be hard to summarize then all here. 
- Culture! If you are seeking a place that makes you feel cared about as an individual this is the place. In today’s times I’m grateful to be a part of the TEAM. 
- Benefits! Even without all the office perks like snacks, food etc. You will be given so much more than those “perks” that all tech companies assume makes their benefit package and culture great. There are too many to list but here’s a few; paid health benefits for the whole family, mindfulness and well being benefits, encourage volunteer time, encouraged work/life balance. 
- Growth! While the growth plan won’t be meticulously delivered at your feet you will be given the agency, opportunities to push yourself further without the fear of failing. They encourage everyone to do continuous learning either for your current role or the role you’d like to move to. 
- Change! I love evolving and making changes quickly when something is not working. 

I’d give 5 stars but we all recognize we can always be better and that includes our CEOs.","If you aren’t a “pick yourself up by the bootstraps” type I can see how the pace, transparency, and available content can be overwhelming on where to start and to continue. 

If you don’t like continuous improvement (frequent change) you will also not fit with the culture."
677,Atlassian,Support Team (Customer Success) does not share same values as overall company,2020-09-18,1.0,Senior Manager,"Company culture is good, maintains a collaborative spirit. Very engaging staff that is always happy to help others. CEOs seem to genuinely care about their teams, even forced the entire company to be work from home during Covid before it became the standard and declared that the choice would be the employee's in the future.
Good benefits, 401(k) matching, decent salaries, good medical coverage","All of the cons here are related to the Support (Customer Success) teams
Support team does not have the same culture as the rest of the company
Support Senior Leadership has a “do what I say, not what makes sense” attitude
Does not do collaboration well, despite making the software that supports remote collaboration
Support leadership fails to keep up with rest of the company from a behavior and teamwork standpoint (As an example, support teams were required to be in the office over the holiday break, being the only people still in the office when everyone else was remote during that time (pre-Covid))
Places roadblocks to promotion quoting “policy”, internal promotion system is slow
Highly qualified persons are passed over for a role and end up training external hires over them despite being “prepped” for the same role
Company has grown beyond the scale of the software they make leading to issues and workarounds that slow down productivity
Support team training consists of the same materials available to customers, it's mostly reading a bunch of articles. Very little actual investment in up-skilling their technical teams
The other reviews that call out the Jira team experience are accurate but not limited to that team
Interview process is extremely slow and not transparent, this is uniwe to support in my experience as other teams move much more rapidly and are able to make decisions at a reasonable pace and move forward, while support lags behind consistently"

684,Atlassian,A company true to its values - home of true Team players,2020-09-08,5.0,Enterprise Sales,"- The most ""human"" Sales environment I have experienced anywhere, so far. Yes, we have OKRs, but we work towards achieving them as a Team, and we constantly ask those around us  ""What can I do to help you?"" and they keep asking the same in return. There is no room for lonely wolves, and this type of behaviour of individual heroism which is celebrated in many companies, does not make you stand out in a good way at Atlassian. This shows in really strongly positive customer experiences, as we genuinely work with customers best interest in mind, and to ensure long term value realisation and an ongoing positive end user experience through strong link from us in sales to our product development teams. 

- The company lives up to its values every day, even if they sometimes stand in the way of faster growth or easier ways to achieve success 

- The company thinks long term, with employees, partners and customers 

- Co-founder and Co-CEO of Atlassian Scott Farquhar is also co-founder of Pledge-1, which operates through Atlassian foundation.  Atlassian Foundation was created with the vision of helping make the world better. As a company, we contribute 1% of annual profits, 1% of employee time, and 1% of company equity to the foundation. For me, personally, this was one of many really positive things about Atlassian, which eventually made it an easy decision for me to choose to join this very admirable company. 

I am really happy where I am and I know this sentiment is shared by many across our organisation, as we one step at the time keep unleashing the potential of all teams.. And yes, I am really proud to be part of this and not holding it back!","- Atlassian is still a kind of big startup, and it can make some needing fully thought processes uncomfortable. There is plenty of room for experimenting, and it requires certain level of capability to embrace uncertainty and makes you look for answers.. For me this is a positive, but I put it here as a negative to highlight this as area that is likely quite different compared to many other more structured sales organisations."

It works really well here as everyone has really bought into it. Other companies say they live their values, but Atlassian really does.",There is a steep learning curve when you join. It can feel quite intimidating working with some of the smartest people in the industry and feel like needing to immediately make impact and change for the better.
691,Atlassian,Great culture,2020-08-30,4.0,Software Engineer,"I joined Atlassian 3 months ago and have been impressed with the culture here.
- Management care about their employee's opinions, they actively ask for feedback about future projects and strategies from all employees. 
- Employee welfare is looked after. For example, the whole company received a day off in August to help deal with any anxiety and stress that may have arisen from the pandemic.
- Continuous learning and improvement is encouraged. People seem to really care about their work and are continuously trying to make things better, all while sharing the lessons they've learnt along the way with the rest of the company.",- The product I am working on is going through a major transformation which is causing a few issues. Some processes can be slow and painful but there are people actively working to improve this.
692,Atlassian,As good as it gets!,2020-08-30,5.0,Software Engineer,"Atlassian is a company that actually cares about it's people. They live and breath their values rather than just paying lip service to them. In my short time at the company - which has coincided with the pandemic - I've been offered floating days off that don't come out of my leave as well as full mental health support with free therapy sessions. Not to mention the 5 extra days off a year they offer to spend on volunteering. If you're going to work for a huge corporation, you want it to be one that actually *cares* — it feels like Atlassian really are doing their best in this regard, and I respect that","Nothing really stands out here. Nowhere is perfect... I might have a different opinion about this after my first performance review though, so take this with a grain of salt"
693,Atlassian,The worst place I have worked at in my career,2020-08-25,1.0,Senior Software Engineer,"- Good culture, engineering folks are nice people to work and hang out with
- A lot of activities are organized in the office for people with different interests: masterclasses, challenges, fitness events
- A lot of areas to learn and to improve your skills at
- It's a good starting point in your career","- Your work environment depends on the team you're going to join, so choose wisely
- Growth paths for senior engineers are absolutely unclear
- Direct and mid-management is horrible. The last 9 months in the company was a nightmare. We've been dictated what to do and how, our engineering concerns and proposed improvements to make customer experience better were just ignored. We'd been doing simple improvements in a product with estimates bloated by management while being constantly stressed. We were just closing tickets. It was my first (and last) time in my career when my performance was measured by the number of pages I created in Confluence, number of tickets I closed and number of comments I left in peer reviews (I'm not joking). In 3 months 30% of the team just left.
- Values are full of hypocrisy and double standards
- Atlassian is a big corp despite the fact that they advertise themselves as a company with a ""startup"" culture. That's simply not true."

- I feel very support by all my team leads and managers all the way up
- flexibility is amazing, which makes my one con a positive, I can make up work when i need to or want to and take breaks when i need them as well
- the ability to work from work, home, or anywhere
- they do a fantastic job of keeping up the culture, the benefits, and making sure employees are happy and getting what they want out of their company","- work life balance definitely can depend on the team, I am pretty stretched thin most of the time
- it can be hard to move up i the company because people stick around for so long that unless someone leaves a management positions it's already full
- good and bad, i supposed, literally no one gets fired. This means you will have to work with people that really shouldn't be here (there are only a few, but they are around)"

700,Atlassian,All about the values!,2020-08-16,4.0,Engineering Manager,"Atlassian are very much a values based company - it's a core part of their interview process and something that permeates into your day to day working once you arrive. If you don't know the values then definitely read up on them as if they're not for you then neither is Atlassian.

This is a place where you can really come in and make the changes you think are required to make impact in your job, there is lots of existing status quo but it's all able to be openly (and respectfully challenged).

They care a lot about their employees, and even during COVID are going above and beyond to ensure that we're having as good as an experience as we can do by running lots of trainings, team events and budget for social(ly distanced) entertainment.","Chance can (and does) happen quickly - it's always well rationaled, thought out and communicated but if you find yourself caught up in the midst of it can feel rather daunting and chaotic and you can feel rather like a fairly small piece without control of your professional situation.

They are a very large (and expanding) company and this means that there are  lots of information sources to get your head around, and it's easy to miss out on important updates if you don't have a good routine of news gathering. Without that you spend all your time reading up on things and not progressing on with your work (if you allow it, or can't stand not knowing about things happening)."

Good compensation and collaboration among other teams
Positive energy and willingness to help others","Support team does not have the same culture as the rest of the company
Support senior leadership has a “do what I say, not what makes sense” attitude that trickles down
Does not do collaboration well, despite making the software that supports remote collaboration
Support leadership fails to keep up with rest of the company from a behavior and teamwork standpoint
Places roadblocks to promotion quoting “policy”, internal promotion system is slow
Highly qualified persons are passed over for a role and end up training external hires over them despite being “prepped” for the same role
Company has grown beyond the scale of the software they make leading to issues and workarounds that slow down productivity
Support teams were forced remote during Covid 19, other teams had already made that choice willingly"

- The opportunity and support to develop yourself.

725,Atlassian,Unicorn of Companies,2020-07-01,5.0,Enterprise Solution Architect,"Management through the founders are highly invested in their employees. As an example, through the COVID-19 pandemic, they have constantly reached out and forced employees to take time off to help alleviate the stress some are enduring from having to manage working from home and their families.

For those that work in the office, a high functioning and desirable environment is created by providing their employees with breakfast, lunch, snacks, drinks, ice cream, and even an open bar at the end of the day. They are also plenty of mental break opportunities from board games, pool, foosball, video games and more

Atlassian lives, breathes and eats their values. The values aren't just some gimmick that get referenced when people feel it is convenient. These drive all of the work and commitments that are made.

From a compensation and benefits perspective, they really take care of their employees. Their unlimited vacation is truly unlimited. As an employee in my first year, I was able to have time off around the holidays with my family, spend a week with my daughter in Cancun, as well as take other days off to enjoy other time. After leaving a company where I had accrued over 5 weeks/year, I didn't find myself at the bottom just working without anytime to enjoy life. They strongly promote a work/life balance.

It is for these reasons and so many more that contribute to a healthy work environment and happy employees. I work with some of the best people. I am so happy to call myself an Atlassian!","Honestly, Atlassian is so refreshing from the powerhouse corporate company from which I previously worked that I have nothing bad to say."

From day one they make sure that you feel included in the company, I always felt that I have a say in what's going on, and I as an employee is kept up to date on all the company decisions. These feels great and really makes us feel that we are the true owners of the company.

Everyone at Atlassian is amazingly friendly and on top of their games. It is so pleasant to work with passionate people and it makes a huge difference in everyday tasks. The products are awesome, we are all living the Atlassian Values every day and I am so proud to be part of this amazing company. - The perks, Atlassian truly cares about every single employee well-being. It is so obvious and so unique all the things we have accessed to! All this remote situation has been tackled with some strong spirit and things I've never seen before - The transparency. We know what we are working for, the OKRs, how our customers are important, this transcribes in profit sharing and bonus. I am super motivated going to work every day partially because of this but mainly because my team members are super awesome and I am learning something new everyday. - I strive with learning and Atlassian is the perfect place for this, to challenge yourself, challenge your assumptions, pushing the limits with passion. - Atlassian Foundation. This is an important part of the equation for me as I want to give back more to communities and people in need. I am coming from a very poor background that's probably also contributing to this feeling of being so lucky being able to do things I like every day. It is important to give back and never forget where we come from. Being able to do so on my work time with the Atlassian Foundation, I really feel empowered with trust and confidence from my management. This is truly unique.",Nothing I could think about really.

- Perks
- Inspiring CEOs that are the real deal, they do what they say. 
- A company that wants a better world, big focus on the environment (pretty much everything the company uses either supports a charity or it is sustainably sourced) 
- During the COVID crisis, the true colors of the CEOs came to show, truly blown away with the company support and generosity on crisis times.","- There are some worrying glimpses of Amazon culture (brought by ex-amazon leaders on high management roles), basically, there is a big push from a couple of individuals to copy what amazon does in terms of processes; unfortunately, the promotors of these also bring some of the micro-manager cultures where you see managers reporting to the CTO asking very low-level implementation questions to the teams, perhaps in an attempt to emphasize but generating the opposite effect.
- It is a big company, there are lots of processes. Some of those not super useful. 
- The level of reporting is excessive some times, on a normal week I can have around 3 to 4 status report meetings where basically I repeat the same message. You may wonder, why don't you fix it and merge them. Well, it is a big company and it is not that simple as some of these people require different contexts. So be prepared for lots of reporting."

Amazing people , very helpful . 
Good for bachelors , as you can spend time after office hours playing at office","it’s still growing , so the teams are highly understaffed, always under pressure to pick tickets even if you don’t know jack about the product . 
You are given one month to read everything and be a master . 
Focus is given to quantity rather quality . 
company values are not followed  in support teams . 
 Management  uses all the tools to micro manage you . They can track how many cases you pick , how many did you work on every single day . 
You can’t take leaves on public holiday . It’s always assumed that you are working on public holiday , not the other way around . You have to raise a leave request even for public holidays . 
 I have heard the cloud team is not good to join , so if you are being hired for cloud you know what to do 
I also heard they fired a person from one of their teams . Not sure if it’s true . But I am sure the upper management is not aware of it  . 
You are not allowed to work from home until 6 months . 
 You have to pick cases daily even if you have lot of cases in your bucket . If you ask for help , you will be noted as someone who can’t deal with pressure . Yah pressure test is done deliberately here btw.

+ Good work life balance. 
+ Kick-ass office with nice amenities, workout room, rooms for parents, reflection room, massage chairs, bar, etc.","- We're not afraid to pivot, which inevitably means whiplash. It's not as extreme as a startup, but it still happens. Lots of org changes.
- I'm told our base pay is not as competitive as other companies in the valley. Between the rest of our benefits and the great work-life balance, it's enough to keep me comfortable and happy.

818,Atlassian,Atlassian is unlike any company I've ever worked for,2019-10-31,5.0,Senior Product Marketing Manager,"This company is growing so quickly, and there is a ton to do!  There are so many challenges for you to solve, some of the biggest challenges you can solve in a career.  And that makes it exciting.  But what's even better is that Atlassian really gives its employees the room to solve those tough challenges.

More than any company I've ever been at, Atlassian tries really hard to take all of the pressures that might prevent you  from being effective.  From the benefits, to the food, to the healthcare, the pay, etc.  It's an amazing experience.

The employees are some of the smartest people I've ever worked with, and it's an absolute pleasure to come to work every single day.

Of course, this could be a ""new job honeymoon"" - but every one I talk to, who's been here for many years, feels the exact same way still.  


Everyone is working really hard - and don't get me wrong, it's not like we're all putting in 10 hour days, every day, or anything.  But it's when we are working, we're working hard, intelligently, fast, effective, and efficient.

And the best part of the business? our company values (look them up) - we live and breathe them every day.","Growing pains.  

Another pro of Atlassian is we're always trying to disrupt ourselves, before our competitors do.  But, that can sometimes cause maybe some confusion, or disconnect, or have a lack of clarity - but, that's okay.  Because if we didn't do it to ourselves, our competitors would. 


I want to address one ""con"" I've seen in other reviews - and that's the pay.  I think the pay is ""fair"" or ""average"" for the bay area.  But what you have to really look at is the total compensation (normally I wouldn't say this, but this time I do).  The free food, the free healthcare, the stocks, the health stipend, the commuter benefits, etc..."

+ Could be an amazing place to grow your career, they are growing rapidly and if you can ride the way, in a short time you can be moving up the proverbial ladder 
+ Australia (if you visit)","- The blogging culture - it is a culture about writing, and 'showing' something has been done. This worked really well when Atlassian was small, and works well for transparency - but it feels like it take a blog to get anything done. If its not blogged about its not real. Keep this in mind, for you to succeed here, you will need to blog and build a brand for yourself internally through it.  
- It is not a product-led company, it is founder led company. This means the major strategy decisions are done from the top. There are exceptions to this rule, i.e. Jira Service Desk came up from a hackathon 
- Atlassian is amazing at marketing process, playbooks, Jira etc, but they do not use it the way it was intended. Do not look at the material and think they have things figure out, if anything its worse on the inside, BUT there is ""appetite ""to improve. There is no standardization across teams, which has its pros /cons."

GREAT work /life balance! We are home well before sunset; gives ample time with family. No early morning, late night meetings.

The management here is pleasantly /surprisingly accommodative and really value everyone's opinion. It's not an eyewash. They really take your opinions and decisions are centred around employees' needs and comfort!

No amount of BRAGGING is enough to describe our CULTURE. It's very practical, humane and REAL. Folks fly down to Bengaluru to inculcate the great culture that has been meticulously build over the years. THIS IS THE DIFFERENCE between Atlassian and any other company, no matter how big, old or rich. Atlassian emphasises a lot on getting the culture right and it shows in everything that we do.","This is not a con: number of meetings can be overwhelming sometimes.

844,Atlassian,Open policies and respectful work environment,2019-08-13,4.0,Software Developer,"Atlassian does a lot of things well – 

Internal documentation – technical, semi-technical and informal blogs that provide new folks with context on past decisions, and keep the fast-growing company feel less sparse. 

A design-engineering-product triad model that encourages a high trust between various function, and greater ownership with YBIYRI.

A healthy work culture, opportunities to work with and learn from Atlassians in other locations. Some really good mentors (you just need to ask!)","The current office location (Eco-world) makes work-life balance a harder for those who aren't staying close by. By no means is the traffic an Atlassian-only problem, but when you've to spend 45 minutes to get outside the tech park (10 mins by walk)  only to further get bottlenecked by the ORR traffic outside, it kills you a little.
You'd expect a company like Atlassian to give this factor a little more importance than other companies, who either oblivious to it or have given up."

Annual kickoff and afterwork drinking socials usually end in terminations or severance in exchange for not filing harassment.

Great employee marketing with their values.,"Rampant politics. Management is very inexperienced. Poor planning. Constant re-organization. Zero change management. No long-term vision. Engineering upper management only sees people as numbers. Promote their own pet projects and put people number on them. Little consideration of the impact to existing tasks or people. Middle managers have no say. It’s all about who you know, how loud you shout (blog) and how you play the game to succeed. 

Sydney culture is geared towards white and male despite many awareness blog posts. Not inclusive. Not multiculturally friendly. No BS value translates to employee hostile behavior. 

This company is where talented ambitious people go to waste. No innovation. Sensible people have left already."

- Great benefits",None that I can think of
863,Atlassian,Great place to build a career,2019-07-01,5.0,Engineering Manager,"Atlassian as a company has  been doing very well, due to very high demand for its products. These products are all about team potential, team performance, team productivity so no wonder Atlassian itself is big on teams too. The place is full of great people to work with. They are great not only technically (check LinkedIn yourself) but also as great colleagues to enjoy working with. There is a strong balance and partnership among engineering, product management, UX design, and data analytics. 

Part of the growth in business comes from the original and very successful products like Jira and Confluence. Part also comes from the newly acquired products such as Trello and OpsGenie. There is a strong theme in this expansion strategy to keep unleashing the potential of all teams, starting with the tech teams.

Atlassian is one of the unique companies whose values do make sense (check them out yourself) and there is a real strong focus for all team members to live those values. Part of every interview does also include a session on the value(s) you may most identify with and why.

Atlassian is also a place for a new software engineer to get up to speed fast. The products are those exact ones (or similar to the ones) that you as a software engineer would be using in any company to develop your own products -- workflow management, internal wiki and collaboration, operations status, operations alerting, source code repository, etc. Knowing that your contributions make people like you far more productive is very satisfying. There is also real dogfooding going on at Atlassian as you end up using the same products for your development effort. If you get a chance to see how these products are used internally, you will amazed about the capabilities of these products -- unfortunately not well known outside, a mistake that Atlassian needs to fix. 

There is attention to detail in almost every aspect. For example, visit one of the Atlassian offices and you can see the difference. Go to youtube and find videos on the Atlassian founders. They are smart, passionate engineers themselves (with an Aussie accent :) and they get it right away whatever you are discussing. They can code very well too.

There is a real strong positivity in the air at Atlassian. There is real caring for the teams inside or outside the company. The foundation donates a lot to the community and you can be part of that effort with your money and time easily.","Some teams may be divided across multiple countries so some of the usual problems due to remote teams may apply, depending on your team."

* Great product - away from the creepier aspect of larger tech companies, Atlassian does its thing helping teams work better together","* There's so much opportunity to grow and improve the business, that sometimes it feels like an endless chasing of our own tail trying to decide what's the most important thing to do

- Secondments to other teams and locales are available.

- Remote work is available for non-managers.

- Company is heavily involved in charitable, prosocial and environmental causes. As an employee, you can also get $1,000/year donation matching and spend 40 hours/year volunteering for a charity.

- Work-life balance is pretty darn good; I can work later, earlier, or from home if I need to attend an appointment.

- Employees with health issues (mental or physical) can access accommodations to help them. Examples:
    - A person who had a sleep disorder was able to work from 12-8pm every day, as they found it very hard to wake up much earlier than that.
    - A depressed person was able to work part-time while attending outpatient therapy.

- Related, discussions about mental health issues are normalized, with people writing internal blog posts about their experiences and receiving a lot of support.

- Lots of interest groups are available for employees interested in art, sports, crafts, books, languages, LGBT issues, programming techniques, social equality, etc.

- Internal systems for storing documents are easily useable and searchable. Anyone can make a blog post that's viewable by everyone.",- Open-plan offices make it harder to focus on technical work. Bring earplugs or over-ear headphones.

Bengaluru office is a great piece of real estate with free gourmet catered food (breakfast, lunch, dinner - the whole nine yards).

Good hardware provided to work with, open hierarchy and no politics are some of the top pros.","If you are a late night person like me, you might miss out on meetings with Australia folks a few times, since they are early morning. This is not a big con though, given the timings are generally flexible and WFH is a real option.

Commute to outer ring road is a bit of a hassle, after moving from Koramangala and Indiranagar - but well, this is BLR! :)"

882,Atlassian,The Curb Appealer,2019-05-04,2.0,Life Hacker,"Decent pay, free food,  market leader in Sydney","No matter how desperate you are for a job, or how annoyed you may be at your current gig, there are some companies you’re better off not working for. Atlassian is one of them. Even if the money is good, the role seems irresistible, and even your friends say it’s worth a shot, accepting a role at such company can set your career back and even jeopardize your future success. 
The High Turnover Outfit : things we watch out for - why key roles keeps popping  up consistently on the job and if they are that means that they have fallen into a hire-and-fire cycle. Atlassian exactly going through this. This can indicate a few things. One, leadership may be very fickle; unable to land on the specific qualities they want in a candidate. Two, the company may have a complexed internal culture which makes retention nearly impossible, no matter how talented the new hires may be. Three, top level goals may be as fleeting as the talent.
Power center shifted to San Francisco even when head office is in Sydney. Too many executives brainstorming, too few employees tasked with executing.
 In the era of transparency, Atlassian remains fully aware that they must attract the best talent with full, robust and competitive packages. In order to do this, they make promises. Companies make promises around the job, the compensation package, the culture and the brand. Furthermore, companies have a brand promise that is a manifestation of its core business strategy. The problem with promises, however, they can be broken. Beware of companies that make promise after promise after promise. A confused and highly bureaucratic HR team, with unable to decide if they want only power and visibility or actual delivery of things business requires. Unless you are on a break and experimenting your career don’t join this company at this phase."

And the company believes in you and lets you take chances and doesn't punish failure or bad ideas.","It has changed a lot, you can feel that the core of the company has shifted from a Sydney startup to Silicon Valley, most of the high ups are now in California and things feel more and more things enterprise. We are talking decision not based on gut and previous Atlassian experience, but rather because that's how they do things in Silicon Valley companies. Not saying that's a bad thing, it's probably important for the company which is needed. But it's a shift in culture and a focus away from the Sydney office.

- Reading blog post internal/external usually yield good laughs.","In general if you value your career, pay attention to yourself and have a plan to develop the skills you need for a real job avoiding getting too attached to this inept system.

- No reason to put efforts into the company, performance review is kind of insulting especially if you actually did any work.
- Lazy and incompetent leadership, they are extremely greedy and quite naive. But it's good that it's not rocket science to recognise that. Anyway all they need is to build their religion. 
- Uneducated folks in high positions and their factions.
- Being involuntarily drawn into political conflicts  regardless the having no interest or show obvious disdain toward those. 
- Your works and yourself might be wrongly represented for weird purpose... A lot of people have time to just fabricate stories. 
- Support team behaviour seems to indicate that the customer can go x themselves, that is why they do not need to do that. 70% of the time I went into contact with support I think  what the ... and I have no idea why waste the money and what are they doing in the middle except confused both customer and product team."
926,Atlassian,Support is outside looking in at what Atlassian is,2019-01-14,1.0,Senior Support Engineer,"Atlassian seems like a great place to work and for many departments it might be, but your experience in support is so different it may as well be a separate company.
The office is gorgeous and has amazing views, there a lot of events going on and there is a sense of pride in working at Atlassian.","The interview process is complex and quite long, with deep technical questions - although these are fairly scattered over multiple technologies and vary from light to very indepth. There is no real order to the interviews, but tend to be based on who ever interviews you.

When you start at Atlassian you'll be happy given all their marketing and shiny office, but once you sit down in support you'll quickly come to realize there's little connection to the Atlassian that other departments experience. 

In support you'll experience:
-Management changing their expectations  of their staff daily, they seem in a constant panic.

-Support organization cannot decide if its a contact center or a deep dive technical support team and end up asking the techs to do both

-With metrics constantly changing staff tend to get treated more based managers preference than based on their job performance

-Managers have no confidence and will single you out if you highlight any issues, even if you're trying to improve them

-Seems sure that its a highly technical support role, but limit training and focus on throughput rather than ability or quality

-The team has almost no morale from the constant changing expectations and no one even expects to meet goals they can't predict and know will change

-Senior positions are guarded by older employees that raise the requirements to unrealistic and unnecessary standards; senior techs would rather convince you that they're more technical than assist their peers in succeeding

-Their location is great but parking in the building costs $25/day until you get a spot (the waiting list is now about a year)"
927,Atlassian,Stay away from the Support organization,2019-01-11,2.0,Senior Support Engineer,"Great benefits, generous stock grants, fun office, lots of company events.

The company overall is an amazing place. It's a fantasy world that doesn't exist in many other places. The people there are generally great. Being in that office you feel like you are definitely doing something special with your life.

If you get on the right team Atlassian will be the great company you will ever work for. There are a few areas within support that have a lot of happy people(but its rare).","If you get on the wrong team Atlassian will be the worst company you will ever work for.

Everyone on the Jira team is unhappy but no one can leave. The stock compensation is so great that you will never find another role that pays better than your Atlassian salary + bonus + stock RSUs. This means unhappy people keep sticking around with their Golden Handcuffs getting tighter and tighter. After enough time you've lost more technical skills than you've gained so now are even more stuck.

Obsession with metrics keeps everyone overworked and overstressed. Chasing arbitrary performance improvement goals leads to management working to block support engineers from participating in all the amazing company events.

Your worth is measured by the time you sit in a chair at your desk rather than the results you deliver.

Management uses Confluence to run projects because they can't be bothered to learn arguably the best project management tool out there, Jira. Even the Jira support team can't use Jira to manage projects because management can only use a wiki tool.

 Senior engineers on Jira support team are turned into supervisors to help whip the team harder and increase throughput, rather than focusing on technical work which would actually solve issues.

Training was a joke, engineers are provided 4 hours to watch some YouTube videos or read some text and claimed to have ""skilled up"". Management has no understanding that technical training is something that has to be continuous and takes real time.  
Training of course requires long term investment, in the short term it requires engineers to not produce units of work with the understanding that it the time will pay off in the long run. This isn't valued because the metrics are looked at on a daily basis, all focus is on finishing the day/week with the highest numbers possible and dealing with tomorrow another day.

The interview process is misleading. It's a very technical interview promising you will do a lot of technical work. Then you start and find out you are supervising people and documenting every conversation you have with junior engineers so that it can be weaponized by management.

Your technical abilities will die here because all of your brainpower is devoted to playing the politics."

You can generally work in your own style and 90% of the time that's okay - which is a really good thing.","If you're just starting your career, and really care about it then you *need* to stay far away from Atlassian's ""Graduate Developer"" program. You might have had some other experience - open source experience, other jobs, freelancing, etc - but if you apply for that position then they'll only ever see you as a newbie university student and they'll always use that against you.

You might have an aptitude for programming, or you might just be really great at it - if so, good for you!
But, Atlassian is *not* the place for you to build your career if that's the case. 
Say you join a team of Developers or Senior Developers, and you've been performing and working at the same level (or even higher) for over 12 months straight? Sorry, no promotion or career development for you. You were a ""Graduate Developer"". That means you're promoted based on the performance of *all the other Graduate Developers*, not based on what you do.

TL;DR: If you don't care about your career from the start, you're happy just to coast for years and have no desire to move forward, then this job is for you.
But, if you care about your career progression, you have a passion for software development and want to make the world a better place, then stay far away from their ""Graduate Developer"" program - they'll only stop you, halt you and won't ever recognize the good work that you do until maybe half a decade down the track they decide that you're a real developer and should be treated accordingly."

955,Atlassian,If you're in Sydney - stay away,2018-09-24,1.0,Anonymous Employee,Looks good on your CV,"I would recommend against working here if you're in Sydney because:

1) Pay sucks
Yes it sucks.  Employees complain about it all the time.  The company don't even pretend that they are trying to pay you fairly saying they are aiming for the median of the market, which is code for undervaluing you and your skills.  Other people in the company doing the exact same work but in the US will get paid much more than you, well over and above the exchange rate.
If you ask, management will give promises about improving pay but nothing really changes.  With inflation, you will go out backwards.  

The Founders are now so rich I think they have no concept of what life is like for wage slave employees.  When you pay 70 million dollars for a house it's inevitable I suppose.  If you ask them about pay or about how expensive living in Sydney is your question will probably be ridiculed or ignored.

Sadly, you're better off working for a bank, which is really saying something.

2) There are no more interesting or challenging roles left in Sydney.

Unless you consider working on a 15 year old disaster codebase fun.
The only people in the Sydney office who don't seem to notice have been around so long they no longer feel the pain of banging their head against a wall.

Entire teams have been moved offshore.  If a great new role comes up there's a good change it will go to someone on a visa.  I have seen locals regularly passed over for interesting roles.

Atlassian talk a lot about diversity, but in reality there are remarkably few women or people from different ethnic backgrounds being promoted into leadership roles.

The company is run by a huge network of middle management (team leads) who are all trained to push their teams as hard as possible and get the most from them. This leads to a really competitive environment, long hours, constant pressure and a complete lack of work / life balance for devs. 
You are expected to be online at all hours, especially if your team is based across different offices."

If you spend too much time actually doing work, or focusing on fixing customer issues, than you will be told off for not being a team player, and doing too many commits.
Be careful what mention in 1:1's as it will all be used against you
Be careful what write on Stride, as it will also be misinterpreted and used against you
You are required to spend extra hours blogging about everything you did, as otherwise you will be deemed as not performing at all
Every manager has their favourites and unless you are a favourite, you will have 0 chance of promotion or even having your thoughts listened to. It is not a collaborative environment anymore, that disappeared years ago.
The advertised values are a joke. Don't ""hurt"" the customer? Why do team leads punish people for working on long running issues in JIRA? Be the change you seek? If you do something that 1 person on a team of 50 is vocal against, then you get punished verbally and at review time. Just 2 examples I have seen .... not good enough. Either live the values the way they were intended when this was a tiny startup, or scrap them and go for the bigger company style awful values that are actually real inside the building but not flashy to advertise that we can swear :(

There's a lot of space to grow your career (either vertically into more senior roles or horizontally into other fields)

You can switch teams (allowing you to maneuver around the Cons below)

Atlassian has a great brand, it probably looks great on your CV","When Atlassian goes bad, it goes really bad.
There's a lot of project churn (projects appearing and then disappearing)

Managers at Atlassian aren't great. Every manager I've had has been a former developer who moved into a team lead role. 

 Nominally speaking, you'd think this sounds great. However getting the most out of people isn't something that a career in writing software prepares you for from what I can see.

When they leave you alone, they're mostly benign, although you'll have to find your own career path. 
If you have sustained high work output, and you know when to keep your mouth shut, you'll be in this category most of the time.

If you happen to get their attention for the wrong reasons however, you're in for a world of pain.  Their abilities at ""performance improvement"" are mostly limited to threatening to fire you.

FYI take the values with a grain of salt, they used to mean a lot to a lot of people (management and staff) but their meaning has become diluted as people have been hired who don't share the same values."

The result of which (along with a great HR/management team) is a fantastic culture built on respect, teamwork, acceptance and hard work (that is recognized and rewarded by others). As a growing company, there is a lot of opportunity to grow and taking new approaches and/or projects is definitely encouraged. I've often said that it is a ""yes"" company - a place where employees (even on other teams) are happy to say ""yes"" when you come to them with a reasonable ask for help, and where management is supportive of you bringing new ideas to the table.

* Some great people at the worker level","This review is mostly about the Bitbucket section of Atlassian.

* Like in most big companies,  there are are good and bad divisions.  One of the bad ones is Bitbucket.  Stay far away!

 * The culture has become toxic.  There are a lot of unhappy staff.  Morale is very low.  In the past it was a lot better, but now the division no longer cares about preserving the culture that made the company great, or following the ""Atlassian values"".

* This division has a lot of issues with management.  They couldn't hire any engineering team managers for a long time.  A lot of the ones they ended up with are terrible.  There's been nearly a 100% turn over in product management.  And two senior division managers recently left.

* Pay is below market rates.  In the past, the work culture and people were meant to make up for that.

* Microsoft recently bought Github, the major competitor to Bitbucket.  Bitbucket is already a distant second in market share.  Bitbucket won't be able to compete against Microsoft's money and resources.

* San Francisco offices are in a sketchy area - multiple staff members have been robbed, assaulted, or harassed going to/from work or at lunch."

The scale (currently ~3500) is large enough that there are a range of interesting projects and there is plenty of opportunity for career growth, but the company hasn't yet started to feel like a big company.  Very little beaucracy, and no BS.

The thing that prompted me to write this review is in response to some of the negative comments. Either these are isolated cases or falsified, as the behaviours that emerge from the company's values would not sustain this on any scale. Yes, there are some inexperienced managers, but the culture of openness and autonomy that exists pervasively makes me wonder how these issues could not have been raised and dealt with, as so many other things are on a daily basis.

So that's my ""con"", that for whatever reason it seems there are people in the org who were carefully hired based on a set of values, but were unable (or unwilling?) to work things out in the most positive environment they're likely to come across.

Other than that, software is hard, and that's true here too. The ways that it is hard varies by product/project."

- Big company, a lot of people occasionally you've meet great people accidentally gets in, they won't stay long though
- Lots of different technical challenge to work on, you'll have to pay tax though, tributes the all the parasites that this company has accumulate for years. My advice is do not ague with them, do not point out their stupidity if they outranked you that will not ends well for you. In my last year I prefer throwing out my personal projects rather than let them lay their dirty hands on it. And believe me because the thieves do not actually have any work to do, they will be scouting all your resources to find anything they can steal or demand a piece of it. Even if you give them your work they won't be able to finish it(that what I did in my earlier years at the company), you have to do it and then give them the credits.
- Interesting facades, sadly none is true.","- Working here is throwing your career into the toilet, that is if you want to build or engineer systems or real functionalities that serves real world purposes. Unless you want to be a salesman, fraud then this will be the experience you'll need.
- Lazy and uneducated management only care about building their personal cult and tribe. Underlings in term focus on writing songs about their superiors and back stabbing each other, exploiting subodinates. You'll be force to join a tribe, help them attack the other, or you'll pay dearly price.
- Brainless people chaining meaningless phrase all the time without any care for customer experience or the product to be crafted, every failure is consider another success. No intention of improving the quality of the product, personal shortcoming and the environment. Is it not only sad because they keeps repeating something stupid and untrue, but also it's not even their original thought. I do not know if most people here even use their brains for thinking, but might be they do, it's just not about producing value.

In my time there, I never questioned if the values you will hear so much about were just recruiting gimmicks or actual living breathing tenets to live by.  There is a legitimate interest in doing work the smart way and being a great company to work for,   Like in most good companies, it is really the people who make or break the place and Atlassian has done a great job of attracting and hiring good people.  If you are coming from a more ""normal"" company, the perks at Atlassian are insanely generous.  If you are coming from a Silicon Valley software company, they may not stack up to you expectations, but you will still appreciate all of the work the Workplace Experience team puts into making the offices and events the best they can.","There is a major disconnect between leadership and the people that they lead.  I often heard our VP say ""all the right things"", but never saw any of those ideas put into action.   I believe that this is the result of a few different factors, but they can all be summed up by saying that leadership seems to be happy judging their success by what amounts to be made-up metrics and just leaving it at that.  In my department, at least, no one at any level of leadership seemed to have a very good grasp of what the operational realities were and none of them seemed to care to either and that is the part that kills me.  There were a lot of interesting ideas, but no real care put into understanding the current situation when coming up with a plan to implement them.  Right before my departure, a major change in operations occurred with less than an hour of training and no opportunities for those actually doing the work to provide input.  There was a lot of trying to force a round peg into a square hole and then blaming the people on the ground level when things didn't work out.  Accountability only ever seemed to apply to the lowest on the totem pole."
986,Atlassian,Incredible life-changing experience,2018-06-09,5.0,Software Development Manager,"This place, particularly in Australia, is like no other. Scott’s personal mission seems to be to ensure that your experience with Atlassian is so great that everything else is ruined by comparison. I disagree. The experience at Atlassian was so good that I want to take some of that magic and sprinkle it over all future roles. I’m not saying it was perfect, it wasn’t, but in some ways that was also part of its magic. It’s owned its mistakes and empowered everyone within to do the same. Yes, the perks are amazing (particularly the equity), but beyond the free food and booze, the family events, the incredible experience team, the biggest perk by far is the values. Positive cultural values have to be driven from the very top and Scott and Mike embody these. There is nothing disingenuous about them and everything that the company does is driven by them. It’s life changing. Also they’re not afraid to be on the right side of the argument on progressive social good. When they shon a rainbow over 341 George St during the postal survey was probably the proudest I’ve ever felt to be part of something truly wonderful. And Atlassian are.","They’ve struggled with scale as any company would with the massive growth like they have had. The IPO led to a huge loss of key talent which exacerbated some of those issues. However, transparency and openness meant that we all knew what was happening, and everyone was empowered to keep the ship afloat. 

It took them too long to realise that people in leadership roles need to be good managers, not necessarily great coders, when they got to 2000 employees, and it wasn’t until I left that they even began to put in the frameworks necessary for leaders to properly lead. 

After a certain point there’s a career wall with nowhere left to go, I’d still be there now if you didn’t need to be there for a decade, or American, to get to the next level. There’s too much reliance on SF being the boilerplate of how to do things, and it’s lacking empathy for local culture and people based in Sydney. 

Last thing is advice to grads: drop the sense of entitlement. You don’t realise how amazing this place is."

It's a mediocre nine to five job, don't bring your laptop home and do not work extra hours.

1001,Atlassian,"Great for early career, be aware of cliques",2018-04-16,3.0,Anonymous Employee,"Note where you land. Cloud products (software as a service) are the growth products, large teams etc. Server and Data Center (on premise) are bread-and-butter value products, lean teams mostly outside the US. A Jira Server role can be very different from a Jira Cloud role.

This is a great place for early-career employees (1st/2nd job out of college or 3-4yrs experience) who love dogs and love to blog.  If this is you, you'll have lots of good experiences - meeting a lot of people at the same stage in their lives/careers, being able to volunteer easily, take yoga classes at work, get free food, take on resume-building leadership roles like being your team's social chair or becoming a member of the foundation (volunteering group) council etc. This will probably be the ""best place you ever worked"" which is a goal for the company. You should remember to blog about all these things on the internal Confluence site for maximum benefit. 

You can bring your dog to work as often as you want.  If you like dogs or have a dog, this is a good place for you.

What else? General conversation topics are dogs, yoga, what someone posted on Instagram, fashion, the newest restaurant, wine, and the SF rental market. 
If these are your go-to topics, you'll do great here. 

Oh, and you'll probably get to go to Sydney at some point so that's pretty cool.","For more experienced folks and especially if you are mid-30s and later with a life outside of work/work colleagues, note that most senior roles/middle management seem to be taken by the folks who joined in the 2012-2014 timefame. Senior roles (principal, head of etc) seem to be few and far between for internal and external growth, and it may be difficult to succeed in these (see cliques below).  

Most things are done the ""Atlassian way"", which is a reason given to do things the same way every time. So if you have ideas or suggestions, perhaps from prior experiences, these are only accepted if they align exactly with how things are already done or if you have a sponsor who OKs them. New ideas and suggestions are mostly encouraged only if you've been around for a while and are in one of the cliques. So it's pretty collaborative if you have the same opinions and methods, may feel dismissive otherwise. I know folks who have left the company precisely because of this.

Cliques:  Other reviews mention ""cronyism"", ""groupism"" and ""communism"" :). These seem to be mostly informal networks dominated by folks hired in 2012-2014, and span SF/Austin/Sydney etc. These folks are pretty close to the long-time leaders. If you grew up in the company, you've paid your dues and you will get opportunities. If you grew up elsewhere, getting opportunities and getting in with the right cliques may be difficult and time-consuming. In fact multiple people across a variety of teams have gone through some pretty rough times when not in the right cliques.

Also the compensation seems to be below market.  And promotions seem to go to people who have been here for a while.

If you are not a dog person or are allergic to dogs... you are in for a tough time. There are even  off-leash dogs in the kitchen where people eat/handle food!

There are processes in place for everything, using Jira and Jira Service Desk. Even the smallest request to another team has to go through a ticketing process. If you are from a much larger company, you are probably OK with this pace. If you came here thinking ""modern startup"", you may be frustrated by the pace. 

The company is very proud of its published values... but it seems folks have different interpretations. For example, ""open company, no BS"" - sometimes this seems to mean that things are transparent and open if you are in the right group. And there's ""play, as a team"" but then cliques come into play so interpret that as you would like."

3) So called 'designers' in every team who are constantly 'envisioning' or 'sparring' and never around to answer the team's questions on work that's in progress
4) Mediocre people stuck at middle management will stymy the progress of anything good or useful unless it makes them look good to their managers so that they can take credit for their work
5) Promotion is decided by a secret council of managers most of whom you've never worked with, but get to decide who is worthy of promotion"
1004,Atlassian,Great environment to make an impact,2018-04-09,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"-Passionate, genuine people who want to build something special
-Truly a values-driven organization, Atlassian really does rally around the company values when big decisions need to be made
-There are still a lot of problems to solve which means there's a lot of space to build solutions and take ownership over key projects
-Lots of autonomy","-With lots of growth, change is constant, it does take effort to keep up
-Communication has been a bit of an issue as the company has grown, although it appears to be improving on all fronts"
1005,Atlassian,Good place to work,2018-04-04,4.0,,"Smart people in every department, and good products.","* Management could be better
* Salaries are a little low"
1006,Atlassian,"Pretty good, but room for improvement",2018-03-21,3.0,Designer,"Quick note: I wish you could give half ratings! I don't think Atlassian is a 3, but I also wouldn't give it a 4. 

- You'll be working alongside some awesome people. The majority of people are extremely friendly and are almost always willing to lend a hand.

- There's a lot of senior talent. If you're new to the game you can learn a lot.

- You get a lot of autonomy in your day to day work.

- Our company values actually mean something. A lot of people live the values and we celebrate that openly as a company.

- Work/life balance is great, though that seems to get tougher and tougher the higher up the ladder you go.

- Free lunch and perks.

- Despite all the problems listed below, they're genuinely trying to fix them and make it a better place for everyone to work.","- Sometimes it can seem as if we're moving at a glacial pace, other times we're moving way too fast. We need to find a good pace and stick with it.

- A lot of the work done doesn't ship for various reasons. We pivot a lot and other times a bigger, more important project will come along which means the current work gets canned and the team transitions to a different project.

- Atlassian has a tendency to tackle big projects all at once which means they can drag on for years.

- Compared to the market average, Atlassian underpays. This is true for Sydney and the US.

- We say ""Open company, no bull#$%"" but there's a lot of bureaucracy at the top.

- If you don't have a good manager who will fight for you, you're going to struggle. This is especially important when it comes to performance reviews and interesting projects.

- Atlassian favours extroverts. The only way to get yourself out there and known to senior management is by promoting your work and speaking at town halls or writing blog posts on the global Confluence instance.

- Favourites get the interesting work. This is great if you're a favourite, but can be hard if you're an introvert and don't like promoting yourself or if you have a bad manager.

- A lot of change over at the middle management level."

- Middle management lacks people management skills. There is a lot of groupism and favouritism. If you are part of 'the group', you'll get promoted, but if you don't 'show loyalty' you'll be sidelined and be forced to move out. It's a classic case of long-term employees being promoted to middle management without any training. 
- In my team, one couldn't question the decisions of the leads. And this was purported as a 'team value'. There was a lot of micro management. Your disagreements could be highlighted as 'not playing as a team' during 1-1s.

1056,Atlassian,Hipchat SRE Review,2017-03-26,5.0,Senior Site Reliability Engineer,"It's a small, close-knit team with a mix of projects we handle independently and collaboratively across a large space.

Our team lead knows that his role is to make the team reliable and available.  That empowers the engineers to do the same for the services with which we are working.  Those services make Hipchat function.

You will never cease to find a new technology challenge to learn.  There is half a floor of software engineers you're working with day to day.  Everyone of them are working to deliver new features or services, and you're working with them from an SRE perspective.  That means you have to learn  as fast as they do...all of them.

If you are unhappy with something, speak up.  Management will listen.  It may be a slow process to effect change, but you can effect change if you are persistent enough.","This is not a job for the faint of heart.  This is a job for someone who loves learning constantly, who has the self confidence to work as an independent operator or as part of the team in a group effort.

SRE within Atlassian is only a couple years old.  In a way this is a con since there's a long road ahead to get to where we want to be.  But if you read this and felt inspired...well...I have to ask why you haven't applied yet.

There is tons of technical debt to be paid down."

Very social place. There is always a chance to go for after-work drinks.","Continuous change of focus. There is no direction. Any changes introduced are not given enough time to settle and evaluate the success or failure.

Toxic management. Publicly praising any changes introduced is better than any kind of criticism. People who actually care and try to be ""the change they seek"" (one of the company values) are flagged as negative which effectively translate to no career opportunities ever.

Management changes all the time. Normally external people are preferred, very few have the opportunity to be promoted and those who get promoted are normally based on office politics rather than performance or skills. 

The best way to be noticed (and have any career development opportunities) is to be a narcissistic extroverted person who spends their day blogging about awesomeness instead of getting any actual work done.

Most of the good people left the company a long time ago. Crazy people turnover at all levels. In 3 years in the same team, I had 4 different team leads, 5 office leads, 3 HR managers,.... Recruitment standards also dropped over time, now hiring mainly young and inexperienced (and also underpaid) people.

The manageers in the Amsterdam office have very little weight in the company and hardly any decision making. All important (and most trivial) decisions are made in Australia by people who lacks the understanding and knowledge of the Amsterdam office and its people.

The culture has changed from a nice start-up atmosphere living the values of the company to a toxic culture rotten with politics and asslickery. The once idealistic values have been bastardized like in a George Orwell novel."

Sometimes it feels like the direction of the company is not clear."
1066,Atlassian,Growing pains evident,2017-01-03,2.0,Senior Java Developer,"The work experience team put a great deal of effort into making Atlassian a nice place to work and to look attractive from the outside to promote the Atlassian brand and help attract talent.

Events, free food, free drinks, free bar, social atmosphere

Aeon chairs, standup desks for the `startup` image

Atlassian has a high barrier for entry and have some very talented people working for them. On the right team the experience can be amazing. On joining Atlassian I worked on the best team of 10 years in software development.","After IPO Atlassian has changed significantly.

2 years ago there where 500-700 members of staff, now 1700+.

Heavy recruitment, reorganisation, re-prioritisation, shareholders to answer to, there is a great deal of growing pain. It’s no longer the small company it once was but not at the larger company maturity level in regards to HR / management. Internal mobility is non existent. There’s significant growing pains and power / self protection struggles by managers who have time earnt their way to positions rather than being trained in management.

In the 10 years I spent in software development I had my best experiences at Atlassian. With that it’s extremely disappointing and sad to say my last 12 months at Atlassian has also been the worst and most stressful.

An extremely strong team I worked on who were delivering was split up, partly because of reorganisation and skills needed elsewhere, mainly as the technology we were using no longer fitted in to the new `Tech Radar` and immediate management wanted to water down the strongobjections by bringing in people who advocated the new `Tech Radar` stack...Nodejs, Springboot (only Springboot with Java) and Go.

I watched a good team turn toxic, one painful memory, all members sat with heads down in a PR review when the dev manager crossed lines through valid team PR feedback after a colleague elsewhere in the company brought on to make our project more `Spring` like. On node.js projects any comments on Javascript where taken as attacks against the manager, PR comments watched, hipchat messages watched only to be raised in 1 and 1’s. Team members played against each other and micromanaged to fit the new `Tech radar`. I watched a good colleague put on performance review for use of Java 8 Lambda’s which looked to functional for the `Tech stack` before he subsequently resigned or debatably constructively dismissed.

The IPO has lead to new large critical projects putting pressure on inexperienced management who have been at the company a long time working their way up. This has then been put down on to developers, decisions based on time, appearance of delivering and ability to recruit. It somewhat changed from a collaborative “we hire smart people atmosphere to tell us what to do not to tell them what to do” to bodies of developers micromanaged as a workhouse.

Pick the right team and  if the current `Tech stack` attracts you, you will have a fantastic experience at Atlassian. Hit the wrong team or if the company decides to switch again you are collateral damage and it’s hard to move internally with outside staff favored for roles due to recruiting targets.

Developers raising concerns were noted as being `salty`, `a religious small minority` by the recently appointed CTO and founders. The same people raising concerns where some of the strongest most talented engineers who cared strongly about the work and quality of work they were doing.

Other downsides are sometimes you are lead to feel like you should feel privileged working for Atlassian. Mandatory on call was introduced putting significant restrictions on movement and activities in personal / family time. It was non-negotiable, significant change to current duty, roles and contract with very poor compensation. Trying to discuss the new requirement was returned with `it’s mandatory`, `take one for the team, Atlassian give you free food`.

For people being relocated overseas Atlassian only offered help in the form of cash which was fair in the sense it covered flights and shipping and initial hotel costs but you won’t have much if any left. The fee is taxed quite heavily, it can also hang over you with the crawlback clause it you are no longer enjoying your time at the company within the period set out. Atlassian could help out better on the relocation assisting in advice for people new to Australia such as the property market, banking, utilities, tax, day to day stuff you need to set up on arriving to Australia but may not be familiar with when you get here and start work."

Strong technical and quality focus.

So far the balance is working very well though.

Arriving as a new developer working on any of the main products (vs new infrastructure, which is different), there's a lot of complexity and legacyness, large teams and an awful lot to learn, both technically and organisationally, and this can be overwhelming - expect 6-9 months before you feel able to effectively contribute to gnarly stuff to the large products.

A chance to work on something that really helps teams, as opposed to something that sells ads.

The company values mean something. Sure, not all of them. (No one seems to really agree on what Build With Heart And Balance means.) And not 100% every day. But overall, the values drive the company more than most.

Many of the executives really care about having a great place to work. The ""Experience Team"" does a fantastic job of making every-day life at work pretty good, whether it is big events (like annual friends and family day) or small events (like ""sillybrations"" on wacky quasi-holidays).

For most people, there is a pretty good work-life balance. Most people work 9-5. Almost no one works weekends. It is a big company with many projects and teams, so this can vary somewhat. But if you walk around the office at 6pm it is pretty empty.

Atlassian has pretty modern product management practices. Yes, there is room for improvement. Yes, there are companies out there do it a better or more consistently. But if you read any book or blog on modern cutting edge product management you'll think, ""Hey, Atlassian has been working like that for a while already.""

The vast majority of your coworkers are smart and have their hearts in the right place. You will rarely feel like you're engaged in turf wars or politics or working with deadweight.","Salaries are flat out low relative to the talent levels and amount of equity given out doesn't fill the gap. The current weakness of the Australian dollar means jobs everywhere else in the world look appealing. Moving to Australia is a big draw but it is near impossible to get senior talent, especially from the US, to consider moving.

There are a lot of teams. Quite a few of them are not an ideal choice. Either because they're working on an also-ran product, because they're strategic priority #42, or because they're dealing with morass of cross-product work. For instance, you can work on billing systems at Atlassian...or thousands of other companies.

Some people and positions do not have good work-life balance. Often this comes from Team Leads or other more senior developers who put in long hours. Sometimes this is due to lack of training in delegation skills. Other times it is due to skill/expertise gaps. (When you grow this fast, you might be the only person on your team who has been around long enough to understand how that subsystem works.)

Quite a bit of silo-ification between products and geographies. That's somewhat understandable as the company has grown but it was a problem even when it was substantially smaller. This is a bit ironic given the tools that Atlassian makes.

I doubt this is unique to Atlassian but Product Management reigns supreme (over design and engineering). PMs are the ones who have meetings with the CEOs and GMs. There has been significant turnover among PM ranks and the general consensus is that the PM discipline has stagnated since a reorg from a functional structure a few years ago. The failure rate of new hire PMs is staggeringly high compared to any other role in the company.

Engineering and Product Development is a strength but many other functions have lots of room for improvement. HR is a perennial sore point for many. Lack of training and career progression have been a top complaint for years and very little has improved. Rollout of new systems (like applicant tracking systems) and processes takes just as long as at many other companies.

There's no two ways about it: legacy code. The main products are over a decade old. Atlassian has done an admirable job of maintaining high R&D investments (instead of turning them into cash cows with skeleton maintenance crews). But you'll be working on 13-year old Java download applications. The company is in the midst of an existential shift to find its way to a SAAS future but there's a huge gap between the products as they are today and how a product built from scratch would look."

I would recommend to a friend as has the chances for some nice work, and looks like a nice stepping stone to something else in the future.","Getting on the right team can be difficult. Salary is low. Salary details are not shared (and for good reason as there is a massive different between salary for the exact same positions throughout the company) and it will usually take sourcing other employment opportunites to discover your true worth and get HR to do anything about it, if you are deemed worthy of keeping. And while the company considers itself very collaborative, this is taken to the extreme and unless you are able to self-promote every single thing you do, every single day, then no one will have any idea that you even exist ..... Worse of all though for me is the shifting goalposts. Performance reviews are quite a joke as they entirely depend on which team you work on, and how good a buddies you are with your Team Lead. Just doing excellent work is not enough, as even though, yes you fixed this stupidly outdated and broken process, but you failed to blog about it for 3 weeks prior to actually making the change and 2 people over there had an error this morning and instead of fixing it had to spend 1 hour figuring out who to blame (when they could have actually read the 1 blog that you did write (but 10 is better than 1 off course!)  .....

* While I do know people whom I feel haven't gotten a fair shake, to a remarkable degree Atlassian strives to do right by everyone who works here, regardless of their level. The engineers-as-fatted-calves syndrome seems to be less of a thing, which is awesome. (That's coming from an engineer, though, so take it with a grain of salt?)

** we don't censor that, but Glassdoor does. that must count for something.","* People in Australia (who don't work here) sometimes refer to us as the ""Australian Google"". That's awesome; it doesn't mean we're Google. Not Invented Here is common in engineering organizations, but it's especially bad here.

* Similarly, while we've had an amazing run so far, we are facing new and much more competent competitors than we're used to. It's not clear that folks in Sydney feel the heat the same way all of us living in the bubble do. Complacency is lethal."

1114,Atlassian,Fantastic people and products,2016-02-24,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"A really sharp group of motivated people making really useful products. At its heart there is a genuine element I think due to Scott and Mike - they are there to build great products and a great company, doing it differently than the norm.  So things like social responsibility are built into the culture at its core.","They were exceptionally great at giving sharp people big things to chew off and in doing so, sometimes it works and that person grows along with the new function.  So if you're sharp and a hard worker, there are good opportunities to try things..  However the concept of growing and cultivating people and finding exactly where someone's strengths were flourish."
1115,Atlassian,Not a bad support gig,2016-02-18,4.0,Support Engineer,"I have been working in software support for more than 10 years (tech support in general for more than 15), so I am old and jaded. When I started at Atlassian in 2014, I didn't really buy into what I was being told about culture and values, etc, but I signed on anyway since the pay was decent for a Support job and the people I met were all very nice. Now that I have been around for a while, I can honestly say that the Atlassian values are not bs and that, for the most part, the company cares about its culture. I used to work for another company that used to blow its culture up your rear end during the recruiting process, but when they went public, it became obvious that culture was not as important as those shareholders. One of things that I have been pleased about with Atlassian is that, so far, the transition to a public company has not really done much to the culture other than reinforce it. Working in Support, you are at the bottom of the totem pole and the work can be difficult, but I still look forward to coming in and working with my team every day and that is saying a lot (refer back to my comments about being old and jaded). Atlassian seems to care about its employees in ways that other companies may preach about, but don't really back up with their wallets.","The company is based in Sydney and most of the development is handled there. Since Sydney is literally in tomorrow, it makes communication between offices difficult. It's is obvious that our Support folks in AUS are much more involved with engineering than the rest of us around the world are. As others have mentioned, the company has a heavy bias towards developers and their work styles and life styles. While I don't feel that this is intentional, it still doesn't feel good to be told how important events are like ShipIt and then be told by your manager that you can't participate because someone needs to be around for the customers.  I don't feel or notice the attitudes that others have noticed (maybe that is an AUS phenomenon), but there is certainly a feeling of disconnect between what feels like the privileged developer class and the rest of us."

1117,Atlassian,"Challenging, but very pro-developer",2016-02-13,4.0,Senior Systems Engineer,"Tons of very smart and talented people. Plenty of opportunities to have a positive impact on the products, on how people use them, and on how teams function. Lots and lots of attention paid to little details around the office - food, events, and general atmosphere - which make it a generally pleasant work environment. Everyone is encouraged to speak their mind.","It's a company founded by and for developers, so if you aren't a developer then it's easy to feel left out. (I can't just stop doing my job for the fun hackathon; if I stop doing my job then things break, badly.) Many in the company also tend to forget that incremental improvement is sometimes a better option for change than doing all the things at once.

There's so much to be done that it's disturbingly easy to overextend. Teams can be a bit scattered geographically, which makes collaboration difficult, and there's a very strong bias in favor of Sydney when it comes to promotions, thought leadership, and meeting scheduling. Everyone is encouraged to speak their mind, and many tend to do just that even when they have no idea what they're talking about."
1118,Atlassian,Growing too quickly,2016-02-07,4.0,,"The people and culture are (for the most part) excellent. A lot of extremely talented people are doing amazing work, and genuinely want to help everyone else do amazing work as well. Knowledge sharing is highly encouraged, and while that can sometimes produce information overload, it’s still good to know that you can find out what any other team is working on if needed.

There are many opportunities for people who want to try different things IF you can find the right people to talk to. From switching product teams for new perspectives, to trying out whole new career paths. I’ve seen many people do role changes: devs, tech writers, product managers, program/project managers, support engineers...

The Experience team are incredible, and are a huge part of why it’s been the Best Place to Work two years in a row. From the big and obvious things like special events and holiday-themed breakfasts, to the small and subtle changes that keep a fast-growing office ticking along.","The flip side of being constantly showered with treats and events is the spoiled sense of entitlement that can grow within the ranks. This is especially noticeable among the newer starters, of which there are more and more every week. Atlassian is filled with very smart people who like being right. This also means the levels of snark and argumentativeness are sometime unbearable.

While knowledge sharing across divisions is encouraged, it’s becoming less and less frequent. Silo mentality has well and truly set in after so much rapid growth. Almost every team is doing things in different ways.

Sometimes it feels as if the company has bought into its own marketing hype, and has lost a sense of perspective about what actually makes it a good company. A few months ago there was a company-wide announcement that staff should go and leave good reviews on Glassdoor, as if a sudden flurry of positivity out of nowhere wouldn’t look suspicious at all. A message like that indicates common sense going out the window."

My team is full of great people who help each other out. While the code I work on today is a bit old, the newer stuff the company is working on is right on the money for where we should be going technically. 

You get to work on software that is used everyday by millions of people. There isn't anything else like this in Australia except maybe for Google. The company is constantly growing so there always new opportunities if you are ambitious.","Like any successful software company there is a bit of clunky old code you have to deal with from time-to-time. 

Your experience at the company can change a lot depending on the team you are in. There are some awesome low level managers (like my own), and some more average ones. In general I would say most of the companies problems stem from the HR department. There seems to a lack of experience and vision there.

In a fast paced environment such as Atlassian, the career opportunities are endless and I find that I am constantly challenged with new and exciting opportunities.

Management is upfront and open about current events with all employees keeping everyone involved.","Atlassian operates as a very global organization and in working with teams in different timezones you will inevitably have evening meetings if located in the US.

If you don't fall in with the right crowd or have different opinions, you're not going to do well there.
When I worked there I was amazed at the amount of internal politics, and how everything is decided by committee. There are also a lot of people who've been there forever but don't really have any job definition. They're just kinda buddies with the founders and so they stick around. Lot's of trolling on things like internal Blog posts. In short it was just a very poor experience. I felt like I was in some kind of cult where everyone  was drinking the Koolaid in public but behind closed doors everyone whined about how the company was being run.
For their part, the founders have made their money, and have started investing in other startups and even getting involved in the Australian political scene to a certain extent, so they're pretty checked out.
The pay was lower than average, but like Google in the early days lots of people were willing to take that in return for having Atlasssian on their resume (I know I was!)."

Now, I have to say that this is only the case if you're willing to devote additional time to work.

Too much open talk about women in tech and sexuality in the workplace than is needed, creates an uncomfortable place to talk about your opinion. Culture is not everything. Nobody is really on the same page. So many different things, and some alike, happening at the time and teams and even people within the same team are not aligned. Too much information on CAC and not clean to be able to sort and know what is accurate and/or what is important. The global aspect is hard to adjust when your team is throughout 4-5 different offices on complete opposite time zones. There is a lack of communication, which is hard to believe when everything is on CAC, but it's not easy to digest. People tend to use EAC as the method communication and forgot how valuable face to face meeting are and how effective they are. Along the lines of communication, setting expectations is the lack of and often times can you bite you in the but, but that might just be my team because I actually don't think that aligns with our company values."

Indeed they once had a thriving, much ballyhooed company culture. Nowadays you'll find it runs rife with micromanagement, favoritism and unsavory business tactics."
1146,Atlassian,Unlike any other Australian company,2015-08-19,4.0,Intern,"The company is constantly growing at a rapid pace, both in terms of head count and customer revenue. Most people within the company are smart and bring their own specialised knowledge to create a company with great capability. The culture is great, everyone is socially laid back yet focused on performing their work to their best. Strong customer base and innovative business model that works well will fuel growth for a long time to come.","Whilst I am an itern (so this doesn't affect me), it is common perception that salaries are reduced from market rates for the luxury of working at Atlassian (which may or may be worth it depending on circumstances). With so many intelligent people within the company, you are competing against all colleagues for promotions, rather than just a handful of people if it were another company. There is a struggle to keep the culture and quality of employees during rapid growth as Atlassian has begun to saturate its reach into the Sydney tech talent pool. Some employees have the social maturity of a 15 year old, and this mindset thrives in a company without the typical corporate culture."
1147,Atlassian,What a joke,2015-08-17,1.0,Senior Designer,"Atlassian offers a lot of perks. Free lunches, beers on tap, pool tables and game nights. They offer nearly-free health, vision, and dental insurance. They have a swanky, open floor plan San Francisco office and there’s a lot of opportunities to travel to other offices or speak at conferences in other countries. There’s some genuinely good natured and hard working people there. They drive you really hard and you will become better in your field but be warned...","To start, there's very little training into the vast, internal structure or options for outside training. There is a ton of in-speak, acronyms, and politics to understand to be effective. Managers tend to focus on improving your weak points instead of bolstering your strengths. Decisions are made via waterfall and handed down from the executive layer with little regard to the impact those decisions have on the end user. If you have a bad relationship with your manager don't expect much help or mediation. When I asked who to talk to about being mismanaged and verbally abused I was told that I shouldn't bring it up and just power through until the manager in question moved on to harass another employee. There's an underlying current of gossip and politics and the ""Open Company"" part of their values is totally [inaccurate]. 


The Culture: Everyone plays second fiddle to the Sydney office. There are more promotions and raises in the Sydney office. Diversity is a joke, a literal joke. The head of HR has a staff of beautiful, young, blond women and has an office deemed the ""Man Cave"". The open office arrangement makes for a lot of distractions. Whether it’s dogs barking, the beer bikes, or a mariachi band (I swear to God that happened) they don’t seem to want to promote a productive environment. The office is located a block from the San Francisco County Jail and a park with one of the few public bathrooms in SoMa. There’s a lot of homeless harassment, human waste and crime you have to consider when coming to/from the office. If you drive in, they don't reimburse you for parking.

The tools: Atlassians “dogfood” all their own software which is cool in theory. Most of the software is groaning under it’s own infrastructure and poor IT and is very buggy since you’re seeing a development version and not production software. Somedays the inferior system you’re forced to use crashes for half a day and you have to work over the evening to make up for it. They don’t like email. Expect 90% of your communications to happen through their instant messaging app (also inferior) which will undoubtedly lead to miscommunications within your team.

Their future: I expect to see a lot of employees leaving and cashing out their stock after they IPO. There's a lot of poor business decisions being made right now to try and boost the share price and with little regard to the customers who support them. That's bad business."

And Mike and Scott sat back in their glass houses and said, ""Whew, that's under control.""

And if you think I am making this up... I am not.

If you want to join a cult and tow the party line, this is a great place to be."

Plenty of time to slack, not do much of anything and be promoted for it. Just stay happy and abide by the illustrious company values.","Too much politics, and nonsense. People landing senior jobs because of relationship, not experience or skill. These same managers routinely chastise the (smarter) members of their team just to keep employed, knowing they're unemployable at any other company.

- Sometimes the focus doesn't seem to be in the right place
- Products have become pretty complex and we're losing out on some market due to more polished, less functional competitors"

Atlassian is really a great place to work and lived up to every exaggerated expectation I had going in. I had the sense my manager really cared about my career development and job happiness.",The work itself can be very challenging and they expect you to learn quickly.

* The hallmark of any good company is great culture. Here at Atlassian it's OK to speak your minds. Prioritize customer over politics.
* Lot of smart people - especially getting hired recently as it is attracting a lot of talent. 
* Great people - seriously you can take any to your family.
* Opportunities are boundless. This is a fast growing company.
* Work-life balance - cannot compare to any other company in silicon valley. Combination of doing well and not being a sweat shop.
* Business model - Unique business model which would be hard for anyone to copy.

It is the next generation enterprise software company.","* Sometimes too many people have opinions about your work without any context. Can slow you down if you don't know how to handle it.

- Minimal politics and BS; people are free to speak their minds about...everything.
- I'm trusted to do my job; I have enormous flexibility over where/when/how I work. 
- The company and its values really mean something to the vast majority of employees - as a whole, people believe in Atlassian, our values, and the products we make. Sounds cheesy, but shoot... it's nice to care. 
- Very, very little email. 
- Great benefits package, competitive salary, lots of office perks.","- It's occasionally overwhelming to have a constant stream of opinions from everyone, including people who lack full context and are speaking up anyway.
- It's easy to work too much/too hard, because there's just an enormous amount of work that needs to be done and things move at a fast pace. You have to set boundaries (and you can).  
- The sheer volume of information/communication shared in the company in a day is mind-boggling. If you try to keep up with it, you'll drown. You have to find the right volume and channels and make peace with ignoring the rest."

We're growing like crazy, and hiring so many new people, it's amazing. It's provided a lot of opportunity to expand responsibilities, attack new challenges and grow my career. As a woman, it's among the most friendly, open and supportive tech companies I've ever worked at - I haven't even had a whiff of the sexual harassment types of things I saw over the years. Maybe helps that there's not a sales team and the big ego testosterone department that usually comes with it. 

The management team is humble and philanthropic - it's genuinely inspiring to work with them and for them.  It doesn't feel like everyone's just there for the money and there are very few politics relative to other companies I've worked at before. The average employee is also much more philanthropically/socially minded than average tech colleague I've had - feels like we're doing good work and doing good in the world at the same time.","It's a straight-shooter culture with a very open online wiki. Your work will often be a public debate and people won't necessarily hold the punches telling you what they think, even if they don't have all the information. With a little bit of self-assertiveness and resilience, you can make it through - in general people are kind and bright, and will be much more reasonable if you catch them in person. But sometimes they can get a little sharper when they're making online comments vs. what they would say in person. The management team also tells it like it is. Consistent with other engineering cultures I've worked in - everyone's more analytical and straight-shooting vs. the warm, fuzzy beat-around the bush side of the continuum."

In most companies this is just more BS internal marketing but not at Atlassian!  I started working here in Dec 2014 and while it has only been 3 months I can say that the values they advertise are absolutely the values that they follow in the day to day operations of the company.

In my 25 year career in IT I have never worked for or with a better group of people.  I love coming to work!  I love taking cases and helping our customers!

Benefits:  Insurance Paid. The last time I worked for a company that paid for my health insurance completely was in 1989 - 1994!!  Vision and Dental, Paid!!!

Perks:  To many to mention but catered lunches, parties, working with great people, learning and growth opportunities, subsidized parking or train, and a lot more!

Need more convincing, how about profitable company for 12 years!  How about explosive growth (Austin office went from 6 or 7 transplants in spring 2014 to over 130 employees in Feb 2015!!!","None.  I love coming to work, I love the people I get to work with, I love the customers (how many support engineers can say that?)

- 5 days paid volunteer leave per year. Awesome to be able to help local charities.

Interview process
- I was asked to facilitate a workshop and go through a design exercise. This was great to actually go through a practical exercise.
- I had 5 face to face interviews in total. Why so many? I work in a senior cross-product role so was asked to meet a bunch of the teams I would be working with.

It is a good group of happy people working hard to make it easier to work together. The upper management is very open and does their best to answer the hard questions. You are given a ton of autonomy but with that comes an expectation to perform at your best. 

The SF location feels like it is a very balanced place where company events feel like a party with a group of your friends rather than awkward team building tasks.

The values are extremely important to the company and everyone can quote them, not because they make you feel good, but because you use them in your job every day.","Timezones - Global company forces meetings at odd hours, not much that can be done about this.
Meeting rooms - we need more of them, lots of empty desks.

- The work environment has a lot of distractions... Like blogs, useless chats.. 
- Managers are like their products.. Worst performance, Have no idea why they want something done... They have no clue on how to manage people...

HR's main concern is promoting their image and that of Australia's best place to work. When it comes to training, opportunities for career development and grooming first time managers, they are nowhere to be found.

This is a place where people openly attack each other in public forums. If you do not write blogs, you will not be noticed. If you do write blogs, be prepared to have your work ripped apart and your intelligence questioned. If you are nondeveloper, expect this at ten times the frequency. And this is all in the name of open company, no BS.

Employees act entitled and culture encourages them to compete for attention. People voice grumbles about small things on company forums so that everyone can see and join in. The cheese variety isnt enough, the lunch isnt free, the perks in some other location or different company are so much better. It goes on and on.

Company is too focused on what the competition is doing rather than thinking about true innovation. Focus shifts often and people are moved around without consent. Be prepared to be a cog in a wheel.

As many review's have already pointed out, there has been a huge exit of people in recent times and especially of senior females. The office politics, lack of career progression and lower salaries compared to other employers are to blame."

They also have a lot of dedicated and smart people working there that makes coming into work fun. Besides the ubiquity of JIRA, I first heard about the company from a TED Talk several years ago (Dan Pink on Motivation – look it up, it's good) and wanted to work there ever since.","In a way, I felt like I was the victim of a bait and switch, and it seems like this is because it's a big company acting like a small startup. I interviewed for one role, and was offered something else, which I had accepted thinking that it would be just as good and similar. What I had found was a team going through transition – people leaving and management being replaced, and a project starting to come apart at the seams. To be honest, I should have asked more about the role before accepting it.

Atlassian is going through growing pains, just as much as any other successful company in the SF bay area. You can gather this by also looking at the Cons of other reviews (even positive ones) – lack of career development, seemingly disorganized management., etc."

I don't mean the stuffy suit and tie feeling of large corporations or financial institutions, rather a sense of leadership and respect that helps careers to grow and smart talented people to stick around. I left because the particular team I was on had fired their manager and spent months in meetings that devolved into screaming and swearing on a regular basis to try and tackle the issue of how to handle the workload. There was no consensus on the correct approach and no strong leaders to step in and implement any judgement or experiential foresight. But in the time since I have left, I've known many others to also take the leap to new and exciting opportunities and each time, I have heard them talk of the bitterness of their departure in the same ways in which I felt when I left.

The offices while central are overcrowded. The company is littered with cliques…mainly older boys whole like to play Dungeons & Dragons and are persuaded by free beer & pizza to properly appreciate the lack of actual career development opportunities taking place.

The company is on a fast track of growth and everything centers on when the company will list in the UK and finally crystallize the large reward that the co-founders are due (and have probably earned). 

Every other ‘manager’ (I use this word loosely) closely monitors their employee share growth and are too engrossed in their future reward to even notice the new employees they have hired. 

This applies to finance/tax/HR and payroll too and is not limited to the operations side. 

Really good people are constantly leaving…the place is a revolving door or new starters leaving because of a lack of direction and older employees taking the winnings of their employee shares and starting a ‘new life’ at some place more organised.

Don’t join this company if you want a ‘career’…it’s an illusion. When you peel back the thin veneer that is the free cheap thrills that are thrown your way to distract you from improving your career attributes, you realize you have pretty much landed in a child care center for little boys that failed to grow up.

All manager level employees (I.e. people who have the responsibility of other employee careers in their hands) should be made redundant as their purpose is really to serve themselves. 

HR should not be allowed to call themselves ‘Human’ because they are clearly devoid of any attributes to draw that long conclusion. At best it's a talent Acquisition department, which can find talent but has no idea on how to properly hang onto that talent once they are in the door.

At the end of the day this is a career limiting environment which is spruced up by constantly having cheap thrills thrown at you. As they say, a pig with lipstick is still a pig and it doesn't matter how much freebies are thrown in your direction, its a career dead end.

All while the founding members plan their retirement funds (via public listing) and ego overweight lazy ‘Heads of Departments’ stare at the rapid rate of growth in their stock options neglecting the careers of those they hired to do their heavy lifting. Observing  the 'Head's of Departments' trying to 'manage' their new hires is akin to watching a spider crawl out of a toilet."

- company is bold, there is never a dull moment!

1202,Atlassian,"Had a good culture, but fast deteriorating",2014-06-06,3.0,Anonymous Employee,"The biggest relief and the greatest advantage I felt about working in this place was the fact that there is not email mess in the company. Everything happens via Wiki (of course Confluence) and believe me, it's a real benefit. So easy to find content and people who can help you in any area.","Due to the growth many people have become managers who has no clue about people management and trying just to do micro management in every aspect. Their ego seems to be driving people crazy and resulting in people quitting jobs. Lateral hires who have no clue about software and just having management experience are trying to build teams. That's going to fail. Using authority for decisions only build resistance towards decisions.
Absolutely no way to switch roles even though there are lot of lateral hires coming in just because they have a big brand in their resume.
Salary was pathetic as the brand value of Atlassian is expected to keep the employees happy. 
Regarding other perks, how many beers, pizzas and candies can you eat in a day to compensate for that?
While developers were being paid less, we had a team for QA (whose role I have never understood till now) who were being paid a hefty salary which used to de-motivate all of us.

It's no more a startup, so hierarchical that I wonder how such a small company can have 6 levels of reporting for 600 employees, while big MNCs with thousands of employees are able to manage with 5-6 reporting levels.

But having said all these, I would still say Atlassian is good place to in."
1203,Atlassian,Fantastic working environment. A growing company that truly lives its values.,2014-06-05,5.0,Designer,"Atlassian is a great place to work. I come into work every day looking forward to it, and my colleagues are also my friends. The company lives its 5 values every day in everything it does. The work is challenging and interesting, there are great perks and events, and I feel like Atlassian cares about its staff which makes for a low attrition rate.

Atlassian learns from its mistakes, and although you can feel the bureaucracy creeping in as it grows from being a startup to a mid-size global company, I feel like there has been a lot of progress in the last year to address some of the problems addressed in other reviews.

The work/life balance is exceptional, better than any other company I've seen. People are actively encouraged to take time off and not stress or work outside regular hours to prevent burnout. Atlassian recognises that hiring and training people is an expensive and time consuming exercise, so it tries to keep its staff happy.","Sometimes it feels like management is comprised of a lot external hires who don't get the company culture. However it's definitely getting better as these people start to fit in. 

A lot of Atlassian's products are very old with legacy code bases, and some teams move very slowly especially with people constraints. This can be annoying when you want to ship awesome stuff to customers frequently.

The perks are fun and frequent, but there could be more attention to detail to the office environment. Atlassian spends a lot less than other tech companies per square meter on office fitout, which means our offices don't have as many features you might get elsewhere."
1204,Atlassian,One of the best tech companies I've encountered,2014-05-12,5.0,Marketing Manager,Great company culture.  Customer love the products,"Working with colleagues based in Australia can be challenging, due to timezone differences.  That said, company is willing to send people to remote offices very frequently, so you get to build rapport with everyone on the team."
1205,Atlassian,"If you have a soul and would like to retain it, move along",2014-04-28,2.0,Anonymous Employee,"There are many genuinely good-hearted, helpful, well-intentioned people who believe and live the stated company values, which is no small feat considering Atlassian's size. 

Thought leadership, when shared, is generally good quality and a source of pride.","Cosign many of the points made by the January 2 reviewer: Atlassian is great at bringing in motivated, quality talent and letting those folks languish. There is limited opportunity for upward mobility, and where it is present, your options are to work for a brand-new manager promoted out of seniority (hit or miss), or a transplant from a traditional enterprise software company whose cultural-fit section of the interview must have gotten cut short (sure miss). 

The HR team (I refuse to call them Talent, since they clearly do not see employees as such) is among the least reliable/responsive I've ever seen. To call them tone-deaf would be an understatement. Valid complaints around gender discrimination and hostile work environment are brushed off; the constant refrain of ""look at the perks we offer"" to questions around pay scale was once funny and is now just insulting. What perks?"
1206,Atlassian,"Good product gene, awesome people, technical debt",2014-04-15,3.0,Senior Developer,You can work on products people love to use. You can notice how company tries to change itself from a installed software company to SaaS. You will be able to work closely with product managers and together shape the product. Despite its size company is still rather open so by observing internal communication tools you can get the feel of what's going on and participate in different activities.,"Depending on a team you will join you can face a crappy and abandoned technology that no one else uses. If you wish to keep up with cool technologies it might not be a good place for you. You will face a wall when it comes to making those products technically better - sacred APIs that cannot be changed, scary plugin system or hacked maven for builds. I would advise to choose teams that work on recently created products. Avoid more mature ones. Company grows a lot and plans to do so in the upcoming years, so despite their great values atmosphere starts to feel like in any other ""corporation"" - multi level managerial structure, bad people management."
1207,Atlassian,"A genuinely fun place to be, not very structured though",2014-03-26,4.0,Senior Developer,"Good atmosphere and vibe in the company, great to be a part of something so successful and I feel I am learning a lot from the people around me.",So much growth and change means it feels a little messy at times. So many new people are joining that teams don't feel settled yet and you have to get used to things changing every week.
1208,Atlassian,Incredible culture and many opportunities for career growth,2014-03-17,4.0,,"The company is willing to take chances on employees who maybe don't have the official experience yet, allowing some extremely talented people to emerge. The people that work at Atlassian are interesting, engaging and supportive making going to work everyday enjoyable.","There are not clear, defined paths for advancement (unless an employee takes it upon themselves to carve it out). The open company no ""bs"" value (yes that's one of the values) is great but it's also sometimes distracting because there is constantly a lot of activity."

1215,Atlassian,A company in the midst of growing pains,2014-01-26,4.0,Anonymous Employee,"Probably the most fun company that you'll be around.  There is politics, but for the most part, you are valued for what you have to contribute to the table.  The amount of transparency is staggering: it's not every company where any Joe Blow can query the company data warehouse or simply ask what the top secret project is.  

Atlassian has some of the best people working for it that you'll ever find, and I genuinely look forward to coming into work.  It's exciting times, if you like building new stuff or breaking new ground, and I've not stopped learning since I've gotten here.","Like many companies that are explosively growing, things don't always scale up fast enough.  Like many of the other people here, I'll point out that not all is right with Kansas, and there's some spring cleaning that needs to be done of some of the cruft.  

I would say that there's a lot less cruft than I've seen elsewhere, but I'll certainly acknowledge that it exists.

For other cons, it takes a tremendous amount of energy to course correct, though this is kind of a first world problem.  Most other companies wouldn't even offer you the option to course correct, but Atlassian does-it just takes a lot of patience and asbestos suits.

Compared to the outside, Atlassian compensation kind of blows, but there are some nice perks to make up some of it.  It really is a pleasant place to work, but you can make more elsewhere."
