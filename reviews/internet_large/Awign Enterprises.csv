86,Awign Enterprises,Worst Worst Worst. Fraudsters. Scammers.,2020-08-25,1.0,Anonymous Employee,I cannot think of any to be honest. Only a few people are good and actually want to work but they are suppressed by the good for nothing 'self proclaimed' leaders who know nothing on how to manage and run a company.,"CEO has no idea what he is doing. No vision. Just lies and lies and such unrealistic promises that company is doing good and targeting this much revenue but everyone knows that not even half of that is achievable due to the company image spoiled in the market by the deeds of the founders and leaders and now no one wants to work with Awign. Lack of leadership from the founders. CEO is a greedy person who do not want to pay to employees or to the interns despite company making good money. And all these positive reviews are nothing but their own employees giving 5 star all of a sudden just to improve the rating which is too obvious - too many ratings and reviews suddenly on the same day. Even on Playstore, they do paid reviews and their own employees make fake Gmail accounts to post reviews. Such a pathetic work environment. They will never deliver what they promise. NEVER! 
Hiring is so bad. No quality hiring and that is seen in the work they do. Anyone who is ready to join for a huge cut can easily get a job irrespective of skills and talent. So many talented people from IIMs/ISB joined them and left in a very short span of time coz talented people do not want to work with a bunch of idiots. There is no respect for people who actually want to do some good. If anything that requires CEO to pay money is absolutely nonsense according to him. They offer internships like refuelling scooters and call that an internship and offer this to engineering students. It is all a total joke and a big scam. Interns are not paid for months despite they working so hard and everytime a new excuse. Ashamed to be a part of such an organisation. Their investors should definitely look into their way of working and see what fraud they are doing out of their money. Oh and forget about personal life. You will get a call at 3 am in the night asking for some irrelevant data which will never be discussed again. If they want to delay anything, they simply ask for the data and then it is pending forever. It is like a circus going on! Will never recommend anyone to work here. Awign is a shame and a disgrace to a society."
