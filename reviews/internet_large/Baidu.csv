If you give confidence to the management, you can get a lot of flexibility.

Work life balance is okay, most people do not spend much time in the office.  

Food is very decent for someone who likes Chinese cuisine.","There is highly negative shift in culture after Andrew Ng's departure. The current environment promotes building political connections with the management rather than focusing on the delivery of objectively high quality work. Most people just compete to artificially pump up the outcome and value of their work to present to the management, although the quality is low tier. Current managers are clueless about the technical aspects and directions - they cannot even properly define what deep learning or any other related term is. Current managers have secured their positions with their personal connections with the executives in China and there is literally zero evaluation mechanism on them, so they are pretty relaxed and do not care about the progress in R&D much.

Communication and exclusion problems have got very serious. Most non-Chinese employers feel very uncomfortable and eventually decide to leave. Chinese employers feel minimal effort to speaker English although the topic is of interest to everyone. They try to take advantage of the situation by having Chinese meetings with the managers and excluding others. Most engineering and product teams in China approach non-Chinese employers in the US with a negative bias, which can be hard to overcome.

Even employers in the US office have strict biases towards each other and this has caused clustering. They intentionally avoid helping people outside their clusters to hinder their success. 

Besides management, most researchers have pretty conservative mindset. They have zero willingness to take risks. The style of most of the research projects is reimplementing a paper by Google, and then slightly modifying it. There used to be very bright and senior researchers, but they have already left..."
