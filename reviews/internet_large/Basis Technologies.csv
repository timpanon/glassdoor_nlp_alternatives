The workloads are unmanageable, and expectations aren’t realistic. They preach work/life balance but the amount of emails I get on weekends and late at night begs to differ.

12,Basis Technologies,Great company,2021-07-20,5.0,Education and Development Strategist,I loved working at Centro! The people were amazing and so were the benefits. Expect to work hard but have a great time doing so.,At times the work life balance was challenging.
13,Basis Technologies,There's a reason why there are so many job openings here,2021-07-15,1.0,Anonymous Employee,Ferris Bueller days off were nice.,"Pay was not competitive (even before Covid times, but especially now when you can work from anywhere). I never received merit raises or cost-of-living raises in my tenure, despite having excellent performance reviews, being a top performer, and Centro making a profit year after year. There is no transparency from the org over how raises and promotions are decided and what you need to do to qualify for one. Some departments will give out raises/promotions but I guess Centro doesn't prioritize all of their departments, as it seems many departments just don't have the budget. Easiest way to get promoted or to get a raise is to leave the company unless you are in one of the well funded departments or your department has already had multiple departures.

You are expected to have job responsibilities outside your job description. These job responsibilities vary widely between team members with the same title. Be prepared to be be overworked and burnt out with no support from management when you go to them for help. Managers are out of touch regarding your day-to-day responsibilities. If you want any credit for your accomplishments to get a raise or a promotion, you need to request a peer review because your manager doesn't understand your job responsibilities.
 
Weak leadership in the tech organization is causing a mass exodus of talent. Management is blaming talent leaving on their staff being poached by other companies, when in reality people are leaving for the reasons listed in this review."

From my team and the other departments I've worked with, they are largely homogeneous white teams.

Centro's proprietary software (Basis DSP) is the #1 User-Voted DSP by G2 Crowd.  Centro has premier partnerships with Google and Facebook.  This makes media planning fun and it also means you have access to a wide variety of resources that you wouldn't necessarily be able to access at a smaller ad agency.

40,Basis Technologies,My favorite company thus far,2020-09-22,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"I never thought I would ever find a place where I could work on cool problems AND have a great work life balance until I came to Centro. I had previously worked at places where I may have had an amazing work life balance, but was bored with the problems I worked on/pace of the company. I've also been at places where I worked on super cutting edge problems, but at the cost of having to work crazy hours and get burned out. Here at Centro, I can honestly say that I am able to have both. 

The employees I've been around are all super smart, yet humble, and not overly competitive like I've seen at other places. People are always willing to help, and we all collectively recognize that we're in this together and doing our best!","We have a gorgeous office downtown, and as much as I enjoy the flexibility of remote work during covid, I miss going there!"
41,Basis Technologies,"Agency perks, agency downsides",2020-09-10,2.0,Media Services,"There really are some truly hardworking people who care about you - the team is the only reason to stick around. My direct managers were awesome and did their very best to combat unclear expectations at more executive levels. Benefits are pretty good also, holiday parties, events, etc. if you care about that. I will say through COVID, there has been great transparency about the company's challenges and safety measures which was much appreciated during such chaotic times.","Honestly, a lot of sugarcoating. I have been at agencies and I understand an agency workload - this is not that. Usually, you have some days that are long, some are not. Everyone I knew in services consistently worked well over 40 hours, most likely 50-60 hours with a base salary that barely breaks the low income level in any major city. Having snacks doesn't make up for burning out your employees without compensating them fairly. You do get monthly performance bonuses, but you don't get your last two months if you leave, fair warning, because although the company loves to say they love their employees, unless you are sales (who are irrationally over-worshiped) or director level or above, you are just a number at risk of any ""it's just business"" decision. Good luck also trying to take advantage of the FTO policy - you need to get covered like you are on an hourly paycheck and everyone is so overworked no one wants to cover you, or your manager will not make it seem like it's ok to actually take said ""unlimited"" FTO. When asked if people should take mental health days during COVID if necessary, we were discouraged because ""business comes first"" ...until all other companies/agencies started giving mental health days, and then they decided it was a good idea. Constructive feedback is not taken seriously by anyone who hasn't been at the company since it was created. Lack of diversity is one of the first things I noticed, although I understand they are doing what they can to fix this. Super unclear growth path - some people get promoted super quickly, some get wishy washy feedback and have no growth in sight."

48,Basis Technologies,This place is truly special.,2020-03-18,5.0,Prefer Not to Say,"For future readers, I am writing this during the COVID-19 pandemic.

The world is confronting something very terrifying at the moment, and it is sending shockwaves throughout the global economy and inciting a lot of fear, panic and distrust. It is a scary and uncertain time for families and businesses everywhere.

Moments like this force you to take stock of what you are grateful for, and while I'll be the first to admit this is a weird time to write a Glassdoor review, I feel compelled to share what's happening here at Centro through the lens of my inbox.

- Nearly overnight Centro assembled a taskforce of people to equip everyone the tools and info necessary to work remotely. We are a tech and services company that grew up on the internet, so it's easy to take this for granted. However, the speed and transparency and effort that went into making this easy for everyone is something I am personally grateful for. 

- Our CEO has scheduled multiple meetings to keep us updated on basic info about the virus, and how its growing across the world. At a time when there is a lot of mixed info in the media, and people aren't operating with the same level of concern - this is incredible. You may read from others about Centro's values around transparency and its care for its employees. It is real.

- We are individually isolated but the culture is THRIVING. Within days, new inter-office chat rooms have sprung up. Office-wide Happy Hours are being hosted via webcam. People are sending out daily tips on productivity or working out from their living rooms. Heartfelt team-wide notes to inspire eachother. Equally inspirational videos of dogs and cats and babies working on laptops. We may be isolated, but we have never been more unified.

- Centro has a nation-wide committe that organizes Centro's philanthropy called ""The Giving Tree"". It also matches some personal donations. This has been in overdrive in recent days.

On and on and on.

In all of this, I have no idea what comes next. No one does.

But I thank God for the people here and places like this.

Thank you, Centro.",We are services-oriented company. Building our own tech. In the Advertising Sector.  In 2020.  Expect all of the inherent challenges that come with that.
49,Basis Technologies,Best Decision I've Ever Made,2020-03-05,5.0,Human Resources,"They truly empower us to be the expert in our field. They care! I've never felt more appreciated.

53,Basis Technologies,Great place for Career Growth - if you're up for the challenge!,2019-09-23,5.0,Client Services Manager,"Echoing what has been said before of the overall amazing culture. Great chemistry across the teams that service our clients and a company that definitely values the people behind the levers. But something important to note is the overall career growth and skillset Centro arms its employees with. Given the varying clients, verticals, strategies and objectives, no day looks the same and no day comes without learning something new. Centro is exceptional at keeping people on their toes and challenges from both a work and personal growth perspective to be a better version of yourself every day.","Each office does great work, communication across the regions could use some improvement."
54,Basis Technologies,Best place to work- hands down!,2019-08-20,5.0,Performance Analyst,"You will never find a company culture like Centro. Everyone is so friendly and truly there to help. It is an extremely collaborative work environment with some of the  smartest minds in the Ad Tech/ Digital Marketing industry.

The CEO, Sean, is extremely hands on and receptive to his employees and their needs. Ego's are left at the door the second you walk into Centro and all ideas are listened to and treated equally. At Centro there is no such thing as ""my way or the highway"" managers are open to new ways of doing things and listen to what other people have to say.","If I ever want to change career paths, it's going to be tough to find a better company that makes me excited to come to work everyday."

Everyone here, regardless of role or title, should feel like they have a voice within Centro and can make an impact and a difference, you can. Centro is a special place that will allow the opportunity to grow your in your career and personally..  They invest in their employees and genuinely care about personal and professional satisfaction. There are lots of opportunities to move into different careers and gain new experiences, you just have to take advantage of them. I have grown more in my time at Centro than I have at any other company.  To succeed and grow, you will need to work more than 9-5 some days or weeks but one at the company feels work is the most important part of life. The benefits are good and I like the Flexible Time Off policy.  The Chicago office is always well stocked with snacks, drinks and various alcohol. The layout and decor is welcoming and wonderful, and the office is filled with amazing people building and using a technology that can change the industry.  Things at Centro will only get better in the near future.","Sometimes Centro is too nice in an effort to keep the culture the way it is. We need to be better at recognizing certain employees aren't a great fit for their role, even if they're great people.  It negatively impacts the rest of us to keep them around. There are also a lot of people at higher levels of the company who have ""grown-up"" with Centro, and don't see things from different perspectives. The pay isn't great,  but it's fine and there are a lot of other benefits. People can also be pretty cliquey and gossipy. It's intimidating and not always welcoming, but it's not usually harmful or mean. Overall, people are very nice and I have very few complaints about anything to do with the company."
57,Basis Technologies,Great place to work,2019-08-05,5.0,Specialist,"I love working here! I think management fully believes in individual growth and if you work hard you are rewarded for it. The company has so many resources and internal collateral that helps you learn quickly and is wonderful to have at your fingertips. The benefits are unbeatable and are truly put in place to make  you grow as a person too (free yoga, free gym money, amazing health insurance, etc!)","This company is very advanced and constantly growing, so you will have to work hard but that is the case in most advertising companies, so why not do it at a place with great people and great benefits."

My co-workers are incredible, and I'm surrounded by high achievers who give 100% and challenge me to be a better professional and person. The benefits are outstanding, and our Chicago office is one of a kind. On-site yoga and meditation, fresh fruit, healthy snacks, and cold brew are just a few of the perks we enjoy! Plus flex time and unlimited PTO :)","No place is perfect, but I am so grateful to have found a company that really cares. No real cons."
62,Basis Technologies,Fun and Growing Fast!,2019-06-01,5.0,Employee,"Centro has the best benefits of any company I've ever worked for (health, wellness, 401K, stock options, continuing education, etc.).

It also has a fun, and paradoxically relaxed, culture with the best people I've worked with. Love me teammates. I say paradoxically as even though it feels relaxed, most everyone here works hard...it's just that even though we're working hard and, every now and then, we may need to work extra hours it's not driven by a top-down, pressurized management.

We work hard because we love the company, love our teammates and want to do amazing work. No company, or person, ever achieved greatness working 40 hours a week and never spiking at times when needed.","I've been here for a few years and most of the cons are in our rear view mirror. It was a really challenging time from 2013 through 2017 when we were redeveloping our new software platform. Revenue growth rates were falling and we weren't hitting our goals so bonuses weren't getting paid at 100% consistently.

There were some dark moments during those years where, candidly, many of the employees weren't even sure the new platform could be built, would be built and, even if it was built, would anyone want it, buy it and pay for it. There were a ton of question marks and naysayers in the company during that time and our attrition levels spiked. 

However, those of us who stuck it out, couldn't be happier. We launched Basis, our new platform in 2017 and it's on fire. Internally it's transformed our operations and how we operate and, externally, over 200 customers have signed on to use Basis in the first 18 months with growth rates climbing back to their normal historic levels.

Sure, there's always things companies can improve on but, at this point, I'll take whatever little problems or gripes we may have (which probably are overly magnified as there isn't a lot of them) versus what I hear my friends at other companies are going through."
63,Basis Technologies,What's not to love here?!,2019-05-29,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"My boss & the leadership all across the board cares about me and my development. The resources offered help me live my best, most balanced life, from the benefits, to the initiatives around mental health... everything lines up nicely with my values, and I appreciate the never-ending efforts toward improving. 

It's very cool to be at a company that truly lives out it's mission and values, and it's comforting to feel like you are in great hands and surrounded by good people.","At this time, there's nothing I would change. Where there's good-hearted, quality people, there's great potential for endless opportunities, and for that reason, I see no reason to go elsewhere with my career."

- Sales reps were extremely difficult to work with and had unrealistic expectations

Perks to the job were great - unlimited PTO, competitive salary, good health benefits, tons of flexibility in all aspects of the position.

There are a LOT of good people at this company. A few bad eggs that stand out, but overall, you'll find many people who believe in the company, and are willing to help.","In my time there, the company was going through an identity shift from services to software as the main offering. Unfortunately, this was not the first identity shift Centro had gone through, and the market I worked in recognized it, making it difficult to position Centro as a stable company. 

I was a remote employee, and support overall was okay. My manager supported me well, but beyond that support was lacking. Sales training and onboarding is getting better, but my onboarding process was terrible, which hindered me throughout my time at Centro. If you've never worked remotely before, I would not recommend this as your first remote position.

2. Lots of great work to be done ... But not enough people who are actually capable of getting it done, which causes an imbalance of workload.","Management (including the exec team) plays favorites. This is not a new issue, and I've seen it on multiple teams since I started at Centro. Somehow, it is never addressed and it continues to happen. If you are friends with the boss, you will get ahead - whether it's getting that raise you wanted, getting all your days off approved, or getting away with doing little to no work (and somehow still getting rewarded). 

There are so many people who are overworked, overwhelmed and under recognized. Management has a poor understanding of what is required of their team, what their team actually works on,  and what is needed, both in terms of staffing and resources to get things done without people crying at their desks. I've seen so many people get frustrated and leave the company, or remain and just become miserable. It has become such a toxic environment in so many ways, and if you try to speak up, you are silenced or disregarded, which pushes a lot of people to leave. When people feel like you don't appreciate them, they will look for appreciation elsewhere. So much talent has been lost because of this and of course, the people who stay are friends with the boss.

There are large company callouts to say ""we are so grateful for the work you do,"" which is wonderful, but it ends there. It does not change the manager relationships and certainly does not reduce any of the stress people feel. There is little to no attempt to value the people who work hard to help the team succeed."

They've all been spoken about, again, as ""having their own reasons for leaving,"" but in reality, it's pretty clear: the vision changed, and with that, the company realized it didn't need the talent it already had.  Therefore, people are finding better opportunities where they are valued and respected.

Culture has shifted and it's made me realize there are better places to be than where I am now.  The perks are good, but they'll never outweigh respect and recognition."
90,Basis Technologies,Centro is the best company I've ever worked for (and perhaps the best company I'll ever work for),2018-10-03,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"The people at Centro are what make this company incredible. From our Founder and CEO Shawn, to our interns we call Centerns - everyone I've interacted with at Centro is kind, respectful, intelligent, driven and quirky. This is not by accident; everyone who works at Centro is carefully vetted, not only to determine if he or she is a good fit for the position, but most importantly, to determine if he or she is a good fit for Centro. Each new employee is sent to our Chicago headquarters for New Hire Orientation to not only learn about the company's mission and values, but also to be welcomed into the family. Speaking of family, Centro truly does feel like a big blended family of sorts. It's insane how much the executive team truly cares about us, and how much we care about each other. Recently, my family experienced a major tragedy, and several members of the executive team reached out to me personally to ask how I was doing. Centro went above and beyond in so many ways and I felt (and continue to feel) completely supported and cared for. 
Aside from the people, we have incredible benefits at Centro (our paid time off and maternity/paternity leave policies could not be better in my opinion), and the company is extremely dedicated to the personal and professional growth of its employees. For example, managers are frequently educated on conscious leadership principals to set them and their teams up for success. One thing I love most about Centro is our foundation in gratitude; it's common to see the words ""I appreciate you"" in an email from a colleague, and we even have a ""Raving Fan"" program that recognizes Centrons who go above and beyond their day to day job descriptions. This all creates contagious positive energy throughout our offices, which happen to be located in the best locations within each city. Humor is also a theme at Centro - we laugh together often, and we enjoy having fun with each other. For example, employees who leave the company and return after a few months or years receive Centro-branded boomerangs. It's amazing to see a relatively large company operate so succinctly, and I'm just happy to be a part of it.","I haven't noticed any cons to working at Centro. I've heard that other companies in the industry might pay higher salaries; however, I imagine those companies' cultures and benefits do not remotely compare to Centro's."

You will shed blood tears and sweat for something that doesn't matter at the end of the day. Upper management take advertising way too seriously and ruins the lives of everyone they manage. From the sales dept to the Media team, this company is truly beginning to crumble. Clients don't care about Centro's offering because they have nothing significant to offer. Oh a DSP? A little too late in the game to be competitive. The data analytics they provide to clients is so meaningless and almost every campaign fails. Every person in upper management is either a psychotic mother or an old guy who is waiting to retire to reap his 401k benefits. If you're a male not in upper management, forget about it... You won't succeed in this company. Centro is so desperate for any business (even budgets less than $10k) they can get it's pathetic. You won't learn anything either, so don't waste your time since this isn't an innovative company, it's just another media organization failing to be resilient and unique. Sales folks LOVE to bring in ideas that make no sense for the client and cause unnecessary work for everyone. Also, forget about a pay raise or promotion... you won't see that, EVER. Anyone who's been at the company for more than 3 years will tell you how impulsive their business decisions are, and it's quite sad since upper management knows this company will not be around in 5-8 years, guaranteed."

It is getting better now. Also, in comparison with other company peers, we don't have as much resources as the competition.

Job seekers: look elsewhere!,2018-06-01,2.0,Anonymous Employee,"The employees themselves are great, talented people.","Centro USED to be a great place to work, even winning awards in this particular category. However, the proof is in the pudding and over the past year or two, the culture has declined substantially to a point where it's completely unrecognizable. The last award we took home for best place to work was in 2016.

First of all, it feels like some of the female leaders at this company are setting women back 100 years. All of the progress we see in the media with women coming together is the opposite of what's happening at Centro if you report into certain women. Regardless of how hard you work, how passionate you are about helping the company do well, and how loyal you've  been as an employee, there is an immature level of cattiness  that supersedes and nothing else matters. Far too many talented people have either left Centro this year or been pushed out because of the declining culture and lack of respect towards employees, and the leadership team, CEO included, refuses to take any accountability, even when the churn rate is shockingly high. Their response when someone incredibly talented leaves? Don't let the door hit you on the way out! But on the bright side, other great companies recognize this talent and are swooping people up quickly so it's a win-win. If you're considering Centro for your next place of employment, turn around and look elsewhere. There are other companies out there that will appreciate your talent more than Centro. And just like the person in the May 2nd post mentioned, unfortunately employees have to resort to Glassdoor to voice our concerns because no one in HR or the exec team are accepting of feedback without it being used against you."

This is because a) candid feedback is only acknowledged and addressed if it is positive and b) going to your manager or HR is unfortunately ineffective. So many current employees feel trapped when it comes to voicing true concerns or simply wanting support to address a negative issue. I can tell you, I am really discouraged that every single piece of negative input is viewed as the employee’s own fault or, even more disappointingly, not a culture fit. I can assure you plenty of strong employees with a solid commitment to Centro feel their negative input gets turned on its head. It couldn’t possibly be our leadership’s fault, right? Of course not! It’s our problem to solve. That’s what we are told. Or if you don’t like it, please see the door.

Employees are expected to live and work by a code of conduct called the manifesto  (help others, be ethical, etc) which is a great thing.  The main office in Chicago is beautiful and has great perks like a yoga room.  Engineering and product teams are the strength of the company.","The company is driven by a sales first mentality with lots of LinkedIn posts, cold calls, and prospecting.   Problem is the sales staff knows a lot about ‘selling’ and very little about digital media.  The media buying and strategy teams also need work.  Campaigns are setup much the same way they were five years ago with no data and analytics.  The company has also been struggling after key account losses.  Bonuses for everyone except sales staff haven’t been paid in several quarters.  Full bonuses for everyone except sales have not been paid in a few years.   Worse the company recently had to delay its 401k match 3 months after the fiscal year ended.  

The company’s future is tied to the new Basis software which may or may not succeed."
107,Basis Technologies,Valuable Experience,2018-03-31,4.0,Anonymous Employee,"I really enjoyed my time at Centro. There were ups and downs just as you’d find at any organization but I ultimately feel very proud of the projects and teams I contributed to. I felt trusted in my role and encouraged to take chances. Expectations were high, the problems challenging, and things didn’t always work out but we worked hard to learn from our failures and build amazing products.

The people we supported through our products were incredible. Centro is full of engaged, smart, fun-loving employees who are good at what they do. Of course there are some at all levels of the org chart that don’t measure up or share the same values. At times, Centro has done a good job of making changes when necessary and other times they’ve been slower than ideal. But Centro hasn’t cornered the market on that situation. Every company has this issue because, well...people.

Centro’s culture and structure certainly evolved over time, as it should. Standing still in business isn’t an option. Market shifts, competitive changes, company growth...all necessitate change. Has it been a perfect evolution? Not always. But I appreciated the willingness to try and adapt regardless of whether management got it right every time. 

I also appreciated Centro’s willingness to put its money where its mouth is when it comes to benefits. Centro  has made great effort to invest in the benefits and perks it offers employees. Few companies support their employees like Centro does in this regard and that is no small gesture. 

For me, Centro was what I made of it. If I pitched an idea, more often than not I was given the green light to do it. I personally grew a ton at Centro and was able to progress in my career unlike many of the places I had been previously. This was in part due to the timing of my employment and Centro’s stage of growth when I joined. But it was also largely due to the great people I had the pleasure of working with/for and the amazing team I got to manage.","It’s hard to do sweeping pro and con statements that apply to everyone, thing, or situation.

Company seems focused on making sure new managers have all the training they need (a good thing), but also backwards. Why not make an effort to notice people WHO WOULD MAKE GOOD MANAGERS and proactively train them to step into those types of roles? There are so many people in management roles that are simply bad at managing ... leading to frustrated employees who have to manage up, do all the extra work for their bonehead boss, all the while getting zero of the credit. 

Total boy’s club @ the top. Especially in sales. Not a man? Good luck working your way in unless you feel like being Shawn’s latest yes man, or you’re a hot chick. 

Leadership keeps pushing a message to their employees that if we all just work a LITTLE HARDER we’ll be profitable. No mention of the fact that the company’s vision and leadership is all over the place. Trust me, people are working plenty hard ... with fewer resources, no bonuses, no raises, etc. Where is the motivation to stay? 

Nobody wins here except for execs, who have been here so long. Some of them have NO experience in the departments/teams they’re running, are completely clueless, and push work off to already overworked staff. I assume they’re still here because they’re waiting to be bought out. $$$

Some of the female executives could stand to take a sexism 101 course. 

Career growth is 100% lip service. In fact, there’s company acknowledgement that people leave due to lack of career growth - so what’s the company’s solution to the problem? Push out more messaging about how it’s so great to grow your career here, with no actual evidence of that being a fact for employees and no actual plan of attack to make that happen for employees. It’s verbal dust."
109,Basis Technologies,Best Experience -- Don't Believe the Recent Posts,2018-03-23,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"I'm not one to write reviews but given the recent negative comments by a few angry ex-employees of Centro being spewed, I feel the need to write about my experience. I left a few months ago after being there for over five years. 

Hands down, Centro is the best company I've ever worked for.

90% of what I've read in the recent posts isn't close to being accurate of what's going on at the company. It seems like a few scorned, bad apples are looking to hurt the company for reasons no one understands.  I promise if you poll the employees at Centro they will tell you it's an amazing company to work for. Leadership cares a lot about the employees and most of my best friends in life are people I met while working at Centro.

And, all of the negative discussion around Basis, Centro's newest platform is laughable. I saw the platform firsthand and also saw it implemented at the company and the first few customers. 

I've seen a lot of platforms in the advertising industry and nothing compares. Did it take them awhile to build it? Sure, but it's a massive platform -- much bigger than the leading industry DSPs. So of course it's going to take a long time and millions of dollars. 

Spoiler alert to the haters: ALL big platforms take that long and that type of investment to build. Nothing new here. And the CEO deciding to remove the CTO and lead day-to-day management of the product and engineer organization was the smartest, and most effective, move he could've made a few years ago. 

If you want to know what's really going on at Centro, just email anyone at the company and I'm sure they'd be willing to give you an honest, fair and unbiased assessment.

And I'm positive the super vast majority of them will say the same things I'm saying.","*SEE ABOVE*

The biggest cons I see are the ex-employees writing negative Glassdoor reviews and trying to cause drama and create bad publicity for a company they don't work for anymore (so silly and juvenile...what's the point?). 

I've always found something funny, and unique, about Centro. It's that when people leave the company they can never ""just leave"". There is something magnetic about the culture that, when they're not a part of it anymore, it bothers them. Never seen anything like it in my career."

- Changes in ""structure/management/product focus/etc."" is exciting in my opinion, but can understandably be confusing at times. This seems to be the norm at a lot of tech companies. Not quite a ""con"", but it's something to be aware of if change makes you uncomfortable."
112,Basis Technologies,Expected more,2018-03-16,3.0,Campaign Analyst,"-Really good health benefits
-Good PTO
-The office is really nice","-The pay. I believe it was once said at an all-hands that they didn't believe in merit increases because you should always be going above and beyond. Going above and beyond is doing your job, and therefore if you're doing your job, you shouldn't expect a merit increase.
-The bonus structure changed almost yearly, never to the benefit of anyone who wasn't upper management. Your bonus was never a direct reflection of your work, either.
-There were a lot of people who were promoted simply b/c they'd been there for a long time. Promotions should not be based on tenure.
-Managers never trained new hires, instead it was put on over-worked teammates. The overworked teammates didn't have time for it, so a lot of people were't properly trained, which then led to frustration from everyone.
-Ad-ops is extremely overworked and under-valued.
-Although they say they've got your back, upper management never does. 
-Everyone is afraid to say ""no"" to clients. There is no reason why a client with a budget of $5,000 should be getting the same service as million dollar client. I don't care how much more money that $5,000 client might have, support me when I say I can't provide them with the same service as someone who is running a much larger campaign.
-There was no head of HR for at least a  year and a half, so if you have a problem, you had no idea who to go to. 
-Work/Life balance is non-existent for ad-ops.
-You will give so much to this company and get very little in return."
113,Basis Technologies,Transitioning to Software,2018-03-14,5.0,Account Director,"The people at Centro are the best people I've ever worked with. It's a caring environment where others go out of their way to help each other. 

It's a place where you feel the CEO, and leadership team, truly cares about everyone who works here and they do the best they can to create a positive and uplifting environment.

A pro, that can also be a con, is that Centro has a big vision. It's great to have a big vision but is it possible the vision is too big? 

We just launched a brand new platform (Basis) at the end of 2017. It's a bigger platform than what our customers are used to. Early signs are promising. It has everyone feeling a lot more pumped up and excited than they've been in the past couple of years.","Over the past few months, leadership has been working on a significant reorganization to prepare the company for its next phase of hyper-growth.  It's obvious, especially reading some of the negative reviews, some people weren't bought in to the vision of the company and didn't like the reorganization. 

The biggest con at Centro is that we've come off a couple of challenging years and people haven't made the bonuses they're used to making.

In addition, we've had some people in the company with bad attitudes that shouldn't have been hired in the first place. They've been toxic to teams and offices. It's good to see management take a hard line, move them out and replace them with people in line with the company's values."
114,Basis Technologies,Candidates Be Advised,2018-03-09,1.0,Anonymous Employee,Centro does still offer unlimited PTO,The CEO and HR are pressuring current employees to submit positive reviews on Glassdoor as a means of combatting negative reviews rather than actually addressing the issues that are honestly & truthfully being raised.

Similar to other posts, there is also a healthy dose of ""boys club"" type behavior and lack of strong, female leadership which this company needs. Mostly, it isn't fun having comments made about the appearance of your coworkers and other blatant sexual remarks which, frankly, is embarrassing coming directly from leadership. Please focus on the minds of employees and what they are investing in Centro, not their looks...this is a business, not a frat house."
117,Basis Technologies,The Best Place to Work,2018-03-05,5.0,Anonymous Employee,Centro has always prided itself on culture.  Some of my greatest friends and smartest people work at Centro.  The focus on the industry and treating their clients with raving fan service is infectious.  It truly is a family and an amazing business that is trying to help clients in every aspect of digital media.,This industry is fickle and there have been turnover issues.

No processes. Politics in every group  drains your energy. Not a place where you can make a difference.

119,Basis Technologies,"Great People, Great Place",2018-03-02,4.0,Anonymous Employee,"The people are the best part of Centro.
You are actually looked at as a person and are cared about, very strong family vibe.  
Media folks are extremely knowledgeable and hardworking. 
Great benefits package, but the biggest benefits are the work life balance (which every company promises, but Centro actually keeps that promise) and the friendships made here. 
CEO and upper management actually make an effort to know the people they work with,  never had a senior level exec care know more about me than just my name, or care about workload, ask if I need help, etc. It's refreshing and uncommon in this industry.","Centro does reorganize frequently, and there are definitely growing pains, but the people who work here are strong enough to weather the changes."

121,Basis Technologies,Account Lead,2018-03-01,4.0,Account Lead,The work is challenging but exciting. Our clients love the service we provide. People are mostly positive and very collaborative. Management allows a lot of freedom to do your job the way it works best for you and for your clients. Fantastic benefits.,Some resources are stretched too thin. Too much emphasis on software when there is still high demand for managed service digital.
122,Basis Technologies,"Love Centro, Great Work-Life Balance",2018-03-01,5.0,Media Services,"I have been at Centro for 3 years now and have no intentions of leaving anytime soon. Centro has an amazing work-life balance, benefits and colleagues. Everyone is so friendly and is always willing to lend a helping hand if you are ever in a bind. If someone leaves and goes to a typical ""agency"" company they always end up reaching back out a few months later expressing how they wish they had never left in the first place!","- More emphasis on Basis vs Services
- Promotions are very difficult for deserving employees"
123,Basis Technologies,One of the best places,2018-02-28,5.0,Anonymous Employee,The career opportunities and the people are the best part about coming to Centro everyday. I have had the opportunity to work in multiple departments within the organization. If there is something you want to do here just ask and someone will help you get there-This is something I know doesn't happen so easily at other companies.,The only con for me is that I think employees here can take for granted how much this company really does offer everyone and therefore it makes everyone wanting more and creates somewhat of a toxic environment. It's a classic case of Centro almost being too nice so that when something isn't 100% perfect everyone freaks out. At the end of the day this is a business and I wish our employees remembered that-especially when they are on their 3 week sabbatical.
124,Basis Technologies,Centro is fully committed to clients and employees,2018-02-28,5.0,Director,"I like that Centro continues to be focused on client campaign performance. But also, the company places equally high value on training, which allows employees to grow personally and professionally. Most exciting, currently, is that Centro’s buying platform is now in the hands of many agencies and brands across the country... and user base is increasing rapidly. From an HR and benefits perspective, the company offers medical, dental, 401k, generous vacation, wellness programs, charitable programs, gym reimbursement, and so much more. I feel fortunate to work for Centro and truly enjoy coming to work every day. Huge props to our founder and CEO, the new sales and MSO leader(s), and the people in our office. Love the culture!","Retaining talent can be difficult. With internal training/education and people consistently working on creative campaigns, Centro employees are among the most experienced in digital media and ad tech. So they are often approached by recruiters and other companies."
125,Basis Technologies,The Best People Around,2018-02-27,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Centro is a company that focuses on the employees first. No matter how busy it gets or how fast we move, the question ""is this the best thing for the employee?"" is always asked first. It's also filled with the best people around and you'll find it hard to leave for the day without laughing or having a conversation that puts a smile on your face. People just care about each other, and you feel supported in both work and personal life while working together on challenging and interesting work.","Not sure if it's a con, but it's a challenge- preserving the culture is more difficult as we've grown, and we can't rely on headquarters or leadership to be the ones responsible for it."
126,Basis Technologies,Tech Company with Strong Culture,2018-02-27,5.0,Director,"Centro genuinely cares about their employees and has a CEO dedicated to building a culture around self-improvement, humility, honesty, accountability, and respect. Benefits are wonderful - 401k match, unlimited vacation time, health benefits and a paid three week sabbatical in your 5th year.

From an industry perspective, Centro is a well-respected technology company that is aggressively changing the way media is bought, sold and planned.","With a changing landscape, Centro has to pivot often and redefine who they are. This can sometimes cause confusion but is always aiming to set ourselves up for the future. It is a fast-changing environment that requires hard work and dedication."
127,Basis Technologies,Grateful,2018-02-27,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"As a long time employee of Centro, I am saddened by the recent reviews. Centro is a fantastic company that prides itself on putting employees first. I have never felt anything other than grateful for the opportunities I have been given here.

During my time, I have seen a lot of change. I started when the company was small. We grew rapidly. The industry grew rapidly. We were forced to adapt. I believe the leadership team evaluates each area of the company thoughtfully to ensure a successful future and I have full confidence in their abilities.

As an employee, experiencing change can difficult when we are not the ones driving it. I feel many decisions have been good, others questionable, a few terrible. When confronted with these situations, we are forced to decide: Do I ride the tide and see what happens? Do I leave gracefully? Do I throw others under the bus until my time is up? Or do I see an opportunity to make things better? I choose the latter. Most here do. The future is always hazy if we choose to ignore it.

It must also be said that I also have complete confidence in our HR/Talent & Development team. They go above and beyond to make everyone feel comfortable and address issues when they arise. They always treat me with respect and work hard to understand my concerns and resolve conflicts if necessary.

Centro also offers an excellent benefits package, competitive salary, and surrounds you with a lot of smart people. I am able to provide a good life for my family and spend time with them. I also like the people I work with. It can't get much better than that.","That said, Centro isn't perfect. There is stress. There is monotony. There can be tension and conflict. Unless you work at a unicorn and pixie dust factory, this is true for every company ever."
128,Basis Technologies,Great for someone getting into the field,2018-02-27,4.0,Anonymous Employee,Lots of learning experience and great training environment.  You are able to shadow and learn from each department. An incredible collaborative environment,Workload was overwhelming and a bit thankless. Unbalanced  work-life

Most important, Centro offers the opportunity to work with an outstanding group of individuals in a challenging and supportive environment. 

Yes, the company has gone through changes over the last 8-10 months, but we are in an industry that is constantly evolving.  I commend the leadership team for not allowing us to become irrelevant but rather, pushing the envelope to make sure we stay at the forefront of that evolution.  Change can be difficult, but if you're not willing to play a role and push for a stronger outcome, then perhaps it's time to reconsider a career in Ad Tech.",There is room for improvement when it comes to unifying communications across teams.
130,Basis Technologies,No need to look elsewhere,2018-02-25,5.0,Sales Support,"There are many perks (tons of good snacks, beverages, benefits, vacation, company sponsored yoga, and meditation).  However, the best part about Centro are the people you get to work with.  Hands down the greatest group of people who will always ""have your back"".  At the end of the day, like most who have work experience, I care that I am able to be part of something, learn, make mistakes, learn some more, add value.  Everyone has the ability to step up and work hard.  Those who do, are recognized and appreciated.  Centro encourages mental health and well-being.","As with any company there are people who are unhappy or bitter, and those people can create negative work experiences, which can be frustrating.    Lack of understanding into the development prioritization process."
131,Basis Technologies,Vision for tech product keeps changing,2018-02-21,3.0,User Experience Designer,"The people working at Centro will quickly become some of your close friends. Centro is great at hiring great people, who enjoy working hard and having fun too. The culture of honesty and fun at Centro has never really shifted since my time at the company. Unlimited vacations: people typically take around 15 days vacations days, ~14 paid holidays, and 10 sick days per year. So it isn't literally ""unlimited"", but you have some leeway. After 4 full years with Centro, you get a 3 week paid sabbatical. Maternity leave is 4 months and Paternity is 1 month. Health benefits are great too. Each year, Centro does ""Wellness Week"" where they encourage participation by everyone to do a free wellness screening (gives you 30% off health insurance premium). Meditation twice per week, if you work in the Chicago office, otherwise you have to call in. CEO and Leadership is transparent with the rest of the company about how we are doing and what they are forecasting.","Lack of vision for the future of the tech product. I don't think this is always coming from the top down, but somewhere in the middle. Tech side suffers from ""paralysis of analysis"", slow to get small changes out. Supposed to be Agile, but can't quite be because of the product they are trying to build and sell. Constantly changing strategies and priorities. Not hiring \ more people on the tech side or services side, even when people resign, so people take on more work without more pay. Very difficult to get a promotion or a raise, process takes months. I'm talking 6 months for some people, or more. It is a frustrating place to work, when the work and projects have been influx from the start."
132,Basis Technologies,Run,2018-02-14,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"Snacks, unlimited PTO, strong benefits, nice offices, fitness reimbursement","Centro is going through a massive restructure that has been mismanaged for months. There is no vision, poor communication, false-starts with continuously prolonged timelines and a mass-exodus of some of the strongest talent in the company.

In addition to internal talent attrition, there has been massive client attrition due to poor campaign performance and lacking technological sophistication. This has created an extremely tense work environment, low-morale, and a company trying desperately to be what it once was."
133,Basis Technologies,I miss the old Centro,2018-02-09,3.0,Anonymous Employee,"Centro is definitely a place where you'll be surrounded (for the most part) by great people and great talent.  Of course, you'll find those outliers who get by with minimal effort and issues with management, but you'll find that everywhere.  Overall, I have had nothing but the best review for Centro - especially a few years ago.","Centro used to be a company filled with color and light, promoting collaboration, and a ton of fun.  Recently, it's become a really tense spot with an identity crisis. They grew so fast that when they desperately held onto their startup vibe, they lost the ability to see clearly.  Now a days, you can feel the sense of urgency in the fact that they're trying to do so many things at one time it's trickling down into their employees and confusing everyone's overall direction."

Consistently voted 'Best Place to Work', it has all the bells and whistles of a proper millennial start up.","There are some silos here.  Growth is only for the hungry.

They have an extensive 2-day new hire orientation and plenty of resources to help you succeed. My manager checks in with me regularly and I appreciate the goal setting and focus on improving department structure and processes. I am not micromanaged and I feel supported by senior leadership and the HR department.,Some processes in non-revenue generating departments are still embarrassingly manual because there has been a lack of investment in systems improvement. I wonder about some employees that have been here for a while and if Centro invested enough in them to ensure they've progressed professionally at the same pace in which they've received promotions. Some departments are still reeling from prior mismanagement. Change happens so slowly and there are always multiple levels of approval and buy-ins before even minor changes can be made.

Also, with unlimited vacation you can take off as much as you want to get a jump on Hampton's traffic or whatever.","To work there as a young person, you learn a lot about digital advertising and you get exposed to almost everything across the digital landscape, so this is a great breeding ground for your career, but ultimately, Centro is the Walmart of digital advertising. Too often clients expect results, analysis, projects, or even rates that are out of scope or might take a little extra time and it becomes holy hell!  Why?  People are overworked and assume too many projects so any real strategy or thoughtful work gets eliminated.  Working at Centro is like working on an assembly line.  Repeat and move on and repeat.  Just like ground hog day.

That would be how I'd recommend someone use Centro, only in an emergency."

They have their hands in too many honey pots and it shows by the lack of focus and manpower they have provided to support (or in this case not support) their products. One of the biggest issues is their lack of self evaluation and being able to recognize where they have weaknesses and address them. You can't fix a problem if you don't recognize that there is a problem. Management turns a blind eye to many issues.

187,Basis Technologies,As Good As They Come!,2016-05-21,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Let's get one thing out of the way - no company is perfect. The difference is that with Centro, even in times where I have personally struggled, I can confidently say that I believe wholeheartedly in the leadership in our company, that they have the best interest of the company and the employees at heart, and that they are actively putting their best foot forward for all of these things. This starts with our CEO, Shawn, and trickles down throughout the organization. The open communication that our executive team offers us is like nothing I've seen before! 

Centro cares about their employees. Bottom line. There is great opportunity for career growth, if you care about the company, your coworkers, and work your butt off!","Business is always growing, and with that, we're always working to staff up. I have seen measures put into place over the last year or so to help improve the way we hire when we see business growing, and it has helped! But, there is always going to be a lag, and so sometimes we can find ourselves in a bit of an understaffed position. Part of this is just the nature of our business!"

Because Centro is positioned uniquely in the industry, there is so much to learn through the different teams and verticals in the company.","As I said, everything you read about Centro is true - including some of the cons. Like every other company on the planet, they have the occasional weak spot in their business offerings. However, in an industry where many crucial factors (work/life balance, salary, relationships with upper management) are often not prioritized, Centro is a refreshing company to work for."

Upon starting, I immediately felt welcomed by the entire Centro team and knew that they were really invested in teaching me everything that I wanted to learn over the course of my internship. I was able to gain real event experience as well as contribute behind the scenes to many other different projects.",None that I can think of.
193,Basis Technologies,Time Well Spent But Moving On,2016-04-04,4.0,Anonymous Employee,"I am extremely grateful for the opportunities I was afforded at Centro and was able to learn a great deal during my time here. Centro always made me feel welcome from the moment I stepped through the door and have to say the culture is nothing like I've experienced anywhere else--very friendly and comforting. I was able to to jump in and get involved right away with my team's clients/planning/projects, always felt like I had a helping hand in any deliverable provided and was able to feel a great deal of accomplishment overall.","The line of communication from the top down is broken and it is fairly unclear which direction Centro is headed in terms of goals and tactics within the industry. Also, in recent times, there have been some major company decisions made and personally felt like they were not rolled out to the company in an appropriate manner. Finally, the company encourages employees to ask the "" tough"" questions or bring up concerns of theirs. The responses to these seem canned, fake and employees are given the runaround."
194,Basis Technologies,Smart and Generous Leadership,2016-03-29,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"The Centro experience varies by team according to who you work with (including from a role, coworker, office location, and client standpoint). Prospective employees should understand that an employee’s experience is tailored depending on these factors. That being said, it seems that the Centro culture makes it a great place to work for a majority of employees.

Centro offers employees a great deal of upsides including: 401(k) & HSA contributions, unlimited vacation, sabbatical, gym reimbursement, and the opportunity to transfer between positions/offices when company & employee goals align. 

No company is perfect, and neither is Centro. But if you’re looking for a top place to work in the ad industry, I would recommend Centro. More than the material benefits, the intangibles (such as feeling challenged at work and believing in the company’s mission) contribute to feeling satisfied. Centro sits in a unique position within the ad tech marketplace which is constantly evolving, and the company is frequently iterating on its products and services in order to better serve the industry. Some people, including some employees, may see this as a negative because of the company’s need for continual realignment (this included changes near the end of 2015). But many others see this as a positive, because although it’s a large company, it is still highly adaptable to meeting the needs of the market on a real-time basis. It's fun to be a part of a company that you feel is contributing to something larger than yourself. The company, which is still led by the founder/CEO, has made well-informed, strategic decisions for acquisitions and areas of growth. The company does take risks to position itself as a leader, and while not all of them have led to immediate returns or without their hiccups, the leadership is humble and has been quick to take responsibility and correct course rather than fall behind the industry. Centro’s track record proves that the CEO and leadership are more focused on integrity and the long game than they are with status quo or quick gains in the short run. This fits well with employees who are intrinsically motivated and see their work as an investment into the future version of Centro.","A good review of Centro doesn’t mean that it’s an easy place to work. It’s not all downhill coasting; you must be prepared to work hard. Some employees have a sense of entitlement, perhaps partly developed because Centro is a generous place of work. As stated in its manifesto, Centro works well for those who have a sense of personal responsibility: “Each person is responsible for her/his own improvement, the improvement of those around them, and the improvement of the company.” 

Centro is a wide company with many different types of roles available, but the hierarchy isn’t always as deep. Growth most often refers to expanding your own skills, knowledge and capabilities, not necessarily by way of title and salary. It’s not the kind of company where you automatically move up into a new role or title each year."

Benefits are good: HSA, medical, dental, vision, transit pre-tax, 401k matching, PTO, gym reimbursement

Lunch once or twice a week from publisher meetings

Flexible with working from home

Fully stocked kitchen with healthy snacks","Executives laid off 30 people back in December due to budget cuts. Many long-term employees (5+ years) have also left within the first few months of 2016.

No real understanding from upper management about why the need for more headcount is so dire. Almost every level in POD structure, except for sales is understaffed, leading to unbalanced work hours. It is not out of the ordinary for some to leave for the day before 3pm while the rest of their team continues to work on their business well past 6 or 7pm.

Sales team does the least amount of work and demands the most out of their teams. 

There is a lack of understanding on digital media and Centro process on some teams, mainly from the Sales end.

Strategy is dictated by client most of the time, with minimal push back from sales due to fear of stepping on toes or losing business.

Handling hundreds of clients while trying to provide so-called ""raving fan service"" is difficult because there is not enough time. 

Client demands need to be handled better. The level of service should not be the same for a large and small account.

Lack of vision in what the company is and what it wants to become, either a tech company or managed services"

Backstabbing, people always looking out for themselves and will slander others if they need to. major Hurdle is lack of Vision, dont know if they are a managed service company or a Tech company and clients are too confused.

As an account lead, I have a base + uncapped commission based on annual goals.  My goal has been achievable every year.  Starting at Centro, the benefits include a 401K match, gym reimbursement, 3 weeks vacation, 10 ""Ferris Bueller"" days, 3 months paid maternity leave, a 3-week paid sabbatical after working with Centro for 4 years and MUCH more.  It's a work-life blend and management supports goals both personally and professionally.

The Centro culture has remained strong despite the aggressive growth we are seeing.

The 401 (k) match is very generous which is 50% up to 8% of your salary and great work/life balance. The manifesto and Shawn's vision for Centro revolves around employee development and becoming a better version of yourself. You can really tell since Centro does invest in their employees. One of the pros that gets skimmed over is education piece. Centro offers leadership training sessions amongst many others that are missing in most companies.

Earlier last year, new management was brought into the engineering department. They decided to stop all work on our main project and scrap what we had. This is the second time in as many years that all development work on this project has been halted, the app completely re-architected, and engineering yelled at because we didn't control scope creep (which is a product issue--our product team has been completely replaced three times in the last couple years). 

This new management were mostly consultants brought in to get a product out the doors. Suddenly, we had after work meetings lasting until 9pm. The entire engineering team was yelled at multiple times for questioning why development work was being completely scraped when a good portion of the code was really good, worked, and could be reused in a new product. We were often left in the dark about high level management decisions, only to be suddenly surprised that we were doing things not to management's liking. It was very confusing to be told one month that hey, we're doing things this one way, and then the next be screamed at in a meeting because we were doing things in the agreed upon way.

One of Centro's big selling points are its awesome benefits: 15 days PTO when you start, plus 10 ""Ferris Bueller"" anytime days. The purpose of these days was to use them as freebie days, for any reason, as long as your responsibilities were covered. We were told that we weren't allowed to use Ferris Bueller days as intended, and anyone who used one needed ""a good reason"". Engineering management told us that Centro's work from home policies were too lose--we have many remote workers and several people live over two hours form the office (one direction) and specifically picked Centro because of the great remote working policy. From that point onward, working from home got people targeted for ""having a bad attitude”, despite their actual attitude. 

The product Centro is building is unrealistic; it aims to be the be-all end-all of placing ads online. Larger companies have built similar products that target specific types of ads (e.g., video ads, text ads for certain platforms). This is supposed to support everything. Just hitting the main APIs for ad placement is a gigantic project, and engineering has had to rebuild this APIs multiple times since management keeps scrapping what we have.

If you're an engineer and you're looking to work at Centro, work elsewhere. The benefits are great (PTO is generous, health insurance is awesome, snacks are provide in excess), but the drama, politics and nepotism will make you hate your job, as it did for me and over 15 other engineers. Centro isn't worth it."
231,Basis Technologies,Nothing short of Amazing!,2015-02-02,5.0,Account Lead,"My favorite thing about working at Centro is the people and culture. We spend a lot of time at work so for me it is really important to be around people who love what they do, have a positive attitude and are excited to do work. Digital and technology is a challenging space but we have a great service and product, combine that with the team, it makes work life very enjoyable and fun!",We cant bring our furry friends to the office!

The culture is terrific and the company strives to ensure that culture remains intact, even at the rate at which we are growing. People are genuinely happy and that shows in the work. I can't think of a more positive and energetic work environment. The perks are very generous, from fresh fruit delivery to a wide selection of snacks and drinks. 

I'll never forget one morning on the train when I was wearing a Centro shirt and a man stopped me and asked if I worked at Centro. He works for a publisher who does business with Centro and couldn't say enough good things about Centro and the people... what a great experience it is and how HE wanted to work at Centro! I take great pride in saying that I work for Centro.",None! Centro is doing it right.

237,Basis Technologies,Your world changes when you work at Centro...,2014-12-19,5.0,Senior Director,"There are no bridges to cross working at Centro but only a clear path to opportunity, growth and happiness.  Centro's ability to combine engagement, meaning and a great work culture enables everyone to excel and grow their skill sets.","Were growing so fast in each region that office space is starting to be noticeable.  As with any company having the success that Centro is having, this issue is being addresses by Centro Leadership."
238,Basis Technologies,Truly one of the best places to work!,2014-12-17,5.0,Manager,"Centro has all the trappings of a great place to work: great people; exciting work; cool perqs. But, what really makes the company special is its values. Centro not only explicitly states that it believes that lasting success comes from individual growth and well-being (see: the Centro Manifesto) - which is cool - but, it actively lives these values every day. That is truly unique in this day and age, and the fundamental reason underlying why you should want to work here.","The biggest challenge about life at Centro is working in a fast-growing, cutting-edge environment. You need to be adaptable, quick on your feet, and be able to work in a place (and industry) where the rules are still being written. This can be exciting to some, but challenging to others."
239,Basis Technologies,Dedicated hard-working colleagues,2014-12-17,5.0,Senior Software Engineer,"The best thing are the dedicated, well educated and hard-working people. It makes such a difference to morale when you spend your days with other people who also want to grow and to share their knowledge and vision. Management have been very receptive to employees' opinions and put a lot of trust into employees.

The compensation is decent, the holiday schedule is absolutely amazing (Ferris Bueller days, Sabbaticals, generousness vacation), and the benefits are excellent (pretty much all the US benefits listed on Glassdoor have been mirrored to Canadian equivalents here in Toronto).

Somehow our CEO, Shawn Riegsecker, manages to remember the names of hundreds of employees...","The company as a whole has the philosophy that if it helps you grow as a person, that value will be put back into the company. In return, there's an expectation that you should work hard and be prepared to develop and contribute. This is not a job for the lazy or foolish."

I don't look at them as colleagues but more like family. For me fit is fundamental and I have found it! Open office concept is great to learn, collaborate and feed off each others energy. SO many benefits such as health, gym, RRSP matching, stocked kitchen, happy hours etc. Bottom line I worked for MANY companies and Centro has been the best experience thus far!","Can get really loud in the office which makes it's hard to hear on the phone.

248,Basis Technologies,Great Place To Build A Career,2014-12-15,4.0,Vice President,"Centro is one of the few places in the media industry where you can build a great career.  There used to be a lot but for a variety of reason, that's no longer the case. Centro engages employees with the assumption that they will work there a long time.
You can grow at Centro whether you are in the early, middle or late stage of your career. The main reasons are that there's a big company investment in personal growth and that you get to work with BOTH technology and service, not one or the other.
All this comes from the vision and strategy put together by the CEO, so it's a mature proven system for attracting, growing and retaining talent","There are very few daily cons about working at Centro.  There are the usual fast-growing-company issues such as scarcity of resources but these eventually get fixed and should be expected. Day to day it's a fun and engaging place to work. 
The main con is that Centro struggles making its identity clear. Many people think it's an agency but it's actually an ad tech company with a fantastic service layer. The technology is relatively weak compared to the ad tech giants and mainly used internally, so this is the source of confusion. 
When the technology is more robust and it's identity is crystal clear Centro could really take off."
249,Basis Technologies,Fantastic Culture & Strong Business Results All in One,2014-12-15,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"I have never worked at a company that offers such deep transparency in its business results to employees and operates across the board under the principle of openness. Centro has a strong culture of collaboration and the teams are smart, high energy, hard working  and focused on achieving results. There is also a deep appreciation for employees as individuals and to offer people the best opportunities possible based on performance. I like the company's focus on healthy living, work/life integration, and personal achievement.","I would like to see greater benefits for life insurance, LTD, retirement planning and family health plans. I think Centro skews its benefits to younger, single employees. 

Recruiting talent for open positions takes longer than it should because the teams are very selective on hiring candidates. I would like to see the process speed up a bit so the teams can manage the growing workload."
250,Basis Technologies,The best place to work...,2014-12-15,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"I have been with Centro for many years now and it truly is the best place to work, for many reasons!  The biggest reason for me is, it's a place that fosters personal and professional development.  Managers really care about the growth and success of their team members.  It's an organization that has a clear vision that everyone wants to get behind.  The CEO and other Execs are able to motivate and lead their teams so everyone is working towards the greater goal. The great benefits are worth mentioning as well!",No cons to mention at this time
251,Basis Technologies,Not What I Signed Up For -- Bait and Switch,2014-12-07,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"Smart and talented staff.  A lot of pair programming, and exchange of ideas.  Successful as a middleman between buyers and sellers of online advertising.","Very siloed, engineering and the business side staff rarely interacted and socialized.  The company has been trying to release software to market for years, and for a variety of reasons, that goal still seems distant.  A lot of the ""best workplace in Chicago"" attributes that made Centro so attractive as an employer have been deliberately peeled away.  Management rationalizes this by saying the staff needs to ""step it up"", so Centro can remain competitive in the marketplace.  

The most troubling aspect to me was the shift towards a top-down, almost tyrannical management style.  Employee feedback is now regarded as dissent, and people who dare to speak up are stigmatized as negative and humiliated in front of their peers.  Due to this, almost half of the engineering team has left since June.  This turnover, in no small part, has to do with new management in engineering.  

Health insurance premium for employees with a family is by far the highest I've paid in my career."
252,Basis Technologies,"Good experience, questionable longterm success",2014-11-22,3.0,Account Manager,"- Hard-working, positive people
- Strong C-level leadership with the ability to inspire 
- Generous benefits and PTO. However in my experience ""Ferris Bueller days"" could not be used as freely as others have described.","- High volume, high stress, constant churn
- Fell behind on programmatic and tried to make up for it by buying a DSP that does not perform for clients
- Has been around for over a decade with the vision of going to market with a media planning software that has still not been fully developed or rolled out (much less adopted)
- Annual raises do not exist but come only with promotions"
253,Basis Technologies,I actually enjoy going to work!,2014-09-03,4.0,Software Engineer,"One of the best places I've had the pleasure to code at. There are good benefits, including generous PTO and flexible work from home. Refreshingly, this is the only place I've been where people use their PTO as they see fit and feel no pressure to fake being sick. In addition I feel that Centro is a transparent organization that values its employees and respects their personal life. 

As an engineer Centro is an exciting place to be right now. We're working on an ambitious and sophisticated project that will change the face of the company and industry. There is good leadership, and solid development plans that are being executed with an agile approach. I feel that the current dev team is really doing software right, and there are a lot of smart people here making it happen.","On the petty side, we are running out of room in the office and snacks, drinking glasses, etc. disappear quickly. More significantly, I think we'd be better off if there was more cohesion between the different departments and offices of the organization."
254,Basis Technologies,Great company unless you are looking to develop quality software,2014-08-25,1.0,Engineering Team,Great company with great benefits.  HR people are very nice and customer support is great.,"This is the worst development job in my long career.  It is sad because the company has some great potential and some really smart engineers.  The problem is that the relatively new CTO (MR) is absolutely clueless on how to manage anything.  Yes, he is technically smart and has some good experience.  Unfortunately, that has not translated into someone that can lead a team to success or manage people.  The tech organization has been stalled for a number of years.  The CTO sat on his butt in California thinking about how smart he is and how much better California is than Chicago (where the company is headquartered).  Meanwhile a year goes by the tech team has not produced anything and the architecture is a mess.  Then the CTO points fingers at everyone else and can't understand why nothing is happening.  He hires this ""executive wannabe"" woman from a consulting company who really screws things up.  Bottom line:  If the CTO's initials are still MR, do not think about taking a development position here in spite of all of the hype."
255,Basis Technologies,"Strong Product Vision, Cares About Employees",2014-08-06,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"The best thing about Centro is the leadership, the culture and the people mixed with a strong product vision for the future of digital advertising. Leadership operates the company as transparent as possible and you can tell there is a genuine and authentic desire to do all they can to ensure employees are really happy and fulfilled. At the same time, the company has a huge product vision for the future and it expects to change how the advertising industry operates forever.

It's an incredibly exciting time to work at the company! We're hiring tons of people across all aspects from engineering, product and design to sales and media operations. The company is growing fast and I feel we have an excellent leadership team that works incredibly well together.","The biggest challenges have to do with managing the rapid growth of the company and keeping the amazing culture that Centro has worked hard to build. Building an awesome company and culture is really difficult to do in any environment but keeping it as you grow rapidly (now over 500 employees) will always represent a great challenge. That said, if any company can accomplish this, I believe Centro can do it."

The greatest thing about Centro, though, is the people.  I've never experienced another company that has such smart people who both understand what the work they do AND genuinely care so much about what they're doing.  Layering on Centro's excellent culture creates an environment where relationships are more akin to a close friendship than to simply being work peers.  It drives you to work that much harder when you know the people benefiting are working just as hard for you.","While our ""slow to hire, quick to fire"" mentality ensures that we only have the right people working here, it also means that when we're understaffed (usually due to new business, rarely to employees leaving) it takes a while to get some relief."

I'm surrounded daily by truly intelligent, kind and hard-working people.  The mood is positive and upbeat, with a cool, young vibe throughout the company.","Cons are limited, and feel kind of petty.  There are growing pains to be worked out in terms of product launches and expectations.

Being a part of a company during a growth period is a lot of fun - you get to learn a lot quickly.",Things move REALLY fast in the industry - you have to be okay with that and willing to go with the flow.
277,Basis Technologies,excellent extra curriculars,2014-04-13,3.0,Anonymous Employee,"Fun place to work.  Lots and lots of great benefits including on-site yoga and free food (not daily, just often), free booze.  Great location.  Some really great people to work with, very warm environment.  Would be an awesome first job, but at the same time could create unrealistic ideas about how employment works in most of the world.","Top management has a great vision but lacks humility.  hires middle management toadies, no dissension allowed.  This creates an environment for meteoric rise but concerned about potential for similar speed crash. Small company and as with all small companies, little opportunities for advancement."
278,Basis Technologies,Personal and Professional Development Go Hand-in-Hand,2014-04-11,5.0,,"6 of my 8 interviews with Centro mentioned the company manifesto, and I have seen examples of that document in action are seen in one form or another every day.  There is a great deal of appreciation for the work you do, and there is a serious feeling of ""we're in this together"" that exists in most meetings.  Work-life matches the attitude required of a company constantly striving to grow bigger.  Definitely, not the place you come to if you aren't willing to roll your sleeves up and get to work.",Most tech companies have an openness towards 'failing fast' - and Centro is no different.  The area where the company tends to fall short is in recognizing and truly challenging potential failure sooner - academic discussion has superseded tangible results on a few occasions where it should have been the other way.
279,Basis Technologies,Truly the best place to work,2014-04-11,5.0,Vice President,"Centro is truly the best place to work. The manifesto created by Shawn Riegsecker, and carried out each day by upper management places a tremendous emphasis on the growth, happiness and well-being of all Centro employees, vendors and customers. As it pertains to employee well-being, I am thrilled to come into work each day to work alongside the happiest and most dedicated people in terms of their work and personnel life. Working at Centro is inspiring every day and full of surprises including perks beyond anyone's imagination such as a dream program, yoga on site, leadership training, management workshops, save the world volunteer days, employee recognition (raving fans), great benefits and vacation as well as countless other perks. Centro puts its money where its mouth is by spending a lot of time and money on each of its employees. Happy employees result in significant success and true teamwork in achieving such success. As the company has grown significantly, none of this has been lost since it is a core of the company's success.",There is nothing I can say about Centro in terms of cons. Upper management is very transparent and open for suggestions through many anonymous outlets on a monthly basis. All managers have an open door policy as well. Anything that an employee may identify as a con or may improve the company is open for consideration by upper management and tends to get changed/implemented if it is in line with the Manifesto and company goals.
280,Basis Technologies,What you read about Centro is all true!,2014-04-11,5.0,Director,I have never worked for a company where teams of people come together in such a collaborative way to serve the needs of their clients.  If you're not a team player... look some where else to work.  The peeps are super smart and super funny too.  The culture is welcoming and promotes personal growth.,New to the company so no Cons to report
281,Basis Technologies,I love working for Centro,2014-04-10,5.0,Anonymous Employee,I started with Centro a year ago and love working here.  It is a great company which is growing and treats employees with respect.  I work in engineering and love my coworkers.  Everyone is smart and professional.,"Centro is growing and like any growing company has to adapt.  Overall they are doing a good job of this.  My fear which could be irrational is that they could loose some of their awesome culture as the company grows.

Another con is that they use MS Exchange and office.  Developers get Macs but they should really use Google Apps."
282,Basis Technologies,Current Employee,2014-04-10,5.0,Anonymous Employee,The benefits are great.  There is the opportunity to grow and get involved in more than just your job description.  Must be self motivated and the the entrepreneur spirit.,Nothing jumps that out at this moment.
283,Basis Technologies,"Rocket ship growth, no politics.",2014-04-10,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Tons of opportunity, amazing culture, benefits and environment. Incredibly smart and aggressive leadership team that is constantly pushing for evolution of the company's offerings and capabilities. Very flexible and generally a good work/life balance. Company tries hard to promote from within and reward great performance.","Pace is fast and demands the ability to work quickly and efficiently. For sales people, not the highest pay in the industry, but still very competitive."
284,Basis Technologies,Great place to work!,2014-04-10,5.0,Management,"Centro has a fun, dynamic culture centered on corporate values and beliefs.  Based on the growth of the company as well as the ad-tech industry, there are many opportunities for growth and career development (if not advancement).  The people actually care about each other and everyone is committed to great customer service and the culture and success of the company.  It's a happy, fun place to work with smart, dedicated people.",Career advancement opportunities are created by the growth of the company and the individual's role within the organization so may be slower for some areas within the company.
285,Basis Technologies,Best Place to Work in Digital Media,2014-04-10,5.0,Account Work,"Incredibly generous benefits
Great people
Supportive, inclusive culture
Always innovating
Company really pushes employees to grow in and out of the office

Crain's has ranked Centro the top place to work the last 4 years running. It truly is a special place.",The pace--things move very fast but that's not always a bad thing.
286,Basis Technologies,Feels like home...,2014-04-10,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Wonderful work / life balance.  Excellent employees, culture and environment.  Exposure to all facets of the digital media industry.",Not a tremendous amount of opportunity for promotion -- people tend to stick around a long time.
287,Basis Technologies,"One of a kind culture, people, leadership, and vision!",2014-03-27,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"I feel appreciated, like my work is meaningful, and am proud to be a part of a company that is changing the digital space for the better and also changing corporate culture for the better.","As with any quickly growing company, the pace is extremely fast; but I don't necessarily consider this a con!"
288,Basis Technologies,"Chaotic environment, inexperienced management team",2014-03-26,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"Nice people, good compensation, minimal equity and profit-based bonus. Nice offices. Very young team, nearly all white, high turnover. Pressure to drink heavily.","Management team is young, arrogant and has no outside experience.  Not well supervised or trained. CEO is a micro-manager and easily distracted.  Company is growing too fast with competing agendas and directions. Low awareness in the marketplace and competes with its own customers.

No diversity in the workforce. Long and convoluted hiring process."
289,Basis Technologies,Excited to come to work everyday. Great culture and environment!,2014-03-17,4.0,Anonymous Employee,"Great work environment. Positive, happy peeps pretty much all the time. Everyone is super smart and works hard. AMAZING vacation and benefits package from day one at the company. The CEO is very approachable - even to newcomers at the company. He truly appreciates and values his people!","Slow to hire, quick to let go. Healthcare benefits are just ""okay."" Not much opportunity for growth and/or advancement for newcomers. Salaries are not competitive. High turnover. Annual promotions/pay increases are rare."
290,Basis Technologies,"Has it all - Vision, Leadership, Culture, Great People",2014-03-13,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"- One of the most scaled companies in ad tech. We're not flashy though, so most people are surprised to hear we do well over $250MM in revenue. 
- We are easily one of the most capital-efficient companies in the space. Achieving impressive YOY growth and doing it profitably since inception. This can be a con, too, because our focus on profitable growth means we're prudent with expenses (not the norm in digital!)
- We're on a mission to solve a very compelling, real problem in the industry. Everyone is very aligned on what we're doing and why
- It truly is a best place to work (and not just at HQ in Chicago). The people are amazingly smart, supportive, warm and helpful. It's amazing to come to work every day and love the people you spend so much time with
- Benefits are simply amazing. 401k match, sabbaticals, yoga, meditation, gym membership, etc.

This says it all: if you watch the Crain's Best Place to Work videos done that feature the employees of all the winners, it's noticeable that everyone talks about the same stuff: free food, simple perks. And yet all the Centro folks talk about the people and the culture. We've got all the perks, but it's the people that really matter.","- Very fast-paced. If you can't handle rapid change and a dynamic environment, Centro is not for you
- Sometimes the culture can be TOO nice; I want people to be comfortable telling it like it is
- Seems like our high integrity can hurt us in this space that tends to reward (or tolerate) hype, BS and nonsense."
291,Basis Technologies,Veteran and proud of it.,2014-03-11,4.0,Anonymous Employee,"Centro provides a fantastic work environment for their employees through the leadership they have in place to guide you through your career path and the fantastic benefits they offer their employees. In addition to this, they are constantly empowering their employees to reach higher which is refreshing for someone who takes pride in their role and the impact they make on the organization.",Ever changing industry means you must be comfortable with constant change and be completely accountable for the impact of your role on the organization.
292,Basis Technologies,Great place to work!!,2014-03-07,4.0,,"For starters, Centro has some of the nicest and most interesting people I have met in the industry. From day one I was welcomed into this wonderful family. I come in every day knowing that my work is appreciated and that my opinions matter. They strive to make everyone a better worker and better person through training and wellness initiatives. Coming from an agency background, where the hours are sometimes long and tedious, It is very refreshing to work at a place where your home life is as valued as your work life. Great benefits and pay is very comparable or slightly above the industry standard. I work in a regional office so we aren't quite as large as the Chicago office, but as we grow, we have the opportunity to make our office exactly what everyone wants. All in all, I have had a great experience and look forward to seeing the company continue to grow and flourish!","The typical ""growing pains,"" that can be experienced working for a start-up. Slightly long interview process, but for a good reason. Everyone that works here is hand picked and the company wants to make sure that everyone is a perfect fit both professionally and personality-wise. Fast-paced, and Intellectually challenging. If you enjoy a job with those attributes, you will thrive here!"
293,Basis Technologies,Great place to work!,2014-03-06,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"1. CULTURE!!
2. Gratitude and respect from peers and higher management 
3. Great work/life balance",Annual raises are not granted but are based on average cost of living. Working above and beyond your current role should be repaid in an annual raise.
294,Basis Technologies,Great place for first job,2014-02-12,3.0,Anonymous Employee,"Good work-life balance, free food, good location","Poor on-boarding, salaries are not competitive, little room for growth.  Large divide between upper management and lower level employees."
295,Basis Technologies,"Great compensation and benefits, plus huge potential. But not without growing pains and some uncertainty!",2014-02-12,4.0,Anonymous Employee,"Some very smart, passionate co-workers. 
Flexible schedule and vacation. 
Ability to work from home as needed. 
Chance to have an impact on an industry. 
Work/life balance. 
Very approachable CEO. 
Great compensation and benefits, seriously.","Lots of new first-time managers in more senior positions.
Rapid growth leading to hasty hiring practices. 
Requires immense domain expertise (long ramp up period for new hires).
A considerable amount of technical debt to overcome.
Poor decisions in recent past appearing to affect an uncertain future. 
Difficulty managing expectations and delivering in a timely fashion. 
Not much individual accountability. 
A culture that seems to be evaporating, albeit slowly."
296,Basis Technologies,"Truly the 'Best Place to Work in Chicago""",2014-01-24,5.0,Human Resources,"The culture here is unrivaled. So many companies try to play up their fun-loving culture and use it to their advantage, but they are all missing the unexplained factor that Centro holds. Aside from the brilliant personalities, Centro is built on the grounds of education and development. Yes- they actually care and take action on improving your skills and fostering a culture of learning! The philosophy that success will come if you hire intelligent, capable 'peeps' and invest in them personally, spills over into every daily function of this company. 

Transparency throughout the company is also apparent. We are constantly reminded of where the company, departments, individuals are at and what direction they are headed. You really feel like you have a stake in what happens in all areas of the company.",None- Shuttle me door to door when it's cold outside?
297,Basis Technologies,Always excited to come to work,2014-01-14,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Healthy business - the top executives know how to run a profitable and financially-stable company. We're not in the ""spend at all costs to scale"" mode like many of the VC-driven tech firms in the business. We're under the same pressures but we know how to do it in a way that is right for our employees.

Employee happiness - We emphasize employee happiness. We've been voted the #1 best place to work in Chicago for three consecutive years -- and it easily can be applied to all our other major hubs. The benefits and employee programs are top notch. Bonus program is fantastic and the fact that the company has a consistently healthy business makes it even better. Paid sabbaticals in the 5th year of employment, free health screenings yearly (with discounts off health premiums just for participating), stipends for health equipment and gym memberships, the company funds health savings accounts for all employees. I can go on and on.

Great co-workers - from Day 1, I was welcomed like I was family, like I was already a lifer at the company. And it continues today. It makes it fun to go to work.

Stability - there are 40+ people taking Sabbaticals this year. That's a lot of tenure. People want to stay.","We're in an industry that rewards boastfulness, massive spending and shady tactics that we don't do. But we'll pay for it because we don't follow the industry norms.

We don't do the massive year-end parties where companies fly all employees in to one location to 'do it up.' We're not lavish in that way. We didn't raise dozens of millions in venture capital to spend so we have to be prudent and smart about how we spend our profits."
298,Basis Technologies,Outstanding people,2014-01-13,5.0,Account Executive,"The people at Centro love working here and it shows.  And it is infectious.  Working for this company makes you want to do your best, which makes for a great experience for Centro's employees and their clients.  Communication is great.  Training is great.  It is honestly a great company to work for.  This is an exciting time to be in the ad tech world and Centro is a leader in this space.",I honestly can't think of any.
299,Basis Technologies,"Great culture, great people, but stagnating in product and technology.",2013-12-17,3.0,Senior Software Engineer,"Low-key atmosphere, flexible work arrangements, and a lot of good people to work with.","Not pushed to grow technically, a lot of turnover, C level management is schizophrenic."
