14,Beat,Consider thoroughly before accepting the job offer,2022-01-16,1.0,Software Engineer,+ They have a fancy office in the center of Amsterdam.,"- They are paying the average for the market, and perks are just average.

- I know it is not their mistake that this pandemic happened, but they handled it poorly. There was no clear communication, some people got laid off, and salary cuts happened.

- There are a lot of people leaving the senior management team.

- There is a monolith written in PHP. In the interviews, it is advertised that your daily routine will have very few PHP-related tasks. But it is very opposite. So if you are not comfortable with PHP, keep that in your mind.

- The hiring bar for the newcomers was high, but it got lower every day. You can't be sure that you are going to work that coworkers, who will competent enough to improve yourself.

- In the company, some groups are looked after by directors and managers. They are free to do whatever they do, and even it is clear that it doesn't make sense. Management will cover their mistakes and won't be blamed for anything. If you make compromises and say yes to everything, you might join these groups. If you are in these groups, your life in the company will be joyful.

- Because of these groups, it is tough to introduce fitting technical solutions. Either because of their ego or poor technical skills, they will reject good ideas; since they have support, they will suppress you.

- During the promotion period, I saw that even technical promotions are done based on company politics. So they promote people that have poor technical skills to have control over people."

- No actual transparency as the SMT claims, please if you are not transparent just don’t claim that you are, its a shame.

- People leave the company for many reasons, but Beat claims its because of low performance and that they were B players. Well that is not true in all cases and it is such a pity to not care or make counter offers in order to keep the people who have invested time and experience for this company. First of all that is not a good strategy but a disrespectful attitude towards your valuable assets, not the ones who leave but more importantly to the ones who stay.

- In some departments people work on weekends, and extra hours, that shows that the daily work and management is insufficient during the normal working hours.
Especially when a company has reached a multinational scale and claims to be one of the best. Sorry not true.

- Quickly moved from a small start up size company to a mid-sized company which means that some of the processes are not perfectly streamlined yet. 

- Environment & treatment: Unbelievably toxic - People are treated with disrespect in the name of ""ruthless execution"" (actually one of the official values of the company).

- Roles/titles/seniority: roles and responsibilities are not clear. There is no consistency in titles and seniority vs experience.

- Firing Process is claimed to be due to low performance, but it has been due to personal matters by Managers and financial dificulties of the company who would not admit that fires people only because their salary is higher than others.

95,Beat,Good environment for meaningful work,2020-12-07,4.0,Product Manager,"- ""Get things done"" attitude from the majority of colleagues and management.
- Arguments, disagreements and conversations are held in an objective and data-informed way.
- ""Beat recharge day"" is a great perk and reaction to the challenges of remote and isolated work, when people started to put more hours per day than usual.
- Product and engineering teams are given the necessary space to discover problems and identify solutions for them without being forced into 1 solution and no proper explanation.",- The expectations between tech teams are not always clear. The principles we rely on when making decisions whether it is tech or product could differ between the teams. So far this situation results in unnecessary surprises in the process and extra meetings inevitably slowing us down. It could have been solved by an overarching decision-making principles in both tech and product areas.

- Cares about employees during these surreal times: currently have 1 recharge day off a month",The main constant at Beat is change and the business is very fast-paced which means being open to at times not waiting until something is perfect to be released.

Good vacation days per year.
Accountability doesn't exist in Beat, you can make many mistakes and you will be ok.
If you get fired by ""unfit culture"" you will get lots of money.
Great offices.","Lots of bureaucracy from Central aka Greece. 
Lots of focus on Amsterdam team but neglecting the rest of Latam processes and teams.
Beat is 85% reactive vs 15% active to innovate which is not great for a ""startup"" or ""agile"" oriented company.
Someone from senior management doesn't like you and they will fire you without a HR process or ""not representing the Beat culture""."

They either love you or hate you. And this hate is just because you think differently. The experience I lived there was so disheartening. The Senior Leadership Team is super junior, and although some are amazing people, others are just full of themselves, not really knowledgeable, but think they know it all. Also, the team in Athens is super junior and very tactical, and give locals teams a very hard time all the time for the dumbest things. Not sure they understand the concept of what a strategy is. 
People management is really awful and fear is the rule. Nikos (the CEO) mistrusts everyone, and focuses on people's faults, and badmouths people in a way I had never seen. 
If you are in a position that has to work day to day with Athens I would not recommend this company. If you are in a local role that really doesn't have much interaction with Athens, then it can be a great opportunity."

All ideas are heard and discussed by the leadership team, and they admire feedback when it is supported by the right rationale and data.
Everything is possible in BEAT, and it is a very fast paced environment with huge potential for growth.
When it comes to ideas, suggestions or initiatives, nothing is off the table.
Accountability is part of the culture, where anyone can hold anyone accountable for their responsibilities.
The company does hire for character and train for skills, and growth/learning is exponential, and hunger for growth is always appreciated.","Business and resources are growing at such a fast pace, in a market that is rapidly changing (ride-hailing), where you always have to be on your toes, ready for the next change/hustle/opportunity, and also where a new development can call for a quick strategy pivot, which can jeopardize consistency."

- Nice offices
- Work environment is friendly
- Good opportunity if you are just starting out in your career","The company is all over the place. 

- SMT and higher ranks have no clarity on direction and it shows on the poor execution of projects. 
- Decisions are made unilaterally. 
- They hire people with great backgrounds who are experts on their field and have them only executing projects without valuing their input or opinions. 
- If you are in a growing path or mid/senior level of your career, you will feel absolutely frustrated since there is no room for decision making, there is a lot of micromanaging. Also no clear growth or career within the company.
- They say they are fast paced but it seems like a justification for lack of leadership and planning.
- HR department is extremely inefficient.
- The overall mindset is ""It's the CEO's company so we do what he says, no questions asked"".
- CEO doesn't believe in Work From Home."

Truly international environment that goes beyond single country operations.,"Central team in Athens needs much stronger middle management, there is a great opportunity to organise work to every single individual better and communicate more effectively.

Lots of solidarity and friendship that comes from when the company was 50 people (which was not that long ago) and this is such a wrong mindset for company operating across 5 countries in Latin America. Of course not every co-founder can adapt or people hired, thus they leave and thats fine. What beat needs to do is hire very very very selectively now, every wrong hire costs a lot and company is not printing money. Lets get over solidarity and friendships. 

Ride-hailing is serious business and competition is fearless. Beat has to work on much better PR because there are so many successes surrounding Beat last 3 years."
154,Beat,So far so good,2020-05-26,5.0,Cx Agent,"- I took this opportunity as a personal challenge (I've worked in the field, but only for a period of time), and as a complement to my degree which involves english. 

- I have learned many things during this time, specially with the COVID situation. Even though changes are constant there is always a lesson, or something new to acquire at the end of the day, at least for me. I've learned to keep up with Beat's rhythm. If a person likes or is used to a fast paced environment, this may be the option.

- Highly competitive salary.",I think there could have been a better crisis approach. There was not a big time frame to consider our options.

- A mission and culture focused on the actual user, the actual consumer. 
- Execution as key principle, merging speed and quality. 
- Full empowerment and owneship, never having to limit my opinions. 
- Growth opportunities (on full meritocracy): I went from ops manager, to head of ops, to general manager in the time in the company. 
How the senior management takes care of their team and their business is an inspiration, which has made of me a better professional and a better person.",Nothing yet perceived as a Con.

157,Beat,Could have been a great place to work,2020-05-26,2.0,Production,"Great colleagues, many benefits, central offices, very interesting and multinational working experience.",The CEO is a great entrepreneur but an awful manager. This explains why all the co-founders of the company and most people from senior management have quit during the last 2 years. He does not respect people's expertise and he does not listen to any opinion that is different than his. This may work if you are a TAXI driver but not if you are the Beat's CEO.

Fun and inclusive culture - Amsterdam has a great culture in the office - lots of team get togethers for socializing. Office space is fantastic - one of the best in Amsterdam!

Industry outlook - ride hailing will have a strong outlook after the COVID 19 pandemic. People will seek safe, affordable and reliable local brands more than ever.

Office politics are getting start to become irritating. After the 1st year there you stuck in the same loop of projects leading to acquire zero new knowledge/skills in the job (depends on the department & manager but usually that is the cases). Micro management its everywhere and office politics have been cultivated. Not trust to company's culture and policies. HR is absent or deaf.

This transformation and change in growth trajectory is a unique period in any company's story. 

Builders are being supported and exposed to greater opportunities. Seeking comfort and consistency is not how one capitalizes on the experience here.","Is the senior management team a comprehensively stacked team? Not necessarily. Is there movement in the right direction? Sure. Accessible for healthy debate? Certainly. 

Need additional investment in getting the right people either trained and/or simply placed into the appropriate people management roles. Let's complement said investment with highly experienced experts to fill a relative void in middle management and senior individual contributors. This will motivate and properly engage young rising stars while allowing senior leadership to set and communicate strategy in a way that resonates and inspires.

We used to make up for tech with raw manpower. The transition in the other direction will be unsettling for some. It'll also place strain on a lean but theoretically your most valuable team, a transition that needs to be carefully managed."

What I find amazing is the Chief People Officer is reading and acknowledging the feedback from former employees. The best part is this is done to genuinely listen, learn and grow to improve the employee experience and make BEAT a truly great place to work for all our employees.

If you are looking for a company where you can make a difference working with people who are smart, hungry and humble then come and join us at BEAT.

The compensation and benefits are really great. To help you learn and grow in the BEAT fast paced environment, the company has an education allowance to support your continued growth personally and professionally.

The company also is supporting remote working to give employees flexibility and the best part if the company has tools to support remote working via zoom, google meets and using slack across the entire organisation.

I just heard that BEAT will accelerate programs and activities to further improve the employee experience + engagement which is great to hear as this shows that people are valued.","As company is growing really fast in a short period of time, the company needs to take everyone on the journey and not leave anyone behind. However, here is the thing though - the company and CEO is bringing in Senior Managers and individuals with gravitas to take the company to next level and to make BEAT a great place to work NOW and for the FUTURE."
171,Beat,Sad to see Beat turning into a hyper-toxic environment,2020-05-08,2.0,Anonymous Employee,"- Extremely talented and open-minded colleagues that inspire you grow.
- Interesting and challenging domain, you get to learn how to adapt through very pressing situations.
- Above the market standard salary and benefits - at least until COVID crisis.
- Used to embrace a culture of personal growth - giving employees the ability to master their craft.","- Extremely amateur handling of COVID crisis, not sure where to start from. 
 Senior management (or what is left out of it) fired more than 20 people, which could even be ok considering the circumstances, if they did not attribute the layoffs to underperformance (clearly not always the case)
 Many people were forced to work part-time with no ability to take the extra government support, due to the layoffs mentioned above.
Scrum masters & QA testers were practically forced out of the company with some hideous communications from SMT.
- Company (a tech company actually) runs without a CFO, CPO, CTO for like a year, with people in multiple levels resigning, as not a sane professional could stand being treated at such a toxic way from CEO and COO for a long time. COO casually insults people she considers ""B-players"", with this translating to all people that have a different opinion than her or believe we should have a stronger strategic plan than just changing our direction every 2 months.
The rest of the members of SMT show zero intention or extreme fear to face the management problems, saying constantly yes to everything. Only way to get promoted to such level is to follow this kind of behaviour."
172,Beat,Some opportunities... at a very high price,2020-05-05,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"High salaries, great office environment and equipment. Good company name to put on your CV (in Greece only... so far).","Highly stressful environment, mainly caused by the senior management team. No relationship between performance and recognition except if you get along with the CEO or the COO (works best with both of them). There is actually no serious performance assessment process in place.

No freedom of speech except if you agree with the COO who always agrees with the CEO. Serious lack of planning from the C-level team, creating a huge workload to the teams due to the constant change of plans."
173,Beat,Demotivating culture – Leadership issues,2020-05-05,2.0,Software Engineer,"Great colleagues, engineering is strong and keeps the company afloat. Very good salaries (especially for Greece). Interesting domain, direct competition with companies like Uber. Large number of users and impact.","CEO interferes and tries to micromanage everything, leaves no room for agility and bottom-up innovation. No clear priorities for product. Toxic culture values, cold focus on ""ruthless execution"". WFH policy frowned upon (at least before covid). Despite management claims for open culture and open office times, different opinions are not respected. You simply won't be asked for your opinion anymore. Too much focus on scaling number of employees, typical ""9 women can give birth to a baby in a month"" mentality. Most people who leave the company (either resign or fired) are left with a bad last impression."

Nice building and facilities. Promising sector. Support of Daimler group.,"Beat used to have a great culture and was proud about it. Senior management is unfortunately still proud of it but the culture has degraded a lot from 2019 and on. All the (once A-Players) C-Level is gone because people were forced to (or because ""they couldn't catch-up with the company's growth"") and some of the positions left  headless even twice (CPO, CMO, CFO, CTO). Instead, people that cannot meet the heavy-duty expectations are climbing the ladder of leadership, making the company even less effective and powerless. The engineering is running CTO-less for over a year now and with no viable technical guidance and roadmap. The phrase ""common sense is not so common"" totally applies here. There's only one logic, the CEO's logic. Everything has to be done his own way. Along with the COO, their micromanagement reaches another level. Censorship cases have been reported too: they monitor and ask for changes in the employees' social media activity and the ""anonymous"" replies that they post in the company's internal feedback surveys."

Things started changing not because of the coronavirus but because of people who started joining the company and taking over critical positions without embracing its culture. This culture used to be one of our greatest competitive advantages against our competitors. But not anymore! Now, we are being transformed to a bad replica of Uber but much smaller.

Nikos is a visionary leader with good intensions. Although sometimes he tends to micromanage and even over challenge his people, he cares about them and he has always been trying to build the ideal working place.  As an engineer, I can say that till a few months ago I used to feel respected and supported by the people in the HR department. People that trully cared about us, our teams’ needs and the organisation in general. Now, the new leadership of the specific department is treating us with disrespect without the minimum of the people skills needed to handle difficult situations like the one we are currently facing. All of us have realised that the covid related actions and the amateurish way they have been communicated to us are just the top of the iceberg. The worst things that lie beneath are the toxicity, the duplicity and the sense of fear that is being spread by the new Chief People Officer along with the fact that she is trying to build a state within a state. Of course there are still people (both in HR and Engineering) that I highly respect but they seem unable to confront this new status quo."

* Training budget (before covid19) that allowed you to spend it on courses, books or even training conferences","* Politics. If you don't know how to do politics, your worth will never shine out of your team. So be prepared to play the game or to keep a low profile
* Senior Management are leading this ship on the rocks. They don't listen, they don't want to hear any different opinion even if they claim they are open to feedback, even if you have reasoning when expressing something they don't agree on. From what I'm hearing, this was always the case but now it's getting obvious to all levels of employees.

Challenging tasks and ever changing priorities help you learn a lot, fast. Not the place for you if you want a 9-5 routine.","Once upon a time this company was something to believe in. Taking a closer look you see how the management team is incompetent and they seriously lack People skills. The CEO is a stubborn, arrogant person that can't accept other people's views. He holds the one and only truth about everything and he switches moods all the time. Despite the fact he frequently asks for feedback you better not disagree with him otherwise you are in trouble. The COO is even worse. Her only contribution is saying 'yes' to the CEO in a manipulative manner and taking credit for other people's work. Both of them can't accept that other people might actually be more experienced and good at their fields than them. This has led to a toxic environment that makes the best people in the company lose their motivation or leave."

There are no managers in teams, just technical people. They have no soft skills or even basic knowledge or being trained to manage people.

There is nothing more important than delivery and this has as an effect scrappy code to be produced, that needs heavy refactor every now and then.

There is no actual direction in technical path. 
This is because all senior management team has abandoned ship because of weird decisions. 

Management (basically 1 person) changes their mind constantly from agile to waterfall and then back, making circles.

Case in point: The awful way dozens of our colleagues were treated during the COVID-19 pandemic. Fired en masse on the completely false pretense of ""underperforming"", when no formal assessment had taken place in more than 18 months. These men and women had regular weekly meetings with their managers during all that time. How could so many so-called ""underperfomers"" have gone undetected for a year and a half?  Senior Management and HR were questioned on this obvious contradiction at the latest all-hands meeting and they stuck to that bogus excuse. It was hideous and heartbreaking to watch. The result: nobody believes another word that comes from top management now. Pretty ironic for a company that prides itself for its supposed transparency."

- Has adopted some good practices from much larger (and much better organized) companies of Silicon Valley and Europe. (Sadly the adoption is often nominal)

- Provides relatively good pay and benefits","- Narcissistic, hypocritical and wholly incompetent leadership that is incapable of leading a small company, let alone a medium sized one, like Beat. They should've been sent packing a long time ago along with all of their directs that tolerate, and by extension reproduce and validate, their abusive, toxic behavior.

 - Complete lack of focus and strategy, with the company burning money fast in an attempt to grow extremely fast and become the dominant part of the FREENOW group it belongs to, without any understanding of the market, how to run a business, or how to build healthy companies.

 - Lots of Politics and disrespectful, borderline abusive behavior from Senior management towards the very people that actually do the work giving rise to:

Toxic culture, command and control management, people with fuzzy track record holding positions of top responsibility. Some in upper management were lacking adequate English language skills to even practice baseline effective communication.

No publicly known intellectual property differentiating/protecting the product from comp (capital-driven market, not a true tech company). To the best of public knowledge available, nothing ""invented here"". Follower vision (they just use publicly available technology as a delivery channel). Fear-based management culture kills any attempts for inventiveness.

Hard to be inspired by upper management or feel creative, more so in drawing inspiration off work (pretty bad work-life balance)."

It taught me not to be afraid of making mistakes, not to be afraid or shy to share my thoughts and feedback. I feel part of a team and not just as an employee that comes in to an office day in and day out. In Beat everything changes every day and it is amazing to grow and evolve and not being stuck in the same methods and mind sets but to move forward with the technology. I am really lucky to be surrounded by top players and great minds and call them my friends.",Anything that might have slipped away we always find a solution straight away so i do not really feel that there are any cons.
