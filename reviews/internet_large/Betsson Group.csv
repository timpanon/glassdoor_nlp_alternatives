2,Betsson Group,One if the best place to work and grow,2022-03-29,4.0,Product Manager,Enough opportunity to learn and grow.,Too early for me to say something
3,Betsson Group,Too big to function properly,2022-03-29,2.0,Marketing,"Recognizable company in the industry, having worked at Betsson Group for a while can be a good experience to further your career

The company has many offices across the world and you get to meet a lot of new people and make new connections","One of the company values is ""One Betsson"", but in reality it couldn't be further from the truth. The company is very fragmented and as soon as you need to involve another department in any task, no matter how simple, it can take months. Especially when working with external partners this can be very frustrating. Different regional teams get very territorial and will withhold information from other teams on purpose. There is no sense of working together towards one goal as a company, different departments are competing with one another.

A lot of questionable hiring and promotion practices, oftentimes someone gets promoted just because they are friends with the hiring manager or one of the higher level managers/directors. I've encountered managers that had very little experience in the respective field and couldn't even answer basic questions that a junior level employee in my field should know. 

There are many cliques in the company, which can make integrating in a team very difficult. The upper management feels like a boys club that make decisions between themselves, without involving knowledgeable employees in any decision making process. Multiple times I witnessed very high level employees making agreements with external partners disregarding any processes, just because they are friends with the owner or CEO of the external partner company. Most of the time these agreements didn't make commercial sense and weren't budgeted for properly."

Nice, young and dynamic team, the majority are good developers and good people - really, these kids can change the world if the want to!
Up-to date software stach and hardware, tehcnology used is current.
Some perks offered, like breakfast mondays, home office, playstation... not as many as it used to be in the beginning.
Some opportunity to travel (especially to Malta to visit the main HQ, who in inclined...)
Work life balance - or the sorts - is ok, what you negotiate is what you get, you can work from if you want.","Now, the politics in Malta is killing the whole show.
Budapest management used to be good in the beginning, especially when the swedes were in charge.
Not any more, since the swedes left and after the ""restructuring"" (Aka. money cuts). They left the good managers to go away, or sacked them, positioning junior incompetent bootlikers to ""manage"" the teams. Most of these guys have unbearable attitudes towards new hires and towards more seinor devs too, who are smartedand suck it in instead, and leave the fools to run their show...
Office space got very crammed and tights due to the large number of new hires, toilet issues, AC issues, IT issues... seems like the posh designer were not prepared that this would be a workplace, not a showroom.
Perks are getting less and less, talented people are looking elsewhere, office management is neutral and ingorant, IT constantly changing for no reason...
Company became a just your avereage threadmill dev show, with average to poor rating, inclding the contractors from a bigger company just around the corner... (not to even mention their side)."

Yes it is true, but good luck getting anybody on board with your plans because your coworkers and management won't back you, they either don't care or are too scared of Malta to make drastic changes. Many have started and left in frustration because of this.

Management has no idea what its developers are doing so you can get away with a lot","Bad culture that unskilled HR has been desperate to fix by hiring new people because they are so out of touch with a modern workplace and what makes people happy. Colleagues are very nice but unless you fall in the right couple of groups then you won't make friends here or have much after work fun, just do your job and go home. People are afraid too speak up or they are too new to understand.

You will work with recent technologies but will never grow and you will be stuck in a few years not having kept up. Malta makes all the big decisions and Stockholm is too afraid to go its own way.

Management does not communicate well so nobody trusts them. When people ask tough questions at all-hands meetings the management avoids to answer them.

Nobody really knows what they are doing at Betsson so if you know how to talk your way through then you will go far but you will be very alone. Most people leave after a year and HR lies about the facts because they are scared to lose their jobs."

Lots of people were left with double/triple roles and still get paid for one which it was ridiculous.
Friday drinks were empty not how it used to be and clearly from HR responses in this site, they show that they don't have a clue what is going on between the employees.

Recently Company Directors, MD, Gaming/Casino Managers, HR team left and these were only few I could name. It's enough to check on Betsson jobs to have an idea how many roles are available and you don't see all these opportunities in any other Gaming companies in Malta, so that say enough.

Shame as it was a good company to work for, unfortunately not anymore and never will. Jesper still the one to trust

Some of the heads in the company are untouchable, most of them have close relatives working with them in high positions and get away with everything. I've seen personally people being abused verbally and their acts swept away under the carpet.

There is no current vision about what comes next, the OM seem to have no idea what technology actually is, speaking like politicians to divert questions and then throwing in buzzwords to sound like they are aware of technology (in my opinion). 

Current managers are mostly in their positions because of their predecessors quit/were fired. Which means you have inexperienced people trying to attempt a job they are not able to do. This leads to a mess where no one really knows / cares what is going on.

I feel there is no respect for the employee and no loyalty either, no learning opportunities (conferences etc) and as it is a mess from the senior management downwards, I cant see this getting solved any time soon and the amount of people leaving reflect this."

I would be lying if I did.,"The HR team are the most amateurish collection of incompetents I have encountered in any company. They exhibit every quality which is the antithesis of good HR practice and this is led from the very top down. Employee engagement and retention have been at crisis levels for some time  and the solution is to produce newsletters; after all why would anyone leave a company if they produce great newsletters? Nothing is being done to address the crucial problems and the main reasons why people leave i.e.  incompetent and under-qualified management, a totally toxic bullying culture where ostracism is considered acceptable behaviour and lack of support and resources are commonplace. 
In the recent 'reduction' of staff, it was noticeable that only the young, naive and incapable were retained whilst the older more experienced employees were discarded in a most unedifying unprofessional manner.  However they were the ones who were questioning the direction of the business and questioning or challenging any management decision is not allowed; only obedient minions need apply.
This is a truly awful company filled with selfish narcissistic ego-trippers who  back-stab each other daily in order to survive. They spend a large amount of their time posting back-slapping tributes to themselves on Linked in and Facebook when their time could be spent a lot more productively in learning how to be at least semi-decent human beings.    
I have never encountered a more disengaged bunch of employees who always appear visibly relieved when they exit the premises as early as possible each day."

Communication (throughout: across members of the same team, across departments, and even across different sites & offices) is lacking.
Within the Tech space, I believe we lack a lot of documentation. This sometimes makes it incredibly difficult for people or teams to take ownership over existing solutions.

I met some very nice people who turned into some of my best friends on the island.","When I started at Betsson I was naïve and full of enthusiasm. I was warned about Betsson by a few friends in other iGaming companies, everyone on the island seemed to know someone (who knew someone) who had had a bad experience at Betsson. I chose not to believe them and thought it would be different with me. So I arrived at Betsson all blue-eyed, ready to make a difference. 

I received no initial training in my new position and was left to make it out on my own (like so many others). For weeks I did close to nothing and was shocked about how little anybody cared. As long as I compiled a few reports, made sure to put in facts that made the department look good and leave out the ones that didn’t I was okay. 

I still wanted to make a difference, to actually do the work I was hired to do. I finally got my hands on my predecessor's files and again was shocked at how little they seemed to have done. I made big plans to be better and to show everyone. I spend days and days making plans and orders but when it finally came down to doing the work… It was undoable. The company website is so awful and old fashioned that do change one tiny detail can take you days, not forgetting that a company as big as Betsson works slow, there are dozens of hoops and people you have to go through and there is a backlog of around 7-9 months to get anything done. You open a ticket and you wait, wait and wait. By the time something finally happens either your goals have changed, you’ve been pushed into another position within the company or you’ve changed companies as you realised that staying at Betsson makes you cynical and sucks the life and the love for your work out of you. You also then realise why your predecessor did/didn't do something and most importantly, why exactly they left the company and why you should do so too.

Colleagues who started after me, who came to me all blue-eyed and ready to make a difference (like I was when I started), were shocked when no one in our department knew everything and that no one seemed to care anymore either. They were annoyed about how unenthusiastic everyone was about sharing  skills and knowledge. I told them about how things work at Betsson when it comes to training and getting things done and they told me that it shouldn't make a difference that I hadn't received any help when I had started, I should do my utmost to make sure that people who came after me would have it different so that those people and the company could thrive. I told them just to wait six months and tell me if they still felt the same way. Guess if they do…"
208,Betsson Group,I wouldn't bother.,2018-04-02,2.0,Senior Social Media Manager,"You meet a few nice people; some inspire you in terms of experience, some make it a fun and enjoyable ride.","A sentence to sum up Betsson Group: disorganised, ignorant and not far from a circus. 

My time at Betsson was before the famous cull of 160 persons, meaning I did not witness this event, and actually worked with a lot of persons who were unfortunatelly fired. At this time, there were a lot of high level managers 'working' in positions they seemed to not even understand - people in Global Brand Management roles that didn't lack basic marketing skills, which speaks volumes about their output, along with the HR and Recruitment processes. And another fundamental skillset that seemed to be missing from a lot of these roles: actual management skills - which became totally frustrating since there seemed to be no firm support from said leaders. Their presence became a joke and it was tiresome explaining basic marketing principles and specific terminology to certain teams. 

Additionally to this, there were other persons placed in roles that they did not seem to understand or have any actual experience in, which ended up being especially apparent in market positions that it seems difficult to hire for (Finland and Norway, as two examples). Being especially apparently in SEO and Brand Management. So when collaborating on projects with some members, it felt like you were injecting ideas for their responsibilities. 

Besides the people, the office is actually getting rather shabby and the perks were not exactly inspiring. Free beer and parties are of course nice to have, but it would be a lot more interesting if salaries were actually competitive to the other brands, or if the promised training budgets were actually allocated - I went on one course in almost two years, which is pitifull to say the least."

Management are inexperienced and  incompetent. The company culture is based on bullying and finger-pointing, with no-one willing to accept responsibility. Nepotism is rife, particularly if you're Swedish, in a relationship or friends with a senior manager. Incompetence is seemingly rewarded with promotion. Cultural fit (ie being a bully) is seen as more important than the ability to do your job. Turnover of staff is huge (around 50%) so your colleagues are constantly changing and you are forever in a state of flux. Management say this is quite normal in i-gaming, but it's not. The majority of employees are unhappy and are looking to leave. HR are awful - employees are constantly being managed out and their treatment of employees who were made redundant earlier this year bordered on criminal."

Want to work for a different department or in a different role, or get a raise? Better change companies.  HR spends most of their time attracting candidates from outside the company, so people already in the company and especially internal applicants get mostly neglect. 

Betsson is filled with silos. Top-level managers come and go in rapid succession in an attempt to fix this. They all fail, because departmental managers are reluctant to address bad practices in their teams - why would they, they've hired their best mates after all.

Failures are covered up. Some people go for years without contributing much, while the conscientous and ambitious ones tire themselves out and eventually leave the company, since they can't ever be promoted past their manager, who gets the credit for their teams' work.  As I said, departmental culture varies a lot:  If you're unlucky, you get a 20-year old manager or team leader with no training or experience, who was promoted from his entry-level job when the old manager quit."

- Middle management caught helpless between frustrated team members and totally disconnected managers that only focus on their personal bonuses

- Managing directors are holy. Bad management? Someone from their team is getting the blame and you see them paying the price

- ""Yes"", is the only answer you should say to your managing director, otherwise you're blacklisted. 

- Egos and political agendas: be prepared for an ocean of personal agendas where you see data validated projects thrown out of the window, excellent employees running out of the nearest exist

- Benefits are ordinary, do not trust what it says on the tin. They cover up the cultural problems instead of admitting, accepting, changing. 

- As with some listed companies, it's what the shareholders want not what the market needs"

And that's a real big plus if you want to learn and grow as a person.,"- Some of the senior management are just too arrogant and disrespectful towards employees and they are unbearable to work with. 

- Too many bureaucratic layers and it takes ages to get things done, so you don't feel that you are accomplishing something.

- Company strategy is based on brand acquisitions, so you will be jumping from one migration project to another. This becomes very repetitive and boring after a while, without much exposure to interesting and challenging stuff."

248,Betsson Group,A company that let's you realize your full potential,2017-07-18,5.0,Technology,"First and foremost, what has inspired me was that the company allowed me to take on responsibility and fix things that I saw needed fixing, and then rewarded me with increased responsibility and compensation at a very rapid pace.  If you like being hand held and governed by a lot of process, this is not the place for you.  However, if you have a hunger to learn and have a strong motivation to get things done, Betsson has the culture to provide you all the rope needed and raw material to make amazing things happen.  What you need to be is self driven and show motivation  It is super rewarding seeing all the things I helped to deliver over the years alongside amazing team-mates.

Also, the people I work with on a daily basis are really really sharp technical gurus implementing cutting edge messaging and storage technologies.  Working in tech, its like a candy store for a techy!

Having multiple offices all over Europe, Betsson has allowed me to experience many different cultures, and has provided a great learning experience working with remote teams.

Awesome benefits including internal and external training programs, career planning, yearly exercise stipend, and even a discount card for many places around Malta .  Not to mention the amazing summer and winter parties you get to go to...","Company has grown quite quickly so many areas lack processes.  Also Betsson is not able to find top talent fast enough to keep up with its growth, so sometimes the work load seems overwhelming.  However, I found that I just need to prioritize what adds the most value and do it first."
249,Betsson Group,Excellent company to work for,2017-07-03,5.0,Senior Recruiter,"Cutting edge technology, great staff, excellent working conditions. Great social events, a good budget for team building activities.

Any time I've needed something - I've got it immediately. Need bigger monitors, a top specced laptop, whatever - it's done.

I've worked for a number of companies, from start-ups to multinationals, and this is one of the best I've worked for. Swedish culture makes for an excellent working environment. My work-life balance is great. When I'm there - I work my butt off... which is how it should be. If I need time off - I've not once had a problem with it. It's more than fair.

I've met some amazingly talented people here, and others that just didn't work out for whatever reason - it's not going to work for everyone.

I have an amazing team, a boss who I consider a friend and is a great person, and I appreciate working with such a great team and company.","No difference to every other company.

Many of the other reviewers here are painting an unrealistic picture. Just like life in general, Betsson rewards those who put in. Remarks about HR and recruitment are ridiculous. If you come to a company and expect that you just turn up and your company gifts you promotions and pay rises, you are being unrealistic. Life has ups and downs. If your department is short staffed, in any company, then there is a period where you will have to work harder. Betsson is no different. It isn't a forever situation. If you don't like your boss or don't agree with something - speak up, don't come and sook like a child on Glassdoor."

- All nice statements, but the reality is very different.

Capabilities generally not good enough - tend to hire inexperienced people on low salaries rather than people who can genuinely drive the business. As a result, business is flabby and inefficient. Few inspiring people. 

Woeful lack of product innovation. Sharper, leaner new entrants are beginning to eat Betsson's lunch. Dependent on throwing bonuses at customers to get them to stick with an inferior product/experience.  

Employee Churn rate 40-50% hints at big, unaddressed cultural problems. But is glossed over.

Share price tanked and flatlining - seemingly no answers apart from buying 2nd-rate operators. Not at all clear where growth is coming from next."

- non-managerial staff are very friendly","- turnover in staff is enormous which makes it impossible to build knowledge in the teams
- HR has too much power, they decide on your starting salary although they have no experience in judging it, and that starting salary is then the basis for your salary for the rest of your career in Betsson. If you outperform in your job, you will not be rewarded for it, no matter how much you beat your targets.
- very uncompetitive salaries compared to other companies in same sector 
- very unfair treatment, where you might be expected to train people paid much more than you, just because they joined when the right HR person hired them
- no career growth, in fact they prefer to hire managers from outside rather than promote from within
- not possible to work from home
- unnecessary levels of management who need constant reports, but who do nothing with the information
- not agile and takes forever to get things done

If you have great ideas and solutions to problems don't expect to be able to implement them until it's too late and management panics and makes your ideas their own. They will probably also give you a hard time about not acting on the situation earlier (which you have tried several times).
