They never had enough agents to provide coverage, and they've since laid off many of those agents. To take even a single day off, you have to find another agent who agrees to cover for you (essentially working two jobs) with no compensation for doing so. And more importantly, there are rumors that the company will be eliminating the whole real estate division this week. So this post may be entirely unnecessary in a few days."

Lunch stipend is nice but honestly if they paid their workers what they deserve I wouldn’t care about a work stipend.","Corruption. In particular, the CEO is involved with a plethora of lawsuits. The other C Suite members are just as bad, trust me. 

The recruiters will suck you in - do not believe the positive reviews, there is NO CULTURE anymore. I quit because it has become unbearable since the layoffs. Management is micro managing the heck outta us, bonuses are GONE & everyone is walking on egg shells. 

The pay - if you have experience in sales, go somewhere else. Seriously, it’s not worth it to make 40-50k salary because you won’t hit bonus. If you are a Home Advisor you’ll be doing the work of 5-6 people for 60k lmao it’s a joke. 

So many people have quit, they’ve lost so many top performers and senior level employees it’s actually crazy. A ton of us on sales also quit. If you’re looking to join Better do a quick LinkedIn search & you’ll see how many have quit (search Better.com resign, resignation, quit, etc) 

There is no volume anymore. Better is seen as a complete joke to customers & it won’t look good on a resume before too long. When interviewing, I was asked many times why I didn’t immediately quit after the layoffs. I can’t imagine how it’ll be for the people who stay there 6months+ 


Oh & also - in order for this company to go public (which it DESPERATELY needs to survive) it’s contingent on Vishals lawsuits that are still pending…. lmfao 

All I’m all, don’t believe these positive reviews - everyone hates it. They were asking us to leave good reviews since it went from 4.5+ stars to crap after the layoffs.

Basically, they give you dollar store tools and expect you to build a house with them, and when you can’t, they blame you rather than suspect the tools may have something to do with it."

Now the video has gone viral, and we have a CEO accusing us of only working 2 hours a day making it more difficult for us to find a job. You want to know the reality? They overhired, and they offshored a ton of files drying up the volume for US employees . We didn't have enough work to do. As a matter of fact there was such little work, they literally told us we could not re-enter the queue more than once before 1 pm to allow everyone to get a file. And if you did, you were on the naughty list. I would sit and refresh waiting for new work to come up. It would take 4-5 hours before your next deal would come. They set us up for failure prohibiting us from taking on more work to allow everybody to get a fair amount. It is crazy unfair that the CEO has undermined us as I think a lot of employees are actually scared to speak up for fear this CEO will actually come after them. He is very intimidating.

727,Better.com,Toxic culture,2021-12-06,1.0,Loan Consultant,"Compensation has the ability to be competitive based on monthly production, however targets are often unattainable and/or changed regularly without any explanation","This company does not care about the individuals who work there at all - you are simply a number to them. The company is desperately trying to define who they are just ahead of going public and failing miserably. 

There have been several huge re-orgs where individuals’ entire roles and responsibilities are changed that are causing the company to implode. The most recent example is forcing anyone who worked in operations who had their NMLS license into a sales role. They took individuals who were too performers in the operations field who were thriving and forced them into a sales role that did not align with their skill set or career path. Employees were told to give the new role 30 days then they could request a transfer to their previous position. This of course turned out to be a bait-and-switch. The company said later that anyone who wanted to move would have to have an open role listed internally (the same role they were forced out of), then they would have to apply and interview for said role. No roles were posted and hundreds of unhappy employees were forced to remain in roles that they do not like and which don’t align with their skills. 

The CEO ruthlessly laid off 900+ people just before Christmas 2021 in a short 5 minute zoom meeting. Within 5 minutes everyone was forcefully logged off their laptops and stated they will receive an email from HR with further details. The CEO was cold and ruthless in this decision. Many of the people who were laid off were the ones who were forced into new roles in September 2021, many of which received merit increases and a promotion during that time. The CEO (Vishal Garg) regularly acts erratic during all-hands meetings and has a history of berating current and former colleagues.

Even before this ruthless layoff, everyone on my team was either wildly unhappy, applying to jobs outside of Better or both. The senior management and HR show zero empathy to employees and only lookout for the bottom line.

They hired a massive amount of individuals, trained them, worked them hard to originate, process, and underwrite applications and then dumped them as soon as rates started to rise. Leadership stated that the layoffs were based off of production, but that is simply untrue. Many of the individuals laid off were top producers. Unfortunately, with this company, there is simply no job security. The people that survived the layoffs are being threatened, with management stating that if the employees mess up, they will be terminated. There is no room for error, nor correction. The result is a company culture based on fear and intimidation.

I would think carefully before onboarding with this company. The pay is better than similar roles but the company itself is going through a transition to IPO, and they have proven that is their sole focus."

The people you work with really are some of the best talent in the industry.","So you came here, because you may have received an offer letter to work for Better, or because you wanted to see what the reviews are like based on the recent headlines regarding Better laying off 15% of its workforce. let me give you an honest opinion.
The leadership at Better is horrendous. The CEO is highly volatile with a well documented history of highly questionable business practices, preferential treatment and intimidation tactics in the workplace. A quick search on Google will confirm it. You never know how a company Zoom call will go based on his mood that day. His communication style is brash, in your face approach where cursing during the meeting is part of his style. 

Many of you have probably heard about the very recent layoff of around 15% of the workforce, later clarified by the CFO to be actually 9% of the workforce... There are many articles floating online, recording of the Zoom meeting where the CEO said it was partly due to performance, productivity. That is not true. A lot of the people that were let go were in fact high producers within the company. And for those who were let go that were not in a production role, you wonder what metrics were used to measure those people. This is purely a business decision to cut workforce to satisfy the investors prior to their IPO. The way they selected who got cut really was like a lottery draw it seems.
If you think that you will be safe because you are new, and will weather the storm, think again. There were many people that were impacted by the layoff that were just hired less than 3 months ago. No one is safe.

The problem with Better is that they are a refi heavy shop. Let's be honest, that's what they are. They are trying to increase the market share of the purchase business, but is struggling to bring in enough purchase business. During the refi boom of 2020 and first half of 2021, the company was able to increase their market share by offering rates lower than their competitors and not charge a lender or commission fee. So each loan they funded was either putting them in the red or near break even. They do this because they want to make a name within the market even though the loans were not profitable. 
The company simply hired way too many people during 2020 and 2021. With the decrease in refi apps coming in, there simply was not enough work to go around. You have sometimes 200 plus underwriters in the queue waiting up to 5 hours for one deal. So whatever they promised you in terms of the monthly incentives that you can make is just pipe dreams. 

I would think very hard before joining this company. Their sole focus right now is going IPO and doing whatever it takes to do so. If/once they do go public, i have a feeling that the top executives will cash in their stock options and sell the company. Classic pump and dump. You can probably figure out what that means for your job security. This is just a first round of many more rounds of layoffs to come. We in fact may actually be the lucky ones."

These individuals were given no heads up, called into a meeting, terminated, and then their workstations automatically shut off since most are working remote. Although it was claimed to be based on ""performance concerns"", many of these individuals were senior employees that likely did not have poor performance. It was a bloodbath of a layoff which was likely to strengthen their balance sheet with their plan to go public.

Culture: Culture of the company is shocking. I have never seen so many unprofessional people in one place. Everyone is very defensive and no one takes any kind of accountability for their work. The best part is they also try to blame others to make them selves look good. Long hours of work and they have made it impossible to take PTO (FYI we have unlimited PTO so don’t fall for it). Restructures every month.

Management: clueless individuals that have no idea how to manage nor how to be just humans. I have never felt like more of a number at any company before. (I have been sales my whole life so I would know). I constantly finished top 3 on my team and never heard a simple “good job”. Not once the management team has brought up career growth or even an option of promotion. So don’t plan on moving up the hierarchy.

- average base salary compared to market plus monthly commission based on how many loans you can fund
- company genuinely cares about improving the way people apply for mortgages and offers very competitive rates to customers
- supportive teammates and manager (this is case by case)","It has been exactly a year since I started at Better, when I first got hired I was AMAZED at the work benefits, compensation, company culture, etc. However as the months went on I started noticing several pretty severe issues the company was having that was directly affecting the employees. I understand that Better is a fairly new mortgage company and is constantly trying to adapt and grow, HOWEVER the amount of changes that have happened in the 1 year I have been here were insane to say the least. I started off as a processing expert, then was selected to be part of the SPOC program, and then later my job title was changed to End2End coordinator. I had no say in any of this, upper management did a company-wide restructure in August and I ended up having to switch teams and was pretty much put in a new role and had to pick up a whole bunch of difference responsibilities. I started off on a refi only processing team, then had to learn purchases, FHA, AND Closing on top of having my pipeline increased to over 150 loans. Yes, 150 loans. This was the period in August and September when rates were dropping and the applications were pouring in. While this is good for the company, unfortunately for all the employees this meant absolutely 0 work life balance. I was working 9am to 11pm pretty much every day in August just trying to stay on top of my triple digit pipeline, and all upper management had to say was that they understood it's been hard and they are appreciative of our hard work. Luckily it has kind of cooled down now and our pipelines are much more manageable, but the way upper management handled everything during that agonizing period just seemed to show that they think of their employees as no more than numbers. Our incentive pay structure has changed 4 times since I've been here, there seems to be no stability in incentive pay at all. Luckily we get paid a decent base salary as a processor, but they seem to think that's an excuse for being able to alter our monthly incentive pay structure whenever they feel like it. I still plan on staying here (and praying that things get better), but I am definitely very wary of the future."
821,Better.com,A LOT of changes,2021-11-03,4.0,Sales Develooment Associate,"Remote positions, lunch stipend, cool colleagues",They have changed my position and metrics about 3-4 times since i got hired in April. Some positions require passing the NMLS exam which can really stress you out especially if you are a parent and try to have a work life balance. Recognition is solely based on metrics and certain managers will pressure the hell out of you about them simply because they make money when we do. This company is slowly becoming just another large corporate entity as a pose to the employee centric company it once was.
822,Better.com,Would Not Recommend.,2021-11-03,2.0,Sales Development Associate,"$55K pay for an entry-level position + great benefits (medical, vision, dental, repro health, parent leave, mental health resources).","The CEO and higher ups are not motivating to work under. They are very out of touch, many in the C Suite have little to no experience in what they're doing, the CEO is obnoxious and narcissistic.
We went from being Customer Experience Associates to Sales Development Associates. What we do is NOT sales. Sometimes, we offer customer support and help people fill out an application (still not sales), but most of the time, we're glorified receptionists in an extremely metrics-driven call center environment. 
What was told to me about the job during the interview process is not true. OT pay was removed after I got hired. Everyone has to take this national mortgage licensing test that has a 76% pass rate, and if you don't pass it within three tries, you basically don't have a job anymore. The expectation is that the test is extremely hard so employees will use time outside of work to study for it. Most of the knowledge from this test is not applicable to the job AT ALL. We simply have to do it bc the company is going public and they want to cover themselves by having everyone licensed as mortgage loan originators. Even though most people here do NOT have a job that originates loans. It's exhausting.
Our pay structure completely changed, and now many people make most of their money by working incredibly hard for a bonus since their base pay decreased. 
They treat everyone like a number, they do not care about us. They are going public and they are trying to generate max profit, that's it. Their employees are suffering and leaving in droves, and the company is continuing to get worse, not Better. 
I also would NOT recommend getting a mortgage from here. It is way too disorganized, and though we do offer lower rates, the process to get there is a mess. The loan team is overworked, short staffed, and the borrowers get the short end of the stick because of it. 
You can go to a tech company with better pay, similar benefits, and less stressful work. No reason to work here."

This place is absolutely toxic. The targets are unachievable, and it would be close to impossible to earn a bonus unless you work yourself to death. They advertise no commission to customers, but loan officers are pressured to fund nearly 20 loans a month to earn a very small bonus. You work so hard. Extra hours. Extra days, for so little. The comp plan is a total joke for the output they expect. The industry standard is generally funding around 7 loans. Better thinks you’re going to fund more than twice that or no bonus for you. No commission either. 

The company is full of very inexperienced leadership that know nothing about mortgage, cliques, a PLETHORA of meetings, inexperienced people in all roles, and the most unsupportive environment you can imagine. Everyone is fake happy. The all hands meetings don’t address real problems and celebrate only specific people. The operations of this company is purely broken in more ways than one. Between zoom meetings, slacks and emails, you will never get a thing done. Most new people come on board and are sensory overwhelmed with the insane number of slack channels and meetings they have to attend. Every single person at this company is new. 

Quite honestly this place is not what you think it will be. If you’re an experienced sales person, you will hate it here. This place thrives on people that have no sales experience of any kind because they’ll let it slide. Loan officers are set up to fail in the worst way, and leadership is shocked when you recommend feedback or change. They don’t implement anything that is recommended. 

I would stay far away and consider applying somewhere else for the sake of your own mental health."

For someone who is new to the mortgage industry, my experience was far from supportive and you're lucky if you meet a group of people who are willing to help you get up to speed with your role. 
In my four months of employment here, our team had 3 manager shifts and they all micromanaged us. The stress of getting acclimated to a new role was taking a toll mentally and physically on many team members. 
Let me put it into perspective:
If your manager comes to you and tells you ""Hey, your numbers have been low this month, if you don't pick it up, I can't promise what your future will look like.""
How inspired do you think that employee will feel the next day? 
How about practicing empathy.

- The interface you work out of is relatively better than most older direct lenders as a lot of traditional processes are automated (although buggy often).
- The work itself is pretty simply and takes about only a month to be fully self-sufficient.","- Communication down the chain of command is very mediocre. You will often find yourself learning about major organizational changes relatively late and although the transparency is stressed, anything deemed ""sensitive"" is either communicated at the last minute, or hidden.
- Management itself is overall lackluster at best. There are definitely a few competent and valuable leaders that go behind the role to look out for your best interest, but otherwise there are many mediocre, first-time managers that you can't help but wonder if they got their position through nepotism. ""Sucking up"" unfortunately works.

This place is a disaster in its purest form. Everyone here is understaffed and overworked. There is little to no work life balance at all. The company is growing at an unprecedented rate but the turnover is ridiculously high. People don’t usually last here more than 3 months. More often than not you’ll work 10-12 hour days. You’re lucky if you meet a handful of people who are willing to be helpful in your role. Everyone is way too burnt out to offer a hand. I’ve personally seen how the stress of this job has began to take a toll mentally and physically on many team members. 

Management and execs don’t invest in headcount where they need it so there are so many operational inefficiencies. If you raise them to management, you are shamed for it. 

Anyone at an upper level position is completely out of touch with any of their subordinate’s day to day responsibilities, which leaves people to figure everything out alone. More often that not, nothing ever gets sorted out and people have to improvise. Building out a working process that is sustainable usually never happens unless you have a competent manager or team. 

The CEO has a history of lashing out at employees and being nasty when things don’t go his way. It’s public knowledge. You can read the online articles.

999,Better.com,TLDR; Excellent place for hardworking and highly flexible people to launch a career/get into mortgages,2021-07-13,5.0,Processing Expert,"- Really uplifting culture. It is very rare that coworkers are unresponsive/unwilling to help. Almost everyone across departments is willing to do their part and work together to get loans across the finish line. People here cheer each other on and celebrate the wins!

- Highly focused on DEI. There is a strong collective focus on being an inclusive place to work and considering the feelings/viewpoints of those outside our own. People really work to do right by the customer and the mission of making homeownership better shines through. 

- Lots of room to work autonomously, at least in the processing department. They give you ample room to do your work and aside from weekly team check-ins and bi-weekly 1:1s (varies by team and manager), you will be working your files totally independently. 

- Managers are on the ball. Again, highly responsive and subject matter experts.

- Pay is above average and there is the opportunity for incentive pay in IC roles.

- Things change a lot. Listing this as a pro as it seems like management is working to build a sustainable + dynamic business for when the rate/market environment changes and business is no longer falling into our lap. Results of this are TBD but over the 10 months I have been here things seem to continue to move in the right direction based on information shared in all-hands meetings.

- Great benefits! Pretty good coverage across the board, they also contribute to your HSA on the HDHP plan. No 401k match yet which is understandable as they have been doing ISOs until recently. We still have unlimited PTO as of now which is great and it is actually easy to take advantage of! They are also working on providing a daily lunch stipend again to all employees, a huge plus.","- Things change often. This also can be a con, as processes change frequently and due to the nature of the business new loan programs, underwriting requirements, etc., are added almost weekly. If you are not adaptable to change you will not enjoy this aspect. However, I'm not sure what else you could expect from a company this young. 

- Management is not afraid to modify current roles and add/remove roles as needed. There is the risk that your role can undergo big changes without much warning. Also can be reassigned teams with little/no warning. Re: startup.

- Workload can begin to mount once you are ramped in. The bright side here is overtime requests of 5 -10 hrs/wk are currently rubber-stamped. Managers are generally flexible about overtime (and sometimes encourage it) and realize it will probably be needed if you have a larger pipeline size. As a young person with no spouse/kids, I don't consider this a con and happily clock OT. If you have extensive obligations outside of work you may consider this a con. Logging off at 6 is definitely possible, but you are likely going to need to clock OT at some point if you have a large pipeline and want to avoid backlogs."

There are many people here who actually care about the company mission and want to make a difference in the home ownership and mortgage space

DEI seems to be taken seriously and as a result the staff is very diverse","Where to begin?

Leadership is VERY inexperienced, young, and highly entitled. These are people who believe they can just google what they don’t know in lieu of possessing actual experience. No matter what lines they feed you during the recruiting process they won’t listen to anything you have to say. Came from FAANG? No one cares. Played golf with some SVP? You’re gold.

WLB is a joke. We went months working 18hours a day and 7 days a week. Unlimited PTO is impossible to use unless you’re a useless people manager who does nothing and can lean on your DRs to handle everything while you drink cocktails by the pool. (Or whatever they do)

Stop. Start. Pivot. Go back. Go forward. You’ll get dizzy with all the conflicting orders and changes in direction. All that work you iterated on for that MVP? Throw it away because the CEO saw something funny on Facebook and wants to do that instead.

Don’t get comfortable with anything. In my time at Better I had no less than 4 managers and just as many department leaders setting direction. People don’t get fired so much as they get “disappeared”. You’ll be working closely with a stakeholder on one day and then the next morning their account has been deactivated. 

“Crushing it” means you worked 7 days a week and never rested to make the CEO happy. He’ll tell you that everyone in the company will be a millionaire if we don’t act like “whiny millennials.”

Google search for “Vishal Gard dumb dolphin” and remember that this is what he thinks of you, and all of us.

Best for last: The PIP culture here is crazy. Like Amazon-level bad especially around perf review cycles. People I worked with were put on ""performance improvement plans” for ranking less than 1 point below a single KPI. The former CPO used to hand out PIPs as retaliation while some people just got off scott-free so YRMV."

Here’s the story. TL:DR Company wants CEA’s to move into a cold call position and did not ask if we wanted the role. Gave us two options, quit or do it. If a company tells you word for word that your alternative is to quit, you should know right away to stay away!

-Constantly changing metrics that are not coordinated between teams, Processing Experts are negatively impacted by PEAs and Closers.

- Confusing communication from upper management. You can exceed in most metrics - receive bonuses, and still be fired for not meeting the conversion metric by 2%"

There's no robust method of working. 

HR is disrespectful and only care about the employers, not the employees.

We now have to clock in and out as salaried employees as if we are children. Why would you have salaried employees clock in and out? Just tell them no overtime because we are stingy and don't want to pay people for making us money outside of the standard working hours. Also don't promote it as a plus when hiring people that they get OT pay when in reality you make people explain 1 minute over 8 hours a day. Can't wait for the company to see the amount of money and clients they lose due to this. 

Company is either severely struggling with money or trying to get people to quit with their new policies to increase their bottom line for investors.

Preach this ""one team on dream"" which is complete bs. The only thing they care about is paying people less even if that means they can't afford a living so they can ipo and become millionaires. 

They faked getting surveys to make the company a best place to work to look better in the public eye then turned around and pulled the rug from under their employees feet once they landed on the list. Would love to see that survey go out now. 

Look up the articles this company has been apart of on forbes and those will tell you the type of ""leaders"" we have.

When other's say that things are rapidly changing, they mean literally daily, and NOT in a good way. Things are going extremely downhill and a crash is going to happen. We have not gotten any type of good news in a long time. The only ""good"" news we hear is how much money the company makes, which doesn't really seem to benefit us at this point. 

-ZERO work life balance
-If you want to literally be strapped to your desk from 9am-6pm (minimum) with an extremely unmanageable workload, then this is the place for you. CHURN AND BURN
-Employee's are just a number, your voice does not matter, and you will not be heard.
-Higher up is extremely manipulating, and some easily fall for their antics. 
-We are being forced into different positions with no say whatsoever, which I didn't even know was legal. 
-We used to receive a $300 monthly stipend to help with WFH expenses, but that was taken away and announced during a meeting right after we were told that we made a record amount of revenue the month prior. 
-Our pay and bonuses are being cut.
-We can't even take an hour lunch break anymore, we have to take two separate 30 minute lunch breaks, so you basically can't leave your house to get a little break for your own sanity anymore. They did this in order for us to be more ""available"" to the customers. 
-You used to be able to apply for other positions within the company, but now that so many in processing and other departments are miserable and trying to go elsewhere, they are forcing you to stay in your position for a minimum of 9 months before you can go somewhere that makes you happier. 
-There is an insane amount of things that need to be fixed, yet nothing gets fixed and new things are created (that also don't work) and are never for the best interest of employees, only customers.
-Your work load gets more ridiculous by the week, new responsibilities weekly. 
-Unlimited PTO will most likely be taken away soon. 

They do not care about you, plain and simple. Don't be manipulated. This company was so much better before and could be so great, it could be amazing. Most of the people here are amazing. In the ""public eye"" it might be tHe BeSt pLaCe tO wOrK, but the truth is coming out. Disappointing is the best word to describe it.

Better is honestly the BEST company I have ever worked for. When I say it ruined me, I mean that in the most positive way possible. I am not new to tech/start-ups, but Better really is in a league of it's own. I'm ruined because if I ever have to work at another company (which I hope I'm a Better lifer), I 100% will be comparing it to the standards of Better.com. From the L&D that is provided to all individual contributors to the front line manager trainings, growth is top of mind from the top to bottom. This company practices what it preaches, this is incredibly rare! I love that Better as a product is trying to make the mortgage industry less biased and more equitable, they are doing the same on the inside with 5,000 employees. I am so proud to work for a company that values diversity and embraces a wide range of experience. It's been just about a year and I'm just as in love as when I started. Better, please never stop being the best. Thank you for setting the bar really high!",A lot of Zoom Meetings (but that's par for the course in Covid times).

The pay is fairly competitive and the bonus structure is on the generous side. You’re given enough work to make the bonuses that are advertised and then some. It’s the right mixture of competition and teamwork. I never feel like I’m being plotted against or that anyone is out to get me as if we’re all winning then we’re all doing good.,"When there are changes the communication is not always there. The workload is often unmanageable and you have to decide what is the most important and most visible issues to get to each day. For some people this can be really overwhelming. Additionally, most people you work with in other positions cannot or do not help. Decisions with files are mostly up to people with little knowledge and experience and almost every request has to be made at least twice to get resolved. The highest performers easily work 10-11 hours daily.  You’re really not as in charge of your metrics as leadership would often like to believe."

I can truthfully say that the product is amazing, and the technology we have does help us stand out from our competition. For the borrowers, the website makes it easy (esp for millennials) to buy a home. 

There are some great people you will meet here, and a few reliable managers. You'll find that the culture is definitely awesome in the office. In regards to a few pros if you ever decide to work is that you'll have a $15 daily allowance for lunch, saving you money over time. I came in with no experience about the mortgage industry and personal finance in general so you'll definitely learn a lot. The Sales Department is generally very welcoming and you'll find that you have a lot of young, friendly people who are always willing to socialize with you after work

There are plenty of opportunities for OT and coming from a recent college graduate, the pay is pretty decent. Definitely a good job for recent graduates that want to get some professional experience moving forward. There’s unlimited PTO available and a decent 401K provider but unfortunately they do not match.","THE ROLE:
I've only been here for about 4 months now and I can definitely say that I am not one of the many that have ""drank the Kool-aid"". To be frank, this job is literally a Call Center role but with few differences. This is the responsibilities for the role:

1.) Getting on the phone and interacting with interested prospective customers
2.) Working with our sales teams to build a pipeline of customers
3.) Educating customers on what it takes to buy a home and partnering with them to make it happen
4.) Taking a consultative approach in helping customers overcome issues and achieve their goals 
5.) Providing the best customer experience possible, which in turn will help you convert potential customers to Better customers

Out of the five responsibilities, I would 2 and 5 are definitely good skills to learn if you want to get into Sales/Marketing but the rest is pretty monotonous where you have to answer inbound calls (performance minimum is about 200 IB calls a month). Obviously, with mortgage and personal finance, you have to err on the side of compliance and this is where training comes in. The listings that I have seen on their site have been poorly marketed and not as transparent as they say they are through their company values. 

TRAINING:
I have been sent to training twice and it was really inconsistent. When I was onboarded, my trainer was from the NYC office and he was knowledgeable but passive whereas my second trainer was from the Irvine office, also very knowledgeable and very hands-on/passionate. This resulted in me having gaps in knowledge and made me depending on my resources a lot more, which I also found to be inconsistent at times because you won't find the answer on a particular Google Chrome plug-in and you end up having to learn on the job from your other co-workers by asking them questions or even through specific situations that borrowers/clients may have. 

MANAGEMENT:
Another major problem that I had was the management. I want to point out that not all managers are like this but this is to the majority that I have witnessed. They are inexperienced and don't know how to adapt in order to lead a team. Creating a culture that involves cliched awards and Buzzfeed polls does not lead to an ideal environment of professional development. The communication between the managers have been horrible as well and it's not surprising given that the company HQ is in New York and we have offices in Charlotte, Irvine. This is a nitpick but it's something that should have been worked on or fully addressed  as we continue to scale quickly. With my manager, we would have monthly 1 x 1's but at times, they can be rescheduled and with the problems that I had with training, being pulled away from the phones to do emails all day because of one bad call that I had only hindered my development in the role. I would like to have more responsibilities and to learn more skills on the job but unfortunately, the monotony of this role doesn't offer any sort of professional development that I would like to have in order to improve. 

All of these problems and cons culminate to the biggest problem that I have with this company...

UNCLEAR EXPECTATIONS:
When I was being interviewed, the biggest concern I had was the learning curve of the material that I was going to learn with this job. The manager that interviewed me gave me a timeframe of about 3 to 6 months, which is pretty reasonable given that this is a startup and you definitely have to adapt quickly. However, through my experience with training, I haven't adapted as quickly as I'd like because of the gaps of knowledge that I have and everybody has a different learning style. Obviously, I have made mistakes on the job and I know that the majority have made mistakes before but when you've been put on a PIP because you haven't been ""performing up to par or not developing as quickly as needed"",  it is ridiculous that they need to address past issues even though I've clearly worked on them and learned from previous mistakes. I have met the minimum performance standard every month but just because I haven't been ""performing up to par"" and using past mistakes that I've committed as a front to let me go is ridiculous. What's even more jarring is that I've been given two weeks to improve and this was after I discussed with my HR friend that PIPs are supposed to be over the course of three months. In other words, I'm essentially the fall guy for the shortcomings of management."

Not many people at the ""Executive"" level have any established track record of success or identifiable skills beyond fealty to the CEO. Better has managed to grow in spite of this, mostly thanks to prolonged low interest rates and a string of VCs who have lined up to be the greater fool.

1452,Better.com,No Balance in Sales,2020-03-30,2.0,Loan Officer,"I worked in the sales department for almost a year and a half; considering most of sales was recently hired in the last few months, I believe I have an accurate account. This is for the NYC office, so other office dynamics may be better or worse. I can truthfully say that the product is amazing, and the technology we have does help us stand out from our competition. For the borrowers, the website makes it easy (esp for millennials) to buy a home.

Pros: There are some great people you will meet here, and a few reliable managers. The biggest Pros are  1) The free lunch. You get a $15 seamless credit which saves you $$ over time 2) You learn a lot about the mortgage industry / personal finance if you don't have a financial background 3) The sales department specifically is fairly diverse; management not so much, but these things take time. We also have an office in India which is pretty cool 4)There are a lot of young, friendly people who are always willing and in need of a drink after work 5)Pay is nice. You get ample amounts of overtime and bonus opportunities 6)A lot of prospective growth in the future 7)The WTC3 is a really beautiful office (not the 120 Broadway office where sales/ops/engineering sits)","I would only recommend working in sales if you are solely driven by money. There is absolutely no work/life balance here. 

They will ask you to work every single holiday. They didn't inform me in the interview, but you are REQUIRED to work one weekend shift per month. You can request a weekend off, but it's not guaranteed you will get it. The refinance team is a lot more aggressive in their sales tactics - I would not recommend working on the refinance team if given the option. The refinance team enforces early morning motivational lectures, enforced team outings for out-of-office bonding, emails ""explaining your why"", and if a borrower tells you to STOP calling, you are still required to harass them through text and email. Last summer they had to buy a wellness fridge to dole out vitamin C packets in the mornings to consistently hungover teammates.

The standard working hours are 9am-6pm (10am-6pm on weekends and holidays) with one hour lunches not encouraged. If you are a loan officer / loan consultant associate, the metrics and  goals are extremely vague leading to constant stress to meet the unclear expectations.  Constantly changing org structures, management changes, and fluctuating expectations lead people staying later and later until burnout - refinance teams always works longer hours than everyone else. 

If you're an LCA, you are measured on the amount of outbound calls / talk time and LCs are measured on locks. LCs are only paid slightly more than LCA, but are audited daily. LCs are also required to deal with post lock problems that management does not take into account.  The CEA role is the best for work/life as their schedule is 9-6, but job is most monotonous as they are just taking cold inbound calls. The CEAs also have to ask permission to use the bathroom??

The last con to working on the sales team is the incentive structure. For a department that is growing so quickly, new roles are constantly being added (a good thing) and the responsibility  of old roles are always in flux (a bad thing) What that means is that one month you are getting paid for lock assists multiplied by 1.5 and then the next month you are getting paid for purchase contracts. Everyone is getting paid differently, and the paychecks are always a surprise (besides the base pay). Perhaps managers should be required to send out emails explaining the bonus. Before I left, they implemented a new pay structure, but who knows it's changed every 6 months since I started. If you are willing to work 60+ hours a week under constant stress, then you will thrive."
1453,Better.com,joke of a company,2020-03-03,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"unlimited PTO, unlimited snacks, free lunch/dinner, 401(k). nothing else","The entire executive team includes a CEO, CTO and ""Chief of Staff"". It's unfortunate that there is continuous turnover every couple months. Better does not have a CFO, Chief Marketing Officer, Chief Operations Officer, Chief Product Officer, Head of People Operations/Recruiting, etc. As the company scales, there are really only 2-3 decision makers at the company and those individuals are the ones that simply agree with the CEO in order to play office politics and get more responsibility. The tenure of our ex-senior leadership goes to show that the company is a complete revolving door and no one actually wants to stay once they start. Better used to be a meritocracy, but now it looks and feels like Trump's cabinet.

Our ""Chief of Staff"" doesn't do anything of worth and continues to get more and more responsibility due to her proximity to the CEO. I can say with certainty that she does not deserve the promotions or anything that she has gotten as she spearheaded and led a partnership that completely imploded and led to close to 0 volume.

There will come a day where all of this turnover and deceit will burn Better due to the lack of accountability and integrity. I used to be proud to tell others that I worked at Better, but I'm now ashamed as it is a complete dumpster fire internally.  The company is putting growth ahead of everything else and scaling like a slightly tech enabled mortgage company rather than a true financial technology company. Continuously hiring more and more people is fine in the short-term, but the company will have an extremely difficult time once rates increase, refinance volume decreases and sales people actually need to do work rather than relying on locks to fall into their lap."

Better Mortgage was by far the most hostile and toxic work environment I have EVER had the misfortune of experiencing.  Working in this type is setting is poisonous to both your professional experience and mental health. 

As so many of my (former) peers have mentioned, there are myriad problems at Better Mortgage, the vast majority of which stem from the top down. Leadership, if they can even be considered that, is severely incompetent in every aspect; from executing on any real sales strategies to having had no experience leading ANY sort of team prior to Better Mortgage. The experience and expertise that it normally requires to run a  business at scale has been replaced by hubris and deceit. The CEO’s spiel during orientation mentions “getting on the rocket ship”. The leadership at Better Mortgage is grossly unqualified, with absolutely no acumen for building any sort of team or business and no track record for success. So, if Better Mortgage is like a rocket ship, then its future is set to parallel that of the Challenger. 

As a result, the culture that Better Mortgage has fostered is one of dishonesty and immorality, where it is advantageous to be self-serving, play politics, ignorance of any normal code of ethics, wrought with with backstabbing l, and an “IPO at all costs” type of mentality. Honestly, it’s reminiscent of “The Lord of Flies” with the leadership team behaving like petulant children with all the tantrums, dysfunction, and savagery."

Sales technology is awful. Better refuses to use a working CRM and had us using metabase, which is free for a reason, forever. All while engineering builds a custom CRM. Some of my colleagues just did all customer tracking on paper or excel. 

Doesn’t feel like anyone tracks performance indicators, and promotions often confuse colleagues. If I didn’t do anything today would anyone even notice our thoughts many of us had.

Meetings are incredibly dysfunctional with people yelling at eachother and being rewarded for it.  It was truly bizarre to me felt like I was back in middle school with the backstabbing and cliques.

Large office space.,"Although there is potential for this company, there's been a lot of missteps lately in how the growth of the company was handled. Management felt the best way to scale the growth of the company was to hire large amounts of sales and operations which was not sustainable. Instead of working on the product and refining and perfecting their business, they only wanted loan volume to increase. There are tools the business relies on every day that are broken and hinder performance. The incentive structure is broken, focusing on metrics that are skewed and often give advantage to the New York HQ office while the remote offices are left in the dust. Decision making is often made with HQ in mind, and there is a lack of clarity and communication about what is going on. People are often promoted to management on their ability to produce work RATHER than their ability to appropriately manage people. This leads to lower management that will micromanage (where are you, what are you doing right now), induce office politics, and make personal decisions that affect the business and employees but do not disclose that with upper management. Can be a toxic work environment."

- Good compensation and benefits
- Potential for a truly differentiated product if the company can stop shooting itself in the foot","CEO is unstable and prone to unprofessional outbursts. It is not uncommon for him to yell and even curse at other managers and sometimes even external partners. Many people have compared some of his behavior to Donald Trump. He often circumvents company processes, particularly when hiring. Unfortunately he tends to hire people much better at talking themselves up and being political than doing the actual job they were hired to do.

Total lack of transparency and accountability among the management team.  Some examples:

1) All-hands meetings are regularly cancelled without notification to the team.
2) When all-hands meetings do take place, the CEO does not show up to address the company about yearly goals. 
3) Quarterly goals come out half way through the first month of the quarter. There is no comment on the lateness.
4) Management refuses to address the negative reviews coming out on this website.  Instead they post or ask people to post 5 star reviews to push the bad ones down. During the time allocated for addressing the negative feedback they presented a hastily made video of company accomplishments instead.
5) Managers of failed projects face no accountability and are even sometimes promoted as if their projects were successful.  This happens despite the lack of any qualifications and having a track record of failure.

Unbelievable amounts of bureaucracy.  There is no problem that management thinks cannot be solved with a new layer of top down organization. Started with OKRs then added OKR sponsors, then executive OKR sponsors, then Pillars which form a layer above OKRs.  At each layer more ""stakeholders"" are added but none of them actually depend on the output so they are not truly stakeholders. No one seems to think of asking the people who do the work what the problems are (hint: it might be all the bureaucracy).

Tech team is complacent and barely makes progress on business objectives despite a very large team and constantly hiring of new engineers. Engineers get special privileges such as being able to show up late, take advantage of unlimited vacation, and leave early with impunity. Meanwhile the operations team has been working overtime for months to do the work that actually grows the business. This is common at startups but still depressing.

Company avoids documentation and training. Instead there is a heavy reliance on institutional knowledge which is poorly communicated leading to the internal team not really knowing how to use the product. As older employees continue to leave more and more of this information will be lost."

2 heads of product quit within six months. In this time two other product managers and a designer also quit.
