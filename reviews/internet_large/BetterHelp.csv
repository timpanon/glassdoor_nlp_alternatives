0,BetterHelp,"Plenty of Clients, Low Pay",2022-04-10,3.0,Licensed Professional Counselor,"I've never had a problem keeping a full caseload, they send clients at your pace","Low pay, no benefits unless you maintain an extremely high caseload"
1,BetterHelp,Impossible to manage caseload in order earn a living,2022-04-08,2.0,Mental Health Counselor,Flexible schedule. Set your own hours. Reliable in-flux of new clients. Responsive support team.,"VERY low pay, and you aren't compensated for time with clients beyond 45 minutes per session, regardless of time actually spent. In order to reach a decent wage, you must manage a massive caseload of messaging-only clients, no-shows and inconsistent participation, to get enough reliable patients to earn decent pay. There is also no autonomy over discharging patients and the system doesn't always allow you to select clients suited to your clinical strengths, they're automatically assigned and messaged on your behalf to your surprise."
2,BetterHelp,"Poor pay scale, disappointing , I left after 6 months",2022-04-08,2.0,Licensed Clinical Social Worker LCSW,"Fairly consistent Referrals
Good platform potentially","Extremely poor pay scale, They do not pay you hourly, you have to have two 45 minute sessions to earn the equivalent of an hour and a half of work.
No reimbursement for late cancellations or no-shows, while the platform is still getting paid whether or not the client makes use of their sessions.
Misleading advertisement, clients are led to believe that they have access to their therapist 24/7. In reality, this is setting a very bad precedent. Clients have difficulty accepting boundaries that therapist set on their time.
Clients also are allowed to believe that they will have immediate access to their therapists, some clients have complained because a therapist they were matched to did not respond within the hour. Completely unrealistic! Sometimes the match was made at one or 2 AM and the client expected an immediate response.
Therapists do not have access to the clients information, making it is very difficult if someone presents with suicidal ideation or thoughts of harming others. The burden is on the therapist to collect the clients information and often there’s quite a bit of pushback from the clients who expect the platform to be completely “private”. They do not understand at a therapist license is at risk if we don’t collect demographic information and ID, just like in a “real” office."
3,BetterHelp,"No one said Id be working for 90-100% free doing most back office, admin, off session client communication",2022-04-08,1.0,Therapist,"sign on bonus and referrals
quick and easy hire for onboard process
diversity of clients and global
platform entry experience for better one after","Onboarding was inept and lost my sign-on bonus due to their mishandling and lack of reply from customer service.
The calendar schedule is got major problems and reboots old schedule on top of a new one, continues to auto-populate inaccurately. 
customer service doesn't assist usually. They'll copy and paste template directions into emails and not respond to direct issues or not respond at all.
Pay is extremely low. Thought it might be an easy side gig while in pursuit of ither projects, but the admin, back office, off session communication and problems with system that require emails and chasing/begging customer service to help, fixing calendar autopopulate mistakes every day is atrocious and time wasting. I have no time for anything else and getting paid nothing.
The requirement to return messages that all clients can send anytime and each one requires return message within 24 hours or a big red banner and warnings are everywhere , causing stress and offense, as its taking advantage of the therapist while slacking on taking care of them.
Notes are disocuraged, any writing actually, as one gets 1-2 mintues of pay for 60 words. These words are not creative writing, they are professional and take thought and careful consideration, as its therapist rep, liability and influences a human being. This is most unethical. The therapist gets ripped off and the client is the one who will suffer. Its sad, because I like my clients and believe I need to get out quick, as most other offers are better and take care of me. Benefits are not readily available and hard to get to, as is a higher pay scale. Interface of system is insufficent and lack effective usability. Im resentful every day already, so I need it out of my life now."

11,BetterHelp,Amazing company & work culture,2022-03-29,5.0,Product Manager,"This company is a silicon valley dream come true. 
Working at BetterHelp gives you an amazing opportunity to make an impact at a high growth tech startup. The company has an awesome work culture & a leadership team that is highly supportive of their team.

The compensation is pretty solid, and the perks are amazing.",The stock (RSU comp) is extremely volatile right now.

I feel very fortunate working here. Great CEO, provides excellent benefits and perks, very comfortable work environment with flexible hours.",I didn't see any cons so far.
13,BetterHelp,An amazing organization,2022-03-25,5.0,Anonymous Employee,Extremely caring people who believe in the company's mission. BetterHelp has such a great culture despite many virtual employees such as myself. The new hire onboarding experience was seamless and I've had great mentorship. You will have great opportunities to interact and engage with all levels of leadership. You will have high-impact and high-visibility in any role at this exciting company.,None. It is such a great place to work.
14,BetterHelp,Job,2022-03-25,2.0,Behavior Therapist,Quick and easy to get started and easy to get a full case load as fast as you want.,"Low pay, takes long to get responses to your questions from the support team, do not have full control of how you manage clients in that you cannot discharge a client if the tell you they are stopping services, you have to wait for the client to terminate services in the meantime you keep getting notices the client has not responded to you and you have to message them in order and you will keep getting notices for at least 30 days. This is a good set up if you are looking to make some extra income or part time, but I have not been able to make enough to do this full time due to the pay scale and inconsistency with clients."
15,BetterHelp,Worst idea ever,2022-03-24,3.0,Therapist,"Easy to set a schedule, maintain a caseload, and the platform is relatively problem free.","Better Help will send a client an email, stating they are you, and engage the client in a conversation. I hate this. Typically you can look at the information and see if the client is a good fit for what you do, but when Better Help does this, you are left to deal with the mess they made. This seems inappropriate at best."
16,BetterHelp,Great Mission and Culture,2022-03-22,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"The team at BetterHelp is really passionate and bright. Everyone is a pleasure to work with and the overall culture is top-tier. It's still a pretty fast-paced, ""start-up"" environment, which I feel gives everyone a ton a room for growth. They prefer to promote internally. We're also pretty spoiled with all of our perks and team/company-wide events.","Leadership can be a bit too hands-on at time, which can slow things down."
17,BetterHelp,Cannot Believe I Landed This Job,2022-03-18,5.0,Marketing Administrator,"--The benefits and perks of working here are enormous! They definitely take care of their employees and prioritize the person over the work. This person-centric focus contributes to the overall culture.
--Unlimited PTO is recognized and used frequently by the employees.
--A culture that prioritizes community and togetherness. I value my coworkers as my peers, but also as my friends. 
--They are extremely conscious of workload. Consistently checking in to make sure I'm not overwhelmed, but I'm also definitely never bored. This does feed into a culture that values proactivity, however. You don't typically get assigned tasks, rather, you ask to work on the things that you're interested in. It's your responsibility to monitor your own workload and make sure you're not taking on too much.","I haven't been employed by them for too long, but, so far there haven't been any cons."
18,BetterHelp,They Spoil Us!,2022-03-18,5.0,Senior Therapist Recruiter,"The perks and treatment of their employees are way above and beyond anywhere I have worked.  I have had some pretty amazing perks with previous companies, but Betterhelp's is through the roof.  $550 a month in uber eats, free massages, fruit delivery, haircuts, its crazy how much they provide for their people.","They are owned by Teladoc, which is huge company and leads to communication issues.  Onboarding took an extra two weeks before I could access benefits and just be fully setup as an employee.   Also, did not get first paycheck for several pay periods.  I had money saved, but the guy that started with me was the only provider in his family and that was a little struggle for them."

20,BetterHelp,Chasing the next feature is slowly killing the organization,2022-02-15,3.0,Senior Systems Administrator,"Pay was decent, when everything went work from home the company honored the agreement to feed its employees with generous uber eats accounts.

Alon gracefully handles very hard, very pointed questions and answers to the best that can be expected.","The management has very little understanding of the current state of the art for security, application design, and technology innovation. Instead focusing on chasing feature after feature, they choose not to invest in paying down technical debt or improving the long term maintainability of systems or implementing basic security features such as MFA.

They also take a very lax approach to regulatory compliance and the advice of staff clinicians for what is clinically best; while correct to the letter of the law leaves employees with a strong sense of do-the-right-thing feeling left out in the cold.

Overall when I left there was also a feeling that Teladoc (parent company) was starting to exert its influence directly rather than keeping an arm's length from something that was working. Teladoc has less than zero idea how to operate in a startup environment and was asking for things that made no sense at a technical level and were harmful at an organizational culture level."
21,BetterHelp,flexibility,2022-02-07,4.0,Behavior Therapist,Good opportunity to work from home. People want help if they sign up.,Made me self employed which was an unexpected tax issue.
22,BetterHelp,Fast-paced startup culture with great perks,2022-01-25,4.0,Marketing Manager,"Betterhelp is a great place to progress your career in a fast-paced growth environment. The company has increased headcount 30% in the last half year which is a great sign. The people I've had the pleasure of meeting or working with cross functionally are brilliant, diverse and talented individuals. People culture and perks are great, however work can be grueling and demanding.","This might depend on the team, but despite all the headcount growth and the fact that we're over 200 people, it's still very challenging to track down the right person or team to help you with something, and it takes a while to execute on projects both small and large. Definitely startup culture. I find myself working over 40 hours/week consistently and will get emails and slacks from manager on the weekends. If work/life balance is your #1 important aspect of your professional life, make sure you set boundaries and vet this during interviews."

25,BetterHelp,conveyor belt therapy,2022-01-12,1.0,Licensed Professional Counselor,"Allows therapists to work from home, allegedly makes therapy ""accessible.""","BetterHelp was clearly developed by people who have no understanding of the mental health field, the therapeutic relationship, or the actual experience of working as a counselor. The screening process to work for BetterHelp is minimal. They incentivize taking on a huge caseload and meeting with clients for brief (30-45 minute) sessions, without the understanding that actual human beings simply don't have the capacity to do good therapeutic work with a high volume of people. For counselors, quality of work (and quality of life) goes down after a certain quantity on a caseload is met. BetterHelp also sends annoying messages to therapists pressuring them to respond to clients' messages, even in cases where responses are unnecessary. The platform feels impersonal and robotic. BetterHelp also advertises to counselors that they don't have to do paperwork when, in fact, keeping client records and notes is generally required by law. The starting pay is incredibly low for someone in private practice and increases $5/hour for every additional hour worked, but the platform doesn't accurately calculate the number of hours worked, thereby cheating therapists out of wages. The most a therapist can make for their hourly wage is still less than half the going rate of what most therapists charge in private practice, and far less than the weekly rate clients are paying for their sessions on BetterHelp. Therapists (and their clients) would be better off offering clients a sliding scale."

BetterHelp understands that its workforce is made up of individuals and treats them as such. Team morale always seems to be at the forefront of company decisions.

While I would expect nothing less from a company in this business, the mental health of BetterHelp's employees seems to be a priority.","I began employment in the middle of quarantine and if I had a problem, it was sometimes difficult to know who had the expertise to help me solve my problem.

Not just ensuring that we are productive but that we are able to navigate through this new WFH situation as best as possible. Benefits such as Uber Eats credits and WFH stipends are all great but taking time out of our company wide meeting to take a stretch and breathing course and giving an extra company wide holiday really depicts how they care for the well being of their employees.

76,BetterHelp,Better Employment,2017-11-14,4.0,Anonymous Employee,"Great office culture of work-life balance. This includes flexibility, understanding, and compassion. Management is made of real people that take into consideration that employees are also real people with real life issues outside of work sometimes. Plenty of office events, celebrations, and activities to keep us happy and motivated. Lots of things going on to remind us what a great service we are building. An environment is curated here that you feel heard, that your ideas amount to something, and the work you put in directly affects the platform.","When it rains, it pours. This isn't about BetterHelp specifically, but just start ups in general. When we're busy, we're really busy, meaning sometimes we work some long days/evenings. It gets really cold in the office sometimes."

79,BetterHelp,Changing the world one person at a time.,2017-11-13,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"When I tell stories to my relatives and friends working outside silicon valley they can't  believe a place like this exists.  Betterhelp bends over backwards to foster community and keep it's exceptionally skilled team intact and pushing forward toward it's lofty goals.   This small but close knit group has accomplished more in the past year than competitors 10x our size and we have made meaningful impacts in countless peoples lives as a result of the platform and network of professionals  we've developed.   This is the place where you can have a real impact and grow both professionally and personally.   The work is challenging and there are moments of high stress but they are tempered with recognition and accomplishment in a balanced way.     We get free lunches daily, free door dash if you are working late,  we have hammocks and massage chairs,  a $2000 coffeemaker and all Chromatic coffee you can drink, beers are in the fridge, the break room snacks are never lacking and so long as you get your work done no one seems to care about the specific hours you are at your fancy standing desk.   It's a fantastic company and  you will be lucky if you make through rigorous interview process and onto the team.  It's worth the effort.","You have to be a self starter.  If you are someone that needs to wait to be told what and how to do things, then this is not the place for you."
