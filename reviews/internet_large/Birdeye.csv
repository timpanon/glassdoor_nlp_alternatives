I came into this job not knowing much about the industry but looking for a career with stability and this is that but more. They prepare you before you start with an intensive 2 week training to make sure you feel armed and ready for the job. Then after you get with your team there is more training and developing. The leaders and your team here really want to see you win. Being a remote job, it still has a high energy and competitive nature.",haven't experienced any so far!

15,Birdeye,Zero Loyalty,2022-01-24,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"I would say great people, but not a single person I befriended is still employed at Birdeye.","When I first started, pr-covid, the culture was great. I was so proud to work at Birdeye. The company as a whole was completely unorganized, yes, but the culture was so great that it wasn't a factor at the time. After covid, things totally changed. They put over half the company on furlough, and only brought back a handful. 

It's a miracle this company is still operating. In sales, you should expect a lot of change, but the changes happening were nowhere near positive for the company or the employees. 

By far the last 6 months were the worst. I had 4 different managers, 5 different quotas, and was moved to 3 different positions, not by choice. I held back looking for another career path because there was a manager spot open that I applied for. After being with the company for so long, I expected to be at least given the opportunity. Instead, they hired an outside manager with almost no sales experience who didn't even know what Birdeye was. The employees under this manager even agreed that sales advice from him was not to be taken seriously. The only people excelling are the ones who keep their head down and learn how to sell Birdeye on their own. 

When I first started, I was told I would only be in my role for a year tops. After 3 years I left the company in the same job title as when I started. Zero loyalty."

- Breakfast, lunch and dinner used to be served when the office was open.
- Open desk culture and easy to approach anyone.
- Freedom to explore and experiment to a certain degree.
- One can grow within the company by doing and showing exceptional work.","- Too much control by founders.
- Politics on higher levels.
- No proper structure in the company. Designations are superficial and no one is doing the work that justifies their role.
- Designations, experience and salary levels are not calibrated and vary significantly.
- New hires could get much higher salary than the existing people who have already proven their worth.
- No proper work prioritisation. De-prioritisation and rework is a trend.
- Sales and support teams are kept in limelight as if they are the most important ones running the company.
- Product team thinks they can get away with their responsibilities just by providing guidance to the engineering team instead of themselves understanding the use cases and functionality. Mostly happens for features that don't have focus from leadership.
- Leadership keeps chasing dates instead of ensuring that the quality, security and performance of the features is top class.
- Few chosen ones get all the accolades while some other deserving people leave the company after a while when not provided the same opportunities to showcase their abilities."

Listen to your employees and their ideas and be focused on execution. Success will continue to come.
28,Birdeye,Amazing place to work,2021-12-09,5.0,Sales Development Manager,"Culture: The team at Birdeye truly values their employees and does what is necessary to ensure they have the tools for success. 

Growth- Family-like environment with endless opportunities to grow.

Product- You're working with various business industries. Birdeye continues to adapt and release more and more features. Birdeye truly shows why they're #1 on G2 for marketing platforms.","No cons, I've enjoyed my experience here at Birdeye"
29,Birdeye,Stagnant-Growth Startup,2021-11-24,1.0,Recruiter,"Benefits are fantastic, it's the primary selling point of the company + equity
Co-workers on the ground floor are genuinely nice people
Product is beneficial for companies, they create new products all the time based on customer feedback","When I joined, I was told this company was in ""hyper-growth"" mode, and we would be increasing our employee size by 200% over the next year. In 2020 we barely hit 1% growth in employee size. This was due to excessive turnover and layoffs/furloughs during the pandemic. 

Since being at Birdeye for over a year and a half, 3/4 of the employees I hired are no longer at Birdeye. Leadership does not give their employees freedom to do what they were hired to do. Mainly on the Manager & Director level, they are micromanaged constantly, leading to a high turnover rate and a volatile environment for everyone else. 

Managers have not grasped that in this current job market candidates have many options. They need to be selling Birdeye to the candidates, not belittling them and having the attitude of ""candidates should be grateful to even be interviewing with us."" Managers need to invest time in training their employees properly. Birdeye needs to hire & promote from within. The favorites (those who came to Birdeye as referrals from their Birdeye manager) get promoted quickly, but not always those with the longest tenure.

The HR leaders are cold and employ scare tactics during performance evaluations for sales employees - even during a first warning. Once you oppose or question the decisions being made, you are automatically labeled a ""problem employee"" by HR. The HR team is constantly asked during 1x1s “Do you still like your job? Do you still like Birdeye?” which puts doubt into our heads, making us think there is something wrong internally. 

The turnover rate needs to be addressed before the recruiting team can be effective. Hiring for the same position over and over is exhausting. There is no data, process, or structure in place for the recruiters and they need a new manager, until these things happen the team cannot be successful.

Many people, myself included, leave Birdeye because there is no future of growth or promotion. If you want to join a startup because you can influence and make changes to help with growth, then Birdeye is not for you. But if you have the mentality of ""keep your head down and mouth shut"", then you might thrive here."
30,Birdeye,The worst time I ever had...,2021-11-21,2.0,Anonymous Employee,None. Seriously. None at all.,"I personally felt my success and growth was secondary to the team manager. The manager did not seem invested in me and I wasn't given adequate responsibilities. I can sincerely say that I followed all instructions, worked hard(and smart!) and adhered by the team's code of conduct, but I felt stuck in a vicious loop of unending work that did not challenge me. There was no relief in sight. 

The team's productivity was severely affected due to the stubbornness and rigidity of the management, who failed to see beyond their own inadequacies. I worked meticulously and diligently with good results but efforts weren't proportionately rewarded. Any attempts to make them see that they weren't adhering to best practices(in few circumstances) and were neglecting ways to optimize development were simply ignored.

I wasn't allowed to reach my full potential and was throttled in my journey towards being a better software engineer. I wouldn't recommend joining this company to anyone with a desire to grow. They do not possess the aching fire and heart needed to achieve mastery in one's area of expertise.

Obviously, my experiences are limited to the team (the Integrations Team to be specific, but I won't divulge any further details) and it might be possible that other teams, devoid of the arrogant manager, might actually be great places to learn, though I am seriously doubtful of this.

I do not harbor any negative feelings towards the company itself, and am grateful for the opportunity given to me, but had the promises of a vibrant learning environment been fulfilled, I would have cherished my experiences for years to come, instead of regretting them."

Customer support is actually really good","Management is pretty much nonexistent. 
Trying to communicate with leadership is impossible, rarely will they respond within 5 hours
This is a company trying to sprint to a goal before ever laying the groundwork to get there
They will sell you on culture and support for you to find out that on an employee basis neither are there. 
There is no coaching or training, bootcamp will not prepare you. 
Enablement does not have a single person with selling experience although they are the ones supposed to train you.
Sales engineers act like they dont want to be there.
Leaving them is even a pain and they dont release or actually process your separation for weeks, hold your 401K and leave you with access to salesforce for an entire week after leaving
They will pretend they listen to employees but nothing ever comes from it.
More meetings than any company ive experienced just to have a meeting
Pay is horrible. No one makes quota, so you will essentially live off of base and they will insult you with how you can earn more."

46,Birdeye,Poor sales leadership. Avoid if you are in sales.,2021-08-27,2.0,Account Executive,"There are some great people who used to work at this company. Seriously, between 2017 and 2018 the culture here was very positive. Unfortunately, most of the people who made the culture great have moved on to better things. A few other positive points:
* Great health insurance
* Free lunch once a week
* Free snacks
* Lots of turnover, so simply sticking around used to help you snag better leads and get a positive reputation with management
* There are some great people who are still here","The opinions expressed in this review are my own. These are not expressed as ""facts"" about the company and should not be viewed as such. Make your own decisions about who you choose to work for, and accept nothing less than excellence.

Back in 2020, around April or May, David Lehman thought it would be a great idea to start doing Big Deal Meetings twice a week from 5 PM to 6:30 PM. During these meetings, sales reps would talk about any deals they had in the pipeline over a certain value. Even if you only had one deal to talk about, you were expected to sit on the call for the entirety and may only speak for 3 minutes. This was AFTER HOURS. It accomplished nothing except demoralizing employees. Sadly, this is an accurate representation of how leadership treated the sales team every day. Incredibly embarrassing for the company and leadership.

At least they've stopped telling reps in interviews that they'll actually receive warm leads (I hope). It stopped for a while, but the interview process was also incredibly inconsistent month-to-month. You'd have interviewees show up and no one in management would be available to break off of calls to actually talk to them. Either way, those warm leads don't exist (spread too thin among too many reps), and you'll end up cold calling.

When I worked here we would spend 3-4 hours per month in monthly all-hands meetings. It just seemed like a big waste of time. 

It also seems odd that if you watch their review count and recent reviews on Glassdoor from week to week, the new and positive reviews will actually disappear. I think Glassdoor catches on that they're fake and removes them, but that's just a hunch. A lot of the positive reviews follow a similar format to each other and don't seem believable.

I would give Naveen a higher rating except that he authorized the hire of some really awful sales leaders over the years. He's extremely intelligent and highly personable, but just couldn't get the top level sales leader hires just right.

This isn't the worst sales org in the work (ie. Paycom and Tom James), but there are definitely better places to work."

-In all of my years as an Account Executive, I've never been more micro-managed than I was here. Deals were taken over by leadership and every email sent to prospects needed to be checked by management

- The team is helpful and sets everyone up for success (even when things are constantly changing)
- Work/life balance in that you rarely work late nights or weekends

- Management resorts to condescending comments and/or aggressive behavior rather than providing real leadership or helpful feedback
- Negative attitude from management takes a toll on team morale, and management does not make an effort to cultivate a healthy atmosphere
- Team is afraid to speak up and would rather internalize or appease management’s actions (probably for fear of losing their jobs)
- No input/contribution on company innovation unless you have seniority or are favored by leadership
- No career advancement or growth due to said favoritism
- Productivity culture reigns supreme: if you’re not busy, you’re underperforming
- Company does not have a clear vision of its own identity

- option to work remotely 
- earning potential","- cross-department communication is poor (i.e. marketing & sales). leads are poorly distributed and there is hardly ever communication around lead-gen events 
- account distribution is fragmented - the revenue ops team does not give out very qualified or workable accounts to target. you must find your own in order to stay busy and build a decent pipeline
- support from leadership needs improvement. getting 1:1 time with your manager if few and far between as they wear multiple hats. 
- too results oriented. high pressure to perform and lacking of that results in threats of discipline 
- independent work culture. there feels like there is no ""team"" and rather it's all about you. makes sense as you are an individual contributor but there is hardly any team building or sharing of best practices. Working remote with COVID is a factor to this"

They have plenty of experience, and every time I ask for help, they always know how to approach things.","Oh boy, where to even start with this one...

They promise transparency, they promise growth, and they promise support. Sounds great right? Unfortunately, this has yet to reflect. Every change this company has made so far has been for the worst. The morale amongst my colleagues is low. 

It all started with the massive layoffs BirdEye executed mid-March, even though the pandemic has not hit, even though the month was yet to be over nor has the company felt any effects of the pandemic, half the company was put on furlough. Since then the company has been going downhill to the point where they are now Review Gating, asking specific employees to leave good reviews, while also claiming the surveys they had out are anonymous. (I believed it until one day someone from upper management confronted me about the feedback I left on the anonymous survey.)

Training is poorly managed, the technologies we use are still not working properly, and yet for every meeting, they claim that employee happiness is at an 80% even though their best employees are quitting and those who are left are getting fired. Do not work here if you are looking to advance in your career in sales. Not worth the trouble."

132,Birdeye,Really manipulative/awful upper mgmt,2020-08-24,2.0,Mid Market Business Development Representative,"People are awesome, used to be a fun culture in the beginning","- Upper management does not communicate, a lot of favoritism. There is no transparency whatsoever. They don't reward top-sellers properly so there's no proper incentive for high-performers. They underpay sales reps as well.

- No change comes from employee reviews. They don't even read them, and don't really care about their employees at all. Unfairly give out opportunities, such as going to trade shows and moving up the ladder"
133,Birdeye,Get in and get out.,2020-08-21,2.0,Anonymous Employee,"The people and managers are hard to beat anywhere else. You will develop friendships and close relationships with the people you share a team with. They will be your rock when things get shaky. I still have very close relationships with them to this day and I do not see that changing anytime soon. It is also a great place for someone with no experience to come in and start a career in this industry. If you are fresh out of college or have been wanting to get into software sales this would be a good place to start to get your experience. Your managers will look out for you and fight for you but that can only go so far. There is some room to grow. When COVID isn't an issue there is lunch on Fridays, kitchen full of snacks, and good benefits.","The salaries are not even competitive. Things change all the time and the higher up leadership will blame you for not getting results even though they asked you to clean out your pipeline last week and you have been rebuilding it with your new leads. Then as soon as you get some small foundation under you... change happens and they are threatening to put you on PIP if you do not get results. There is also no consistent PIP plan either. Some people get let go after 1 bad month and then some people get to ride it out for 9-10 months of bad performance. Higher leadership does not listen to the boots on the ground. This will cause you to have unrealistic goals (even during a pandemic) and they do not want to listen to your suggestions on creating success. It truly is their way or the highway and unfortunately, their way is going to lead them down the wrong path because they are too egotistical to listen to their employees. This includes the executives and stops at the direct management level. The AE/BDR Managers don't even get listened to at all either so it isn't just at the bottom of the totem pole. I personally worked in different roles and it doesn't get better anyway that you look at it. All the reviews that you see that are similar and not ""5 Stars"" are accurate. When people leave and start to leave honest feedback on Glassdoor the marketing team starts reaching out to newbies that have been around for less than 6 months to leave ""glowing"" reviews. I get why they are doing it but just be aware. There is just a bunch of ignorance and arrogance going on and it is sad that you realize that AFTER you move on to a new company that does things the right way. The President has switched to a fear-based approach that has been mentioned in one of the reviews as well. It is just a very toxic work environment that takes a toll on your mental health/"
134,Birdeye,Complete 180 from when I started and I'm so disappointed about it,2020-08-20,1.0,Account Executive,The people! I worked in the Dallas office and honestly my coworkers are the reason I stayed so long. I made friendships that will last and I am so grateful for that. There are snacks and lunches on Fridays which is cool too. When I started it was all rainbows and butterflies and it was a great way to get sales experience straight out of college. My direct manager was an amazing leader and they helped me to succeed from the day that I walked in the door. The VP of sales Sarah is a rockstar and a great leader as well. Direct managers work hard to keep up the morale and personally train in the specific areas you need help with.,"I'm going to make it short and sweet.

-Upper management does not care about their employees only money in their pocket
-Morale is low, lower than normal working from home
-No work life balance at all, when you weren't at work you were still working
-No transparency ever
-Mental health down the drain and no one cares

The bottom line is that the entire sales floor is so exhausted. They are mentally drained and burnt out."

Other pros are Friday lunch and a snack bar, quota-crusher events, and the occasional team event given by managers (when it isn't COVID-season, obviously). Location in Cypress Waters is great for going to lunch or having a drink with coworkers. Product is getting better pretty regularly. Lots of useful software tools supplied to sales, although I will say they are not adequately used or trained on.","Most of my warnings to new employees is surrounding employee happiness and treatment. Much of this I tried to address time and time again with various points of contact in middle management, and I know many of my colleagues have as well and share the same frustrations as I do. 

BirdEye tells their customers that they need to be proactive and listen to stories about bad experiences internally so they can improve their business, but BirdEye hasn't been practicing that themselves. I hope management sees this and takes it more seriously than they did our recent internal survey responses and conversations. 

I'll break my primary grievances down without going into too much detail, but ultimately these factors influenced me heavily in my choice to leave the organization voluntarily and seek employment elsewhere.

• BirdEye's sales department has evolved into being a very fear-based organization

- employees are not going to be able to succeed, no matter what resources they have, if they are being demoralized on a weekly basis and they do not feel genuinely cared for
- jumped from a 3 month PIP to a 1 month PIP during COVID although our PIP contracts did not say that policy was subject to change. 
- tell you that other companies are ""not like BirdEye"" and that you won't have similar opportunities elsewhere, and that you won't be happy/happier if you leave
- people have taken FMLA and left due to mental health issues brought on by work
- during the middle of COVID, the President addressed the entire SMB org and told all of us that if we're failing or unhappy, we need to get out of sales (I'm not kidding) during the height of COVID and small business shut-down -- leading to fear, confusion, and demoralization. 

• Employees are not treated like the ""family culture"" management is always talking about, but as disposable cogs in a wheel

- some middle management gaslights employees over their concerns-- constantly finds other people or things to blame 
- dismissive of concerns of sales even when issues are permanent to sales success for the entire floor
- many different departments do not respect employee work-life balance
- handling of COVID related downsizing has been shady and unclear, again hurting morale and driving a feeling that the front-line employees are not cared for. (I cannot overstate enough that no one wants to work for someone/a company that doesn't care about them or their concerns in their role)
- Constant changing of team/role responsibilities directly impacting teams' abilities to do their jobs, with little to no regard for their financial stability or day to day support in their role. 

• Pay is below industry standard, and while most of us were hired on as AEs to work inbound leads (a pro when your base is so low), the entire org has moved to outbound and our pay is no longer reflective of the work we do. Role descriptions were changed mid spring with no regard to anyone or their quotas

- there are also BDRs getting paid higher base than AEs. 

• Changes are made with expectations of ""results yesterday"", but the changes are often unsupported

- trainings coming after a change is rolled out-- product, CRM, pricing, etc type changes
- enablement material such as email sequences (that sales is supposed to heavily rely on but does not have permissions to edit or alter) have still not been updated to reflect any of the multiple, significant changes our product has undergone in the last 5 months. Blame for this is never really addressed but is shrugged off
- what little communication and transparency BirdEye did have has been totally lost, resulting in constant confusion and low morale
- no one appears to *actually* be held accountable for struggles on the sales floor other than the reps with quotas and their managers
- Overall disorganization and lack of transparency from top to bottom of org"
139,Birdeye,Great place to work at,2020-07-18,5.0,Product Management,"BirdEye is a young SaaS company that has an incredible & innovative product. Lot of pros -
- Non Hierarchical
- Ownership and results driven
- Dynamic environment, talented team, awesome engineers, open culture
- Transparency
- Flexibility to structure your salary to save tax
- Not for someone who is looking to do a regular 9-5 job. There is decent amount of work regularly, and when you are looking for more learning opportunities, you cannot shy away from that.","Most of the standard benefits not present -
- Reimbursement of phone, internet
- Standard group insurance with standard cover covering entire family
- Gym allowance, Cab facility etc.
- Generous stock options"
140,Birdeye,Great Place to Work!....Come Join us!!,2020-07-17,5.0,Sales,"I've only been here a few months, but I can already say without hesitation that I've never worked at company more dedicated to product innovation, customer success and employee happiness than Birdeye.",None that I've experienced yet!
141,Birdeye,Great Company!,2020-07-17,5.0,Account Executive SMB,Great support from upper management! Innovative company that continuously develops world-class products that are very easy to sell.,I have yet to find something to talk negatively about
142,Birdeye,Very grateful to work in here,2020-07-04,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"I have to say that this is absolutely the best company I’ve ever worked for so far. From company culture, products, leadership, management, coworkers, work flow, benefits and etc, everything seems great to me either it’s before COVID-19 or after. My skill set and experience have grown and expanded a lot in the past few months. From the interview on the first day until today, I felt like everyone I’ve met and worked with is showing that THEY CARE, they care about the company, they care about the work they do, they care about the clients and they care about each other. I’m super grateful for those I’ve worked with closely especially my manager and peers. They truly listen to you and understand you well, they are competent, articulate, helpful, patient, respectful and collaborative. It’s definitely been both an honor and pleasure to work with them. I think everyone and everything here are demonstrating the company's four values: Customer Happiness, Innovation, World-Class, and Family Spirit. So I’m so grateful that I can be part of this family and work on awesome things everyday.",Nothing I can think of.
143,Birdeye,Just keeps getting better!,2020-07-02,5.0,Major Account Executive,"BirdEye is by far the best company I have ever worked for! The leadership, product, and co-workers are best in class! I love the ability to collaborate with everyone from the CEO to the engineering team at any time. The sales teams are full of smart, successful, and driven people. The products are easy to sell and the teams that support our clients are world-class! BirdEye is the EPITOME of Teamwork makes the dreamwork!",Nothing that stands out to me
144,Birdeye,Tuned in Leadership with core values that are driving principles,2020-07-02,5.0,Customer Success Manager,"BirdEye has a done a great job of hiring high quality talent from leadership down to front lines. This provides a solid vision or ""nest"" that employees can really buy in on. The product and platform are constantly being updated to stay current and relevant, so the commitment to drive innovation is high. BirdEye management is also committed to providing an inclusive environment where you can truly be yourself.","With regular platform enhancements, BirdEye is a non-stop learning environment so you never really feel that ""you know everything"". BirdEye is based in CA but has its biggest employee presence in TX, this limits growth opportunities for those not in TX. There is a lot of pressure for revenue growth and upsells, so sales is part of everyone's job."
145,Birdeye,"Great Product, Great People, Great Life",2020-07-02,5.0,Mid-Market Account Executive,"We get to sell a world-class product that our executives are always investing more in to make sure we stay the industry leaders in this space.
I love being able to wear a Hawaiian shirt, shorts, and flip flops in the middle of the summer.
Snacks are always handy and Lunch is provided every Friday.
Management truly cares about you not only at work but outside of work as well.","Things change a lot, and I feel like we focus on too many things at once in regards to KPI's, forecasting, meetings, more meetings."
146,Birdeye,Very innovative team,2020-07-02,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Great team always looking to innovate the product to help its customers. Everyone at BirdEye is easy to work with, treats each other with respect, and strives to be great.",The internal training program is coming together nicely but not all the way there yet.
147,Birdeye,Fantastic place to work for those who want to build and innovate!,2020-07-02,5.0,Anonymous Employee,Executive team is very focused and collaborative. The company strategy is sound and during Covid they have been extremely supportive and communicated effectively. I am very proud to be at BirdEye and be part of the action!,None that I can think of. Great opportunity!
148,Birdeye,My other family- Welcome to the Nest!,2020-07-02,5.0,Implementation Specialist,"There are many Pros- 
1.) I have experienced a true willingness to serve our clients
2.) Strong female leadership 
3.) Support from all channels of leadership from direct manager to cofounder of the company
4.) Open to new ideas and suggestions
5.) A family connection
6.) Consistent new developments/releases in the product
7.) Dedication to training and promoting employees
8.) Teamwork and support from across channels- Sales, Customer Success
9.) Investing in upgrading tools needed to complete work
10.) Flexible work schedule and trust that you can complete your expected workload","I have not experienced many cons:
1.)This is a company that is still growing and developing protocols, so if you do not like trying and adjusting- may not be the best fit. I love it because I can add my experience and ideas and help develop what I think is the best fit. 
2.)You will be busy! In the Implementation role especially, you will be managing many projects at once and will be expected to show results. Again, this is something that I enjoy- the day goes by quickly, I feel that I accomplished a lot each day, leadership praises/congratulates you for your hard work!"
149,Birdeye,DO NOT WORK HERE (ALSO KNOW THIS REVIEW WILL BE DELETED LIKE THE OTHERS),2020-06-30,1.0,Account Executive,"Cool people and free snacks (this was, of course, only before Covid as we have been working from home since the end of March)","Things were okay before Covid, but just ok. Birdeye is still in a start-up phase so things were definitely never perfect. But once the president, Dave, got hired on and Covid-19 hit, things became a living hell. 

Within the first month they laid off over 30% of their employees but then hired externally 3 sales engineers, sales trainers (search up Guru Ganesha, he trained us, you will have a good laugh if you look him up online I promise you!), VP of enterprise, and VP of marketing.

Sales were dropping significantly as Birdeye is the highest price product (we are priced 3x higher then our competitors, but do practically the same thing) and we were in a pandemic. But instead of acknowledging this, they blamed their salesforce and would yell at us almost everyday and force us to work overtime with no extra pay (also our quota never lowered during this time). I know multiple people that had to quit because they were having panic attacks and suffering from depression because management was treating us so terribly. 

After this technique of theirs didn't work (shocker!), they started making more cuts and blamed it on sales performance, trying to stop employees from receiving unemployment insurance. 

This company is extremely shady!! They are firing people left to right but are continually hiring externally as well, mostly for upper level position. Something really weird and fishy is going on, and everyone knows it. Even last week a manager quit on the spot... 

Whatever you do, do not work here, its not worth it!!!!!"
150,Birdeye,"Massive Bait and Switch (they force employees to write good reviews, don't believe them)",2020-06-26,1.0,Sales,"The same cliches you'll see at most startups - fun coworkers, good benefits, etc. I enjoyed going to work before they fired all of my friends.","Pay is below industry average for sales, middle/upper management is shady and incompetent, company keeps spinning their wheels without growth. I was at Birdeye for over a year and the company has shrunk! Not great for a ""fast growing startup"". There is massive turnover because of low pay and unsustainable and toxic business practices. Managers don't have any idea what they're doing so there has not been a single sales rep who got better after being there. If you love being micromanaged by someone who is clueless then this is the place for you! When I first started I was excited and thought the company had a lot of room to grow, but after seeing people drop like flies, BirdEye underperform its competitors, and the abusive middle management in the sales org I had to get out of there. Please don't trust the reviews, they pressure new people to write 5* reviews before they know anything about the company. I'd be shocked if they don't somehow try to get my review taken down too."
151,Birdeye,Innovative and are the best at what they do!,2020-06-13,5.0,Customer Success Manager,"Birdeye is the best company because they care about family spirit, and support their employees as well as their customers. They are innovative and are the best at what they do!",I have no cons at all.

BirdEye has a great culture, where you're excited to go into work and see your colleagues.  The company does a good job of celebrating achievements and making individuals feel special when doing a great job. Everyone is very supportive and wants to see you achieve.  There is always someone willing to help answer questions and problem-solve if needed.",I can't think of any cons

169,Birdeye,Decide for yourself!,2019-12-07,2.0,Account Executive,"Itis overall good company. Growing. 
Below is not a pro or a con, but what you would find at BirdEye:  is that a very expensive hiring spree is going on right now.  Its going to make this company very top-heavy. Revenues anyways don't support having so many top positions etc (and their salaries). This money pressure will force top management to let go of some mid-management, citing performance. This will in turn increase work for top management and then they will churn, due to insane work pressure. This has been a typical employee cycle since BirdEye started. In the current times, please be careful while you are here or planning to join. The only people who will survive is with no personal life.","No cons as such. A good and fast-paced workplace.

Great company with tremendous leadership and potential. Warm Onboarding. Product and trainings are impeccable. Management and leadership really cares about their direct reports and do the best they can to best position everyone here for success. No company is perfect but BirdEye has a solution's oriented culture that is really focused on problem solving and facilitating change that is conducive for the company and everyone else. BirdEye appreciates their employees and fosters a culture of collaboration and transparency as well.
You also have a voice here. You can make an immediate impact and help change the culture and discourse. The level of positive traction and upward growth the company is experiencing is unprecedented.",No cons. Any process or issue BirdEye might have today is being remedied and fixed. Nothing is ever perfect but the beauty of any imperfection is the consistent growth BirdEye is experiencing and this collective mindset by everyone is taking us to new heights. I am serious!

173,Birdeye,Just not a great Dallas start up,2019-10-29,2.0,Account Manager,Coworkers are great but management stinks,"They failed to get a round of funding because the investment companies learned of the massive turnover and closing of multiple offices (their competitors all received funding recently)

The entire enterprise sales had trouble competing in that space and collapsed. 

Multiple Vice President of Sales have left in the past 2 years with an average stay of 2-4 months. They left for great companies like Salesforce, Compass but Naveen downplays it as if they took a step back in their career

They have trouble attracting top talent and promote those who drink the kool-aid

The CFO is also HR so a major conflict of interest. They once had an HR hire quit in her first week after so saw the corruption and backwards policies. 

I’ve worked at 5 start ups and BirdEye is by far the most toxic and poorly run I’ve ever seen. 

I wouldn’t refer my worst enemy to this dump

Quitting Birdeye was the happiest day of my career. So many great companies in the Dallas area with better pay, product and most importantly management 

Save your generic HR reply Waifu. Birdeye won’t be around in 3 years let alone be going public."

At BirdEye I feel like I've finally found what I've been looking for. I know that sounds like a strong statement but everything I've seen in engineering align so nicely. The talent on the team is amazing. I've worked with some smart engineers in the past, but the level of commitment and ownership here is impressive. The passion the entire team has and the pride they take in what we're doing is such a motivating. Most of the people are focused on getting work done. 
The lack of politics is definitely a plus. I'm looking forward to work here for many more years.","There is plenty of help if you ask, but if you're expecting a spoon feeding, this is not that place."

195,Birdeye,Happy to be out,2019-07-15,3.0,Anonymous Employee,"Some of the teams have a few of the best and hardest working people I've ever partnered with.
Has potential to be something really great with the right leadership and strategy","Poor management - little ownership of actions and decisions starts at the very top
Zero work life balance - you're expected to work like a sweatshop employee
Very few perks in the office - Think of all the things a standard company/start up would have and kiss them goodbye. 
No corporate direction - there is a hyper focus to just generate more income without any thought to the long term stability of the accounts,  company and product.
No personal career path growth"
196,Birdeye,Finance,2019-07-08,5.0,Current Employee,"Smart, intelligent, hardworking coworkers, good manager, great perks, and always being challenged to do an outstanding work.","There are times when it's difficult to disconnect, however overall its not that bad."

- If you can do the job, there are endless opportunities to grow
- Transparency and autonomy (of course, depending on your level) 
- Focus on automation

- Overall company focus on revenue and growth
- Finally, it's amazing to see a company of this size balance scale and grow",I know we are working on it but the internal systems need to be rewired to make life simpler.

200,Birdeye,"Great company to grow, be challenged",2019-07-02,5.0,Marketing,There is a lot of freedom to do your best work. Decisions are made based on data and you can always try something provided you can drive it to the finish line. Everyone in the company (including founders) is pretty accessible due to the flat structure.,Travel opportunities are low which could be good for some but not so good for others.
201,Birdeye,Don't take it from me - BirdEye is the #1 reviews software per G2,2019-07-02,5.0,Account Executive,"I've worked at four companies in my career and seen many others and BirdEye is, hands down, the best on so many levels. I have been able to work with some of the smartest people I've ever met, been given incredibly challenges to solve, have had a ton of fun, and have been able to help our customers be successful. While BirdEye has already accomplished a lot, the best days are still ahead.","If you are new at BirdEye, embrace yourself for challenges but I promise, you will enjoy working here."
202,Birdeye,Becoming more than just a marketing tool,2019-07-02,5.0,Product,"There is nothing that fires me up more than being on a growing team and moving from an application, to a stack of products, to eventually a platform and figuring out how to become a google, facebook, amazon, etc. catered to SMBs. The possibilities really are endless for the company from that perspective as we have gone from a mere marketing tools, to Customer Experience platform. As an employee, the possibilities for growth are endless, assuming you can over perform.","We push to this idea of becoming the best CX platform (which is great), but the challenging part is the speed in which we do it."
203,Birdeye,Great place to work,2019-07-02,5.0,Software Engineer,"Flexibility, culture, free food are all pros at BirdEye.",I will say learning programs is currently a con but I see forward progress.

Fast paced.","Lately, There has been some dirty politics going on, that takes away all the energy and good reasons to come and work.
Politics is everywhere but considering it is a startup, you would not feel like you are learning or growing in any way. Management here in this section has changed for the worse.
The best part they know, they can get away with almost anything in the name of numbers and what on. 

Culture &values 4 stars - because HR :)"

208,Birdeye,Growth through hard work,2019-06-27,5.0,Customer Success,"BirdEye is the best place I've ever worked. BirdEye offers flexibility unlike any past employers I've ever worked with.

Being a working mom, this is one of the several difference makers in my day to day. If I need to leave early or come in late, no one ever questions it. This comes from setting a standard of trust within all BirdEye employees. It's expected that you dedicate your self to working hard and when you need to handle life as well all do, there are no issue at all. During my time here, yes there have been growing pains as there are in any scaling business.","There is a great deal of change that happens constantly, this has produced great results over time but if new processes and products aren't in your wheelhouse BirdEye won't be a fit."
209,Birdeye,Building a rockitship,2019-06-25,5.0,Account Executive,Great culture. Everyone there wants you to succeed. You are given a lot of autonomy which is supported by required transparency.,"As with many scale-ups, we have some challenges too but nothing that is unmanageable."
210,Birdeye,Great workplace,2019-06-25,5.0,Sales Development Representative,Some exciting benefits and you get to work among a really nice group of people. The size of the company is pretty decent but the fast paced culture is what makes it a startup. It's fun to work here.,I don't see any downsides of working here.
211,Birdeye,*Applicant beware - it is NOT what it seems*,2019-06-15,1.0,Account Executive,"They have a snack bar. .

The only other positive thing I'll say going for them are the employees.  There are some great people working at this company whose talents are very under-utilized.","IN SHORT: BirdEye is more interested in people looking busy than in making sales, gaining market share or empowering their staff to be successful and they won't hear a word of input, suggestions or reason. They don't want ideas or outside-the-box thinking and the only answer given on how to get some traction is doubling down on what isn't working and making more calls. They claim to be agile and aggressively expanding but they are obstinate to making a deal with anyone. They expect the market to bend to the way they want to do business rather than making it an easy choice for them to implement their software. They can't be bothered with creativity and have no room for introspection and asking how can we be better at what we do or how can we be more effective. If you love to be micromanaged, then you'll be right at home. The only way they could micro-manage more is if they require a bathroom sign-in sheet.

DEEPER LOOK: I was completely mislead about the position during the  interview process. I interviewed several times with several managers, including senior leadership and asked direct, specific questions about the position, it's expectations and the method by which I was expected to prospect and sell. I was told my results were what was important, not how I got them and that my specific experience was of heightened interest to BirdEye as they were very eager to break into the market I have had years of success in and that duplicating that success at BirdEye is the ultimate goal. To be direct, I specifically asked if there were call expectations or if other means to prospect were embraced and utilized at BirdEye because I was not the guy to come in and dial a phone all day - not because one can't be successful doing so, but because there is a much more effective way to sell into the market I have a proven history of success in. The answer to that question was not at all, we want you to bring what has made you successful and apply it to our product. I was told to ""kill what you hunt"".

This is exactly what you want to hear from a potential employer - looking to break into new markets, eager to hire experts in these markets and are open to new ideas on how to gain market share, offering full autonomy to use formulas that have been proven to be successful and apply them to an exciting, growing company with a great product that has a solution to a huge problem. All very compelling...until my second day out of training when I was asked by upper management ""what do you do all day? Where are the calls?""  It caught me a bit off guard, but I thought ""this is just coming from excitement to get the new team rolling"" - which I could relate to and was eager to get some momentum. 

From that point, it was a steady progression to setting minimum call requirements for the day, no answer or help on certain tools and programs not working properly, absolutely zero support from a sales standpoint, zero interest in my input and ideas on how to get traction in the market or how my years of experience in the industry could be utilized to refine our processes or use best practices. I voiced my concerns to management, who has absolutely no experience or leadership skills to speak of, who would ""take note"" of my concerns but they were never addressed. The only response I would get is that I needed to show some success with doing it their way, then once I had success doing it their way I might be able to get some buy in to try it another way. That is the actual response I was given. If I was seeing success, why on earth would I want to change it???  

This continued for the last 3 months and the workplace became increasingly uncomfortable as it was blatantly obvious that my direct manager and senior leadership's perspective of me had changed. I very quickly went from feeling like part of the team to being an outsider. Asking questions or for help was treated like an inconvenience. In my exit interview, I brought up the breathtakingly drastic difference between what I was told while interviewing to where we are now was ethically questionable and could have been avoided had the company just been honest with me about what they wanted rather than say whatever people want to hear in order to get them in the door. I was told that after hiring me, they brought in an actual recruiter and in refining their recruiting process, put a ""hard stop"" to certain practices and are sorry that I had a poor experience. This is an acknowledgment that unethical practices have been exercised to recruit people, but no consideration had been given to me to, despite this."
212,Birdeye,"Incredible culture, opportunities, great benefits",2019-05-14,5.0,Account Executive,"BirdEye culture is incredible, from co-workers to management to free snacks/coffee/free lunch (once a week). BirdEye does things at a high level. Very collaborative culture with an emphasis on empowering individuals to make decisions and learn from mistakes. Plenty of coaching from the managers!

I love that BirdEye takes calculated risks when hiring people with focus on strong aptitude and willingness to learn. In my case, I was not at the level that was required.  This was all explained prior to hire, I should mention. So, again, transparency in expectations with the support to help you become successful is what makes BirdEye stand out amongst other companies.","Only challenge is the learning curve of the product, it's pretty deep."
213,Birdeye,I love the Company,2019-05-09,5.0,Account Executive,"* Solid product
* Great opp with the large customer base

215,Birdeye,Fast paced company,2019-05-09,5.0,Product Manager,Lots of driven individuals. Moving fast is in our DNA.,Priorities may change often but that gives us agility so not necessarily a problem.
216,Birdeye,They Write Fake Reviews,2019-05-01,1.0,Account Executive,They provide lunch on Fridays,"Management will lie to you about earnings, promotions, and culture of the company. There's lots of micromanaging, they will try to push you out if they don't like you, and they say most people hit quota - in reality, only 10-15% do, so expect to make around $50-60k. They also have been caught writing fake reviews on their Google page, their own website, and this site. Just read the comments on some of the Glassdoor reviews, no one actually speaks like that about their company - it's comical."
217,Birdeye,Some of the most amazing people I've met,2019-04-30,5.0,Sales Manager,"- Incredible colleagues
- Senior managements is unbelievably transparent, honest and accountable.
- A lot of people are very mission-oriented
- Great place to build your career","Not much, so many good things."
218,Birdeye,Current employee working for an year as a software engineer in Gurgaon office,2019-04-30,5.0,Software Engineer,"- Well executed projects
- Good engineering managers
- Growth opportunities
- Good culture",I did not find any con so far.
219,Birdeye,Fortunate to be working at BirdEye,2019-04-30,5.0,Technical Support,"- Company cares about the employees
- Company focuses a lot on the culture and employee happiness
- The work is very satisfying and at times technical in nature
- The employees here truly care about the customers","It's a very healthy company, can't think of any"
220,Birdeye,I love my job,2019-04-29,5.0,Sales Account Executive,"BirdEye is doing things that no one else in customer experience industry, and the work itself is really cool. Compensation is reasonable. Coworkers are almost all highly competent and very helpful.","In order to be successful here, you gotta be a hunter."
221,Birdeye,Great environment and cutting edge technology,2019-04-29,5.0,Senior Software Engineer,"Fast-paced work environment; a lot to learn. Working on some cutting edge technology.
The culture is open and supportive with good collaboration.
Most of the people are open to hear feedback.","Unless you live close to the office, commute and traffic could be an issue like for any other company in Gurgaon."
222,Birdeye,Churn and Burn,2019-04-26,1.0,Account Executive,"Hard working and competitive co-workers
No geographic territories
Free lunch Fridays and stacked snacks and drinks
Young Staff","While there are many positives to working for a SaaS company in hyper-growth, BirdEye does not have that feel or benefit.  The sales operation is run in way where you are worked until you are burned out.  You receive a 3 month ramp quota (which is great) and are likely to hit and exceed quota in that time.  You're commission will be through the roof and you will think this is the greatest place ever.  This is also the time they ask new employees to leave Glassdoor reviews (hence the high rating).  Unfortunately those will be the best times for your bank account.  The monthly quotas only adjust upward based on working days in the month and are unrealistic.  It is a giant Inside Sales ""factory"".

The work/life balance is not one you would expect from other young tech companies in DFW or even ones with Silicon Valley roots.  PTO is very limited and you are required to use it for a sick day.  

The office location is in Las Colinas which is inconvenient for the young staff they continue to hire.  Most live in Dallas and the commute each day can be a burden."
223,Birdeye,Burning Ship,2019-04-23,1.0,Sales Development Representative,The co-workers are great especially the SDR’s. That’s about it.,"They say you make around 50-60k as SDR is totally not true. You will barely make 30k. 

Tons of qualifications to jump through to finally get credit  for an account that demos. 

Management will make open promises just to keep you around in your current position. No clear justifications on promotions. Say they want to promote within but they only hired outside while I was there. 

It’s almost like they don’t want to pay their employees. Except for people in the “inner circle” who get accounts fed to them. 

Tons more"
224,Birdeye,Do not believe the (good) reviews. Or work here.,2019-04-15,1.0,Manager,"Free insurance 
Some lovely people","No paid parental leave. You have to use PTO. Which is accrued.
The CEO. The CEO. The CEO.
Extremely high turnover rate
They ask for reviews from employees after they’ve been there 6 weeks. There’s pressure to say nice things because it’s obvious who the reviewer is.
Did I mention the CEO? Why is he so bad, you may be asking. 
-He has delusional expectations for his company and his employees
-He’s an engineer with no business experience 
-He changes the direction/strategy of the company literally 5 times a week
-He’s sexist
-He does not know what he is doing
-He is cheap and lowballs employees
-He only listens to his yes men who also have no idea on how to run a business 
-He has no respect for other people’s time 
-He has to learn everything the hard way
-He promotes a culture of fear and chaos
-He really, really hates getting a review that is less than 5 stars. I’m actually expecting him or his yes man to call me to ask me to change this review (like he did with a friend of mine)"
225,Birdeye,You reap as you sow!,2019-04-07,5.0,Senior Technical Support Engineer,This organisation proves time and again that there is very less tolerance for politics and the people not contributing in overall collective team success will be shut down. Our managers and leader shouldn’t feel bad with some false smear you see here. Our Tech support team is doing great. Now waiting for new engineers to hit mainstream.,Nothing as such. Keep doing great.

We get a lot done in small span of time - just because the top management is really passionate of the BirdEye's growth and getting things right. Product is broad as well as deep with lot of focus on continuous improvement. We have a lot of fun and it feels like there isn't anyone here dragging us down which has been a problem at some of the companies I've worked for in the past.,"The speed is definitely not for everyone.

237,Birdeye,Large scope of improvement,2019-03-28,1.0,Technical Support Engineer,Good software company to work with but only until 1 year ago. The culture was good then. There was no micromanagement. Friendly environment. Seniors used to listen. Product is good. Compensation is fair. Food quality is not that good but it is free so cannot complain.,Past few months the company transformed into a call center. Lot of micromanagement. Seniors and leaders don't have time for the employees. The feel good factor is lost. They make personal comments and you cannot go to HR because he is biased. They have started to ask not to take our own leaves. Now they are forcing to work on weekends with no extra pay or overtime. There is no personal life and no work life balance. Top management is least bothered to look into it. Culture and values are only on walls and nowhere seen. Cannot recommend anybody to birdeye.

- Fast-paced cultures can be overwhelming for some and any would be applicants should consider if that is an environment that suits their personality. 

- Lone wolves should apply with the intention of learning how to be a team player because this sales office is very collaborative and any member of any team is usually willing to help anyone out."
281,Birdeye,Account Executive BirdEye Review,2018-10-11,5.0,Account Executive,"My favorite thing about BirdEye is the environment. Management is super involved, but not in an over bearing way. They don't micromanage, they are just truly there to help you with whatever you need. The dress code is also casual which is great plus, and the benefits are awesome.","There really aren't any cons.

Everyone is always willing to jump in and lend a helping hand... making for a highly collaborative atmosphere across all departments from executives to managers to individual contributors. There's a genuine sense of shared passion, both for BirdEye and the customers & businesses we serve.  Work/life balance is encouraged (rare for a ""startup""). Solid benefits. Fully stocked kitchen. Team outings are fun as well!",Some growing pains due to a lack of defined/streamlined processes (mostly due to the incredible/rapid growth).
285,Birdeye,Bird of a Feather Fly Together!,2018-10-05,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"I can't begin to describe how fulfilling it is to work for a company that cares about their customers.  BirdEye truly practices what they preach. 

-The product knowledge transfer process is the best I've seen at any company I've been at - they make sure everyone knows how to become a super user of the product and they are very transparent about upcoming and current releases.  The communication is impeccable. 

-They're good at hiring people (no, I'm not tooting my own horn!). Everyone that I've worked with so far is super cool and eager to help. There's a diversity of backgrounds and knowledge!  

-Good coffee (don't underestimate the power of good coffee)

-There's flexibility in attire and arrival/leaving times.  I.e. it's the end of the world at some companies if you arrive at 9:01 instead of 9:00 - BirdEye is not like that! 

-Probably the most important of all, is that leadership is very present.  Again, it's amazing working for a company that is passionate about what they do and is invested in ensuring it's done right.","As in any fast growing company, there are going to be some growing pains. I.e. some internal systems were set up without the consideration of scalability (which is understandable).  Currently, it's a bit difficult to get these back on the right track without engineering support, but I'm sure it won't be long before they're addressed."

The only con is that they cater lunch once a week as opposed to 3-4, but let's be honest, catered lunches mean bigger waistline."

The culture here within the Dallas office is great. I really enjoy coming into work every day. 

Exciting company to be a part of because of the ever-changing environment. Those of us from the Tech-world can appreciate this refreshing new feel the company has since we are still so new.","Due to the nature of being a startup sometimes things can seem a little overwhelming if you aren't used to that. Additionally, changes sometimes take some time to happen. The company is receptive to change which can be a good or bad thing depending on if you can handle an ever-changing role."

She knows what she's talking about, she'll listen to what you have to say, and willing to make a change when it needed to be. Even though we're in a sale environment, it's super competitive, but everyone willing to help each other out and cheers for each other.","They'll ramp you up really fast on quota, but you have a lot of support from the directors, managers, and sales floor to help you get where you needed to be."

It's a perfect place for someone to come in and make an immediate impact - tons of opportunity to go into larger account sales, people management or both.  The pay is fantastic (entry level employees routinely make $65k+) and the work life balance is great (tons of PTO, work from home, etc.)",High growth leads to gaps in process and right now it's hard to track down routine items that more established companies with an official HR department would have readily available.
308,Birdeye,Sales Development Representative,2018-09-04,5.0,Sales Development Representative,Fun and collaborative  environment where everyone on the team is more than willing to help.

315,Birdeye,Not a long term spot,2018-08-16,1.0,,Friendly culture. Fun people to work with.,They only hire people that are top producers from other companies. The only problem is that they bring the best from other companies and tell them they’ll make 6 figure incomes but in reality you’ll struggle to hit quota like everyone else. This place is like a revolving door and has people leaving every few weeks. They tell you in the interview that most of the team hits quota but in reality only a small amount of the people here hit quota. Don’t expect to make 6 figures unless you’re on inbound phone calls. Everyone else gets crappy leads and has a high quota.
316,Birdeye,Incompetent Senior managemen. I am saying this after observing them closely for over a year.,2018-08-14,1.0,Customer Service,Not much except that they do pay market salary to make the suffering worth it,The CEO and his brother COO are pathetic leaders and sadly running the show. All other senior hires are either busy trying to please them or looking for jobs. The CRO who was a big hire just quit within 2-3 Months of joining as he could Not handle the micro management. Not to mention other VPs that have quit in the last one year alone.

I suspect this will change over time."
321,Birdeye,Mid Market/Enterprise SDR,2018-07-26,4.0,Sales Development Representative,"Strong team. Everyone wants everyone to succeed. The SDR Manager actually wants what s best for you. Not a common trait, but if you had an issue he would go to battle for you. Makes you want to work harder. 

Also the tech/product is top notch. I still believe it is the best ORM software out there and it is getting better.","The excuse ""growing pains"" are thrown around too much. It covers for lack of transparency on issues, and poor management. Things are turning around, but more focused could be had on alleviating some communication and training issues"

- Founders are always accessible. Upper management always willing to help.
- Despite being a younger company, it is apparent that managers care about the career trajectory of employees, and how to bring out the best in each person.
- The general climate is not loud, and people are truly empathetic and respectful of the shared space. Strong CEO supported effort to ensure that everyone is valved, regardless of function (none of the marketing vs sales or contractors vs FTE etc politics that can occur).","- Company is growing very fast. It's an exciting time, but that also means that the future state could be very different than the environment today. It is definitely a challenge to maintain the quality as the company scales.
- Not the place to be if you need a lot of direction. Also not the place to be if you are easily frustrated.
- People love what they do, and will work to get ""it"" done, which can mean longer than typical days."

334,Birdeye,What a Joke,2018-03-29,1.0,Account Executive,"Mac hardware, decent office view from a nice building in the DTC.  Not much else that I can think of.","CEO doesn’t know what he is doing and is reactive versus strategic about his vision. Entire enterprise sales team has left because of the CEO, and they now consider themselves an SMB product because of this. 

Go-to-market strategy for social publishing was the worst I’ve ever witnessed. The product doesn’t even work, no instagram functionality, and the marketing department uses the same stock photo for all posts. Not very engaging...

I feel very bad for people that still work in sales at BirdEye."

Beautiful new offices in Dallas.   Competitive comp plans and ramp up for new salespeople.",You have to be prepared for change and growth ( not a negative actually)
339,Birdeye,Fast Growing with Great Culture!,2018-02-09,5.0,Sales,High energy company with a wide range of products for every type of business.  Beautiful new office in Dallas with the best sales team ever.   Top notch training and a management team that partners with the reps to help set career paths!  I am so happy to be a part of this remarkable company,None as far as I am aware of.
340,Birdeye,Best Place to Work,2018-02-09,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Winning Culture - Everyone wants everyone else to Win and willing to help in anyway possible.

Everyday is a new adventure and opportunity to learn and grow!  From the products, sales reps and management   the collaboration  makes coming to work so much fun!   It is exciting to produce and be recognized for all of our hard work",Nothing that I can think of
342,Birdeye,Lots of opportunity!,2018-02-08,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"I've only been here a month and it already feels like a family. I've worked at tech companies for more than five years and have never seen such a nurturing and hard working environment. Competition is not toxic here as it is in most start-up sales cultures, it's a motivator. We're all in this together. 

The executive team and leadership teams at all levels are very collaborative and decisions are rarely made without consideration of all perspectives. There is no ego at BirdEye and it's the reason we're going to succeed. The product is great, has little competition, and has clear value. The fact we have sustained our growth on pure inbound leads and we're just at the beginning, should tell you that big things are coming.

I read a few reviews that said we're not offering training and support for Sales and this is just the byproduct of growing a sales team quickly. However, this has been recognized and we're already fixing that. We now offer a full Sales Academy and Continual Learning Program that will ensure all reps hit the ground running -- confident and prepared from day one, and that everyone else has the resources and tools they need to succeed.

Plus, if you're a woman in the tech world (especially Sales) you know how hard it is to feel heard and represented. This is not an issue here. BirdEye makes sure that everyone has a voice. The entire leadership team for one segment of the Sales org is even all female. If you've even slightly payed attention to the News, you know how rare that is! Opportunities for leadership exist for anyone, no matter who they are. It's one of the reasons I'm proud to work here.

Also free gym & lunch on Fridays","- The Dallas office is in Irving
- No free snacks/drinks
- Not enough social outings (though I think this is changing)"
343,Birdeye,Average product with serious leadership challenges,2018-02-05,1.0,Account Executive,"Brought on some top talent in Denver with promises of lots of money to be made and career opportunities, however it never materialized so all the good people left.  The turnover in sales is higher than I have ever seen at another tech company.",CEO has never run a company before and it shows.  The lack of self-awareness and inability to build a successful culture will be their downfall.  The product is about the same as any other reputation solution in the market so deals come down to price.
344,Birdeye,SINKING SHIP,2018-02-03,1.0,Anonymous Employee,The software is innovative Software and most of the people are good.,I’d think twice before taking a huge risk at joining BirdEye. There is a huge disconnect amongst senior leadership and each individual’s vision for the company. Leadership seems to lack the experience and the knowledge of how to run and grow a successful business. The training that’s provided is minimal and not very thought out. There aren’t many resources available to help reps succeed.
345,Birdeye,PLEASE BE CAREFUL...,2018-01-18,1.0,Anonymous Employee,Great people work here. Great hard working people. Who dedicate themselves to the company.,"There has been a huge amount of positive reviews that just seem dishonest. Executive team does not care at all about employees. They are slowly pushing everyone out the door. Team members who started with them from the start have been treated horribly. Executive team makes promises that they never keep. They preach employee happiness, but never follow through with anything that actually helps the culture. No training is provided at all from the start. No resources to help an employee succeed. Zero career path. They truly set you up for failure. I’ve never worked for a company who cares so little about their people. There has been so many people leaving, pushed out, and abandoned by this company. I really hope anyone who is considering working here think twice. You will be blinded at first, but will understand what I mean. The product was great, but you will quickly learn that they will take away features without any training to help you combat it. They will also take away key components and keep quota the same. I understand that changes will happen. But at least train us on how to handle them. And at least give us time to learn how to handle them. Instead they keep quota the same(or even raise them) while removing key features that helped us sell the product in the first place. It’s like selling a meal at McDonald’s. Then taking away the fries and drink, and expecting us to sell it at the same price. They brag about how well the company is doing, but don't care about how the employees are doing. I feel bad for all of my colleagues, because they are truly great people. Who are not being valued for their commitment. I beg anyone who is considering this company to read all the negative reviews written. Find a company who actually cares about people. Find a company who actually has compassion for the well being of people. I don't want anyone else to be treated this way. I have to say that this was the worse experience I have ever had at a company. BirdEye is used to help our customers use reviews to improve their business. Instead of taking our negative reviews and trying to make a change. The CEO rather focus his energy on finding who wrote the review to get them to remove it. I  just hope this review has helped."

2) The product - It's easy selling something that you know WORKS and is leading our industry.  We are always innovating and launching new features, and literally the product gets better every month.
3) Transparency -  This is anywhere from my boss, to transparency in company meetings, within the team, etc. 
4) Opportunity - I've personally and professional grown so much in one year. The company is growing so fast (but not too fast) that I think in the next year or so there are going to be so many opportunities that come up if you do well and hit your number.  Every time we have Sales or All Hands Meetings, I come out of them excited for the future of my career and the company.",The obvious con - it's a startup so there are growing pains.

- A few great people to learn from
- Huge Salary

I joined from failed ecommerce startup at salary hike of 150% but realized it is mistake to run after money.","- No work life balance.  You have to work on weekends and on national holidays 
- Even after all this work, there is very little appreciation 
-  Many times employees are scolded by management to make fun of us. 
- Giving high salary is always used as a reason to make sure you work on weekends and many times you work 2-3 days continuously. 

People in top management in India are so incompetent and are just trying to survive in the hope of a buyout.
The HR keeps track of the average number of hours spent in the office by each employee and shares it publicly."
392,Birdeye,It's the place to be!,2017-07-31,5.0,Senior Product Manager,"If you want to challenge yourself, extend beyond your comfort zone to grow professionally, BirdEye is the place to be. Very dynamic, fast paced and yet a supporting family-like-culture where members from different teams/profiles/locations are always happy to help. 

You'd get loads to learn, own and execute; essentially to prove your mettle. A place where the objectivity and crisp thought process will be appreciated as opposed to the subjective globally accepted gyan.","Cannot call it a downside or a con, but at times, things change pretty frequently. That being said, that's how fast paced agile teams work after all."

- Teamwork comes naturally to everyone working here. 
- Very impressive management team and board.
- This is a company that is very open to good ideas and moves quickly to make positive changes.
- They care about their employees, they see them as people, and they celebrate and recognize people many times a day.","- It's cold in the office but, they actually provide blankets :)

You would learn a lot on how to perform in Startup.",Change in India office leadership is affecting morale.  CTO focuses on getting things done by hook or crook.

398,Birdeye,Winning atmosphere,2017-06-26,4.0,Sales Associate,Great team and culture. Great product. Set your own hours. Work hard play hard.,Due to leads and some other changes (quotas etc.) most of the office isn't hitting quota which means low to no commission checks. A lot of this is due to deals falling through.
399,Birdeye,Amazing place for engineers,2017-06-07,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Great learning environment. Open to experiment with latest and upcoming technologies. Team events (cricket, rafting), free food (breakfast, lunch) and gym.","We work hard, if needed late evenings or weekends, some may not like it"
400,Birdeye,I Would Pass,2017-05-24,2.0,Anonymous Employee,"Decent Pay and Insurance Benefits
People at the local level are great.","Where to start: This company is a great example of a startup that thinks way too much of itself, or rather the founders do.

To begin with, there isn't much in the product that other companies couldn't do.  So much work is done offshore in India which means its CHEAP and so you get what you pay for.

As an organization, things are so scattered, so disorganized and dysfunctional that when they talk of the company going public one day I hope no one blows a fortune investing."

407,Birdeye,Beware of CEO,2017-04-27,1.0,Anonymous Employee,Great technology and scaling industry,"CEO has a habit it of adjusting workers stock (including mine) - zero, I repeat, zero ethics. Cares only about getting rich. The company is very profitable and doing well. His strategy is simple: People trust him, they build the company and he screws them. He is the exact example of the nasty side of greed in tech."
408,Birdeye,Moving to BirdEye has been the best career move I've made so far.,2017-04-24,5.0,Account Executive,"I am a Sales Professional and can sell anything that I personally believe in. At BirdEye, the SaaS is something that is a no-brainer for every business that wants to scale and grow. We even offer free trials to prove value before ever asking for a signature. To match the great service we're selling, the comp plan is very generous as well. I will be able to do about $30k more this year than last year at my previous position. The company pays for great insurance benefits, generous PTO, etc. The thing that I'm most satisfied with and excited about here is the company culture. I was told up-front that everything revolved around the company's core values: Integrity, Altruism, and Family. I couldn't be more excited about my future here at BirdEye.","Because we are a tech startup, we are always evolving, growing, changing, and altering things. If you're someone who doesn't do well with change, then this may not be the best company for you at this point in time. I personally love the forward-thinking style that the company operated with, however, I could see that some people may not prefer this style of business."

Great benefits plan.","Worked there 18 months.  Was promised a raise twice and never saw one.  Sales will always get more recognition, but support is responsible for retention and customer satisfaction and there is never any financial reward for going the extra mile at this company.  That needs to change.

Too little PTO for a professional organization. 

Absolutely no career path for customer care."

I've worked at a couple over the last 10 years and being able to contribute to something as it's growing and evolving is awesome. It's not easy. We have a lot of training sessions these days because we are continually rolling out new features to our product offerings. I put in longer hours not because I'm required to, but because when I get on a roll, I don't want to stop and want to contribute any way I can. The space we're in is cramped right now and it can get loud when everyone is on the phone, but the buzz it creates is exciting! This place is a rocket ship and I'm along for the ride!","Our office is a little cramped with the amount of growth we've had and in such a short time. PTO is accrued, unlike anywhere else I've worked, which is tough as it's just a couple hours a pay period. Can make it hard to plan vacations and any time off for awhile after starting"
417,Birdeye,Customer Success Manager,2016-10-29,1.0,Customer Success Manager,The ability to work remotely is the only pro that I can offer about the company.  The accounts I serviced from the beginning quickly showed improvement.,The whole company.  They are not honest and deceive you.  You are treated as an employee with no benefits.  They hire you as a contract position but dictate the hours you work and how the work is performed.  The lack of communication causes great distress in which you have no control of.  Other managers lack in care and dedication areas passed from person to person when accounts are not handled as expected.

Birdeye's engineering team has put together an incredible product, and its fun to show our clients everything  Birdeye is capable of doing for them. 

The company is growing at an incredibly fast pace and no two days are alike. The pace is a challenge - but a good one. One person can have a huge impact on Birdeye's performance and culture.","The company is still young, so some of the creature comforts of larger organizations do not exist yet."

Ability to Learn - Opportunity to own your role and develop it in the direction you'd like - you and the company can both grow together.
Great Leadership Team - they provide excellent strategic direction and visibility into the larger picture.
Be Heard - Everyone has a voice in this company, what you say matters!
Great Location!","Expanding Quickly - hard to balance the staffing needs with the growth of the company.
Time Demanding - everyone has a lot on their plate, but flexible in terms of hours and location.
Growing Fast - moving fast and breaking things is awesome, but we have to correct mistakes quickly when we make them - but at least we're allowed to break things!"

As a startup the leadership has made it clear that they will find ways to make things work, and collaborate to make the product more dynamic.  There are no dumb questions!

Couldn't be happier with my time with BirdEye thus far, and looking forward to the months and years ahead!","Can be some long hours, but the time and effort pays off.. literally. Must be prepared to adapt as the company grows."

I believe in what we're doing, I believe in the leadership, direction and approach that BirdEye is taking and as a result that's directly correlated with that...I believe in BirdEye's future. It's a great opportunity with a great company that I'm proud to be a part of.

The atmosphere is fast paced, energetic and fun. Building and creating the right culture is extremely important here. They're very specific and deliberate with their hiring process, which I think is a good thing. They're bringing on smart, hard working, progressive, innovative, intelligent people who also know how to have fun in the process. The managers and directors care about your success as it directly affects the success of the company. They want you to learn, they want to see you grow professionally and they want you to be successful as well.","I have nothing negative to say at this point. At this stage, there's a lot of work to be done to continue to grow and expand. However, I don't think that's a negative thing. I look at it as a great opportunity that will pay off in the end."

The benefits are solid!","We try to do a lot of things all at once, and it causes a less than favorable work-life balance.
Compensation is below average."
425,Birdeye,Learning and growing...,2016-05-18,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Every single employee can influence innovation and get their ideas implemented pretty much every week. To have a real impact everyday is very rewarding for me. Management encourages employees to take risk and break stuff (but fix it fast). Everyone is so smart and talented (I'm learning a lot), small teams and it's all-around great culture (friday happy hour snacks and drinks).","Some of the best things about BirdEye can also be problems. Having a high potential for impact also means lot of work and not much work-life balance. But that's typical Silicon Valley startup i guess. Because everyone is smart, talented and hardworking it can come as a shock to people who are used to being a rock star."
426,Birdeye,"Awesome Company, Awesome People!",2016-05-18,5.0,Manager L Customer Care and Success,"I have worked at Birdeye for just over a year and I can’t say enough about this extraordinary company. Not many people can say that they have a job, or work for a company, were their contribution is valued and appreciated. But, I am one of those fortunate few.

Everyone, from the CEO down to each team member, is in true collaboration as we work together towards a common goal. We work hard in a fast paced, often changing environment. Which is great, that's how we grow and evolve! However, we have the advantage of having a highly supportive leadership team. Who not only supports us as a team, but supports our individual growth and success within the company.

I am proud to part of Birdeye, a company that is a leading, innovative platform in its field. An awesome customer success team whose true purpose is providing the greatest 5 star customer experience. And having the rewarding task of helping each Birdeye customer, grow their business, manage their online reputation, and ultimately support their success.","I honestly don't have any.

Doers have the chance to make a difference, everyday. The company encourages feedback and pretty much everyone has a voice about making things better.",Because of the fast pace of growth many issues are figured out and solved along the way. But I guess that is pretty common for fast growing startups.

Get to solve engineering problems that impact businesses and consumers. Excited about infrastructure, big data and machine learning areas where we are way ahead of competitors.
