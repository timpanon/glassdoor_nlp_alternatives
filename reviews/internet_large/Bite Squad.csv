High demand and expectations where they manage you like a child. Consistently have to wonder if you will keep your job if a complaint is made. Will take advantage of you fully - tell you not to worry about your job and then layoff everyone.

So in other words they wouldn’t include your tips the way it should be."
8,Bite Squad,Don't work here,2022-01-21,1.0,Delivery Driver,Literally none. This management only micro-managed and didn't work with my schedule at all.,"Micro managey management, dispatch is always rude, not willing to work with my school schedule, rude lead drivers, literally everything about this job was not ideal"
9,Bite Squad,Driver,2022-01-14,4.0,Delivery Driver,"Pay was decent, didn't cover the costs of maintenance on the vehicle, but still provided a job when I needed one.

12,Bite Squad,Potential Managers and Professionals Beware,2021-12-31,1.0,Market Success Associate,"80/20 split of duties; 80% in Field and 20% at Home.
Medical, Dental, and Vision (while expensive) are very good.","Leadership has no direction except for ""increase revenue"". Heard on multiple calls that it is the singular goal and they did not care what sort of programs were created or how wildly different things functioned as long as ""increased revenue"" was achieved.
Spend your own money on functions and events; then watch as it takes ""two weeks"" for it to be paid out to you. 
If you are expecting to be paid for mileage. Then watch as your entries are edited for clarity and hundreds of miles dissappear. Be prepared to have a GPS tracker on at all times and come out of pocket for a better track than the one expensify offers to track your mileage otherwise you may not be paid or written up if you can't prove it to leadership.
Be prepared for goals to change mid month or the last week of the month. Leaving you to scramble to meet them or face being written up. 
Be prepared to use a system with loads of errors or inaccuracies. Then be written up when you don't reach a goal because on your end it shows complete and on leaderships end you are 5% under goal. Also be prepared for leadership to say nothing will change when they are told of an error that resulted in your corrective action or tell you that ""those are the facts I see, so good luck disproving anything because you must use what I use."" And not the entirely different system you are having to use to report work. 
Be prepared to go above and beyond and then spend long hours over a weekend because the outdated system deleted all your notes, follow up tasks, and work proving what you had completed that week.
Also be prepared for anything and everything to be taken out of context or have leadership make up the most ridiculous stories they can about a situation."

-Great pay for college students around lafayette area.
-Work around college student hours well.","-Days are chaotic.
-Management sets standards, only for team leads to instruct you to break them. 
-Management will “acknowledge” feedback, but frequently not implement any changes.
-Employees talk loudly about many taboo workplace topics, such as politics, with no reprimanding.
-Horrible shift times; either you sacrifice your entire first half of the day, or the entire second half. 
shift examples: 6am-2:30pm, 2:30pm-11:30pm.
-The job is completely doable from home. But, if you’re hired right now, you WILL be expected to make a trip to the office every day. Meanwhile, coworkers that once upon a time performed well, will be continuing to freely work from home.
I began work from home because of covid, but was moved into the office about half a year in. 
Meanwhile another coworker moved to a different state and is still free to relax and work from a remote location."

31,Bite Squad,Bite squad driver review,2021-07-31,2.0,Delivery Driver,"bite squad has a flexible schedule, work when you want to work with little supervision.","there is no continuity in the locations you are sent to. there seems to be no attempt to send you to locations close to your previous delivery. You will be driving a great distance between deliveries. There are app issues: dropped orders, sent to closed locations, orders not placed when you arrive t the pick-up location. You are offered a delivery after the pickup time has passed, and because of this you are late with deliveries and receive a bad tip. I have had to call driver support for delivery or order issues, and they do not answer, or take a while to answer the call. Due to these issues, you can complete 1-2 deliveries per hour and sometimes only 1 per hour. I have had times this did not happen but it is rare to complete 3 orders in an hour. I was delivering on Friday, July 30, 2021, and was only able to complete 2 deliveries in 3 hours. I made $15 dollars for the 3 hour shift."

Literally nothing good, still have to do 20 words to say there’s nothing good about this company.","Highly disorganized organization, no communication, time off isn’t really time off as you’re still expected to answer your phone and be available. Many many more things"
34,Bite Squad,Great Opportunity with Growth Potenial,2021-07-20,4.0,Business Development Manager,"Base Salary of $50k, Residuals for 3 years and Commission per restaurant you sign up.",Small market share within the industry and a challenging market post covid.

.","They manipulate the wage system and order system and make packs with restruants with certain driver to not give them the order. It's not fair at all, and legal matters should be handled."
36,Bite Squad,Pretty good side gig,2021-07-07,5.0,Delivery Driver,Make extra money on the side,Lots of mileage on your car
37,Bite Squad,Definitely look elsewhere for delivery jobs,2021-07-06,1.0,Delivery Driver,"Easy work, but the cons severely outweigh the pros.","Dispatch is terrible at handing out orders in a manageable way.

Little to no interaction besides the actual delivery process.
You can listen to whatever you want to, it's your car.","You aren't making enough to combat the wearing of your vehicle.
Orders aren't designated by area, so you are being sent haphazardly across town.
No advancement.
Tips seemed to be arbitrarily assigned through the app. This was noticeable when people gave cash tips, they were often much higher than what was given through the app. I assume this was an effort to pool tips through the company."
41,Bite Squad,Great side gig,2021-06-22,4.0,Delivery Driver,I like how easy it is to start earning,Tips and extra earnings aren't able to cash out early

44,Bite Squad,"Lacking in Pay Equality, Perks, Communication and Culture",2021-06-15,2.0,Quality Assurance Analyst,"* The manager I worked under was the best manager I've ever had. Open, honest and has your back 100%
* Unlimited PTO","* Serious lack of communication with upper management - no all hands meetings in years (literally) . Employees have no idea what the plan for the company is or where it's going. The current CEO has never once addressed the company to discuss his vision or how we were to be involved.
* Very few perks. 
 - Pay is on the low side. Not competitive with other related company for same role. 
 - They do not pay for a portion of your internet or phone. 
 - No bonuses or any other type of appreciation for jobs well done. 
 - They offer free delivery to those who live within delivery areas. If you live outside a delivery area, you get nothing. Recommendations were sent to HR to include everyone in this perk but HR's reply was basically ""too bad"". 
* Upper Management only meets/talks to employees when something is wrong, never to say thanks or offer a job well done.
* Lack of communication between most departments. Most people in Engineering have no idea what is going on, who is working on what, what build is going to be released, what's involved in the release...it's a disaster every week and very frustrating
* Reviews were done behind employees back between managers and HR. We were not involved until it was complete and were not allowed to offer feedback. Outstanding reviews received no cost of living increase. 
* No cost of living increase in two years of employment
* Promised 401k was coming upon hire but two years went by without it. They recently started one and they do not match. 
* Reactive company, not proactive. One person edited a comment in Slack so they locked down everyone's access. Rather than punishing the problem, they punished everyone. They do not trust their employees to even have edit access to comments, even when it means leaving possible inaccurate information in Slack."

+ Simple interface
+ Not locked in an office
+ Clients are usually nice. Usually.
+ If you are lucky to stay in a populated area, you can make some decent money. Especially if you're fast and polite. Again, if you are lucky. The company dictates this ""luck"".","+ Availability is dictated by an auto schedule, defaulting to about 30 - 35 hours. Sometimes less.
+ No more uniform and bag provided. While it may be a plus to some, it added a degree of professionalism that set it apart from competition
+ Most importantly, it's no longer a W2 employer. Have fun itemizing your (many) job expenses alone.
+ The progressive damage to your car will eventually outweigh whatever bank you make.
+ You are not compensated for miles driven. They could start you at the heart of a town (ideal money making), fling you an hour away, then lock you down there (neutering your income like a feral tomcat).
+ Customer service is outsourced and, at best, incompetent. They don't know you're in the middle of nowhere, or waiting at the local restaurant for an order, or even if you're delivering to a hospital. Therefore, they lack perspective. Also, will try to screw over the customer and/or you if it makes them a scratch more money.
+ Will ask you for more, but not provide more. ""Oh can you stay an hour or two afterwards? We are really busy."" Once or twice, yeah sure. You gave me a job and I'm thankful. Every other day? Fix your crappy turnover problems!
+ Keep track of your earnings. There have been lawsuits over it."

Management is trained to be outright deceptive, even outright dishonest (yes, actually LIE) about potential (true/real) total income potential, and avoid talking about, or just disregard actual P&L factors, and won’t tell ya, or ever care that THIS JOB IS most likely GONNA cost ya more to do it than you’ll ever make doing it. I left a year ago, and am STILL paying off my gas cards. Worked for the for 10 months, left with over $7K in credit card bills for fuel.","Management are very well trained conmen. It’s a gimmick job, a confidence game, and they know it. They will say ANYTHING to get you to drive for they. They pretend to respect their drivers, and form fake personal relationships with their drivers, and use the personal relationship to control, and manipulate the drivers. It is really sad. Worst job I ever had, cost me more to do the job, than I ever made . Don’t do it."

I can make as much or as little as I want. If I work 40 hours and I pick blocks of time beforehand, I can make $500 a week. Some days are more lucrative than others. Sometimes I make $20 in an hour and sometimes it's around $10.",They make changes without communicating with the drivers. Some orders are too low in compensation.

- LOTS of long trips, definitely past their mile quota.  I have had a few making me drive 10 miles to get the food and then another 9 to deliver it...all for an extra dollar?
- You either get cut early OR stay later than your scheduled time off (think 20 minutes or more)

I do not message while driving so I have to make the choice of stopping to handle the issue which puts me arriving late or listening to the incessant sounds until I arrive.

Decent pay and good compensations for what we do. Fun finding new restaurants ive never been to.,"Apps sometimes are finicky/slow to updating status of order pick ups. GPS needs some updating. Led me to wrong places. Information given on how to manage through bite squad sources as an employee NOT THOROUGH. Whether it was suppose to be done at the orientation or not, it is not clear to me as to how everything works. Like scheduling, requesting time off, pay periods, apps to use for those different areas, basically figuring out how, whom, and who to contact when questions or issues arise for certain areas of the job. Also, the means to transport orders when they are big in quantity or requiring a lot of hands to help transport to customer. For example an order i had picked up there were 5 different drinks. A car normally only has 2 cup holders. Now that was challenging. Even getting things to the car in the ine bag given wasnt and is not always that helpful."

162,Bite Squad,Disgraceful company such scammers,2019-10-10,1.0,Delivery Driver,Driving alone and meeting restaurant workers. Learning new areas,Most of it is negative. I started in August after moving to a new city in florida. When you first meet the guys they all seem chill and open to questions about the protocol and app you are required to use. They boast about this new app that let's you take money out daily which is actually a lie. It's only when you earn a certain amount and it's like half your earnings. Plus they tax you hard on your paycheck.  I would not work here if I knew the struggle. The restaurants always cop an attitude and the customers sometimes tip nothing when they live in a huge mansion or have a cushy office job. These people are scumbags. Furthermore management and dispatch are garbage. They have no clue what's going on and will boss you around like a peasant boy. I hate having to drive 45 mins when I should get orders in my area which is like 40 quality restaurants.  It baffles me I chose a nice place to live in but I never get to work over here. I always go to gross shack slums and downtown driving is always a killer on gas.

They’ve recently started keeping me past my EOS, which I don’t necessarily have a problem with, but they don’t tell me or give me any idea of how much longer they need me for. Restaurant workers are occasionally rude and will sometimes ignore me for long periods before acknowledging me and updating me on the order."

Driving around all day vs. being stuck behind a desk or counter. Friendly co-works. Make your own schedule. Paid at least $10 per hour, i have made up to $19 am hour.",Really the only cons i see is your tips left online are counted towards your wages until you meet the $9.25 minimum wage then you receive all your tips after that. Of your full time you soend about $120 in gas every 2 weeks. Miles on your car.

- Dispatch would change orders when an item was out of stock without contacting customers. 
- The app glitches constantly and the gps could lead you to wrong addresses. 
- Dispatch doesn’t make customers aware of orders that have been requested for delivery at a specific time being assigned after chosen delivery time. 
- Does not explain issues or provide a disclaimer to customers concerning app issues which results in your lack in tips and possible confrontations with customers. 
-Mileage pay is ridiculous"

211,Bite Squad,disappointing.,2019-07-26,2.0,Delivery Driver,Only one that I can think of... don't have a 'boss' in the same room,"They said bitesquad is all about efficiency... I am regularly sent orders as soon as they're sent to the resturant, which leads to 10-30 minute waits every time.  I spend hours waiting at resturants for orders that should have been dispatched efficiently instead of with laziness. 
Average earnings with 5.44 base wage + tips + the ridiculous $1 per delivery ""reimbursement"" that absolutely does not cover personal vehicle operating and maintenance cost... average earnings only 9 to 11 dollars an hour. 

The $1 per delivery 'reimbursement' might work for those in company cars.. but it's nowhere near enough for those of us that are using personl vehicles. 

Should be $0.58 per mile for those using personal vehicles... not $1 per delivery."

216,Bite Squad,Not Getting Minimum Wage,2019-07-21,1.0,Delivery Driver,You can make your own schedule. It's really chill I basically just watch YouTube while I wait on food because they recommend you wait in  your car while the food is being prepared.,"Not making minimum wage, they say they give you gas reimbursements of $1 per order but that is factored into  your hourly so that is a blatant lie. I kept track with the gas I spent one night making ""$10"" and hour (the minimum) and I actually made 7 because of the gas I spent. Of course some nights the tips are outstanding and you make more but that is very rare only happening once or twice in the 4 months I've worked here. The hours are very strange... you will either get one day one week or 5 the next. Then when you do get scheduled they make most of your days only 2 hours (with a break if they're slow.) Shifts where you work more than 4 or 5 hours are broken up throughout the day for example 11:30-2 then again at 4-10 or something similar effectively taking over your entire day. Hardly ever get off on time either getting off hours early or hours late. Overall very inconsistent with the scheduling however I would say I could deal with that but not getting paid is the big issue."

You could make 400-500 in one week and only expect to get about HALF of that back but then you’ve been having to use daily pay to put gas in your car so that eats up that half as well and the way the pay period is set up if you have bills to pay,  DO NOT WORK FOR BITE SQUAD FULL TIME. PART TIME, AMAZING. FULL TIME. NOT WORTH THE WEAR AND TEAR ON YOUR VEHICLE OR THE CONSTANT REFILLING OF GAS they also take money out of your first 2 paychecks but they make it sound sooo sweet when you’re getting your interview"
222,Bite Squad,Don't waste your time |  Avoid,2019-07-07,1.0,Delivery Driver,"Free to choose your schedule.
100$ credit to free food.","Pay; In my area 10$ is the minimum you can make per hour. That sounds great, right? But, if you are given tips from a customer, the company will not pay you anything. If a customer doesn't tip you, the company will compensate 10$. You're not keeping your tips where you should have made 20$ in total for that hour. 

Gas? Nope. \\ Support? Nope \\ 

Point system: at the interview, if your car breaks down they said you are not at fault, and wont be penalized. Guess what? You still are penalized for something not in your control. Once you reach a certain threshold of points, you start not having as much deliveries to do, which ties back into poor pay."
223,Bite Squad,A complete scam and rip-off,2019-07-01,1.0,Delivery Driver,Somewhat flexible schedule if they pick you as a favorite,"They will lie to you about their wages to get you in then pretend they didn’t. They steal whatever tips you get to calculate their pay, the $10/hr guarantee only applies 3 hours out of the day, contacting your manager is a hassle upon itself. They will send you on 12+ mile deliveries to restaurants all across town and only reimburse you 1 dollar per delivery, regardless of distance. What pitiful amount of gas can you get with just $1? 

Talking with HR is a nightmare, they barely give you supplies to even do your job and the whole operation reeks of a scam. My orientations were done out of a public library lobby; I’m starting to suspect they don’t even have a real office. I wouldn’t recommend this job to anyone; the wear and tear it puts on your car won’t even pay rent."

Long wait times at restaurants, waiting for food to be prepared while only earning $4.86/hr.

Sometimes I’d just finish an order then I’d get a pick up or “task” as it’s called from dispatch that’s  kind of far out only to come deliver it almost right back to my last delivery point. It could be due to busier times but it’s the only “problem” (and I use that term very lightly) that I encounter.
231,Bite Squad,Monotony at it's finest,2019-06-21,2.0,Marketing Manager,"The pay for market managers is decent, but this is temporary. They have already started replacing higher paid managers with low paid ""Lead Drivers"" who are former drivers that can set up tablets and hand out shirts. 

There is room to grow and move up, but the move is usually in title only. You may get a raise, but it won't be much.

They are also really good at making you feel useful and valid by praising you for almost hitting your goals (because you will NEVER hit all of your goals).

The team atmosphere is kind of nice. You regular conference calls when all the Market Managers are told about what's coming up for the company and your market. They really want you all to work together to solve problems, but beware, they also have no problem using managers against each other.

Bite Squad doesn't shy away from helping to raise money for charities some times, that's pretty cool.","As a Market Manager, your job is to ""interview"" groups of potential drivers 3 times a day and try to get them to apply the same day so that you can get them on the road delivering.  

You will also need to constantly adjust the schedule.   You are constantly hiring drivers to replace drivers who quit and this makes scheduling a nightmare.  The turnover rate for drivers is the highest rate I've ever seen in any company, so you can NEVER rely on a scheduled driver logging on and have to pay they do.

Your bonus depends on  you hitting your goal, which your manager will make sure you don't hit. You will need to hire a certain percentage of applicants which is always a high number you'll never get because the application process is so easy that people constantly apply, thinking that they want to do this, but then don't respond to your ""interview"" emails because they already started doing Uber.  

Another aspect of your goal for your bonus is delivery time, or ""PoP Score"". This is also hard to hit because you are only allowed to schedule so many drivers at certain times and if you don't have enough drivers on the road, your orders will be late.  If it's peak time, say around 7 PM, and you know that it'll be busy and you'll need at least 30 drivers on the road, your manager will only allow you to schedule 20 drivers, and it's a guarantee that at least 5 drivers won't log on. So there you are with HALF of the drivers you'll need to hit goal, frantically calling and texting drivers to try and get them to work when they weren't scheduled, hoping you'll hit your PoP score to get your bonus (which you wont).

At the end of your day, you would think you could go home and relax, but that isn't true. You need to keep your phone and laptop (both of which YOU supply yourself) near you at all times, even when going out, because you are expected to keep a constant eye on things and help get drivers on the road if your PoP score gets too low. I've had to leave movie theaters just so I can call an get drivers logged in. You take your work with you everywhere.

Lastly, you are spied on constantly.  There are cameras in almost every room in the office that are used for watching you remotely. You really have to watch what you say because your manager won't hesitate to call you (on your personal phone) and say ""What did you mean when you said..."".  Everything you say and to is scrutinized, and if your manager doesn't have time to watch you, he/she will find someone to do it for them.

It's the same thing, every day. ""Interview"" (it's not an interview, you're just telling people what they will be doing) potential drivers, push hard to get them to apply, give them a shirt, hat, and bag, fix your schedule, take your work home, and be monitored while doing it.  Every...Day...

Again, this won't be a problem soon as the Lead Driver is the future of the company. If you get offered a job as a Market Manager, run away because you will not be doing it for long."

Turnover is high. No one knows what’s going on. Very unorganized. They give you no gas reimbursement, expect you to travel and pay for no meals. They new comp plan is set up to look like you can make 120,000 easy, but you can’t and you won’t.

241,Bite Squad,One of the worst comany's I've ever worked for,2019-05-09,1.0,Delivery Driver,There are actually no pros to working here,"The reason it was so bad was because no matter what goes wrong they will always blame you. If the people who are in charge of directions give you the wrong address they will blame you for messing up. 
You also only get $12 an hour and it does not help your car at all, you have to constantly fill up so when you get that $400 check almost half is gone to gas. Your car will garuntee put on close to 5,000 miles from just 2 months of working. Also you dont get to pick when you work you have an actual shifts and they dont really budge. 
And dont even get me started on the uniform. Its this disgusting green color that makes you look like luigi but somehow even worse. I get that its for brand awareness but walking into restaurants was extremely embarrassing. 
If you have the option to do another job then do it, the management is terrible and not worth the trouble"

249,Bite Squad,REAL unbiased review,2019-04-16,5.0,Delivery Driver,"Excellent technology and dispatch department. Completely different and better experience than ridesharing or pizza delivery.
The money is very comparable (although the pay plan is very different) to pizza delivery, with the positive that there is no waiting in between deliveries, folding boxes, mopping, sweeping, being managed by seven-year-olds etc.","If you’re not prepared to be a driver for a living and I are going to drive with something that gets south of 30 miles per gallon you’re going to be unhappy with the gas expense per hour, you could go up to about $2.50 to three dollars per hour in gas expense.

If you have a Prius your gasoline expense will be just about one dollar per hour worked. The reviews out there where people say it wasn’t even worth the gas etc. are just Angry or stupid. You’re going to pay one dollar to $2.50 per hour in gasoline depending on what you drive."
250,Bite Squad,Bite squad,2019-04-14,3.0,Delivery Driver,The great thing about this job is that you’re able to pick the days you want and don’t want to work. Your able to switch your shift only if needed every two weeks. You also are able to work the hours you want and if you decide that you want to still work pass your work hours they keep you. The hourly pay is good.,"A lot of gas wasted, they say you will only do 7-10 mile distance from where you live to pick up the food and you work your way 7 more miles out to the customers house and so on. Since I’ve been working they have been short of staff and I was the one picking up slack. One time they had me drive 30 miles because they were supposedly short of staff. My shift ends at 8:30pm and I would come home at 1pm. They told me one thing during interview and they set me up about two weeks into it. This is not the first time me helping them out feeling obligated because they beg you.  The pay is great if only driving local if not then it’s not great. No benefits, no 401k, I think they give you 10 cents every hour for using your GPS on your phone and a penny a mile.  One biggest thing that bothered me is they say we get paid tips. Guys remember if your getting paid tips through the bitesquad app remember they keep a large amount of that tip money . Almost everything. That’s how the company makes the majority of their money.one of my pay check was almost $1000.00 and I only got back $600.00 because they kept four hundred dollars of my tips that I thought I was going to get. It’s better to hope you get paid tips in cash when you do the delivery so the money can go directly to you. It’s a great gig if your being helped a little more financially."

-No benefits 
-You must accept all deliveries no matter what...even if they are 20 miles one way (I had this happen and dispatch completely ignored my request to have my order reassigned to someone else) 
-You cannot contact a customer before picking up their order (this means that you have to rely on dispatch for simple order issues that you could easily resolve yourself)

263,Bite Squad,not recommended,2019-03-13,1.0,Delivery Driver,They offer flexible scheduling. No micromanaging.,"If you're interested in the company they're a few things about the pay you should take into consideration first. In Arkansas they pay $2.75 an hour plus 97% of tips. 3% of driver tips are charged for processing fees. There is a $1 per order payment and a .04c an hour reimbursement for data usage. They have what they call ""guaranteed"" or ""live"" hours that they offer a minimum pay that fluctuates throughout the year. What this means is during the peak hours (dinner & lunch rush) they guarantee you will make at least said amount with your base pay of 2.75 and tips if you do not they will cover the gap, sounds good right. But this is what they do. Say the guarantee pay is $10 an hour for the lunch rush and you only collect $8 they give you $2 to make the guaranteed $10 but what they dont tell you is, if tomorrow you make $15 during those hours they take the $2 back that they gave you the day before. They keep these method for a whole two week period, keeping your pay at the minimum average. So your pay from last week, during the guaranteed hours, directly effects your pay from this week. When you take your daily earnings and add them together for the whole two week period your actual earnings will be noticeably less than what you earned each day. In addition to ""altering"" a drivers pay I noticed that my tips dispersed when they shouldn't have. Meaning at times, my tips went down but my delivery number did not. Also if the client makes a mistake on an order and the customer wants it corrected, the driver takes the loss. They automatically dispatch a second driver to retrieve the mistaken items and removes all pay for the delivery from the first driver and gives it to the second driver without informing the first driver of any issues... at the end of one of my shifts I noticed a reduction in my pay and attempted to contact my manager through the ""contact my manager"" option in the driver app. This pulls up my work email and allows me to email my manager directly. When I asked for an explanation as to what orders I did not complete properly just so I knew what i did to lose pay and could correct myself in the future, management said ""who's this"". I informed them who I was and continued to requests an explanation. management acts like they dont know you and then ignores you if you keep trying to discuss the issue... I gave them adequate time to respond to me and they did not. After notifying them that I was resigning they suddenly knew who I was. Upon hiring they require drivers to pay an $80 deposit for the use of the mandatory hot bags. They are only offering me $40 of the $80 deposit for the returned equipment."
264,Bite Squad,It all comes down to the car,2019-03-13,3.0,Delivery Driver,"Flexible schedule, opportunity for overtime, easy to master, ability to listen to music/podcasts/audiobooks, great way to explore the city","Maintenance, repairs, and fuel costs can vary greatly.

*Forced to work on certain holidays,eg. Valentine's Day, don't expect to spend time with your loved one.
*Constantly sent home early and put on breaks. This is to avoid you getting that 10 or 15$ an hour minimum. You get no notice to these happening so you may be scheduled an 8 hour day but only work 3. 
*They don't care about your safety. I stopped on the side of the road to use my phone to resolve issues with an order, got told I should be moving while doing that. Yeah, let's text and drive.

-I had way too many customers not tip. And it was always the people I had to drive 10 miles to the RR and then another 5 to 10 to drop off.
-They charge you the credit card fee from the customers tipping on their cards. 
-Days I worked 8 hours I would rack up anywhere from 160 to 200 miles all in 1 shift
-Upfront costs of $25 for uniform and $40 bag deposit
-Gas (You use a lot of it. They love sending you across town for a 1 item order that doesn't tip)
-You don't get to see what your tip will be upfront nor the distance to the customer when you take an order. It's a surprise every time.
-You are not allowed to turn down an order. Example they assign you an order but it's 13 miles away. You can text dispatch and ask for something closer. So, what do they do? They give you one that's 12 miles away.
-Your safety is NOT their concern. Don't let them lie. Had an incident where the customer gave an incomplete address. Tried calling them 4x but their phone was shut off. I get a hold of dispatch explain the situation to 3 different people. All while telling them I do not feel safe in this particular area. 40 min later they finally let me leave the area. 
-Dispatch treats you like an inferior child. They are rude and act passive aggressive.
-If you schedule time off it won't always be honored. They think their sly.

Any time you have a concern they direct you to your market manager whose responses will range from completely ignoring you to not offering a proper resolution to legitimate issues. Also good luck with making more than one delivery per hour, they send you to restaurants before the places even have the orders most of the time, and will try to give you a break after every delivery since with your tips they almost always have to make up the difference during peak times. If you narrow your availability at all they will give you almost no hours, since they can't schedule you for 12 hour days. They may also be listed here under KASA Deliveries, not sure if they use that to recruit anymore but if they do run fast and far.

You most definitely have to remind dispatch of hard cut times, otherwise you can find yourself working beyond your scheduled hours due to the small number of delivery drivers for Bite Squad.

Occasionally I’d like the chance to run in somewhere during a delivery (as I’m close to somewhere) to grab a drink. I try to be on top of keeping things in my car to eat and drink.

371,Bite Squad,Sales,2018-08-24,1.0,Account Executive,"Independent, good name recognition, growing industry.","Where do I start. You do get a 2 month training salary and then after that its draw again commission. That didn't really bother me since most of sales career I was paid that way. What did bother me and will likely bother you is that you don't know ahead of time if you will get paid commission on a restaurant. Why? They have weird, if not unethical, rules and how they pay you. You get different levels of commission depending on if a restaurant falls in the top 10, 25 or 50% off all restaurants with the most orders. If they're below the top 50%, you get absolutely nothing. This can be a good thing I'd you are opening a new market. It's a terrible thing if you're in an established market. Likely the top performing restaurants will be taken already and you're also competing with national chains which inherently get lots of orders thereby driving up those averages. Here is the kicker.. you won't know for 60 days if you will even get paid until results are measured.  And.... here is where it gets really bad. Those that do fall below the 50% mark, some very low performing restaurants will get kicked out while many will continue on in their program which means they make thousands off a restaurant that they paid you nothing on."

378,Bite Squad,Unorganized and Horrible Communicators,2018-08-17,1.0,Delivery Driver,You can clock in from your front door instead of going into an office.,"Bite Squad is easily the worst company I've ever worked for. My manager was extremely incompetent and messed up nearly every single one of his tasks. He told me that instead of updating my availability on the app, that he would just call me every week to discuss which days I would like to work. This never happened... the scheduled carried over every week and led to me calling off of shifts that I never agreed to. I let management and the dispatch know that I couldn't work them, but when the shift came they called and left me a negative ticket (you have a driver score in the app that literally serves no purpose other than to make you look bad). I let my manager know that it was a mistake and it took a month for them to remove it... Like I said, it didn't matter but it was the principal.

My manager NEVER responded to me on my first call/text. I always followed up 2 or 3 times to get a response. I requested vacation time 3 weeks in advance and was still scheduled, leading to another ticket and more stalling before it was finally removed.

Dispatch is the group of people that send you the orders. They constantly messed up, wasting my time and the customer's time. I would often have to drive 20-30 minutes to a restaurant only to have the order cancelled by them and reassigned to another driver. I often had to wait 15-30 minutes at a restaurant because dispatch hadn't submitted the order to them and/or haven't paid for it. I would often receive a new order when my shift was supposed to end in 10 minutes, causing me to frequently work late. I would wait hours in my car during a shift for an order to come through, only to find out that dispatch ""forgot"" to send me orders. 

The pay scale is super misleading. It's set up like this:
Sunday - Saturday: 11:00 am - 5:00 pm = $10/hour guaranteed
Sunday - Thursday: 5:00 pm - 8:30 pm = $12/hour guaranteed
Friday and Saturday: 5:00 - 8:30 pm = $14/hour guaranteed
You get to keep all of your tips after you make your guaranteed wages

This is extremely misleading because you almost never make your guaranteed wage. This is how they get you... You are paid $2.50 per hour and your tips are used to make up the difference. If you don't make your guaranteed wage, they are required to pay the difference. I never made more than I was supposed to even though the company advertises that you can make up to $25 an hour. Unless people are tipping extremely generously, this will never happen. And the customer doesn't realize how far you have to drive to get to some restaurants. For example, the restaurant could be 10 minutes from their house but you receive the order when you are 25 minutes away from the restaurant. That single order could take an hour to complete and the customer will only account for you driving 10 minutes from the restaurant and give you $3 as a tip. Totally not worth it. This is not the customer's fault at all, just a stupid flaw. Also, if the customer gives a tip on the app, Bite Squad charges a processing fee! This further reduces the amount of tips you get because almost everyone tips on the app. 

I had a terrible experience with Bite Squad. DO NOT WORK FOR THEM!!! I've never felt compelled to write a negative company review until now, and I would leave 0 stars in every category if I could. Sorry about the rant. To reiterate... the cons are as follows:

Horrible communication
Consistent management and dispatch errors
Advertised as flexible hours, but that is misleading
Constant work past your scheduled shifts
Unwarranted ""tickets"" against you for management and dispatch errors
 False impression that you will make more money than you actually do"

You will pay for the bags and uniform as well as your own background check, and the credit card fees for people that tip through the system. its a complete joke.

- Very minimal customer interaction.  You drive to the restaurant, pick up food, drive to the customer and give them the food, and you're done.  No receipts to sign, and no money changing hands unless they cash tip you.
- Very minimal management interaction.  I see my manager about once a month when I go pick up more display coupons.
- You can pick the days and times that you want to work, with little to no complaint from management.","- Never have a guaranteed time off.  No matter when you're scheduled to get off, you keep going until they send you the end shift notification.   
- Starting this job without already having some bill/gas money put aside is not going to work.  The pay is bi-weekly, you pay for your uniforms, and you put a deposit on the bags, so your first paycheck is going to be smaller than usual (mine was about 40 bucks).

402,Bite Squad,Driver,2018-07-29,3.0,Delivery Driver,There are pros for working for a bite squad for example when you do deliveries and you get tipped in cash you don’t report it. So there was some times when I would get between three dollars and $30 a day.  Dispatch is very good because when I worked I would work from 11 to 2 then 5 to 9 and dispatch makes it easy to talk to them because you just chat them up on your messaging app and there’d be a lot of times I probably did this every day  my shift would be till 2 o’clock and if it’s 150 I would ask dispatch if  this would be my last order and if you ask that they will say yes.  And people who tip from 11 to 2 and 530 to 8:30 the drivers are getting paid $11 an hour so you don’t have to tip on the app but please tip them in person even if it’s about two dollars because that’s  what a minimum tip is so please do not tip on the app tip in person so the drivers will actually get the tip.,I read reviews from bite squad before I started the job and a lot of people do talk about gas bill and they are right it does take about half of your paycheck for gas and another thing I get my oil changed every 3500 miles  And I would have to do it oil change 2 to 3 weeks at a time and I pay $20 every oil change and then the next aspect you go look at is your tires I’ve had my tires for about six months and just because I work nine hours a day it’s still wearing out my tires faster. So my paycheck they pay you every two weeks and when I would get my paycheck it was around.  500 to 630  depending on if I worked weekends but the bad thing about this job  is when you make tips and people tip on the app that is not a tip that money just goes like say if I work from 11 to 2 you get $11 an hour but when they tip on the app it just goes to that 11 an hour so you are not making what they just tipped and they Do you give you a dollar per delivery when it’s done but that is still not enough I believe post mates does $.60 a mile which works out a whole lot better than a dollar per delivery successfully. And another thing is when you first start they take $40out of your first paycheck and 40out of your second to pay for the bags they give you they give you a full size catering bag and the pizza bag and A hat and a shirt but you don’t have to wear the hat I worked there for a solid three months I never wore the hat but I look professional.  But if you lose the two bags they charge you 180.

Ex: after a 8 hour work day, you only make 9 deliveries. Drivers should be compensated more for gas (you only get $1.00 per delivery, oppose to $4.00 (what grubhub offers as I was told). Drivers are using their own cars, which we are prone to having our own cars involved in accidents, etc. The least this company can do is add more reimbursement per drop."

Its a great job if you don't mind working for free. They never consider your gas cost. $1 per delivery for gas but they will send you 15-20 miles to the Resturaunt and another 15-20 miles to the customer do the math.... Now its been an hour no tip you just spent $6-7 in gas that's per delivery and even if you get a tip you could have had 3 deliveries in that hour and they do this ALMOST EVERY DELIVERY....... Its a scam and a shell game with your money they are making it big while you drown. Its totally not worth it. The turnover is new drivers every time I see one. Because everyone quits when they realize they are working for almost no pay. Lets put it this way, if you bring home $800 in 2 weeks be prepared to use almost $400 back into gas NO LIE! they have absolutely no respect or care for the drivers they will use you up until you simply can no longer afford to work there. On top of driving you to broke literally they will also insist you work hours after your shift is over. Again with no regard that your now on your second tank of gas.

Gas reimbursement is $1 per trip, but theyll sometimes have you going almost 18 miles round trip, so ur losing money trying to work for them. You don't get your tips at the end of the night, and they use those tips in order to bring your pay per hour up to there guaranteed hourly wage.
Speaking of that $10 / $12 an hour guaranteed wage, you basically make no tips during that time unless you make more then $12 an hour out of 2.50 plus your tips.
 During the orientation we were told that we would be making $12 an hour plus tips. When I found out they lied about the pay I made the decision to get out of there.
They do not pay me enough to be a constant pain.
They will consistently send you to restaurants before they send the order to the restaurant, causing you to have to sit there and wait for 20+ minutes when you could be working.
Dispatchers don't know the lay of the land, and they're based out of state. Had them send me to a restaurant in one town to make a delivery in my hometown, when we have the exact same restaurant in the hometown. A dispatcher that works this area would know to change that to the restaurant in town so that I wouldn't drive 8 Miles there and 8 Miles back, for an order that shouldn't take more than 10 minutes to pick up and drop off because it's in bloody town.
And these goody uniforms. 
Bright Irish green, seriously?
I made so much more money doing delivery driving before bitesquad came in and bought out our business. Then they come promising so much more money, and it was all lies like I should have known it was from the very beginning.

Work? You can schedule the days you want to work and the days off in ordination, then grab the days/times you want to work within the app.

Pay? You keep all your tips.","Pay? During regular hours, you get paid $5.23 per hour, and in special hours from 11am - 2pm you get $10 per hour guaranteed on Monday - Friday & from 5:30 - 9:30 you get $12 per hour guaranteed on Saturdays and Sundays.

Payout? You get get a payout of every other Friday. Seems very odd. Because of this, you'll waste more money on gas than actually working.

Transparency? The app they use, a lot of information is behind the scenes. For example, you don't know how much you made per day and/or per week. In app, weeks end on Sundays while the paycheck ends on Saturday, so basically they're showing you that you made more per week, but really, you didn't."

Depending on the area you are working, parking can be a headache.  Sometimes you have to feed the parking meter or park where very likely could give you a ticket.... in my experience parking availability is the worst part of the job.
2.  You sign a contract to deliver within 7 miles of your current location.  That is a lie.  I have received order 15 miles from my location, and almost half 10+ miles.   You can request to change of orders that you are going to pick up, although some dispatchers give you a hard time... but when you pick up from the restaurant.... you are sticker with 10+ miles delivery distances.   Orders where customers is more than 7 miles from restaurants should not go through, but it happens all the time.

447,Bite Squad,Great 2nd job to earn extra cash or make ends meet,2018-04-02,4.0,Delivery Driver,"- Hourly Pay (W2)
- You keep tips
- You can set your own schedule and there are plenty of shifts to pick up
- You are uniformed. They give you shirts, hat and a jacket.
- They give you  high quality hot bags (with deposit)
- Data and gas reimbursement
- Easy job 

    You get paid hourly. It can differ from market to market but in Orlando, we get Rush guaranteed pay of $10 an hour between 11 AM to 2 PM All week. Than $10  M-TH 5:30 PM to 9:30 PM and F-SUN you get $12 when working  5:30 PM- 9:30PM. For all hours worked, you will earn a Base wage of $5.23 per hour in addition to all tips and reimbursements minus credit card fees. Within the Rush Guarantee period, if your total Base ($5.23) + Tips per hour over a two-week pay period is less than the Rush Guarantee in effect during those shifts, you will be paid the difference.You can set your own schedule and there are plenty of opportunities to pick up extra shifts. Asking days off is very easy through their system and I've always gotten them off, just make sure you plan ahead or you will get a negative mark for asking off the same day even if is an emergancy. I've been able to work 30-hour work weeks or 10 depending on how much I want to work. I love that is a W2 job so you don't have to worry about reporting taxes, its all taken care of. You get data reimbursement and in my market I get $1 per delivery for gas which is fine for my car since its very fuel efficient. If you are driving a car that is not fuel efficient then that will eat into your earning. You can start your shift anywhere you are. The areas are proprietary/secret but pretty much if you are in the greater city area you're fine. They'll let you know otherwise. You are uniformed so people take you more seriously than ubereats and other delivery drivers. This will help when you are looking for parking in limited parking areas. They provide shirt, hat and jacket. All you have you have to worry about Is black slacks, black belt and black closed toed shoes. The app is simple and easy to use.  I work a full time job 7AM to 4PM getting $15/hr and this is a great side gig to make extra cash, help pay off important bills and make ends meet.","I HATE that you can't pick where to end your shift. I've had to drive up to 40 minutes home sometimes when right before I got the order, I was 5 minutes away.  Doing deliveries in downtown areas are stressful and it sucks because there is limited or no parking and you might have to walk far to get to restaurants and/or homes. No opportunity for raises or advancement but that is the nature of this kind of job."
448,Bite Squad,DON'T DO IT!!!! ITS A TRICK!!!!,2018-04-01,1.0,Delivery Driver,You get to choose your tunes while out on the road.... W-2 employment not independent contractor.... That's about the only Pros,"Will send you 20 miles away to pick up an order and they do this multiple times during shifts, putting upwards of 200 miles on your vehicle per day, then when you have car trouble and have to call off, even if you give them advanced notice of 24 hours, they take away from your driver percentage which keeps you from being eligible to drive one of their fleet cars, which usually just sit in the parking lot and collect dust because they want you to run your car into the ground and then punish you for it! The dispatchers are rude. They don't care about the safety or well being of the drivers. The dispatch supervisors are even worse. The local managers pretend they are trying to make changes but nothing ever changes. They only pay bi weekly, once you do get paid around 1/3-1/2 of your pay has to be put back for fuel for the next 2 weeks. I have worked 11 hours shifts without even one break, that is 11 hours of constant driving. Even truck drivers aren't suppose to be on the road that long without a break!!!! WE ARE HUMANS NOT ROBOTS!!!"

They are really good about finding the times that work for you. The job is really nice for the fact that you can log in anywhere on your phone to start work. It’s nice to just get in the car and start working anywhere. Customers tend to be very nice which makes delivering food seem a little more rewarding then it sounds. Restaurant owners and workers are always extremely nice to you. It’s a really good feeling when people smile at you and thank you for delivering their food to them which makes me happy to do what I do each day. Definitely a good company to work for, especially if you need to make a decent pay check to pay for rent and school . The pros out weigh most of the cons for this job.","The shifts never end on time ever. Even if you put a short shift request in there is no guarantee you will be let off. The taxes that get take out of card tips hurt when it comes to the pay check. Some customers never tip at all which leads to lower pay because tips are really how you make decent pay.  The gas reimbursement is a dollar an order but some orders are 5 to 10 miles away from the restaurant which can really cause problems when you have to fill up 4 to 5 times a pay period. Half of my pay ends up back in my gas tank. The app also tends to cause issues between the driver and the restaurant. The restaurant does not always read the instruction portions of the orders. And customers don’t understand that some options cost extra money to add and that needs to be handled before the driver arrives or it takes longer to receive an order. One thing that causes big problems are how slow some restaurants are, they eat into the possibility of making tips especially if you ended up waiting 30 minutes to an hour to get two items. That needs to be changed for the sake of customers and drivers. Parking at some restaurants is extremely hard because they have no parking close to the restaurant or so little to begin with."
453,Bite Squad,Working for Bite Squad,2018-03-29,4.0,Anonymous Employee,"I’ve been employed for the Bite Squad since August and I work on average about 42 hours a week.  I really like working for the Bite Squad and I enjoy super serving our customers. What pleases me the most is getting a 1st time customer and having that customer using us on a regular basis. My goal is to do 200 deliveries a pay period, which is about 100 a week. I’ve come close and I’ve got it up to between 183-195. I go to restaurants that I’ve previously never heard of. I enjoy meeting the restaurant staff and owners and managers and I’ll often patronize the restaurant when I am off. In the Little Rock area there are about 4 delivery services, Uber Eats, Waitr, Grubhub &  the Bite Squad. It’s just like the radio business , meaning that it’s competive but you have to superserve your customer. You have to stand out of the pack. The Bite Squad does just that and soon one of the competitors will be forced to drop out. We take the food delivery service to another level. Since August I’ve delivered 2,445 deliveries and I’ve only messed up 3 orders but I saw to it that I made it right for the customer. When a recent customer was upset about not having any ranch dressing for his chicken wings . I told him that I would be back in a few and get him some ranch . Actually I didn’t go back to the restaurant because it was too far away but I went to a nearby grocery store and was back at his apartment no more than two minutes later and the customer was impressed and gave me an additional tip. As I told dispatch the good Lord blessed me with a good job and I am grateful so it was no problem to make it right with the customer because they are the lifeline of our business! Also I plan on visiting our home office in Minneapolis to see the operation and meet everyone and I hope I can move up in the company.  I think management here is great and they are here to assist you.",Well I wish it could be impressed upon the customer that we need tips to make it. There are some people who have large orders but don’t tip.  Also I may be in North Little Rock and yet I may have to drive out to Benton. I wish I could just stay in Pulaski County.

- If you aren't working during busy times, sometimes they'll offer you a bonus to cajole you into doing so.
- You get an hourly wage, and they do all the payroll stuff.
- You don't have to commute, or go into the office.  If you live in the delivery area, you can clock in from your parking spot or whatever.
- They offer management positions in-house first, so if you want a chance to get a leg up on the ladder you'll get one.","- You share your tips with dispatch 60-40.  I don't resent dispatch, but generally for delivery jobs you get to keep your tips 100%.  Dispatch should just get a better hourly.
- Your gas, mileage, and car maintenance is compensated by a $1 per run ""indie reimbursement"" which, obviously, isn't close to enough for gas, mileage, and car maintenance.  They'll send you 10+ miles away without even blinking (and that's just the first part of the trip).
- They'll keep you past your shift end if they're busy.  They're up-front about this, but it's still super annoying to be working an hour after your shift is supposed to be over, delivering one pad thai to a guy in a 50 building apartment complex for 60% of a 1 dollar tip."

The day before the 2 week pay period ended, the $10/15 guaranteed rates (which are usually from 5:30-8:30) switched to 6:30-8:30. This affected our whole pay statement for the previous two weeks. They claimed it was a glitch due to daylights savings time. But the ""glitch"" occured 12 hours before daylights savings time, and it changed a chart that Bitesquad had made. Seems highly unlikely. During the pay period they show you the hours and the tips that you've earned, but the don't show you how much money you've made; why? Probably because it makes it easier to scam you when you receive your checks. It's basically impossible to know how much should be on your check. The company is not clear in explaining the pay to new employees. And most employees don't even realize hat you get either the tips or the guaranteed amount. (Whichever is higher)"

500,Bite Squad,My Review of this Company,2018-02-01,1.0,Delivery Driver,Able to make your own schedule,"You only make 50% of your tips, Bitesquad takes the other half.  In addition to that, they charge you 3% of every order, for credit card processing fees.   If you drive your own car you make a dollar for every order and they give you a minimal (and I mean pennies) data reimbursement.  They advertise as guaranteeing certain payrates within certain hours.  Lets break this down, you figure in the minimum wage, tip, $1.00 per delivery and because this is an hourly guarantee, most likely you'll do 2-3 deliveries within that hour....add it all up and most likely you made over the $15.00 guarantee or slightly over.  They advertise it to be bigger than it really is.  Let's talk about the tips, the tip split is 50-50 when the customer includes the tip on their credit card. More and more customers are tipping in cash when they find out that the whole tip is not going to the driver."
501,Bite Squad,Bitesquad is not worth it,2018-02-01,1.0,School Counselor,You don't have anyone micro managing you.,"Dispatch talks awful and very unprofessional to the drivers.
Even though bitesquad says you make your own schedule, not necessarily true. They threaten you with write ups if you do not work on their busiest days, such as v-day, they sent out an email stating that everyone must work or they will be written up, if it is a day that you are not scheduled to work and have told them you're not available on those days.
They send you into unsafe neighborhoods, when they tell you upon hire that they only service the surburban areas.
YOU DO NOT GET YOUR TIPS.  an example would be if I work 30 hours in 2 week  period at a pay rate of 10.00 per hour that's 300.00 for two weeks. Lets say I worked 30 hours in a two week period and I receive 200.00 in tips in that 2 week time frame as well.  You would think that would be 500.00 right?  WRONG,  they will pay you 10.00 per hour at 30 hours OR they will give you the 200.00 tips and add 100.00 to make it balance out 300.00. They reimburse you very minimally in gas.  Often you are sent across time 30 minutes away for a meal or a shake that's less than 5.00.  Also, they charge a small order delivery fee to the customers and the driver doesn't get that either. to sum it up, they keep your tip and delivery fee and pay the driver 10.00 per hour.  let's not forget that they charge you for EVERYTHING.  they had a 100.00 referral bonus for the driver and the person they referred if they both meet the qualifications after the new driver has completed so many deliveries. I got the 100.00 after harassing them for it. When I finally got it, it was 60.00. How heavy do tax 100.00? The people that own bitesquad are for self and they don't take about their drivers."

508,Bite Squad,Overworked Under Paid Consistent Change,2018-01-21,1.0,Sales Associate,Almost no pros to think of. They sell you a dream scenario thats unrealistic,"TOO many to name... 
First the constant change dealing with your commission. Expect for the commission structure to change at the drop of a dime. 
2. Over worked - not only do they expect you to be on the road all day going to restaurants but you spend time doing all the prospecting and labor intensive admin work also. 
3. Team meetings 3 times a week and then more 
4. Commission only - even though they say they pay a base almost no one makes the base, so it's straight commission 
5. Change change change- something is always changing 
6. They just don't care if they are overworking you - 50 to 60 plus hours is what you are expected to do and you still arent successful. 
7. Unrealistic Expectations- no marketing, no commercials and most of the restaurants already signed are getting no business working with them 
8. Tiring and overbearing culture"

512,Bite Squad,No stability and constantly changing policies and micromanagement make doing your job hard.,2017-12-24,1.0,Sales Representative,Flexible schedule; base pay is not bad for the short time they offer it; markets in High traffic tourist areas can be lucrative,"This company is only a few years old and has no set infrastructure or policies; little to no job security is offered, as they have misjudged and had to close or scale back many of the markets they have opened in.  If you are lucky enough to work in a high traffic tourist area with local cuisine then you can make money (ie, Florida, Hawaii, Texas) but most of the territories are not easy to work.   They won’t tell you when they hire you, but they hold the right to not pay you for accounts you set up that don’t fit your managers idea of a good restaurant.  They also deduct 500 dollars from your commission if you sign up any location that has more than 9 stores worldwide, which severely limits the restaurants you are allowed to call on.  The only gas mileage reimbursement you get is from restaurants you sign up and get approved, so you can end up paying in to fill your tank.  They have 2 comp plans, one with a base and one with straight commission but all employees are w-2 so the company can micromanage every detail of their sales teams day.  Constant conference calls and development calls will interrupt your day during times that you should be out calling on restaurants, and they will try to get you to do a lot of additional leg work to service accounts, even though you receive no compensation for this.  Management is out of touch and told me not to sign up restaurants that had menus that weren’t in English or didn’t have expensive enough food.  Overall, technology is glitchy and the service has a lot of hidden fees that deter most restaurants from wanting to sign up. The company will tell you to market it as a way for a restaurant to get exponential sales, but 9 out of 10 restaurants will not receive enough orders to make the service cost effective, and the tablet and its software don’t work well; restaurant owners constantly call you after they sign up because of tech glitches, and the extra fees they realize they have to pay come out to over 30% in charges, plus the additional fees the customer is hit with.  If the owner cancels before the month is over than you don’t get your commission either.  The market is so saturated with delivery services that their rate is not competitive.  
When I started they had just done a mass hire across the country to expand into new markets. Within 6 weeks over half of the new hires were gone; at training my trainer told me he had been with the company a year, but I later found out that no one on the sales team had been there more than a few months.  It was pretty obvious that everyone was on the chopping block once enough restaurants were signed up or the market failed to adequately perform."

They also have their own cars that you can drive and you are not gonna get that at a pizza place anywhere in town. You will also be set up with a driver app where you can see how many deliveriesyou have done, how much tips and hours you have for that pay period and easy push button updating of each order. I have not encountered too much of a wait time at any of the restaurants. If you do run into that then you can contact dispatch through your driver app and give them the update. Then they will let you know if there is something else close by to take or if it is just better to wait. Like I said before though if you have sit around and wait you are still guaranteed to make the floor income. So show me the $$$ while I sit here and wait in my AC and listen to music or podcast. ha. Overall you are most likely gonna make more than the floor which is very awesome as most restaurants have the food ready as you get there or just a few mins after. So you can get the delivery and get gone to get another delivery and stack that $$$. They also provide a shift planning app that makes it super easy to request days off or switch with other drivers. The local management is very easy to contact as you have their phone #'s and a contact email for any questions or concerns which doesn't happen at a lot of places.",It is not like your normal delivery job in which you would receive cash tips daily so you do have to wait for your paycheck to get the credit card tips.

~Dispatch is always civil and almost always kind to me. They are the go between, so I've NEVER had a customer or restaurant yell at me. Which is why I don't mind that dispatch gets a portion of my tip, although I could stand to keep more of it.

~Almost completely independent and extremely easy work. You get an order on your phone app, use the navigation button to get to the restaurant, walk in, take the food and confirm the order if possible, walk out, and hit the navigation button to find out where to deliver it.

I have done a lot of driving back and forth between my city and some far away city to make orders, so the short radius thing isn't true. The amount of gas money I'm spending is really adding up."

573,Bite Squad,Bite Squad,2017-06-05,4.0,Delivery Driver,"I have been working for this company for 7 months.  I work with a GREAT group of drivers and management team who always have my back and are willing to lend a hand when needed.  Love the hourly wage + tips, flexibility of scheduling shifts, and no stress as in regards to being in an office environment.   You are the ""master of your own destiny"" in this job, if you are willing to put in the time and effort.  The opportunities are endless in this market.   One more major benefit is driving the company car!!  No wear and tear on your personal car-savings on gas and maintenance-need I say more!!",Dispatch getting a percentage of our tips.  Wasn't a topic that was discussed with us at the orientation or the training session. Slightly disappointed on that note.
574,Bite Squad,"Driver for Anaheim, OC",2017-06-05,5.0,Food Delivery Driver,"First pro that comes to mind is being paid to wait for orders in an overly saturated market. Being a W2 employee and not an independent contractor guarantees an hourly wage, no matter how dead the market is. This is VERY good news for all of us serious drivers!

Next pro is the pay. The average driver realistically makes about $15 an hour with catering orders and tips. This average wage goes up as the market grows. Catering  tips can get pretty huge, but are mainly during the lunch rush.

A twist on being a W2 employee at Bite Squad is that we can set which days we can work, and have a ridiculous amount of vacation days we can request off. We get scheduled hours depending on our availability, and have the privilege to request an earlier cut if we need to leave sooner, or a later cut if we want to work a little longer, depending on how busy the market is. Most vacation requests are approved if sent in with at least two-weeks notice.

An extremely valuable tool Bite Squad provides to us drivers is their Dispatch Customer Service system, a system I swear upon. For any hour we're on the clock, Bite Squad has a Dispatch team ready to handle all customer service issues, including calling the restaurants and customers. This means we don't put in the orders, and we don't call the customers with issues. Dispatch monitors all activity and notifies the customers if their food will be late, even without us contacting them. The best yet, they actually pick up when we need to call them. No more handling issues in the dark. I'm pointing at you, Postmates.

The Bite Squad cars. What's better than saving gas money and getting paid to drive a company car? All employees can be scheduled with a Bite Squad car by bringing in a clean Motor Vehicle Record to their Market Manager for approval. All deliveries made with our own cars will get a $1, non-taxed reimbursement.


The Anaheim Market is a very friendly and supportive unit. We all look after each other, answering any questions anyone might have. The hiring process is almost painless for serious applicants. New employees seem to blend in really quickly, and nobody is left behind.

The future of Bite Squad Anaheim, OC honestly looks bright, despite being a fairly new market. Being a team of W2 employees, we provide customer service on a higher level than our competitors.  Bringing a better, more professional service to our customers, we're constantly growing and expanding to new areas.","I worked full time for other food delivery companies before coming to Bite Squad, and the market has been pretty stale from oversaturation of competitor companies. This con may turn into a pro for Bite Squad Anaheim, OC, however, being an entirely different food delivery platform to work for.

Please see Pros for more info."

It is not flexible - you have to block out two shifts per week for them...so they aren't very ""life happens"" friendly. (Unlike Uber, Lyft, Amazon Flex, Delivery Dudes, Postmates, and all the other e-commerce delivery contractors.)","The uniform is horrible, it snags the first time you wash it - you must buy the uniform it's $20. It makes you sweat because it is not a breathing fabric. It also clings to your nipples so females may want to keep that in mind before working with them.  I wore a tank top under uniform and I could still see my nipples thru the uniform shirt.  The hat is also VERY Hot and it's a requirement. There is NO lee-way on uniform standards so you are required to wear black shoes, black long pants and  non-moisture wicking shirt with a thick hat during 95 degree weather.   They also don't schedule you the hours you agree to.  It changes.  Also some nights you might make $100 - most nights you make $18.

The pay is a joke $5hr+70% of your tips, this is one of the most disrespectful thing I ever heard of after taxes and getting paid every two weeks it barley covers expenses. Try Postmates, Uber Eats, or Grub Hub they are far better then this company hands down, You will make more money and work when you want accept any order you want, and stay inside a delivery zone nothing over 10min or 10 miles you are compensated very well for farther and longer deliveries..

Having to get permission for everything from someone in Minnesota. Dispatch does not understand the area where you are working. Not being able to sign in and sign out whenever you want to. Driving your own car. Market may shut down at any moment. Not having any supplies for months on end for restaurants and drivers. High turn over rate. Point system that makes no sense. Points differ from driver to driver when calling out.
590,Bite Squad,"Just Say ""No"" to Bite Squad Employment",2017-04-25,1.0,Delivery Driver,I cannot find any Pros for working for this company.,"The company I drove for for one year was purchased by Bite Squad.  Needed an income, so became a full-time driver for Bite Squad.  Could not get any information regarding employment.  Drove 100-200 miles per shift, delivering less than 10 orders per 10 hour shifts.  There is no shift end time, keeping drivers 1+hours after shift end.  Customers confused that previous delivery company was now Bite Squad.  Left drivers to explain and we had no information to share about Bite Squad.  Minimum of 20 minute drive to restaurants to deliver around the corner.  Management would not answer questions.  It was the WORST experience EVER.  DO NOT WORK FOR Bite Squad.  So disappointed.  I loved my previous employer who paid and treated their drivers well."
591,Bite Squad,Driver,2017-04-18,1.0,Anonymous Employee,There is not a lot,"The company is very sketchy and automatically takes tips away from drivers to help pay the minimum wages of their  call center employees.  Tips can be designated to just the driver if the customer clicks on the tiny option box. But most customers don't notice so the drivers get nothing.  It's a sketchy roundabout way to underpay their call center employees and say it's legal because they make up their wages in ""tips"".  What they do borders on being illegal."
592,Bite Squad,It beats being unemployed buuuut.....,2017-04-14,1.0,Independent Delivery Driver,"Flexible schedule, no supervisor breathing down your neck. Learn about your city and new restaurants.

At the interview they said you'd only be assigned deliveries within a 3-4 mile radius, IRL you'll never get one that's less than 5 miles away with an additional 5-15 to deliver. Expect to waste your hourly wage on gas and whatever you make in tips is profit if you're lucky. Every day I ask myself why am I doing this, but again, it beats being unemployed for the time being and I'm able to bring in SOME income. They don't check backgrounds or do drug tests only motor vehicle. Supposedly they charge you for the uniform but I haven't received my first check yet to verify. On a 4 hour shift I'm averaging anywhere from 70-120 miles from clock in to clock out, but usually around 95-100. They guarantee $10/hr but after gas you'll be lucky to be making 5-6. I would not recommend this unless you are unable to find ANY job."
593,Bite Squad,Bitesquad Delivery service totally rocks!,2017-04-11,5.0,Delivery Driver,"I like the independent nature of the work, and the support is second to none!","Bad weather = better tips, so there's that!"
594,Bite Squad,Okay Part Time Job I guess,2017-04-01,3.0,Independent Driver,"I enjoyed Bitesquad because, as an independent driver, it was a hassle free job. I kept my bag and my uniform at home and could literally walk out to my car and clock in if I felt like it. 

The way scheduling worked, I was able to adjust my schedule as needed. They never seemed to really pressure me to work certain days, however obviously they offered more hours during peak business. 

Bite Squad's large delivery zone meant that I learned a lot about the different roads and path ways of my city. Getting lost sucks, but getting paid to get lost isn't the worst thing in the world.","The pay structure is really terrible. When I started I was promised a 7.25/hr+tips+reimbursement which amounted to about $1 per delivery, plus a small amount for data. If that didn't give me about 15/hr they would make up the difference. This was GREAT because, even on busy nights, I would often only make between 14.50-15.50 an hour, which wasn't the greatest, but given how hassle free everything was, I didn't mind. 

In the past few months Bite Squad has done two things, first, they changed the guarantee from 15 to 12. This didn't really effect me, since as I said, I was making 15 an hour with tips regardless. However, just a few weeks ago, they changed my hourly rate from 7.25, minimum wage, to 5 an hour. As I expected, I instantly noticed that. 

The thing about bitesquad is because of how their system works, even in ideal conditions, you're lucky to get 2 or 3 deliveries an hour. If you don't get that, and if people don't tip, you're lucky to make 7/hour in tips. Because Bite's ""delivery zone"" is most of my city, I can expect to drive much further distances to and from restaurants to pick up food. 

With their current pay structure, I can make more money at any other traditional delivery service. Pizza Delivery places, basically, pay more. I know one pizza delivery service in my area that pays 5.5 an hour, on the road, a mileage based reimbursement instead of a flat $1 which is not a lot to drive sometimes 10 or 15 miles round trip! (with mile reimbursement i'd make 4 or 5 bucks probably), and when you're not driving you get paid well above minimum wage to wash dishes, answer phones, etc. Better than 5 dollars an hour to be bored as hell in your car. 

I've been offered to drive for Bite Squad using one of their cars, but I'd have to adjust my schedule, which conflicts with my primary job. Furthermore, their office is so far away from me the commute really isn't viable. 

This is a part time job for me because you don't schedule enough hours for it to be full time! At my 2nd job I can easily get 35-45 hours a week no problem. Looking at what you're scheduling your drivers... I won't get that many hours. 

I might stay on if I wanted to drive your cars. But you park your cars like an hour away from my house with bad traffic. I don't want that kind of commute, frankly. The job I'm getting to replace this one is at most 30 minutes away from home."
595,Bite Squad,Worst company to work for or to deliver with as a restaurant owner,2017-03-31,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"Based on my experience with them as an employee, I can't think of anything good to say about them. But I have an endless list of examples how terrible they are.","First, they don't care about any employees, the pay and their scheduling are bad. Unlike company such as Uber and postmate, their system sucks. The worst part of all which I m not going to mention here is a legal issue. Most of the good reviews you see about them come from people from their management team or friends and family.

As far as restaurant signing up with them, don't get me started on that. I work for two restaurant right now in Miami that used to deliver with them. Oh my God it's not worth it deliver with this company. I can detail everything with every reason why as restaurants owner or employee you  shouldn't be associated with them. But that will stop you from trying them and see for yourself. That is a company for people with no other choice"

598,Bite Squad,Terrible for drivers,2017-03-24,1.0,Delivery Driver,"Somewhat flexible scheduling, working by yourself.","In addition to employing incompetent management and dispatch staff, this company is very non-transparent. They don't tell you much about the pay structure when you start, just that they guarantee $15/ hour. What the company doesn't clarify is that they keep a certain percentage of your tips for their dispatchers, and that this amount can be changed without warning. When I first started with BiteSquad, the dispatch office kept 10% of our tips. However, a few months into my employment they raised their keep to 40% without notifying anyone. Their job postings say you can make up to $25/ hour, but this is false. It is nearmy impossible to make over $15/ hour as a full-time employee. Additionally, the company does very little to compensate drivers who use their own vehicle. The company charges customers a higher delivery fee for longer trips, but BiteSquad keeps the additional fee. It doesn't matter if you drive 2 miles or 50, you will receive the same miniscule reimbursement for car expenses. What looked like a good opportunity in the beginning has turned out to be an outstanding disappointment. If you are interested in being a delivery driver, I recommend looking into local pizza places or other delivery services."

You're telling me this restaurant could potential bring Bite Squad $30,000-50,000 in annual revenue year over year and you're going to pay your sales reps $50 for creating this partnership??

A couple times, after subtracting out for gas, I made as much as $18/hour, although most of the time, it was closer to $12/hour or $13/hour.

I like how there is a message board on the scheduling website, because it is a way to communicate with other drivers. If you want to work more or less hours, you can make a post to let other drivers know so they can either give you some of their shifts or take some of your shifts.

If you enjoy driving, then this is a good job for you. Most of the time, you are just driving to various places around the Las Vegas area.","Sometimes they send you to restaurants that are 15+ miles away and/or sometimes the person you are delivering to lives as much as 15 miles away. It's a bummer because you only get $1/delivery, which rarely covers the money you spend on gas, let alone the wear and tear on your vehicle.

They require you to be available Thursday through Sunday because those are their busiest days. I'm not sure what happens if you aren't available on one of those days on a weekly basis. Maybe they just don't hire you, I don't know...

One part of the job is verifying the food order with someone at the restaurant. You aren't supposed to open up the food boxes (for sanitary reasons), so you kind of have to take the person's word when you verify the different food items on the order. Normally this isn't a problem, but if a customer calls and complains about the order (even if you did your job and verified the entire order), then they send someone else to deliver whatever was missing, and the tip from that customer automatically goes to the driver who ""corrected"" the problem. They don't contact you to see if you verified so if this happens, you will lose your tip due to someone else's mistake."

In my interview, they claimed to value communication, but apparently what they mean is they don't want you to question anything or even come to them with input/suggestions. That's not communication!

611,Bite Squad,Student Job,2016-12-08,5.0,Driver,"1)As a student Bite squad makes it easy to complete my degree while still holding a job. The flexible schedule allows for me to carve out time for class and study.
2) As a student job you will be hard pressed to find a job that will pay $15+ an hour plus tips.
3) Since i'm a student who is from out of state the vacation system makes it easy for me to fly home. This also made it easier for me to move from Seattle to the DC area.
4)  Through my two years with the company i have seen multiple drivers rise up through the ranks if they wanted to, turning Bite Squad into a career is a possibility.","1) All delivery jobs have down times due to certain holidays or the time in between lunch and dinner. Working during this part can be a bit tedious.
2)i have never seen a delivery job that is full time, so benefits are usually less."
612,Bite Squad,Conflicting Info,2016-12-05,2.0,Independent Driver,I don't have any pros yet.,"I already have a con, though.  They advertise flexible scheduling. I put in my schedule and was advised that corporate did not approve my ""flexible"" schedule. I must work weekends. That is not what I signed up for.  I wanted a Monday thru Friday schedule."

614,Bite Squad,The very bad and unpleasant experience,2016-11-17,1.0,,I've got no idea regarding good reasons to work for BiteSquad,"Bad software support,their CPS brought me at place and said to take this road. First I've checked it and saw there isn't any road. Looks like a trail in the wood. I just went around,hoping it will recalculate rout. Usually it making it,but I came to the same spot. I thought if it wants me to go through it,I'll go. I went,but I came to the dead end with two poles in the ground. It was very dark,I need to backup. On one side was a fence,on the other wood with blackberry jungle! I've called dispatch and they told me to call manager and they finished my shift. I don't know how,but I've managed to back up safely. Next shift I was on time and I did log in,to start it. I've waited around 15 minutes and received a message,to come to the office and see a manager. When I came,he told me-""You're unsafe driver,you're fired"". The end of story. I've followed their app,and I'm a bad,unsafe driver! So nice of them."
615,Bite Squad,Delivery driver's nightmare,2016-10-23,1.0,Delivery Driver,Flexible schedule. You get to visit a lot of different restaurants that you may never have seen or heard of before.  No other pros worth mentioning.,"They pay you minimum wage and say that you make at least $15/hour or more. The difference comes from tips. You never see the tip amounts and are forced to share them with their dispatch team. You will not see more than $15/hour. You pay for gas and expenses on your own vehicle. They are supposed to keep you in one area for deliveries, but they route you all over the place wasting your time and gas money. If you are lucky enough to get a break during work, they will try to give you that break when you are the farthest possible distance from anywhere.  After expenses, you are lucky to make minimum wage. There are no options for benefits.  This place is a joke!"

You only get 70% of your tip if the tip is given through the app. If given as cash in person, it's all yours. 
They don't pay you OT if they keep you past your scheduled shift. You just keep working as if it's part of your assigned shift. 
Only reimburse you $1/order, no matter how far you travel. 
They claim they don't schedule you more than 40hrs/week, but you're lucky if you even get 25 in two weeks (and I made myself available to be scheduled everyday) which comes out to about $250-$300 every two weeks, $500-$600/month.

They make claims that the OSHA says drivers cannot wear shorts which is bull... The closest thing that the OSHA ""recommends"" is that kitchen workers wear pant to avoid burns.

Average of $15 an hour, usually you don't make more than that.","$1 per delivery no matter how far you go, Ive had runs that I got $2-$3 and went 20+ miles for. That happens alot. They take 40% of your tips and give it to ""dispatch"". Some of the restaurants you interact with will treat you like dirt or ignore you, will refuse to go over orders for accuracy with you. No guaranteed tips. Your $1 per delivery counts towards your $15 an hour. This company profits by ripping off its drivers. You cannot see where an order is going before you pick it up.

638,Bite Squad,Here to serve!,2016-01-08,2.0,Delivery Driver,"Great part time job, a way to earn extra cash.",The way that they operate is they don't respect your time or the idea of scheduling. There is said to be no end time. So they schedule you 4pm - 6pm and then they keep you on the schedule til 10pm. Also more gas reimbursement would be nice. I guess being short handed one driver is sent all over town from the strip to the Arizona border. and back again.

640,Bite Squad,Delivery Driver Review - Minneapolis MN,2015-11-09,5.0,Delivery Driver,"I've researched a lot of other delivery driving jobs, as well as worked in pizza delivery and I do honestly believe that BiteSquad is one of the best delivery jobs available.

- The dispatch and support crew is very dependable as well as efficient when it comes to customer service, as well as when unexpected problems arise during deliveries. They answer calls within seconds and are always willing to assist you.

- Scheduling is fair in the sense that you are able to edit your schedules on a weekly basis as well as request days off (I've never had a request that was denied as long as it was within a 2 weeks notice). They also have this feature on the app that allows you to request to stay later on your shift or leave earlier. Of course it is tentative to how busy it is that night, but dispatch generally does a good job of meeting your requests.

- Customers are generally more polite compared to pizza customers or other delivery services; they also tend to tip a decent amount. Also, most customers are located in ""non-dangerous"" parts of town so that's not a concern at all.

- The pay is as advertised, and it's guaranteed you will at least make 15/hr, compensation if necessary to meet that amount. Generally speaking drivers make anywhere from a bit over 15 to 20 an hour, dispatch distributes orders so that everyone makes roughly the same amount per hour.

Overall, I work at least 25 hours a week and the pay is decent so a full time college student like me can live fairly comfortably.","There aren't many cons but if anything, I've heard that before I got hired the pay was higher. However, this is understandable because of the minimum wage increase. 

Another thing is that although deliveries always come back to back, it's pretty easy to tell if it's a busy night or not. This is just my theory, but it seems during busy nights the driving times between pickups and deliveries tend to be shorter. Some nights, driving times could be anywhere from 10-15 minutes, and I assume this is due to the lower amount of orders. Overall, the pay very consistent for a delivery job though."
641,Bite Squad,Excellent job,2015-10-18,5.0,Delivery Driver,"Great support at dispatch, extra hours available if desired, great flexibility- the shift planner system allows you to set availability on a permanent and temporary basis, so you have the ability to ask for a specific time off rather than having to take the entire day. 

The driver application gives you all the tools you need to do a great job- every customer has a phone number, so there is minimal difficulty in getting hold of a customer if needed. Equipment like bags are provided, the initial shirt and hat are and then are available for purchase- which means you actually take care of your stuff. In Minneapolis, there is a parking permit you can purchase for 20$/year that makes parking a cakewalk. 

Benefits are nearly nonexistent at this point, but to me that is a bonus- more take-home pay. Full time, I can legitimately take home almost $3,000/month, after taxes, including gas/wear and tear reimbursement of 1$/delivery. I think the pay makes up for the lack of benefits. I was able to go full-time within 4 months, so room for advancement from part-full time is nice.","Having to wear a uniform, getting asked random questions on the street, the rare occurrence of getting hassled by a drunk or two, and the stress of driving. Accidents are an occupational hazard, but if you know defensive driving, that risk is greatly minimized. Most of the job is learned by doing, but little tips at the start would be extremely helpful. No sick leave, medical/dental/vision, or other benefits. Not much talk about driving one of their vehicles or other positions available within the company, but I have not asked."
642,Bite Squad,Working for BiteSquad,2015-10-14,5.0,Anonymous Employee,Fun and easy job. No side work. W-2 employee. Get to drive around and listen to music. Management is great.,"The only cons I can think of is sometimes dealing with traffic, and the normal wear and tear of driving your car."
643,Bite Squad,Bad People,2015-10-13,1.0,,"The management at this company is having an identity crisis. Too many people directing in different directions.  They are making rookie mistakes.

645,Bite Squad,Easiest job ever!,2015-10-10,5.0,Driver,"Great pay, usually averaging >$20.hr. with tips. Only delivery service in Seattle that gives you a W-2 and treats you like an employee not a contractor. If you work full-time they offer health insurance. Plus it's fun, meeting new people all the time, seeing things and places around town that I wouldn't have seen if I was sitting at home wishing I had more money. The local manager is really good and helpful. You can drive their car or use your own (mine's better than a Prius) and the reimbursement is generous.","None, really except sometimes I wish I had my weekends back. Easiest job I ever had. If you have a good driving record and can follow a GPS, this is an easy $1000 a month. Also, this is not a career for me and most drivers, but there are probably good opps for the right person who wants to advance."

Theres honestly not much pro going on.
They are flexible with schedule only if you're available during their rush hour times 4pm-8pm. 
They mostly hire on the spot, its not much interviewing when you're asked to come in for an ""interview"", they're just giving you information about the job before they hire you.","It's actually $10/hr and the rest is tip that covers the other $5, hence why they guarantee ""15 h/r"" . Reimbursement for gas isn't much. Only a $1 of reimbursement for gas, and 4 cents back to you per data usage. 

Strict green shirt and black pants uniform, you always have to wear the ""hat"". 

Job isn't worth the amount of gas and energy.

You have to have a car w/ insurance and have to pass a vehicle check. 

If your insurance is with progressive, they won't be able to hire you."
