3,BlaBlaCar,A spectacular journey,2022-01-11,5.0,Marketing Data Analyst,"Working at the HQ of BlaBlaCar was my best professional experience and truly kickstarted my career.

BlaBlaCar fully embodies the 'successful startup' vibe, bursting with quirks, colorful personalities, incredible talent, an almost cultish culture (in the best sense of that expression) and a growth trajectory to make your head spin.

It definitely surpassed my expectations, and I would in particular recommend engineers and developers to work for BlaBlaCar. They provide great autonomy, a multitude of opportunities for horisontal and vertical growth and will just all round pamper you.","BlaBlaCar is lean. As in very lean. 
You will get lots of responsibility quickly, but not necessarily because you have earned it - just because every team seriously needs additional hands.
This is a deliberate strategy, but additional hires would make it a nicer experience for the individual employee and provide more time for diving deep.
A serious implication of this is that code quality and documentation tends to suffer.

In my experience, the middle managers at BlaBlaCar are doing their best, but they are usually specialist first, manager second. This has pros and cons: Do well, and you might get a shot at becoming manager earlier than elsewhere - if you want to. However, given the scale and ambition of BlaBlaCar, I believe that most teams could benefit from more seasoned managers with a proved track record of getting the most out of their teams."

23,BlaBlaCar,Technical direction lacks vision and decision-making power,2021-06-20,3.0,Software Engineer,"Even with all those issues BlaBlaCar seems to be able to steadly hire awesome people. That is the biggest asset of the company, lots of smart and hard working people.","I have worked for 4 years at BlaBlaCar. A company as any other if times get rough it will fire you as it did to many people around 2017. Some were announced that would be let go but no more communication was given, so those people had to come back to the office for one or two months having nothing to do. Do not let the image of ""startup"" (""we are all having a blast working here"") fool you.

By the way, it is not a ""startup"" anymore, that is just a way to attract young blood looking for a trendy name to put in their CVs. BlaBlaCar is a behemoth and the lack of competition on the carpooling sector does not help it move any faster or be afraid of losing its dominance on the carpooling sector (the bus one is another story). That is exactly where the lack of competition is bad, the company does not feel any (or feels very little) pressure on improving things.

On the tech side it has been very interesting from 2016 until 2018 when many things were built even though the technical direction was really messy -- many directors overlapping, people put in place long-term vision leaving the company one week after presenting their vision, etc. From 2018 the main focus on the tech side was not to build new bricks, but mostly into the two things: migration from the legacy PHP stack into a SOA Java stack and migration from on-premise to the cloud. If you are looking for a technical challenge that is not the good time to join BlaBlaCar, you will be mostly working on some kind of ""migration"". Besides, given the current context, the travel sector is severely impacted so the amount of QPS services are handling is very very low.

Although improving, the technical leadership lacks clear direction and decision-making power. Organization is far from flat, you can count around 7 (or maybe 8) levels for around 500 employees! So, expect a lot of politics and hearing that ""it is a good thing to be done but it is not the right moment"". Also, the lack of competition makes it that product iterations are *really* slow. From the ages required for the UX team design one screen to the time engineering teams will get involved it may takes multiple quarters! If, in the meantine, some key member to the project leaves then most of project will be certainly lost due to the huge bus factor.

Roadmap creation is a huge mess, every quarter a new process takes place and nobody understand what is going on. It enhances the lack of visibility mainly on the tech side about where a project is."

43,BlaBlaCar,"Blablacar: Living its values, transparent, humble, intelligent and empathetic.",2020-09-18,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Despite the very difficult context, this organization has shown its true colors. People-first is clearly how this place operates. I'm amazed at how they have risen above the restrictions, revenue reductions, and other obstacles to success, and responded with ingenuity, humility, and transparency.

The message from the top down has been one of empathy, but also somehow giving strength to the workforce by maintaining the hunger for success and motivating the teams to continue to find value in their work and in themselves.

Having a lot of past history with companies going through troubled times, I can honestly say the toxicity has not taken root and that is something to be proud of. Maybe it's because it was never here, lurking in the shadows to begin with?

It feels good to be in a place that cares and takes care of its people, and thrives in the face of adversity. Also very nice to be in a female-friendly environment, even if there are not a lot of women in engineering. Staff is genuinely a nice bunch of people, who try their best, and work well together. I feel lucky to be in a nice culture that is present at all levels.","Covid has stripped us of many of our luxuries -- blablabreak, the weekly drinks at the Favart, and other niceties of the pre-covid life. Not going to lie, I miss those perks.

Covid has also impacted our team growth, so some teams have a lot of work right now while we are hiring. On the bright side, hiring is a huge priority, people who signal the need to be scaled are heard and responded to.

The next 6 months will probably be a challenge for the organization, even if we are optimistic about rebounding given early indicators."

But if you're used to bigger corporations then it can be a good choice given the advantages listed before."

Company is fairly flexible in terms of working conditions. Brand name effect on CV.","Severe problems with management and strategic direction lead to dysfunctional processes. There was a noticeable void of direction/decisions taken by top management and lack of focus/clear priorities. As a result, company pushed in all directions at same time (oftentimes contradictory directions) and working atmosphere/team ambiance became toxic. 

Clearly this is a well-known problem as company terminated a significant portion of its employees shortly after I left - this went all the way from the very top to the bottom of the pyramid. Can't say now if the changes have worked but would stay away as the company is clearly in retreat and lacks a clear management structure and culture of transparency and accountability."

It's a great place to both learn something and put your own input - cause everybody takes you seriously and new ideas are welcome.","Only possible cons could be a life / work balance. Nobody force you to do over-hours or stuff like that, it's just that you yourself would like to deliver your work done as good as possible (as others around you are trying to do same) - so you still are thinking after the work on stuff that you're working on. So it's not like ""I'm working in some company called BlaBlaCar"", but rather ""I'm working in BlaBlaCar"". Because not everybody would like to identify himself with a company in which he is working, I'm putting this as the only cons."
