21,Blinkit,WORST COMPANY TO EVER WORK WITH,2022-03-01,1.0,Senior Executive,There are no pros. Only cons.,"The CRM team of this company is treated like trash. No one cares how hard you work or what you go through everyday at work. Team leaders and managers chill while the agents take back to back calls without a single second gap in between two calls. Not only this, AGENTS CANT EVEN DECIDE WHEN THEY WANT TO TAKE THEIR LUNCH OR TEA BREAK. You can only leave your seat when you are asked to. There have been days when agents even take their lunch breaks at 5 pm because nobody cares. The pressure that agents go through every minute of the day cannot be described. They have 2-3 designated so called SPOCS who will keep on pinging you to move to next call when it’s only been 4 seconds since the previous call ended. Not only this, they’ll poke you even if you go to washroom!! They’ll highlight it in group chats and different channels. It’s like working as a daily wage worker or worse than that. The team leaders and managers have absolutely no time to connect with the agents. Lol I don’t even know who exactly my manager was. They have no time to address the issues faced by agents while working. They’ll highlight if you’re even one second late in logging in but they’ll make you work post your shift timings because there’s business requirement. The irony!

I can go on for a thousand more words and it would still not be enough. Imagine having to justify to your team leader or SPOC, why you spent 5 mins in the washroom or waiting till 5pm for your lunch break because your SPOC hasn’t given you the permission to eat yet. They’ll change your shift timings any time they want, they’ll make you do whatever work they want. Why? Because they are paying you :)"

I made sure that I tell everyone in my circle to avoid grofers. 
There are rats, cats and bird crap all over their warehouse and they send the same groceries to the customers. Cat ate some product? Tape it and send it to the customer because why not
Rat rolled in atta? Tape it and send it who cares?
If you take a leave after 20 days of continuous work the HR will ask you to understand your responsibilities and not take a day's leave. 
Work for 12 hours and you get peanuts as a salary without any leaves, without any increment also without any job security.

Grofers provides you with a work environment which is collaborative and learning. The managers give you immense accountability on projects and initiatives which will help you grow in a multidimensional way. 
Skills like stakeholder management, planning, execution are a few areas where one understands the non-linearity of learning.

It is a dynamic and challenging place which enhances your skills and focus on results. The average age of the organization is less than 28 years making it agile and quick in decision making, thereby, showing impact which usually takes months to be visible in multinationals.

4.Usually,only 2-3 members do 90% work of the entire team while the top management decides new place to eat from the investors money. 

5.Six days working and on most Sundays you're working from home. 

6.The company has received more than $200 million USD funding yet it won't provide its employees a good and comfortable seating space. An MBA graduate is setting up people's laptops.

I used to presume from textbooks that a firm runs in a set direction, and in case of deviation, corrective steps need to be taken; never did I thought how much insight was actually required in it. I trust that only in a startup, one could learn on how to properly get the work done. 

I would like to specially highlight the guidance received from all the senior management here at Grofers, who never shy away from helping; something that I rarely found in my previous employers.","The place where I think Grofers faces issue is proper implementation of tasks.

2. Black listed by IIT coz they fired 250 people (I don't know why IIT did this coz not even a single person fired was from tech and the people who did not get a joining date were helped to find new jobs.. thumbs up for this)

3. Other teams are pathetic as there is no set process developer is told to leave all his work and fix a issue and deploy without any QA and that fix than breaks everything. Than it is reverted back so all effort is wasted.

4. People are told that there is a release at 8pm on the same day

5. No fixed sprints considering they have PMs, Managers, Engg Managers

You don't enjoy work anymore. 10 people would be doing same task and would try and please the head framing stories about criticality of their job.
Apart from work, there are several other downsides:
1.No culture - people are treated as labours. No one would value you or your work. Everyone is considered replaceable.
2.Work timings - It is mandatory to come to office Mon to Sat; 9 am to 7pm. One they violate labour laws; second it is pure waste of effort. Even if you don't have work, be present in office and kill time. No public holidays. No over-time. No other benefit apart from your compensation, which again will increase by pennies understanding the cost pressure.
3.No communication/transparency - Founders hardly interact with people in organisation whereas this shouldn't be the case with a start-up. They are inapproachable. One sits with tech and is worried about tech issues; the other is mainly driving operations.
4.Incompetent management - Most of the head of departments do not have domain understanding. They are either the batch mates of the founders or 1-2 years experienced foreign degree holders. No process understanding. Being founders batch mates - no pressure for cost optimization or driving change. Organisation is being managed by one downs who fail to drive change as the head of departments can't convince the founders. Such heads have no accountability and if things go wrong, team members are fired on the spot and the heads meekly hide their faces. If you analyze grofers top-management, you would realize that there is no single name that has industry/domain expertise. The ones hired left the organisation in less than a year. 
5.No values - The head of departments run the organisation in an autocratic way. There are heads who use abusive language on the floor, shouts on team members and threatens them to take their job away if work is not done in their prescribed manner. Founders turn deaf and blind when this happens.
6.No professionalism -  Rules are different for different departments and individuals as well. Some has liberty to come by 10 and leave by 4 pm; work from home; attend dance/ zumba classes whereas others are penalized even if they reach by 9:30 am. No support to employees – no cab facility even if you leave at 10:00 pm."

A bunch of talented, passionate people working towards a big goal. The environment is fun and exciting even though we have a highly aggressive work culture in the technology function.There is flat hierarchy and goals are clearly set.
