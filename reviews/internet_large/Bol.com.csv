36,Bol.com,Worst experience in my life,2020-05-30,1.0,Software Engineer,So much events are organized throughout year (mostly in Dutch),"I started my career at bol.com in June 2018 and had a traumatic year. I landed to a complete Dutch team, so they all had to switch their communication to English for an international junior. Team members explicitly stated their unwillingness to communicate in English as a great welcome.

Team members were very reluctant to cooperate/communicate with me and manager wasn’t very helpful. I started to hear negative feedbacks about me from my manager(I would prefer to receive feedbacks from teammates first) and indeed tried to reflect on feedbacks even if I wasn’t agree. How much ever I worked to be a better engineer, teammates picked up negative situations with a needle and came up with bad feedbacks. For example, I tried to attend to an important meeting with software architects  about our team to observe and learn, but I received “losing focus and trying to participate other projects” feedback.

My contract was for one year and I wasn’t a citizen of an EU country. I was aware that I had to go back to my country if bol would not extend my contract. At the same time understood that I had no chance in that bullying team and wanted to switch to another team. This request had been blocked by manager by saying “let’s open a new page in new year”.

A new manager came and I had good 2 - 3 months. She told me everything is going good and for sure I’d receive an extension; maybe even a permanent contract. At the same time I realized picking up negative situations with a needle feedbacks started again. We had an incident on a software I mostly built (and peer reviewed). All the team except me had meetings about incident and “new way of working”  titled meetings. I was explicitly not invited and discriminated in team by not invited to a meeting about team’s way of working. I expressed my dissatisfaction about the situation with my manager and she said “I should focus on my job”. One week after, I was fired out of blue. Moreover, that manager sent a mail about my departure to whole department and stated reason to leave was “low performance”. 

Thanks god I was able to find another company in a short period of time.

It was hard for me to overcome psychological effects I had in bol. I would not advise to anybody such a toxic company like this. Don’t believe to contract extension promises managers give, I’m not the one who left out a small time to find another offer."

42,Bol.com,Low salaries and quickly deteriorating environment (Definite no-go for expats),2019-04-01,2.0,Anonymous Employee,- Used to be technically interesting company before it started to become chaotic (not-well managed growth) so still there are some traces of technically challenging work in some groups,"- From software engineering practices not as solid as advertised
- Low salaries and management is in denial of it. Comes up with their analysis which is, of course, does not reflect the realities of the market
- Friction (though became less by time) about the use of English in communication.
- Highly political environment (lots of gossip, exclusion in decision making). Basically talkers' heaven and hackers' hell... 
- Indifference to the violation of work ethics (such as accusing people but not able to back it up) if it is done by Dutch colleagues. On the contrary putting a magnifying glass for minor reactions, the resistance of expats.
- In conflict situations, using ""accept feedback"" as a tool of harassment. E.g. if you think you are right and making it clear, what you hear will be  ""please reflect this situation on yourself and accept the feedback"" translates as we do not hear you, please shut up and do what we say.
- Witnessed several situations where expats (particularly non-EU) harassed with ""we will not extends your contract unless you do this and that"" where mostly this and that are non-actionable vague comments
- There are groups in company which excludes everyone else from the decisions and go re-invent the wheel (writing message broker, poor wrappers around cloud tools etc etc) then force you to use them
- Finally poor location"
