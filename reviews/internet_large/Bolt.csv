People are mostly pretty nice.","Salaries and benefits are average. The requirements to improve to new positions are not always clear. Salaries and rarely discussed and such subjects seem to be avoided, as well as benefits. Most cons come from a global level. Information is not always shared, especially vertically."
111,Bolt,Local autonomy in balance with a global engagement. What I learnt about Bolt in my last 3 years and 3 positions.,2021-09-21,5.0,Country Manager,"Being part of a local team at Bolt is much like being part of your own start-up. With one major difference: The level of competence within the company, ready to support you whenever a need occurs. Being allowed to work autonomously and per a locally set strategy, while at the same time having the comfort of knowing that your global organization is always ready to back you up is for me one of the best parts of working at Bolt.

Bolt is much about transparency. 
– Global bi-weekly meetings with stakeholders from each business line who present the latest developments. 
– Peakon employee surveys are sent out, results are presented monthly, and followed up on a team level. 
– Team inclusion in strategic decision making.

Bolt is a team of Doers Extraordinaire! There's a consensus among the employees that you only get out what you put in. This mindset is rather practiced than preached and has allowed the company to create a sense of entrepreneurial attitude and engagement that I have not experienced elsewhere.","If your main motivator is a heavy paycheck, Bolt might not be your short-term solution. Salaries are at par with the market and objectively based on data from Mercer. However, aside from this, there's a more generous options scheme for all employees. Making the long-term economical flipside a much brighter story. 

For the last years, Bolt has been one of the fastest-growing companies in Europe. Growing the organizational size by five-fold in two years has put pressure on certain internal processes and structures. My impression is that Bolt is currently adapting well to their new scale, and has taken any raised flags about areas that have suffered due to the growth."

-Flexible working:  after starting working it became very clear that working from home is not flexible, it is frowned upon.
-Diversity & inclusion: while they love saying that Bolt is a supportive employer of inclusion, this unfortunately does not reflect on the reality. The sense of elitism of Estonians in the company is disturbing, that included few members who aren’t even apologetic for their racist comments. Despite all the complains and making the higher management aware of the situation, they simply shrug it off. 
-Work/life balance does not exist s the staff are expected to work during antisocial hours/days without any compensation. The attempt to raise and discuss the matter was shut down repeatedly.
-The office culture is toxic and made of overworked employees who are pleasant to work but they are too scared to ask for their rights resulting to a backstabbing environment where gossips are encouraged by the managers who run the London office as a strategy to control their staff. 
-Green mission: another company that brags about being green to the environment where it is simply untrue, it is exactly like Uber only with worse conditions to the drivers."

Despite my good interview results and quick learning skills, I failed my probation period due to my ""communications skills"". Yes, you read it correctly. I did 7 interviews+ 4 months contribution but my English apparently wasn't ""enough"". By the way, it does not take 4 months to check one’s English level and communication, you can define it during an hour of written test or 30minutes discussion. It makes me to believe that the level of English was not the real reason.

I am pretty sure that the English fluent staff among Engineering team is not more than 40% in Tallinn, Bolt HQ. Although my communication skills, English level shown as a reason for fire, actually most teams use Russian in their daily use not English. 
You will not feel any requirement about Russian language skills at the beginning but in reality it is strong desirable skill and maybe the reason to fire you for the lack of communications skills."

She clearly led expectations on my role, helped me grow in my skills, and had weekly check-ins with me to see how things. were going. She also celebrated my small wins and showed lots of appreciation. Things started to shift pretty quickly as I was handed over to other line managers on the Expansion team (whom I never got to talk to, did not show time for me, etc). The manager-report role was very blurry for more than 6 months.","-Poor focus on local teams and leadership especially in Africa
-No talent development. Provide to your managers the skills and information they need to succeed. I highly doubt that all the managers that were terminated so quickly in East Africa one after the other didn't have love for the company or couldn't improve. If you fail to keep so many employees engaged and productive, that's on you, not on them! Why hire them in the first place if you only think of them as stupid and useless? Why give them salaries that you don't think you can afford 3 months down the line? Isn't this the reflection of how poor your entire people/hiring long-term strategies are? Why create roles that you eventually end up deleting once you realize they are not ""necessary""? Why not be real that Bolt is simply interested in being in Africa for numbers to help your endless fundraising, but not into adding something positive to the people/the staff/the drivers, etc? If your business can be run from some analytical formulas/spreadsheets, why bother hiring people if you don't utilize their brains after all? Meaning in this scenario, the local staff with the most advanced analytical skills will win your heart and the rest who come with other skills will be considered ""useless"" and not worth dedicating some attention to. 1. analytical skills and thinking can be developed. 2. staff/managers' engagement need to be nurtured if not they become disengaged in the business. 3. ops teams need to have a common understanding of how to solve problems, how to come up with solutions at work, a vision on how to serve our drivers, what's acceptable and not acceptable (all of it and much more was missing). You cannot expect people to deliver results/work as you want them to, without setting an example/vision for them to follow.
-Start showing you care about your managers in Africa (how about having individual 1 on 1s with them, weekly check-ins, setting time to talk to them not just about your damn metrics but them/who they are/their aspirations, etc). I had a lead in charge of expansion in Africa markets who never talked to me, showed up for 1 night or 2 in our market, doesn't even say hi, doesn't even show desire to hear about my work...let's not even mention the fact that by that time the CEO himself had never set foot in Africa(being one of his biggest market)
-Lots of corporate BS (you need to have friends at HQ to make it at the company)
-Salary is not that great for top African talent, especially those coming from fast paced startup environments, but the company thinks they are paying fair; don't bother applying there (for those who want to work on sth impactful on the continent, that's not the place for it)
-Small wins are not recognised, hardwork is not appreciated, it's a company where congratulations are so rare and are only reserved for a few (those that agree to be suck-ups),motivation of teams is low(here not talking about monetary incentives), I don't ever remember hearing the CEO motivates his global team, share his vision for the company, remind us on why we are working so hard....being a founder does not mean being able to manage a global team..."

There are talented people, who pride themselves in getting done more stuff with less. There's fairly little corporate bulls*t (for a company of their size).

The work you do there is very likely quite impactful, affecting the huge number of clients.","Company priorities can change pretty quickly, which might or might not suit you.

When I got interviewed, I was told that I'll have an opportunity to work on project X, over which I was quite excited about. When I joined though, I instead had to work on another project which I wasn't at all interested in. When I complained, I got an offer to work in another team that seemed to suit me more, and the team was happy to take me on, but then company priorities shifted, and I was instead moved to work on another project.

This is a toxic place, where you get promoted based on your friendship with the higher management. Speaking up is not appreciated, and can actually get you in to trouble. No work life balance possible, if you are not on the good list of your manager. The CEO spends most his time planning very expensive parties and asking employees to write 5 star reviews on Google , Facebook , AppStore and Glassdoor when the ratings go down.

All arround Africa, its the same feeling people are complaining about same issues from south Africa where team members are practically being oppressed and team members afraid to say anything to Uganda where my friend was just fired in the most unprofessional manner. Situation seems to be much better in West Africa and Tanzania where we can all see the impact of strong local leadership, then again i remember some of my friends complaining about the lagos office."

Toxic management  especially in Africa.

 Incomptetent leadership extremely insensitive and inexperienced in people management.

 No health insurance for dependants. Some employees had to take sudden pay cuts even before the COVID scare.

Racist and xenophobic.

Lack of transparency by management when letting people go. Instead of being honest about their sliming revenue stream to conduct retrenchment they just let you go for a very flimsy excuse in cahoots with line managers to avoid paying severance.  

Very shaky job security since 2018 more than 40% turn over.

All correspondence in messengers, including private messages, is inspected by management.

There is no concept of confidentiality. HR employees easily share personal information about other employees not only with management, but also with other companies.

The company dismisses competent employees who point to existing problems in the company, giving preference to incompetent employees who do not give anything useful, but are friends with senior management. While I was working here, several good engineers was suddenly fired, and no one knows where are they and what happened.

Things that were discussed and promised during interviews are not necessarily guaranteed so don't plan anything in advance. Hardly any growth within the company unless you are backed up by someone from a higher level. 

What I also disliked is their extremely slow and confusing hiring process, probably aimed at getting rid of the candidates who are not that interested which is not a good approach as there are interviews in place for that. When applying, you are required to solve a task before even doing a preliminary interview. There should be a possibility to ask all the questions you have about the position prior to spending time on the assignment which you won't even get proper feedback for."

The truth is that this employee was ponting the bad performance of this leader as so did many of us but for personal reasons he lied and made this person lose the job. 

It is illegal, and this person could have sued because he has been clean for months.(They said he was taking drugs in between working hours, while his closest coworkers never saw him taking drugs even at social encounters) 

 



If you don't flatter the leaders in Estonia, you won't be as good positioned as the ones who do."

340,Bolt,Great Place to Work At,2019-06-26,5.0,Marketing Specialist,"The thing about being a Bolt employee is, you need to work hard and be a serious team player. It is very easy to get invested in the organization because there is a sense of ownership that gets created when you work with Bolt. The management style is friendly and motivational. It is a laid back company with a result-driven culture.",Be ready to become the workaholic that you didn't know you were. Work never ends. And the attachment to the job comes with its own heartaches.

- A good stepping stone for those looking for experience in the industry
- Great monthly benefits (snacks, sports, team building)",- Lack of opportunity for career progression
344,Bolt,"Cool environment, poor management",2019-05-24,3.0,Customer Support Specialist,"The environment is cool and chill, people are friendly and nice, team events, some flexibility, snacks","Team leads and senior team leads in customer support lack experience and maturity, it's mainly a bunch of pretty little girls who are friends with who matters. There is need of more professionalism.

Agents are treated as robots, the only focus is on the statistics, not the employees or not even the customers."
345,Bolt,Best place I have worked at,2019-05-05,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"I joined the company as a Support Specialist when the team was around 250 people 2 years ago and resigned when the team was over 1k. Obviously, the company has taken a  huge leap while I was there, it has changed a lot, but nonetheless, the experience was above my expectation at all times. 
 I had a very good time in support,  the team was still quite small so it was a great opportunity for me to learn the ropes and get a glimpse of how different departments operate. What was also great my supervisors always encouraged to provide input on internal processes and would often give side tasks that were not directly related to replying to customers. This really enabled personal growth and most people I started with are currently working in specialist positions. I have to say that currently, the experience in support is a bit different, it moved to more traditional customer support work environment.
After around a year I was given the opportunity to move to a specialist position. That experience was even better, for someone who didn't have a lot of experience in the things that I was dealing with, my team in Bolt provided me with all the support structure and freedom that I needed to gain proficiency. The job was demanding but also very engaging, even at a junior level you can influence the product and make a real change. 

More general stuff in no particular order -

* The team at Bolt is now too big for generalisations but overall it's a young team with lots of ambition but also experience and intelligence.
* Most people are passionate about their jobs and work really hard (but smart).
*People really care about making data-driven decisions and it's a very good thing.
* Compared with 8-12 months ago the team has a lot more structure and processes have matured significantly across all departments without getting too corporate, however, there is definitely still room to grow in that regard.
*Good opportunities for personal growth for everybody.
*Opportunity to work with the latest tech and be a part of a reputable company in a trendy industry
* Very good perks - nice office, Summer days in Estonia / Winter days abroad, ride credit, free snacks and coffee until you overdose, fun office parties /team events, etc

To conclude, I think that Bolt is a great place to work for anyone that has the right attitude to get stuff done and is willing to share the enthusiasm.","There is one particular topic that I need to mention: work/life balance. The reality is that the hours are long and that it's a very high paced, demanding environment.  Of course, your experience will vary depending on what you do, but overall the expectations are high. In order to succeed you need to manage your time well and know your limits.  
Another con is that there is a lot of people who have worked in the company for a very short period of time, due to growth. Few people know each other well and there is a lot of specialists in their fields who lack insight into how the company operates and what are the internal norms and processes, this can create misunderstandings.
Also Kinder chocolate is available in the kitchen only on Fridays instead of 24/7 (jk this is not actually a con)"
346,Bolt,Impactful and inspiring place to work at,2019-04-19,5.0,Product Designer,"Bolt is an excellent chance to make a meaningful impact on the transportation industry. 
- Top management is well-aligned and very competent (which is not always a case for startups).
- Engineers are incredibly talented and professional, and HR is doing a great job attracting the best talents from all over the world. 
- Compensation, benefits and perks are on a pretty high level, especially true for Estonia.
- Processes are currently a bit startup-stylish but already started establishing into something more concrete.
- Overall vibe and climate are pleasant and inspiring.","- Poor communication between departments and the product team (sometimes).
- Being underdogs/runner-ups which means that most product features are built from competitors perspective rather than finding original and innovative answers to the same problems."
347,Bolt,Marketing Manager,2019-04-18,5.0,Senior Marketing Manager,"Culture, brilliant people, compensation, flexible hours and great exposure","The industry is young, so don't be surprised when you don't get all the answers in one instant.

The company culture is great, people are fun and supportive, there's a lot of parties and team activities. Flexible hours - it's all not about time spent at the office but rather about the results you deliver.",It is a very fast-paced environment and you have to be ready to face challenging tasks every day.

Cool office and company events

You have awesome young people around you","The company has values but they are actually not followed, especially by top-level management. It's more talk than anything else.

The salary is not good compared to other IT companies. You can be in charge of a lot of things and still earn less than in a non-managerial role somewhere else.

Don't expect to be only doing your own job and that your responsibilities are not going to be changed (increased). Don't expect your salary to reflect the change in responsibilities.

You will get used to people being let go randomly on a day-to-day basis

You will probably buy the honeybadger philosophy the first weeks but will be soon enough disguted with their loosy Winnie the Pooh version of things.

Supersonic growth that unlocks some opportunities -but only for certain positions. Interesting challenging tasks and generous pay for the engineering roles. Comfortable office.","Extreme chaos due to lack of process, thoughtful analysis and very poor communication - between teams, between management and their respective teams. No formal or informal training for newbies. Mid management tends to micromanage, senior was mediocre or inadequate, unintelligible, hard to reach and even oppressive. Zero visibility into what's going on in teams daily interacting with each other. Very little transparency company-wide, bad expansion planning and coordination. That with a constant corporate ideology imposing (""No corporate BS"" claim translates into a complete contrary IRL). All of which causing tons of unnecessary stress, high effort + low productivity for the customer-facing people, especially Customer Support, who are expected to ""go the extra mile"" of work with below-market salaries and zero recognition, just because ""hey we're the fastest-growing European startup"". Support is treated as an ever-junior role and not a serious career. Constant feedback from the teams about the same repetitive customer problems goes simply unheard. Senior management seems to not give a damn and is unwilling to talk, listen, analyze feedback and invest into improvement of any of these - as long as the machine runs and grows. Moreover, the senior leadership seem to consciously promote and genuinely enjoy this stress-poisoned environment, encouraging outrageous alcohol abuse during company events, probably some at making people forget about the existing problems. Ill work-life balance. One the most toxic and nightmarish workplaces in my life."

423,Bolt,Challenging and interesting job in a great environment,2018-04-02,5.0,Senior Software Engineer,"I get to solve hard problems with no simple solutions. 
Ridesharing market is huge and interesting - I enjoy the excitement and surprises this may bring (I would not like to work for a bank or a telco even if they had otherwise good environment).","Strong initiative and self discipline is a must. For me this is actually a pro but your mileage may vary. If you enjoy autonomy, responsibility and getting stuff done (no matter what) then you will love it here.

The atmosphere in the company is friendly and coworkers really feel more like family than colleagues. 

Company itself puts so much effort into the well-being of its employees. There's always coffee and snacks at the office(who isn't motivated by food) but we also always get all the equipment needed for a better and comfortable working environment. And let's not forget the fact that we were taken to Cape Town for winter days?! It doesn't get better than this I think.",Really few.

447,Bolt,Customer Support Specialist,2017-08-20,5.0,Customer Support Specialist,Taxify has an absolutely amazing stance on how a company should be run. You don't deal with any of the usual corporate BS that you'd expect from a growing company. Taxify truly appreciates its employees and offers full transparency. Not to mention the awesome parties they throw. ;),The only real downside I can think of (as things are right now) is that the job does get repetitive. However! There are a lot of different departments you could potentially switch over to if you have the know-how or interest.
448,Bolt,Taxify,2017-08-11,5.0,IOS Developer,"Company, and every person in it, is motivated. Really motivated. And you're going to be motivated, you're going to be hungry to do your job the best way you can.

And my shortlist of pros: close to zero bureaucracy, awesome colleagues, challenging tasks, feeling of being part of the company.","You have to be a witness of extreme, rooftop rising numbers each month and party with your colleagues/friends to celebrate it. Probably not the best place for people who don't like company growth and making customers happy."
